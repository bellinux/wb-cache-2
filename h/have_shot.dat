5|$|The first airstrike {{attacked}} the ships of TF 16 which was initially defended by fighters from VF-6. Once radar spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft, both carriers launched all available fighters. Enterprise was badly damaged by three bomb hits, but the Japanese lost 19 dive bombers and four Zeros to the defending fighters and anti-aircraft fire. They claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down a dozen Wildcats although the Americans lost only five, of which two belonged to VF-5; {{some of the}} American losses were reportedly due to friendly anti-aircraft fire. In turn, the American fighters claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down 52 Japanese aircraft, 15 more than the Japanese committed to the attack. The second Japanese airstrike failed to locate the American carriers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Major-General Giora Eiland {{publicly}} retracted the IDF's {{admission of}} responsibility, and {{a statement to}} that effect {{was approved by the}} prime minister's office in September 2007. The following year an IDF spokesman, Col. Shlomi Am-Shalom, said that the Shahaf report had shown the IDF could not <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> Muhammad. He asked France2 to send the IDF the unedited 27minutes of raw footage, as well as footage the France2 cameraman shot the following day.|$|E

Marge also adds the shooting {{must have been an}} accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely to know how to operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E
5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down two American aircraft while losing {{two of their}} own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, {{but it is not}} possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E
5|$|After the war, courts-martial were convened to {{investigate}} possible war crimes {{by members of}} the division. In the first case, dubbed the Biscari massacre, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. Lieutenant General George Patton, the Seventh Army commander, asked Major General Omar Bradley, commanding II Corps, to get the case dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E
5|$|HMS Denbigh Castle (K696) {{was one of}} 44 Castle-class corvettes {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War II.

While escorting her first and only Arctic convoy to Russia, she claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down a German torpedo bomber. Denbigh Castle was torpedoed in early 1945 by the , with the loss of 11 men, near the Soviet coast. The ship was beached in an effort to save her, but she was pulled off by the ebbing tide and capsized. Her wreck was declared a total loss.|$|E

5|$|In November 2009, the Royal Saudi Land Force, {{as part of}} a {{military}} effort against insurgent intrusions of the kingdom's border, started using the Apache in Operation Scorched Earth; this also involved launching air strikes against Houthi rebels operating inside neighboring Yemen. In January 2010 the rebels claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down an Apache; this was denied by the Saudi military. In late January 2010, the leader of the Shiite rebels announced their withdrawal from Saudi territory, this announcement followed a key battle on 12 January when Saudi forces reportedly took control of the border village of Al Jabiri.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth Marlar Taylor (December 23, 1919 – November 25, 2006) {{was a new}} United States Army Air Corps Second Lieutenant pilot {{stationed}} at Wheeler Field during the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. Along with his fellow pilot and friend George Welch, {{he managed to get}} a fighter plane airborne under fire.

5|$|Major General Ennis Whitehead's Advanced Echelon (ADVON) {{headquarters}} in Port Moresby ordered three squadrons based there {{to join the}} battle. P-38s of the 39th Fighter Squadron engaged a dozen Japanese fighters over Wau, shooting one down. A few minutes later, the 9th Fighter Squadron—which had only recently converted to the P-38—downed another Japanese fighter, while P-40s of the 41st Fighter Squadron surprised six Japanese fighters, shooting down three. The airmen claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down 23 Japanese fighters and a bomber. Australian gunners of the 156th Light Anti Aircraft Battery claimed another bomber and two fighters.

5|$|Six IK-3s were {{serviceable}} {{when the}} Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941. All six were in service with the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun near the capital, Belgrade. Pilots flying the IK-3 claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down 11 aircraft during the 11-day conflict. According to one account, {{to prevent them}} from falling into German hands, the surviving aircraft and incomplete airframes were destroyed by their crews and factory staff. Another account indicates that one aircraft survived the invasion but it was later destroyed through sabotage. The IK-3 design was used {{as the basis for the}} post-war Yugoslav-built Ikarus S-49 fighter.|$|E
5|$|The First Carrier Division arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 {{to support}} {{operations}} of the Japanese Army in China. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters (plus four spares) and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai. The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 Nationalist Curtiss Hawk III fighters and claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down six without loss. The following day, four A4Ns claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves. The carriers returned to Sasebo {{at the beginning of}} September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near Canton. Nine fighters from Ryūjō escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that same day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down. The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and Nanking. Ryūjō returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral Tomoshige Samejima's Second Carrier Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not been {{recorded}} since the original pair of Negros fruit doves were shot in May 1953 at Mt Kanlaon. However, a local hunter in southern Negros claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> it in the nineties, which has given hope that the species may still exist, and as such the IUCN lists the Negros fruit dove as Critically Endangered, as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds. If the species still exists, {{it is likely that}} habitat destruction for agriculture, timber, and charcoal-burning and hunting, a common problem for all other pigeons on Negros, are major threats.|$|E

5|$|USAF F-105s were {{escorted by}} F-4s {{to protect them}} against enemy fighters. However, the Thunderchief was officially {{credited}} with 27.5 air-to-air victories against North Vietnamese aircraft {{at the cost of}} 17 aircraft lost to enemy fighters (North Vietnamese pilots claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down an additional 23 F-105s but none have been confirmed by USAF). All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs—one by air-to-air missile, the second by cannon fire and the third by jettisoning the centerline rack full of bombs directly into the path of a surprised MiG.|$|E
5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} {{air cover}} for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron {{was forced to}} ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, a pair of Fulmars claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down a pair of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.|$|E
5|$|IAF Hunters {{performed}} extensive operations {{during the}} Indo-Pakistani War of 1971; India had six combat-ready squadrons of Hunters {{at the start}} of the conflict. Pakistani infantry and armoured forces attacked the Indian outpost of Longewala in an event now known as the Battle of Longewala. Six IAF Hunters stationed at Jaisalmer Air Force Base were able to halt the Pakistani advance at Longewala by conducting non-stop bombing raids. The aircraft attacked Pakistani tanks, armoured personnel carriers and gun positions and contributed to the increasingly chaotic battlefield conditions, which ultimately led to the retreat of Pakistan's ground forces. Hunters were also used for many ground-attack missions and raids inside Pakistan's borders, such as the high-profile bombing of the Attock Oil refinery to limit Pakistani fuel supplies. In the aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan claimed to <b>have</b> <b>shot</b> down a total of 32 of India's Hunters.|$|E
