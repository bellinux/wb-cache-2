5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2006, over 600 people {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces {{were reported to have}} been drafted in {{for the duration of the}} protest, to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested after trying illegally to gain access to the plant.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. <b>High</b> <b>carbon,</b> alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
50|$|As {{the carbon}} {{percentage}} content rises, steel {{has the ability}} to become harder and stronger through heat treating; however, it becomes less ductile. Regardless of the heat treatment, a <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> content reduces weldability. In <b>carbon</b> steels, the <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> content lowers the melting point.|$|R

50|$|The {{ratio of}} copper to carbon {{can be changed}} for a {{particular}} purpose. Brushes with higher copper content perform better with very low voltages and high current, while brushes with a <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> content are better for high voltage and low current. High copper content brushes typically carry 150 to 200 amperes per square inch of contact surface, while <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> content only carries 40 to 70 amperes per square inch. The <b>higher</b> resistance of <b>carbon</b> also results in a greater voltage drop of 0.8 to 1.0 volts per contact, or 1.6 to 2.0 volts across the commutator.|$|R
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide {{levels in}} the blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the body}} {{requires}} oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide levels.|$|R
50|$|According to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center CDIAC South Korea {{is among}} the top ten, namely ninth, <b>highest</b> country in <b>carbon</b> dioxide {{emissions}} in the period 1950-2005. The United States (25%), China (10%) and Russia (8%) are the countries with the <b>highest</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide emissions from 1950-2005.|$|R
50|$|Carbon steel has a <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> content, {{which gives}} the steel a lower melting point, more {{malleability}} and durability, and better heat distribution. The disadvantages are the quick corrosion and staining.|$|R
5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> steel in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. <b>High</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E

25|$|Early iron {{smelting}} {{made use}} of bloomeries which produced two layers of metal: one with a very low carbon content which is worked into wrought iron, and one with a <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> outer layer. Since the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> iron is hot short, meaning it fractures and crumbles when forged, it was not useful without more smelting. As a result, it went largely unused in the west until the popularization of the finery forge. The wrought iron, with nearly no carbon in it, was very malleable and ductile but not very hard.|$|E

25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance <b>high</b> in <b>carbon,</b> then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|R

25|$|The {{pig iron}} {{produced}} by the blast furnace is not useful for most purposes due to its <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> content, around 4-5%, making it very brittle. Some pig iron is used to make cast iron goods, often being remelted in a foundry cupola.|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} for abiogenic oil cites the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> depletion of methane as {{stemming from the}} observed carbon isotope depletion with depth in the crust. However, diamonds, which are definitively of mantle origin, are not as depleted as methane, which implies that methane carbon isotope fractionation is not controlled by mantle values.|$|E

25|$|Narrower stomatal {{apertures}} {{can be used}} {{in conjunction}} with an intermediary molecule with a <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide affinity, PEPcase (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase). Retrieving the products of carbon fixation from PEPCase is an energy-intensive process, however. As a result, the PEPCase alternative is preferable only where water is limiting but light is plentiful, or where high temperatures increase the solubility of oxygen relative to that of carbon dioxide, magnifying RuBisCo's oxygenation problem.|$|E

The economic future based on high-priced oil and wheat looks bright. Saskatchewan is the ninth biggest supplier of oil to the U.S., shipping them more than Kuwait. The province has 1.2 billion barrels of recoverable conventional oil and an estimated 1.5 billion barrels of potential oil sands reserves (which create troublesome <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions when processed).|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, {{carbon dioxide}} is fixed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO in {{mesophyll}} cells exposed directly to the air spaces inside the leaf. This exacerbates the transpiration problem for two reasons: first, RuBisCo has a relatively low affinity for carbon dioxide, and second, it fixes oxygen to RuBP, wasting energy and carbon in a process called photorespiration. For both of these reasons, RuBisCo needs <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide concentrations, which means wide stomatal apertures and, as a consequence, high water loss.|$|E
