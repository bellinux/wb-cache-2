5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Johnson {{started his}} career with Manchester United as a trainee in 1992, but a knee injury {{suffered}} {{at the start of}} the 1992–93 season kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> over a year. After making his comeback in November 1993, he scored 12 goals in 22 competitive appearances for the club's youth teams, and was rewarded with a professional contract in July 1994. In 1994–95, he was part of the Manchester United youth team that won the FA Youth Cup.|$|E

Upon recovery, and following the appointment of former Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa as manager, Sparagna made his noncompetitive debut for Marseille alongside fellow academy graduate Jérémie Porsan-Clemente in a friendly clash with Benfica in July 2014.|$|E
5|$|He {{missed the}} entire 1991–92 season while he recovered, {{suffering}} a further knee injury in late 1991, when an incident at a nightclub on Tyneside kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> even longer. The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news {{of that time}} – namely the recession and rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1917, {{while still}} {{completing}} his military training, Johnson married Eunice Nichols. Their only child, a daughter named Judith, was born May 19, 1927. Upon {{his return from}} military service, Johnson purchased the Elizabethtown Mirror with financial assistance from his father. He built the struggling paper almost from the ground up, and a competitor soon bought <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a profit. Johnson used the profit {{from the sale of}} the Mirror to continue his education at the University of Kentucky. While a student, he worked as a reporter for the Lexington Herald. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1922. The university awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1940.|$|E

5|$|The 2015-16 season {{brought a}} host of struggles for Parise, who {{struggled}} through a sprained MCL {{at the beginning of}} the season, before injuring his back near the end of the season. In a game against the San Jose Sharks, Parise sustained a hit from Logan Couture that further aggravated the injury, taking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the season and the Wild's short playoff run. Even with the injuries, Parise led the team in goals and was second in points. He also led the NHL with a total of three hat tricks on the season.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{signed for}} Hertfordshire side Stevenage in August 2007, and {{featured}} regularly {{for the club}} for two seasons, playing in the club's successful FA Trophy campaign in May 2009. However, he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in three places in August 2009, ruling <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> eight months, but returned to first-team action in April 2010 as Stevenage won promotion to the Football League {{for the first time}} in the club's history. He then played a key part during the club's 2010–11 campaign, helping Stevenage earn promotion to League One.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham Forest for the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson had been playing with a torn posterior cruciate ligament, and it was expected that his recovery would rule <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|After being {{tracked by}} both Manchester United and Manchester City, {{he began his}} {{professional}} career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract {{at the age of}} 17.

He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead joined up with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his time there was disrupted by appendicitis, which ruled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> four weeks. The club released him in January 2009.|$|E
50|$|The 2015-16 season saw <b>him</b> turn <b>out</b> <b>for</b> HC Thurgau of the National League B, the second-tier of Swiss ice hockey. He tallied 11 {{goals and}} 25 assists in 25 NLB games.|$|R

5|$|Ahead of the club's 2009–10 campaign, May scored five second-half {{goals in}} Scunthorpe's 12–0 {{pre-season}} victory against Brigg Town. He also scored in friendlies against Jersey and Lincoln City. Despite his impressive pre-season form, {{he was an}} unused substitute in the club's first three fixtures of the 2009–10 season, before suffering an ankle injury that ruled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a month. Having returned to training in October 2009, May suffered another setback after injuring his other ankle – ruling him out of first-team action for six weeks. He made his first appearance of the 2009–10 season as a late substitute in a 3–1 home defeat against West Bromwich Albion on 28 December 2009. It was to be May's only appearance of the season, and he was released by Scunthorpe in May 2010. May made 51 appearances during his two and a half-year tenure at Scunthorpe, scoring five times.|$|E
5|$|Forster {{started his}} career with Newcastle United and had brief loan spells with Stockport County and Bristol Rovers. He then spent a {{successful}} season on loan at Norwich City, helping the club win the League One title and promotion to the Championship. Forster then joined Celtic on loan for the 2010–11 season, and helped them win the Scottish Cup. He spent a further season on loan there, winning the Scottish Premier League before becoming a permanent squad member in 2012 for a transfer fee of £2.2million. Forster won many plaudits for his performances at Celtic and holds the Scottish top division record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal. In August 2014, he joined Southampton for a reported £10million. Forster had a generally impressive debut season in the Premier League, but sustained a serious knee injury in March 2015 which ruled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} year. On his return in January 2016, he quickly found form again and went on to set a club record of 708 minutes without conceding a goal. Forster's return aided Southampton's rise from thirteenth in the league to a sixth-place finish, earning them qualification for the following season's UEFA Europa League.|$|E
5|$|He {{kept his}} place, but in November, an injury {{sustained}} against Mallorca {{was diagnosed as}} a bruised kidney and fractured vertebrae, which kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> some weeks, during which time Zé Castro forced his way into consideration as a starter. In January 2007, Pablo marked his 100th game for the club with a rare goal to earn a draw with Racing Santander, and completed the season with 24 league games. He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E
50|$|Villalobos {{started his}} college career at Cal State Northridge in 2010, having sat out 2009 as a red-shirted year. However, he {{suffered}} the fourth leg break {{of his career}} in 2011, putting <b>him</b> <b>out</b> injured <b>for</b> over 15-months.|$|R
