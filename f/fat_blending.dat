40|$|A {{calculation}} procedure for formulating lauric and palmitic <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> {{has been developed}} based on grouping TAG melting points.

These outcomes also suggested that both TAG species and their quantity had a significant influence on the crystallization behavior of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> Palmitic <b>fat</b> <b>blends,</b> in general, were found to exhibit higher SFC values than those of Lauric <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> Instead of the similarity in crystal microstructure, lauric <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were stabilized at β polymorph while palmitic <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were stabilized at β’ polymorph...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Fat</b> <b>blends,</b> {{formulated}} by mixing a highly satu-rated fat (palm stearin or fully hydrogenated soybean oil) with a native vegetable oil (soybean oil) in different ratios from 10 : 90 to 75 : 25 (wt%), {{were subjected to}} chemical interesterification reactions on laboratory scale (0. 2 % sodium methoxide catalyst, time = 90 min, temperature = 90 °C). Starting and interesterified blends were investigated for triglyceride composition, solid fat content, free fatty acid content, and trans fatty acid (TFA) levels. Obtained values were compared to those of low- and high-trans commercial food <b>fats.</b> The interesterified <b>blends</b> with 30 – 50 % of hard stock had plasticity curves {{in the range of}} commercial shortenings and stick-type margarines, while interesterified blends with 20 % hard stock were suitable for use in soft tub-type margarines.

40|$|Shortening {{base stock}} was {{prepared}} by blending High Oleic Sunflower Oil/HOSO, Palm Kernel Oil {{and a hard}} fat (hard Palm Stearin or Fully Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil). The ternary blends were adjusted for having the same unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios. Physicochemical properties of the <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> were then {{compared with those of}} its interesterified blend. Enzymatic interesterification was carried out using sn- 1, 3 specific lipase on its optimum condition. Silver-ion HPLC analysis showed that there was an increment on the degree of unsaturation based on the TAG composition after interesterification. As a result, the process significantly altered <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> properties, namely solid fat content/SFC, crystallization and melting behaviors, and crystal morphology. Interesterification by including HOSO gave the lowest SFC profile whilst its slope was the sharpest. The slopes of SFC profiles of interesterified blends without HOSO were found to be comparable to that of commercial shortening. Crystallization peaks of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were also changed after interesterification. The peak at higher temperature was diminished, and as replacement, a broad peak at middle temperature was emerged for both interesterified blends with HOSO and without HOSO. The enzymatic interesterification reduced the melting temperature of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> However, the interesterified blends with HOSO gave lower melting temperatures than those of the interesterified blends without HOSO. It was also observed from PLM that the size of fat crystals became smaller and dispersed more homogenously after enzymatic interesterification...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{intestinal}} mucosa {{functions as a}} barrier against harmful dietary and microbial antigens. An intact gut barrier forms a prerequisite for protection against infection and allergy. Both allergic and inflammatory mediators (e. g. IL- 4, IFN-gamma) are known to compromise the epithelial barrier integrity by enhancing permeability. Breast milk provides protection against infection and allergy and contains polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). AIM OF THE STUDY: Although PUFA are commonly used in infant formulas their effect on intestinal barrier is still poorly understood. Therefore the effects of distinct PUFA (n- 6 : LA, GLA, DGLA, AA; n- 3 : ALA, EPA, DHA) and a <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> with PUFA composition {{similar to that of}} the human breast milk fat fraction, on barrier integrity were investigated. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cells (T 84) were pre-incubated with individual PUFA or a lipase treated <b>fat</b> <b>blend,</b> with or without subsequent IL- 4 exposure. Barrier integrity was evaluated by measuring transepithelial resistance and permeability. Membrane phospholipid composition was determined by capillary gas chromatography. RESULTS: DGLA, AA, EPA, DHA and to a lesser extend GLA enhanced basal TER and strongly reduced IL- 4 mediated permeability, while LA and ALA were ineffective. Furthermore, the lipase treated <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> effectively supported barrier function. PUFA were incorporated in the membrane phospholipid fraction of T 84 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Long chain PUFA DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA were particularly effective in supporting barrier integrity by improving resistance and reducing IL- 4 mediated permeability. <b>Fat</b> <b>blends</b> that release specific PUFA upon digestion in the gastrointestinal tract may support natural resistance...|$|R

In the meantime, the temperatures for isothermal crystallization were selected at 35 % solid fat content (SFC) for each <b>fat</b> <b>blend.</b> During isothermal crystallization at 35 % SFC, the ternary blend containing PS had one broad exothermic peak that reached its peak maximum after 21. 3 min. Meanwhile, the ternary blend containing FHSO showed two exothermic peaks of which the first peak emerged during the cooling stage at 30. 9 oC and the second peak appeared within 1. 6 min isothermal time. Both PS and FHSO influenced the crystallization kinetics of the blends differently. The parameters of crystallization kinetics as calculated by the Foubert model were a (55 and 20 Jg- 1), t-ind (0. 351 and 0. 003 h), K (2. 89 and 42. 61 h- 1) and n (6. 2 and 6. 0), for blends containing PS and FHSO respectively. In addition, it was observed by stop and return DSC measurements that ternary blends containing PS experienced stronger recrystallization compared to those containing FHSO.

In this paper palm olein and palm stearin (70 : 30 w/w) <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> was chemically interesterified using 0. 4 ml % of NaOH: glycerol: H 2 O (1 : 2 : 3 w/w) or 0. 3 % sodium methoxide catalysts under different conditions of time and temperature. The produced interesterified blends were used to prepare fortified vegetable butter samples using nanotechnology.

At a similar <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> formulation, only the high melting fat and medium melting fat were interesterified in binary-EIE. Meanwhile, both fats and the liquid oil were interesterified in ternary-EIE. The solid fat content (SFC) of all binary-EIE blends was generally retained as similar in the temperature range between 0 and 20  °C when the amount of unsaturated TAGs was limited by excluding the liquid oil during EIE. However, the SFC was significantly reduced at temperatures above 20  °C {{compared to that of}} the initial blends. Furthermore, the melting point of binary-EIE blends at BH 50 H 15 formulation prepared with palm stearin and fully hydrogenated rapeseed oil as the hard fat was found to be drastically reduced from 54. 6 to 35. 3  °C and from 62. 8 to 39. 2  °C, respectively. In contrast, the SFC of ternary-EIE blends was generally reduced when more unsaturated TAGs were available for EIE by including the liquid oil. However, higher SFC was noticed at temperatures around 10  °C in ternary-EIE blends, as the amount of high-melting fractions in their initial blends was increased from BH 50 H 5 to BH 50 H 15.

40|$|Palm fat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fats in food industry. The main role of palm fat is to develop the desired texture of food products. <b>Fat</b> <b>blends</b> were developed to find the most appropriate mixture fitting the technological needs. In our work palm mid fraction (PMF) was mixed with anhydrous milk fat (AMF), goose fat (G), and lard (L) in a 1 : 1 ratio. Anhydrous milk fat represents fat consisting of a wide range of fatty acids. Goose fat is a soft, easily melting fat, and lard is characterized as animal fat with wide melting temperature interval. The measurements aimed to establish the miscibility of the fats and the effect of animal fats on the melting-solidification profile of palm mid fraction. SFC vs temperature curves, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) melting thermograms describe the melting profile of the samples. Isotherm crystallization by SFC vs time curves and DSC cooling thermograms were measured to characterize the solidification of pure <b>fats</b> and the <b>blends.</b> Since the SFC curves did not show crosspoints we concluded that <b>fats</b> <b>blended</b> in a 1 : 1 ratio were miscible. Anhydrous milk fat strongly modified the properties of palm mid fraction, the blend became similar to anhydrous milk fat.

However, due to possible nutritional and sustainability issues, the food industry is looking for alternatives. In this study, the functionality of three alternative non-palm hardstock fats (β’-tending/plastic Fat A and B, and β-tending/non-plastic Fat C) rich in stearic acid and combined with rapeseed oil (RO) was evaluated in sugar-snap cookies. Firstly, the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> were characterised for their fatty acid composition, melting and crystallisation behaviour.

The proposed alternative fat phases showed a lower atherogenicity index and a different melting and crystallisation behaviour compared to the palm-based <b>fat</b> <b>blend.</b> These physicochemical differences resulted in margarines with distinct microstructural and thermal properties. However, dough hardness and elasticity was not significantly affected. Regarding sugars-snap cookies, the application of Fat A/RO 73 / 27 gave similar quality attributes as the palm-based reference, whereas Fat B/RO 81 / 19 and Fat C resulted in slightly wider and more easy-to-break cookies which in some cases might even be more desired.

40|$|The {{effect on}} {{lipoprotein}} metabolism of diets enriched in different isomers of dioleoylpalmitoylglycerol was studied. One diet contained fat in which palmitate was esterified {{to the two}} outer positions of the glycerol (OOP) {{and the other in}} which it was esterified to the middle carbon (OPO). The lipid composition of chylomicrons was similar in rats fed either <b>fat</b> <b>blend.</b> However, triacylglycerol (TAG) in chylomicrons from OPO fed animals was relatively enriched in palmitic acid, at the expense of stearic, oleic and linoleic acids. Silver phase HPLC and 2 -positional analysis clearly demonstrated that the identity of the fatty acid in the 2 -position was similar in both dietary and chylomicron TAG. No significant differences could be seen in the in vitro hydrolysis of chylomicron TAG from animals fed the two fats labelled with [14 C]palmitate. As expected, following hydrolysis, palmitate was released as free fatty acid from chylomicrons isolated from OOP-fed animals but within 2 -monoacylglycerol from those fed OPO. The enrichment of chylomicrons with palmitate in animals fed O[14 C]PO resulted in increased delivery of [14 C]palmitate to the liver. In a further series of experiments Golden Syrian hamsters were fed diets containing the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> and either 0. 005 % or 0. 12 % (w/w) cholesterol, for 28 days.

To study the impact of MCT on glucose metabolism, 18 preterm infants were randomized to receive either an MCT or an LCT formula containing 38 - and 6 %-by-weight medium-chain fatty acids, respectively, in their <b>fat</b> <b>blend.</b> At 4 wk of age, the metabolic rate, substrate utilization, glucose kinetics, and oxidation were measured by indirect respiratory calorimetry in combination with a constant-rate oral infusion of [U- 13 C]glucose. The "true" rate of appearance of glucose (Ra "true") was measured from the dilution of the uniformly labeled (m + 6) species of infused tracer, whereas "apparent" rate of appearance of glucose (Ra "apparent") was measured from the dilution of infused tracer C (carbon). The latter was measured by an on-line combustion method using a gas chromatograph-isotope ratio mass spectrometer. At a carbohydrate intake of 8. 4 mg. kg- 1. min- 1, total utilization of carbohydrate was equal in both groups at 7. 6 mg. kg- 1. min- 1. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Dososahexaenoate (DHA) {{is highly}} {{concentrated}} in mammalian nervous and visual systems and its deficiency during gestation, lactation and early life, could have dramatic impacts on brain functions and mental health. Achieving an appropriate DHA {{status in the}} neonatal brain is an important goal of neonatal nutrition. We evaluated how a-linolenic acid (ALA) provided by different dietary fat matrices improved DHA content in the brains of both young male and female rats. Young rats born from dams fed during gestation and lactation with a low ALA diet (0. 4 % of fatty acids) were subjected for 6 weeks after weaning to an anhydrous dairy fat blend-based diet that provided 1. 5 % ALA or to a palm oil blend-based diet that provided the same ALA level: either 1. 5 % ALA or 1. 5 % ALA and 0. 12 % DHA with 0. 4 % arachidonic acid (ARA). With each diet the n- 6 / n- 3 ratio was similar (10) to follow the values generally recommended for infant formula. Fatty acids analysis in whole brain showed that 1. 5 % ALA dairy <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> was superior to both 1. 5 % ALA palm-oil blends, supplemented or not with dietary DHA, for increasing brain DHA. Females compared to males had significantly higher brain DHA with the 1. 5 % ALA palm-blend diet, but the dietary supplementation with DHA smoothed the differences by a specific increase of males DHA brain. In conclusion, dairy <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> enriched with ALA {{appear to be an}} interesting strategy for achieving optimal DHA levels in the brain of post-weaning rats.

40|$|Milk fat (MF) and {{rapeseed}} oil (RO) blends {{were analyzed by}} differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was shown that peak and onset temperatures {{can be used to}} determine the percentage of each <b>fat</b> in the <b>blend</b> and that the relative enthalpy of one peak assigned to low-melting triacylglycerols (TAG) {{can also be used to}} determine the percentage of RO in the blend. A linear relation was also established between IMF content of the blend and its dropping point (DP), indicating that DP can be linearly related with the above DSC data. A blend of MF/RO 70 : 30 (wt/wt) was then chosen as a model system for enzymatic interesterification (EIE). The applicability of DSC analyses to EIE products was checked and a correct correlation could be established between DSC values and the interesterification degree and DP. Among the data from the DSC profiles, the peak associated with low-melting TAG was the best indicator of the reaction course. In the same way, a high-melting MF stearin fraction was interesterified. with RO. In that case, onset temperatures and peak "a" were better reaction indicators than for the interesterified MF/RO blend. We therefore suggest that values from DSC endotherms could be used to monitor EIE of <b>fat</b> <b>blends.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{addition}} of sucrose behenate for the {{modification of the}} physical properties of soft fats, such as soybean oil-based interesterified fat, refined palm oil, and palm mid fraction was studied. The {{addition of}} sucrose behenate was verified to affect the crystalline network of fats, changing the hardness and solids profile. The isothermal crystallization behaviors of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> with 1 % sucrose behenate were analyzed at 20 and 25 °C.

Compared with standard cow's milk-based formulas, partially whey HF confer a limited protective effect against allergic disease in high-risk infants, particularly atopic dermatitis, but not respiratory allergies. No randomised clinical trials have been published on partially whey HF in infants with colicky symptoms. The group did not find sufficient {{evidence to support the}} use of partially whey HF in regurgitation, although recent data suggest that a thickened partially whey HF may be more effective. Partially whey HF, fortified with prebiotics and/or probiotics, with high levels of sn- 2 palmitate in the <b>fat</b> <b>blend</b> or without palm oil, provide some benefit in functional constipation.

40|$|Twelve <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> {{based on}} palm {{fractions}}, shea fractions and fully hardened soybean oil were combined with high oleic sunflower oil and studied for potential use as puff pastry shortenings. The <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> {{had a lower}} saturated fatty acid content (28. 3 - 32. 0 %) compared to a commercial puff pastry shortening (49. 4 %) and butter (65. 9 %). The saturated fat contained in the blends was formed by different triacylglycerol (TAG) structures containing mainly stearic acid, palmitic acid {{or a combination of}} both so that the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> contained different TAG composition and it was possible to assess the effect ofthe different TAG composition on their performance as puff pastry shortenings. The fat sources of the main TAGs were: Palm Stearin (POs), which contained tripalmitoyl glycerol (PPP) Palm Mid-fraction (PM F), which contained 1, 3 -dipalmitoyl- 2 - 0 Ieyl glycerol (POP) Interesterified Palm Mid-fraction (inPMF), which contained PPP, POP, 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl- 3 - 0 Ieyl glycerol (PPO) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2, 3 -dioleylglycerol (POO) Fully Hardened Soybean Oil (fhBO), which contained tristearoylglycerol (SSS) Shea Stearin (SHs), which contained 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oelyl glycerol (SOS) Interesterified Shea Stearin (inSHs), which contained SSS, SOS and 1 -stearoyl- 2, 3 - dioleylglycerol (SOO) and 1, 2 -distearoyl- 3 - 0 Ieyl glycerol (SSO) High Oleic Sunflower Oil (HOSF), which contained trioleyl glycerol (000) The blends were formulated to systematically vary the ratio of trisatures (either PPP or SSS); 1, 2 - disaturates (either PPO or SSO) and 1, 3 -disaturates (either POP or SOS). The blends were processed on a pilot plant scale and their properties were studied The physical properties of the <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> and their functionality as shortenings for puff pastry were assessed by their Solid Fat Content (SFC), polymorphism, melting and crystallisation profile, texture and production of a baked puff pastry product. The solid fat content showed that blends containing stearic acid had the highest SFC between 20 and 30 °C (25. 3 - 33. 3 % at 20 °C and 19. 8 - 24. 2 % at 30 °C) compared to samples containing palmitic acid (18 - 23 % at 20 °C and 1. 2 - 21. 2 % at 30 °C). Above 30 °C all samples commenced a decline in their SFC, the most affected being those containing disaturated TAGs and palmitic acid. The melting profile showed that higher melting TAGs were present in blends B 1 -B 4 compared to blends containing mainly palmitic acid (A 1 -A 4), where less energy was required for melting and crystallising the TAGs present. The main polymorph found was f 3 in blends containing SOS, POP or a combination of both as their main TAG (blends A 4, B 4 and C 4). Polymorph P' was also detected in the blends combined with B. Blends A 3 and C 3 which contained POO as their main TAGs crystallised mainly in the W polymorph. Puff pastry prepared with blend A 1 (POs:HOSF 29 : 71), A 4 (PMF:HOSF 41 : 59), B 3 (inSHs:HOSF 38 : 62) and C 3 (inPMF:inSHs:HOSF 19 : 20 : 61) was very hard. Blends A 2 (POs:PMF:HOSF 13 : 19 : 68), B 4 (SHs:HOSF 40 : 60), C 2 (POs:PMF:fhBO:SHs: HOSF (9 : 12 : 4 : 12 : 63) and C 4 (PMF:SHs:HOSF 20 : 21 : 59) were most similar to butter in the compressibility of the baked product and specific volume. It was found that puff pastry prepared from blends that contained SOS as the main saturates (blends B 4, Cl, C 2 and C 4) presented properties closer to butter than the other blends as they were similar to butter in compressibility of the baked product and had high specific volume. Blend C 2 prepared with POs, PMF, fhBO, SHs and HOSF (9 : 12 : 4 : 12 : 63) produced a puff pastry product with better qualities {{than the rest of the}} <b>fat</b> <b>blends</b> and its textural properties such as specific volume (3. 5 cm 3 /g), height (22. 6 mm) and compression (138 g) were comparable to those obtained with butter. For this reason, it was selected to be optimised for use as a puff pastry shortening by increasing its saturated concentration from 33 % to 34. 6 % and 37. 6 % and compared to a commercial puff pastry shortening with 49. 4 % total saturates. The main TAGs were PPP:SSS (2. 5 : 1) and POP:SOS (1. 1 : 1). Physical properties such as SFC, melting and crystallisation profile and yield stress were affected by the increasing levels in saturated fatty acid content. Microscopyand rheological analysis showed minor differences at the microstructural level and this was reflected in their performance in the puff pastry products. The blends compared well with commercial puff pastry and butter. It was concluded that a high SFC and melting point, indicative of good plasticity, are required in the making of puff pastry products and that the level of microstructure provided by disaturated TAGs with the configuration saturated-unsaturated-saturated is desirable as they promote crystallisation in the ~ polymorph, a good lift and specific volume, favouring the production of puff pastry products with comparable characteristics to those obtained with butter and the commercial puff pastry shortening.
