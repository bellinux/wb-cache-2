She is esteemed as a standard-setter for wifely and womanly virtues for all Hindu women. Sita is adopted {{daughter}} of Janaka, king of Videha, found while he was <b>furrowing</b> the earth. The prince of Ayodhya, Rama wins Sita in her svayamvara. Later, when Rama is sentenced to a fourteen-year exile, Sita joins Rama and his brother Lakshmana in exile, despite Rama's wish for her to remain in Ayodhya. While in exile in Dandaka forest, she falls prey to Ravana's scheme and sends Rama away in quest of a golden deer, while she is kidnapped by Ravana. Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. Sita proves her chastity by undergoing a trial by fire. Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where Rama is coronated as king. When a washerman casts doubts about her chastity, Rama abandons a pregnant Sita in the forest. Sita gives birth to twins Lava and Kusha in the hermitage of sage Valmiki, who protects her. Her sons grow and reunite with Rama and again Sita is asked to prove her chastity before Rama can take her back. However, Sita chooses {{to return to the}} womb of her mother, Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of eucalyptus bark {{varies with the}} age of the plant, the manner of bark shed, the length of the bark fibres, the degree of <b>furrowing,</b> the thickness, the hardness, and the colour. All mature eucalypts put on an annual layer of bark, which contributes to the increasing diameter of the stems. In some species, the outermost layer dies and is annually deciduous, either in long strips (as in E. sheathiana) or in variably sized flakes (E. diversicolor, E. cosmophylla, or E. cladocalyx). These are the gums or smooth-barked species. The gum bark may be dull, shiny, or satiny (as in E. ornata) or matte (E. cosmophylla). In many species, the dead bark is retained. Its outermost layer gradually fragments with weathering and sheds without altering the essentially rough-barked nature of the trunks or stems — for example E. marginata, E. jacksonii, E. obliqua, and E. porosa.|$|E

40|$|SummaryEarly Drosophila {{embryogenesis}} {{is characterized}} by shifting from astral microtubule-based to central spindle-based positioning of cleavage <b>furrows.</b> Before cellularization, astral microtubules determine metaphase <b>furrow</b> position by producing Rappaport-like <b>furrows,</b> which encompass rather than bisect the spindle. Their positioning is explained by our finding that the conserved central spindle components centralspindlin (mKLP 1 and RacGAP 50 C), Polo, and Fascetto (Prc 1) localize to the astral microtubule overlap region. These components and the chromosomal passenger complex localize to the central spindle, though no <b>furrow</b> forms there. We identify the maternally supplied RhoGEF 2 as {{a key factor in}} metaphase <b>furrow</b> positioning. Unlike the zygotic, central spindle-localized RhoGEF (Pebble), RhoGEF 2 localizes to metaphase <b>furrows,</b> a function distinct from RhoGEF/Pebble and likely due to the absence of a RacGAP 50 C binding domain. Accordingly, we find that ectopic activation of Rho GTPase generates <b>furrows</b> perpendicular to the central spindle during syncytial divisions. Whereas metaphase <b>furrow</b> formation is myosin independent, these ectopic <b>furrows,</b> like conventional <b>furrows,</b> require myosin as well as microtubules. These studies demonstrate that early Drosophila embryogenesis is primed to form <b>furrows</b> at either overlapping astral microtubules or the central spindle. We propose that the shift to the latter is driven by a corresponding shift from RhoGEF 2 to Pebble in controlling <b>furrow</b> formation...|$|R

40|$|During cytokinesis, {{cleavage}} <b>furrow</b> invagination {{requires an}} actomyosin-based contractile ring and addition of new membrane. Little {{is known about}} how this actin and membrane traffic to the cleavage <b>furrow.</b> We address this through live analysis of fluorescently tagged vesicles in postcellularized Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We find that during cytokinesis, F-actin and membrane are targeted as a unit to invaginating <b>furrows</b> through formation of F-actin–associated vesicles. F-actin puncta strongly colocalize with endosomal, but not Golgi-derived, vesicles. These vesicles are recruited to the cleavage <b>furrow</b> along the central spindle and a distinct population of microtubules (MTs) {{in contact with the}} leading <b>furrow</b> edge (<b>furrow</b> MTs). We find that Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor mutants, pebble (pbl), severely disrupt this F-actin–associated vesicle transport. These transport defects are a consequence of the pbl mutants' inability to properly form <b>furrow</b> MTs and the central spindle. Transport of F-actin–associated vesicles on <b>furrow</b> MTs and the central spindle is thus an important mechanism by which actin and membrane are delivered to the cleavage <b>furrow...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryCell {{division}} {{is achieved by}} a plasma membrane <b>furrow</b> that must ingress between the segregating chromosomes during anaphase [1 – 3]. The force that drives <b>furrow</b> ingression is generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which {{is linked to the}} membrane by an as yet undefined molecular mechanism. A key component of the membrane <b>furrow</b> is anillin. Upon targeting to the <b>furrow</b> through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, anillin acts as a scaffold linking the actomyosin and septin cytoskeletons to maintain <b>furrow</b> stability (reviewed in [4, 5]). We report that the PH domain of anillin interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids (PIPs), including PI(4, 5) P 2, which is enriched in the <b>furrow.</b> Reduction of cellular PI(4, 5) P 2 or mutations in the PH domain of anillin that specifically disrupt the interaction with PI(4, 5) P 2, interfere with the localization of anillin to the <b>furrow.</b> Reduced expression of anillin disrupts symmetric <b>furrow</b> ingression that can be restored by targeting ectopically expressed anillin to the <b>furrow</b> using an alternate PI(4, 5) P 2 binding module, a condition where the septin cytoskeleton is not recruited to the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that the anillin PH domain has two functions: targeting anillin to the <b>furrow</b> by binding to PI(4, 5) P 2 to maintain <b>furrow</b> organization and recruiting septins to the <b>furrow...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila embryo {{undergoes}} a developmental transition in the blastoderm stage switching from syncytial to cellular development. The cleavage <b>furrow,</b> which encloses nuclei into cells, is a prominent morphological {{feature of this}} transition. It {{is not clear how}} the pattern of the <b>furrow</b> array is defined and how zygotic genes trigger the formation and invagination of interphase <b>furrows.</b> A key to these questions is provided by the gene slam, which has been previously implicated in controlling <b>furrow</b> invagination. Here we investigate the null phenotype of slam, the dynamics of Slam protein, and its control by the recycling endosome. We find that slam is essential for <b>furrow</b> invagination during cellularisation and together with nullo, for specification of the <b>furrow.</b> During cellularisation, Slam marks first the <b>furrow,</b> which is derived from the metaphase <b>furrow</b> of the previous mitosis. Slightly later, Slam accumulates at new <b>furrows</b> between daughter cells early in interphase. Slam is stably associated with the <b>furrow</b> canal except for the onset of cellularisation as revealed by FRAP experiments. Restriction of Slam to the <b>furrow</b> canal and Slam mobility during cellularisation is controlled by the recycling endosome and centrosomes. We propose a three step model. The retracting metaphase <b>furrow</b> leaves an initial mark. This mark and the border between corresponding daughter nuclei are refined by vesicular transport away from pericentrosomal recycling endosome towards the margins of the somatic buds.

40|$|Most <b>furrow</b> {{irrigation}} systems have low performance due to deep percolation at the upstream end and tailwater runoff at {{the downstream end}} of the field. To eliminate this problem improving <b>furrow</b> irrigation performance is necessary. Since the inflow discharge has high effect on infiltration along the <b>furrow</b> which consequently affects the application efficiency and water distribution uniformity, {{it would be important}} to apply different <b>furrow</b> inflow hydrograph shapes based on the field data such as field slope, soil texture and <b>furrow</b> length to save water. To produce different <b>furrow</b> inflow hydrograph shapes, an automatic valve which was connected to a stepper motor was designed to change the inflow discharge with time according to the desired inflow hydrograph shape. The experimental field was located at Isfahan University of Technology. A constant head water delivery system to the <b>furrows</b> including the automatic valve was installed in the experimental field and the tests were conducted for different inflow hydrograph shapes. The comparison of the measured <b>furrow</b> inflow discharges with the simulated <b>furrow</b> inflow discharges produced by the automatic valve showed that the automatic valve can produce different <b>furrow</b> inflow hydrograph shapes with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|During early {{development}} in Drosophila, pseudocleavage <b>furrows</b> in the syncytial embryo prevent contact between neighboring spindles, thereby ensuring proper chromosome segregation. Here we {{demonstrate that the}} GTPase Ran regulates pseudocleavage <b>furrow</b> organization. Ran can exert control on pseudocleavage <b>furrows</b> independently of its role in regulating the microtubule cytoskeleton. Disruption of the Ran pathway prevented pseudocleavage <b>furrow</b> formation and restricted the depth and duration of <b>furrow</b> ingression of those pseudocleavage <b>furrows</b> that did form. We found that Ran was required for the localization of the septin Peanut to the pseudocleavage <b>furrow,</b> but not anillin or actin. Biochemical assays revealed that the direct binding of the nuclear transport receptors importin α and β to anillin prevented the binding of Peanut to anillin. Furthermore, RanGTP reversed the inhibitory action of importin α and β. On expression of a mutant form of anillin that lacked an importin α and β binding site, inhibition of Ran no longer restricted the depth and duration of <b>furrow</b> ingression in those pseudocleavage <b>furrows</b> that formed. These data suggest that anillin and Peanut are involved in pseudocleavage <b>furrow</b> ingression in syncytial embryos and that this process is regulated by Ran...|$|R
50|$|Both {{the border}} and the border <b>furrow</b> of the cephalon are {{relatively}} narrow. The <b>furrow</b> that divides the glabella in an anterior and posterior part (or transglabellar <b>furrow)</b> is straight or bent slightly rearwards. The posterior lobe is parallel sided, has two pairs of lateral <b>furrows</b> in shape of prominent grooves, or pits small basal lobes, and no median node. The pygidium has a border that is flattened and widened. The pygidium is not entirely subcircular, because posterolateral corners are somewhat developed, but without spines. The lobes of the rhachis are separated by narrow groves (or transaxial <b>furrows)</b> that reach the median node but do not cross the rhachis. The distance between {{the tip of the}} rhachis and the border <b>furrow</b> is short or these even touch, but there is no <b>furrow</b> midline that connects the <b>furrows</b> defining the rhachis and the pygidial border.|$|R
