5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by both <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> England's, lack of success. She bemoaned {{that the}} sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} {{that she needed to}} readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E
5|$|Founded in April 1879, the Church of Christ, Scientist {{is led by}} a {{president}} and five-person board of directors. There is a public-relations department, known as the Committee on Publication, with representatives around the world; this {{was set up by}} Eddy in 1898 to protect <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> the church's reputation. The church was accused in the 1990s of silencing internal criticism by firing staff, delisting practitioners and excommunicating members.|$|E

5|$|Jourdain {{was also}} the author of several textbooks, ran a school of <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> after the {{incident}} became the vice-Principal of St. Hugh's College. Before Jourdain was appointed, it was decided that the two women should get to know one another better; Jourdain owned an apartment in Paris where she tutored English children, and so Moberly went to stay with her.|$|E
5|$|Marcus went {{to great}} lengths to {{sanitize}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> Wyatt's history. For example, she worked hard to keep both her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Malory becomes {{temporally}} blinded {{after having}} {{an allergic reaction}} to zucchini. Seeing {{this as an opportunity}} to help themselves, secretary Cheryl and human resources representative Pam hack into the ISIS computer mainframe from Malory's office and alter their files, allowing them better health care and other perks they can not afford themselves.

5|$|Utami {{has also}} noted that the novel is a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of it directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{the whole}} video set {{is made in}} {{tropical}} and romantic setting. The video begins with a shot of Rihanna herself laying down in grass. Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
60|$|How {{delightful}} {{to escape}} from all this, to quietness, peace, freedom from <b>her</b> <b>own</b> cares <b>and</b> other people's,--Fern Torr air and scenery, Edmund and Agnes for companions, and liberty to teach school children, go about among <b>her</b> <b>own</b> people, do good in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> way, <b>and</b> enjoy <b>her</b> <b>own</b> studies. It was like a captive longing to be set free,--a wanderer in sight of home.|$|R

5|$|Born in East Troy, Wisconsin to a {{dressmaker}} and a dairy-farmer, Hickok had {{an unhappy}} childhood marked by isolation and abuse. After her mother's death when Hickok was fourteen, she left home, worked on <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> {{completed high school}} {{with the help of}} a cousin. She went into journalism after failing out of college, and soon became a successful reporter for the Minneapolis Tribune and the Associated Press (AP), achieving several firsts for American women journalists. By 1932, she had become the nation's best-known female reporter.|$|E
5|$|Both Britain and France claimed {{victory in}} the battle: Britain by virtue of {{capturing}} or sinking seven French ships without losing any of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> remaining {{in control of the}} battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household.|$|E
5|$|Each evening, Texas {{retired from}} her {{bombardment}} position close to Okinawa, but returned {{the next morning}} to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E

Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X (Steven Williams). X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by the agent's partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Scully, meanwhile, meets {{a group of women}} with abduction experiences similar to <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder (Don S. Williams), who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> her husband's gain. In {{the early years}} of their reign, she was often seen as completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 1938, Skelton {{replaced}} Red Foley as {{the host}} of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest {{at one of his}} banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.|$|E

5|$|The anime ends differently, with no {{life-threatening}} {{situation and}} Hazumu choosing Yasuna {{in order to}} help cure her worsening sight problem as it begins to degrade so she can no longer see girls as well. Afterwards however, Yasuna, who becomes able to see all people again, decides to break up with Hazumu, saying she can stand on <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> in the follow-up original video animation episode, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari on Christmas and the two get married in a ceremony held by Hitoshi.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Fiona as she {{explores the}} environment, evades and hides from enemy pursuers, and occasionally fights against the castle's inhabitants. Sometimes Fiona will panic when in danger, {{in which case}} she begins to run on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> the player loses some control. Hewie is a central part to the gameplay, and accompanies Fiona throughout the game. He can be given orders to explore the environment, attack enemies, and otherwise aid in Fiona's survival. Capcom added the dog mechanic during development thinking retailers and players alike would not enjoy a survival horror title with a lone female protagonist.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
