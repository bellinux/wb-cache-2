Nominating essays were judged by the President of the International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP), the President of National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) {{and a team of}} Pendaflex executives. The winner received a spa vacation for two in Arizona and a $4,000 stipend, along with a golden PENDY, a fresh bouquet of flowers every month for a year and Pendaflex organizational products, including the Project Sorter, Mobile File and Get-A-Grip <b>Expanding</b> <b>File.</b>|$|E

Tab-completion is feature-rich, <b>expanding</b> <b>file</b> paths (with wildcards and brace expansion), variables, and many command specific completions. Command-specific completions, including options with descriptions, can to some extent be generated from the commands' manpages.|$|E

When a compressed archive file is chosen by the user that they wish to expand and uncompress, they can then choose the destination folder for the expansion; {{which is where the}} <b>expanded</b> <b>files</b> will be stored.|$|R
50|$|DFS used a {{very simple}} disk {{structure}} and files on disk were located only by their length and starting sector. This meant that all files had to exist as a continuous block of sectors and fragmentation was not possible. Using the example in the table above, the attempt to <b>expand</b> <b>file</b> F in step five would have failed on such a system with the can't extend error message. Regardless of how much free space might remain on the disk in total, it was not available to extend the data file.|$|R
5000|$|Compact Pro also {{included}} {{the ability to}} produce self-extracting archives. Although this was becoming common in archivers at the time, its particular implementation was notable because the extractor [...] "stub" [...] code was quite small at about 13 kB (compared to StuffIt at 38 kB). In an era of 14400 bit/s modems, this was a worthwhile savings. Many considered even this to be too large to bother with, {{and there were a}} number of small third-party utilities to strip the stub off from an existing archive. Compact Pro's stub could also <b>expand</b> <b>files</b> that had been split into parts, a rare feature at the time.|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to stress that such approach inherently enables backward and forward standard compliance. Backward compatibility refers to the capability of a decoder to interpret correctly both the older standard, in particular JPEG- 1, and the newly added functionality. Forward compatibility refers to the capability of the older standard or its legacy implementation to still being able to interpret and decode the information it is assumed to recognize in the <b>expanded</b> <b>file</b> format specification but to ignore all new components that {{are connected to the}} more recent standard specification such that it does not breakdown. The latter capability is extremely important since it will guarantee that existing applications using legacy codecs are not jeopardized.|$|R

Cooley was working to gain ABA accreditation since the satellite schools opened in June 2002, but had faced delays caused by disagreements on standards, resolved by a settlement of Cooley's lawsuit with the ABA, resulting in the ABA's acquiescence.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{applications}} {{expand to}} fill the space available to them, exploiting local storage to improve performance by caching, prefetching and precomputing data. In virtual-ized settings, this behavior compromises storage elastic-ity owing to a rigid contract between the hypervisor and the guest OS: once space is allocated to a virtual disk and used by an application, it cannot be reclaimed by the hy-pervisor. In this paper, we propose a new guest filesystem called Harmonium that exploits the ephemeral or deriva-tive nature of application data. Each file in Harmonium optionally has a motif that describes how the file can be reconstructed via computation, network accesses, or oper-ations on other <b>files.</b> Harmonium <b>expands</b> <b>files</b> from their motifs when space is available, and contracts {{them back to their}} motifs when it is scarce. Given a target size, the sys-tem selects <b>files</b> to <b>expand</b> or contract based on the load on the CPU, network, and storage, as well as expected access patterns. As a result, Harmonium enables elastic cloud storage, allowing the hypervisor to dynamically balance storage across multiple VMs. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} an implementation of MPI-IO us-ing a new parallel <b>file</b> system, called <b>Expand</b> (Expand-able Parallel <b>File</b> System), {{which is based}} on NFS servers. Expand combines multiple NFS servers to create a distrib-uted partition where <b>files</b> are striped. <b>Expand</b> requires no changes to the NFS server and uses RPC operations to provide parallel access to the same <b>file.</b> <b>Expand</b> is also independent of the clients, because all operations are implemented using RPC and NFS protocols. Using this system, we can join heterogeneous servers (Linux, Solaris, Windows 2000, etc.) to provide a parallel and distributed partition.

50|$|In RAID configurations, {{almost all}} {{policies}} {{are applied to}} each leg in isolation. For example, even if a LV has a policy of cling, <b>expanding</b> the <b>file</b> system will not result in LVM using a PV if it is already used {{by one of the}} other legs in the RAID setup. LVs with RAID functionality will put each leg on different PVs, making the other PVs unavailable to any other given leg. If this was the only option available, expansion of the LV would fail. In this sense, the logic behind cling will only apply to expanding each of the individual legs of the array.|$|R
50|$|Logical names do {{not have}} a close {{equivalent}} in POSIX operating systems. They resemble Unix environment variables, except they are <b>expanded</b> by the <b>file</b> system, instead of the command shell or application program. They must be defined before use, so it is common for many logical names to be defined in the system startup command file, as well as user login command files.|$|R
50|$|Great Plains Airlines was a {{regional}} airline headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States.

The airline filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 2004 after attempts to secure additional financing and investments were unsuccessful. After it ceased operations, all five of the company's aircraft were repossessed by creditors and all other property belonging to the airline was auctioned off.|$|R

5000|$|The command interpreters of {{the early}} {{versions}} of Unix (1st through 6th Editions, 1969-75) relied on a separate program to expand wildcard characters in unquoted arguments to a command: /etc/glob.
