The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not exclude the possibility of poisoning. Matthias's funeral was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490.|$|E
5|$|In late 1812, Alceste was {{decommissioned}} {{and placed}} in ordinary at Deptford. Between February and July 1814 she was converted at Deptford into a troopship; in this role, she was recommissioned in May 1814 under Commander Faniel Lawrence, and sailed with troops to North America. Following the British decision to attack New Orleans; Alceste left Pensacola on 8 December 1814, {{in tandem with the}} 50 other vessels under Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. The point chosen to land the troops was at the head of Lake Borgne which was subsequently discovered to be guarded by five American gunboats, a sloop and a schooner. On 14 December, Cochrane dispatched nearly 1,000 men in 42 barges from the various ships under his command, including Alceste. After rowing for almost 24 hours, the British stopped just out of range to rest and <b>eat</b> <b>breakfast</b> before launching their attack. The conflict, known as the Battle of Lake Borgne, resulted in the capture of all the American vessels, at a cost of 94 British and 41 American dead and wounded.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Youth {{suicide is}} one of the top three causes of death among age group between 15 and 24 years old. The known risk factors include depression, hopelessness, {{dysfunctional}} families, substance abuse, school failure and harassment. However, research reports in relation to the protective factors to prevent adolescent from suicidal attempts are still lacking. The purpose of this study is to detect (if any) the protective effect of physical activity and the habit of <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> on children suicidal attempts. Methods: This study adopted a secondary data analysis approach, in which data was extracted from the 2013 Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance System to detect the association effect between children's physical activity level and the habit of <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> with suicidal attempts. Results: The increase number of days of physical activity and the habit of <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> were both significantly related to the declining trend in suicidal attempts (p< 0. 0001). Only the effect of habit of <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> on suicidal behaviour remained a protective factor for suicidal attempts after the adjustment (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Our results illustrate that the physical activity has a marginal effect on suicidal attempts among males only. After adjusting other risk factors, the habit of <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> shows a strong effect on preventing children from having suicidal attempt and also suggests a dose effect for the days of <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast.</b> For a child who skips breakfast for a week would have 1. 7 higher risk of suicidal attempt compared with another child who <b>eats</b> <b>breakfast</b> every day in a week. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

25|$|We do {{know that}} Seleucus managed to defeat Antigonus {{in at least one}} decisive battle. This battle is only {{mentioned}} in Stratagems in War by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus and Antigonus fought for a whole day, but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus' troops slept without their equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and <b>eat</b> <b>breakfast</b> in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus' troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and in disarray and thus easily defeated.

40|$|Objectives To examine school-level {{relationships}} between deprivation and <b>breakfast</b> <b>eating</b> behaviours (<b>breakfast</b> skipping and the healthfulness of foods consumed) in 9 – 11 -year-old schoolchildren {{and to examine}} whether attitudes towards <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> mediated these relationships. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting One hundred and eleven primary schools in Wales. Subjects Year 5 and 6 pupils within the 111 primary schools. Measures were completed by 4314 children. Analysis was conducted at the group (school) level, with each school representing one group. Results Deprivation was positively associated with breakfast skipping and consumption of ‘unhealthy’ items (i. e. sweet snacks, crisps) for breakfast. A significant negative association was found between deprivation and consumption of ‘healthy’ items (i. e. fruit, bread, cereal, milk). Deprivation was significantly inversely associated with attitudes towards <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast.</b> The {{relationships between}} deprivation and (1) breakfast skipping and (2) consumption of ‘healthy’ items for breakfast were mediated by attitudes towards <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast.</b> The hypothesis that attitudes mediated the relationship between deprivation and consumption of ‘unhealthy’ breakfast items was unsupported. Conclusions Deprivation is associated with adverse <b>breakfast</b> <b>eating</b> behaviours amongst children aged 9 – 11 years, in terms of breakfast skipping {{and the quality of}} breakfasts consumed. Socio-economic differences in attitudes towards <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> are apparent amongst this age group, and appear to relate to social gradients in <b>breakfast</b> <b>eating</b> behaviours.
