40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{records of}} a {{population}} of White Leghorns at the Oregon State Agricultural Experiment Station, submitted to accelerated selection for <b>hen-housed</b> egg production on an individual and a family basis at 40 weeks of age for 18 years, were studied. An analysis was made to determine the relative efficiency of accelerated selection compared to direct selection for egg production based on annual records. When annual means of the production line were compared with control populations, accelerated selection proved {{to be effective in}} obtaining genetic gains in <b>hen-housed</b> annual production by increasing the part-year or egg production to February 1 while the residual production remained unchanged. Reliable estimates of genetic parameters obtained from the pooled analysis of the data demonstrated that accelerated selection on the basis of egg production to February 1 is justified and could provide 1. 8 times as much genetic gain per year as would direct selection based on annual records. The half-sib heritability estimates for <b>hen-housed</b> egg production were 14 percent for production to February 1 and 11 percent for annual production. Sexual maturity had an heritability of 27 percent and body weight one of 53 percent. The estimates of heritability for egg weight and egg specific gravity averaged 32 percent and 30 percent, respectively. The full-sib estimates of heritability were generally larger than those based on half-sib estimates, indicating the presence not only of additive genetic variance in the population, but also other sources of variation such as non-additive genetic variance and maternal variance. For this reason, half-sib estimates of heritability are more reliable. The high estimate of genetic correlation, 0. 86, between annual <b>hen-housed</b> egg production and that to February 1 justifies the use of accelerated selection. The positive correlation between residual egg production and that to February 1 indicates that there was no decline in residual production as a result of accelerated selection. Annual egg production seems to have plateaud in the last six generations, possibly due to a reduction in the additive genetic variance as indicated by the negative time trend of the heritability of <b>hen-housed</b> egg production to February 1. The progressive reduction in mortality indicates that the effect of inbreeding caused by restrictions in population number has not been important. Selection indices for annual and production to February 1 were derived from the estimates of genetic parameters. The results of this study demonstrate that accelerated selection for hen -housed egg production at 40 weeks of age or to February 1 has been more effective than direct selection on annual records would have been...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{records of}} a {{population}} of sex-linked dwarf layers at the Oregon State Agricultural Experiment Station subjected to an accelerated selection for <b>hen-housed</b> egg production at 40 weeks of age {{for a period of}} over 11 years were analyzed for selection response, and for the estimation of genetic parameters. The parameters obtained from the study were used to derive selection indexes that might maximize genetic-economic gains in egg production and related traits. The response to selection for increased egg production was positive. The basic trait, <b>hen-housed</b> egg production at 40 weeks, increased significantlv from an average of 24 eggs per bird in 1966 to 108 eggs in 1976. Residual egg production, or net rate of lay, increased from 27 to 109 eggs. The total <b>hen-housed</b> egg production at 68 weeks of age increased, as a correlated response, from 51 to 218 eggs. Sexual maturity improved also as a correlated response to selection on the basis of part-year egg number to a fixed, date. Age at first egg declined from 32 weeks to 21. 7 weeks. In the last generation egg production was comparable to or slightly better than that in some of the commercial control samples. The early egg weight improved by 3. 0 grams when the last population was compared to the initial unselected one. The heritability estimates for egg production index, sexual maturity, and 10 week body weight, all based on the pooled dam component of variance, were higher than the estimates based on the sire components, but the heritability estimates for egg weight were lower. The genetic correlations between body weight, and egg weight measures were positive. The genetic correlations between egg number and egg size measures were negative. The heritability and correlation estimates in the dwarf strain were generally all comparable to those reported in the literature for normal size strains...|$|R

Responses were measured as deviations from replicated, unselected control strains. Realized heritabilities averaged. 17 over the seven generations studied. Selection appeared to be equally effective when based on sire-family means whether sire families were separately housed or intermingled in floor-flock environments. Egg mass, measured as daily grams of egg produced per hen housed, increased as much for the full-year period as for the selection period, which began when pullets were 30 weeks old. Correlated responses occurred in terms of decreased age at sexual maturity, increased egg weight, and increased <b>hen-housed</b> rate of lay. Random genetic drift appeared to influence all traits studied. Relatively spacious floor pens and individual-hen cages were associated with essentially equal overall productivity, but 18 -hen colony cages were stressful as indicated by large reductions in part-and full-year egg mass, <b>hen-housed</b> rate of lay, percentage survival, and by increased age at sexual maturity. Adaptability to specific laying-house environments was not differentially influenced by selection on the basis of sire-family means when families were separately housed or intermingled in floor pens.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{trials of}} 336 days each were run one year apart using a {{commercial}} strain of incrossbred pullets housed at 22 weeks with flock sizes of 7 and 10 birds per cage at a density of 290 cm 2 /bird. The toenails {{were removed from}} the front toes of half of each flock with a hotblade debeaker at 23 weeks of age. These trials were undertaken to learn if removing the toenails near the time of housing would prevent the onset of hysteria later. No hysteria developed in either trial among either the declawed or the intact birds. However, it was determined that declawing significantly improved livability (2. 0 %) in Trial 2, but not in Trial 1, and reflected a significant improvement (1. 7 %) in <b>hen-housed</b> production. The percent large eggs was significantly depressed by declawiing (2. 1 and 3. 7 % in Trials 1 and 2, respectively) while income per square foot (929 cm 2) was increased.

40|$|Abstract: Laying {{performance}} and egg quality characteristics of grower pullets fed raw or processed pigeon pea seed meal diets during grower and layer {{stages of life}} were determined with 135 black Bovan Nera grower (126 days old) pullets. Each raw or processed (toasted for 30 minutes, boiled for 30 minutes, or soaked in water for 24 hours) seeds, which constituted a treatment, were milled. Each treatment had three replicates and nine birds per replicate in a completely randomized design (CRD). The experimental diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Live weight, feed intake, live weight gain, egg production, mortality, external and internal egg quality characteristics were measured. Results showed that there were non-significant (P> 0. 05) differences among the layers fed PSM diets in all the egg production parameters measured, except daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR). However, layers fed boiled PSM diet had the highest hen-day production (67. 64 %), feed intake (105. 57 g/b/d) and <b>hen-housed</b> production (78. 71 %).

40|$|In laying hens, {{behavioral}} responses measured {{late in the}} {{laying period}} are associated with decreased performance. If measured early in the laying period, these behavioral responses {{could be used to}} predict performance later in life. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the association of the behavioral response toward a novel object at 23 wk of age with subsequent performance during the laying period. A total of 1, 251 hens from 6 different pure-bred Rhode Island Red lines (208 hens per line on average) were housed in 318 cages (56 cages per line on average). Performance variables included egg production (both per hen-present and hen-housed); BW at 19, 51, and 69 wk of age; mortality; and feather damage at 63 wk. Hens from cages with an approach response realized greater total egg production (hen-day and <b>hen-housed)</b> and greater egg production in the middle (<b>hen-housed)</b> and end of the laying period (per hen present and hen housed) compared with hens from cages with a passive response toward the novel object. Approach responses were also associated with more feather damage, but not with BW or mortality. Low correlations were found between greater egg production and more feather damage. These results suggest that an approach response toward a novel object measured early in the laying period is associated with better performance later in the laying period. The novel object test early in the laying period can be used to predict subsequent performance, although possible causal mechanisms for this association remain to be investigated...|$|R
