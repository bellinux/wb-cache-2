Cavitation-based therapies including ultrasound-induced sonoporation and laser-induced optoporation {{have led the}} way for novel approaches to provide the potential of sterility and cell selectivity compared with viral or biochemical counterparts. Acoustic streaming, shockwaves and liquid microjets associated with the cavitation dynamics are implicated in gene and drug delivery. These approaches, however, often lead to non-uniform and sporadic molecular uptake that lacks refined spatial control and suffers from a significant loss of cell viability. Here we demonstrate spatially controlled cavitation instigated by laser-induced breakdown of an optically trapped single gold nanoparticle. Our unique approach employs optical tweezers to trap a single nanoparticle, which when irradiated by a nanosecond laser pulse is subject to laser-induced breakdown followed by cavitation. Using this method for laser-induced cavitation, we can gain additional degrees of freedom for the cavitation process - the particle material, its size, and its position relative to cells or tissues.

The results were correlated with histologic examinations at various times during recovery up to 5 d. Moderate HI, induced by right common carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 8 % O 2 for 90 min, produced a cytotoxic edema of 52 +/- 9 % brain volume and depressed the ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate from 1. 43 +/- 0. 21 to 0. 11 +/- 0. 09. Within 1 h of reoxygenation, the edema decreased to 4 +/- 2 % of brain volume, demarcating {{the core of the}} lesion. At 5 h of recovery, a secondary cytotoxic edema together with a newly developing vasogenic edema expanded again, reaching its maximal extent of 45 +/- 10 % brain volume at around 24 h. The ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate recovered slowly, reaching 1. 12 +/- 0. 27 around 13 h. Thereafter it declined again in a manner analogous to the observations made in human newborns after severe perinatal asphyxia, reaching trough values of 0. 48 +/- 0. 22 around 24 h after HI. At the cellular level, the vast majority of neuronal death occurred before 15 h. Subsequently, strong glial activation lasted 2 - 3 d after HI.

Three doses of trandolapril, chronically administered in vivo, were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts subjected to global ischaemia followed by reperfusion. Trandolapril has an anti-ischaemic effect.

Trandolapril increased myocardial bradykinin content (from 31. 8 ± 6. 1 to 54. 8 ± 7. 5 [*]fmol/gww; P< 0. 05, at baseline) and eNOS expression and activity in aortic endothelium (both P< 0. 01 vs control) and in cardiac myocytes (from 11. 3 ± 1. 5 to 17. 0 ± 2. 0 [*]mUOD[*]μg protein− 1 and from 0. 62 ± 0. 05 to 0. 80 ± 0. 06 [*]pmol[*]mg[*]prot− 1 [*]min− 1; both P< 0. 05 vs control).

40|$|In {{this study}} we aim to {{understand}} the dependence of the critical slip weakening distance (Dc) on the final slip (Dtot) during the propagation of a dynamic rupture and the consistency of their inferred correlation. To achieve this goal we have performed a series of numerical tests suitably designed to validate the adopted numerical procedure and to verify the actual capability in measuring Dc. We have retrieved two kinematic rupture histories from spontaneous dynamic rupture models governed by a slip weakening law in which a constant Dc distribution on the fault plane {{as well as a}} constant Dc / Dtot ratio are assumed, respectively. The slip velocity and the shear traction time histories represent the synthetic “real” target data which we aim to reproduce. We use a 3 -D traction-at-split nodes numerical procedure to image the dynamic traction evolution by assuming our modeled slip velocity as a boundary condition on the fault plane. We assume a regularized Yoffe function as source time function in our modeling attempts and we measure the critical slip weakening distance from the inferred traction versus slip curves at each point on the fault. We compare the inferred values with those of the target dynamic models. Our numerical tests show that fitting the slip velocity functions of the target models at each point on the fault plane is not enough to retrieve good traction evolution curves and to obtain reliable measures of Dc. We find that the estimation of Dc is very sensitive to any small variation of the slip velocity function. An artificial correlation between Dc/Dtot is obtained when a fixed shape of slip velocity is assumed on the fault (i. e., constant rise time and constant time for positive acceleration) which differs from that of the target model. We point out that the estimation of fracture <b>energy</b> (<b>breakdown</b> work) on the fault is not affected by biases in measuring Dc...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{buildings}} consume 19 % {{of energy}} in the US as of 2010, and traditionally, their energy use has been optimized through improved equipment efficiency and retrofits. Beyond improved hardware and infrastructure, there exists a tremendous potential in reducing energy use through better monitoring and operation. We present several applications that we developed and deployed to support our thesis that building energy use can be reduced through sensing, monitoring and optimization software that modulates use of building subsystems including HVAC. We focus on HVAC systems as these constitute 48 - 55 % of building energy use. Specifically, in case of sensing, we describe an energy apportionment system that enables us to estimate real-time zonal HVAC power consumption by analyzing existing sensor information. With this <b>energy</b> <b>breakdown,</b> we can measure effectiveness of optimization solutions and identify inefficiencies. Central to energy efficiency improvement is determination of human occupancy in buildings. But this information is often unavailable or expensive to obtain using wide scale sensor deployment. We present our system that infers room level occupancy inexpensively by leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure. Occupancy information can be used not only to directly control HVAC but also to infer state of the building for predictive control. Building energy use is strongly influenced by human behaviors, and timely feedback mechanisms can encourage energy saving behavior. Occupants interact with HVAC using thermostats which has shown to be inadequate for thermal comfort. Building managers are responsible for incorporating energy efficiency measures, but our interviews reveal that they struggle to maintain efficiency due to lack of analytical tools and contextual information. We present our software services that provide energy feedback to occupants and building managers, improves comfort with personalized control and identifies energy wasting faults. For wide scale deployment of such energy saving software, they need to be portable across multiple buildings. However, buildings consist of heterogeneous equipment and use inconsistent naming schema, and developers need extensive domain knowledge to map sensor information to a standard format. To enable portability, we present an active learning algorithm that automates mapping building sensor metadata to a standard naming schema...|$|E

40|$|The energy cost of {{asymmetric}} cryptography, a vital {{component of}} modern secure communications, inhibits its wide spread adoption within the ultra-low energy regimes such as Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Radio Frequency Identification tags (RFIDs). In literature, {{a plethora of}} hardware and software acceleration techniques exists for improving the performance of asymmetric cryptography. However, very {{little attention has been}} focused on the energy efficiency. Therefore, in this dissertation, I explore the design space thoroughly, evaluating proposed hardware acceleration techniques in terms of energy cost and showing how effective they are at reducing the energy per cryptographic operation. To do so, I estimate the energy consumption for six different hardware/software configurations across five levels of security, including both GF(p) and GF(2 ^m) computation. First, we design and evaluate an efficient baseline architecture for pure software-based cryptography, which is centered around a pipelined RISC processor with 256 KB of program ROM and 16 KB of RAM. Then, we augment our processor design with simple, yet beneficial instruction set extensions for GF(p) computation and evaluate the improvement in terms of energy per cryptographic operation compared to the baseline microarchitecture. While examining the <b>energy</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the system, it became clear that fetching instructions from program memory was contributing significantly to the overall energy consumption. Thus, we implement a parameterizable instruction cache and simulate various configurations. We determine that for our working set, the energy-optimal instruction cache is 4 KB, providing a 25 % energy improvement over the baseline architecture for a 192 -bit key-size. Next, we introduce a reconfigurable GF(p) accelerator to our microarchitecture and mea sure the energy per operation against the baseline and the ISA extensions. For ISA extensions, we show between 1. 32 and 1. 45 factor improvement in energy efficiency over baseline, while for full acceleration we demonstrate a 5. 17 to 6. 34 factor improvement. Continuing towards greater efficiency, we investigate the energy efficiency of different arithmetic by first adding GF(2 ^m) instruction set extensions to our processor architecture and comparing them to their GF(p) counterpart. Finally, we design a non-configurable 163 -bit GF(2 ^m) accelerator and perform some initial energy estimates, comparing them with our prior work. In the end, we discuss our ongoing research and make suggestions for future work. The work presented here, along with proposed future work, will aid in bringing asymmetric cryptography within reach of ultra-low energy devices...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{worldwide in}} domestic domain accounts for almost {{one third of}} the total energy consumption so it is important to reduce energy usage in this sector for energy sustainability. The project aims to investigate two domestic energy saving methodologies in domestic sector, namely voltage optimisation and non-intrusive load monitoring. The first method is to address the issues of unnecessarily extra usage of electrical energy caused by excessively high mains voltage. It is achieved via a voltage optimiser to maintain the voltage at a desired constant level. The second method is to make electrical energy usage information more transparent to consumers and identify the potential energy waste caused by misusing energy of devices. This is to be achieved via the methodology of load disaggregation. The mains voltage delivered to individual houses varies constantly depending on the location of the house, the load condition and other factors. The method of installing voltage optimiser in domestic houses to optimise the voltage and reduce energy consumption started from last decade. Most of the existing voltage optimisers do not have very precise voltage control and there is very limit report on the theoretical analysis of them. Therefore, a power electronic based voltage stabiliser for voltage optimisation in domestic house is proposed in this project and an intensive study of proposed voltage stabiliser is carried out in terms of the topology, mathematical modelling and control strategy design. The simulation and experiment results are also presented to verify the proposed voltage stabiliser in this thesis. The current method adopted for analysing energy saving is via comparing the electricity bill of a house before and after the installation of a voltage optimiser. But it is impossible to ensure that the user behaviour and energy usage pattern are exact same in these two cases. The lack of quantitative analysis on energy saving has become a major obstacle to convince people and promote the voltage optimisation in domestic house. This project investigated a method for estimating the energy saving of installing a voltage optimiser in real time. An energy saving algorithm is presented and implemented. A test rig hosting different types of electric loads is established to verify the robustness of this algorithm. The experiment results demonstrate that the presented algorithm can estimate the energy saving achieved by a voltage optimiser in real time with very high accuracy. Non-intrusive load monitoring is to disaggregate the total electricity consumption into individual appliances based on the voltage and current measurement at premise level. Most of the existing approaches require massive training and pre-known dataset to obtain the disaggregated <b>energy</b> <b>breakdown</b> of a house and there is no well accepted approach to monitor the home appliances operation in real time. The project is to explore a new method by which the operations of individual appliances can be monitored in real-time simultaneously. A new load signature is proposed to describe the features of appliances and an event based algorithm is developed in this project. The algorithm is then implemented onto a test rig with 6 different appliances and 11 working modes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to monitor the operations of individual appliances and feedback the information in real time. ...|$|E

Activation of autophagy when nutrients are scarce allows cells to reutilize their own constituents for <b>energy.</b> Besides protein <b>breakdown,</b> autophagy also contributes to the mobilization of diverse cellular energy stores. This recently discovered interplay between autophagy and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism reveals {{the existence of a}} dynamic feedback between autophagy and cellular energy balance...|$|R

The simulations are compared to recent results of time domain spectroscopy. Being able to retrieve higher harmonics {{of the response}} function, nonlinear phenomena in quantum cascade lasers are studied theoretically. For different temperatures, gain is simulated under operating conditions and related to the intensity inside the cavity, showing the degradation of performance with temperature. Resolving the electron densities in <b>energy</b> shows the <b>breakdown</b> of inversion at high intensities...|$|R
