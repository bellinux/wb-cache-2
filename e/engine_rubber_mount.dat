40|$|AbstractAs {{the usage}} of {{vehicles}} has become necessary in every person's life the automotive industries {{are in need of}} reducing the vibration forces to satisfy the customer requirements. The performance and riding comfort of the automobiles are affected due to the vibrating forces. The power plants are the one of the major sources of vibration and these vibrations are caused because of the unbalanced forces from the engine. Engine mounts are identified as the one of the major sources of vibration controllers. In this investigation, modeling and analysis of an <b>engine</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> are done. The mount consists of two mild steel plates and a rubber isolator in between the plates. The modeling and assembly of rubber mount components is done using I-DEAS and finite element structural analysis and numerical investigation are made on the finite element (FE) analysis software ABAQUS. The deformations of rubber mount obtained from FE analysis are used in the Minitab to develop the mathematical model and deformations are obtained with respect to different process parameters. The results obtained from the predicted model are compared with the numerical simulation results...|$|E

50|$|The 835 {{model was}} revised for 1929 and was offered in two sizes {{designated}} the 827 and 837, on 127 in and 137 in wheelbases respectively. The <b>engines</b> were <b>rubber</b> <b>mounted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There were {{numerous}} other design problems which were gradually addressed over the years, although some persisted to the end. [...] The early clutches could not handle the engine torque, {{and two small}} internal pins would shear off, leading to severe slippage (later resolved). The side-stand tended to break off, particularly if the owner insisted on starting the machine on the side-stand, leaving {{a hole in the}} frame beneath the engine, while the center-stand was too short to provide good support for the motorcycle, dragged on the pavement, and tended to break in half (both later improved). The <b>engine</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>mounting</b> system, which isolated the rider from vibration very well, left the engine to its own devices, and it shook like a commercial paint can shaker at idle.|$|R
5000|$|As a chief design {{engineer}} for Chrysler, Skelton {{is credited with}} leading {{the development of a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> system for cars. Directed to develop ideas to reduce motor vibration, Skelton's team conceptualized more than 1,000 separate ideas; the Chrysler team combined the best concepts into a new system known as [...] "floating power." [...] The <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> and other components of the system significantly reduced the transmission of engine vibration to the passenger compartment, thus smoothing the ride. This Skelton/Chrysler engineering innovation spread throughout the automobile industry.|$|R
5000|$|Engine mount {{breakages}} {{were known}} to occur, especially when the car was driven roughly. This problem was particularly evident in the later fuel injected engines, because the increased engine power correspondingly increased the stress on the Camira's <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{included}} a speedometer and trip recorder. To reduce noise and vibration, the <b>engine</b> was <b>rubber</b> <b>mounted,</b> and the pressed steel frame {{was lined with}} soundproofing felt. The water-cooled engine was well silenced, and riders reported that sometimes they only knew the engine was running by checking the ignition light. Carrying capacity was boosted by quickly detachable panniers and a glove compartment {{in front of the}} petrol tank. All this made the MkI LE expensive, however, at £126 compared with the BSA Bantam at £76. The odd looks also meant that it did not appeal to the usual motorcycle buyer.|$|R
50|$|All {{mechanical}} {{systems in the}} real world contain some amount of damping. Damping dissipates energy in the system, which reduces the vibration level which is transmitted at the natural frequency. The fluid in automotive shock absorbers is a kind of damper, as is the inherent damping in elastomeric (<b>rubber)</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tall, {{long-stroke}} motor's vibration tendencies are {{helped by}} large, <b>rubber,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b> One- and two-barrel carburated versions were offered. The two-barrel version, the L11 option, {{also included a}} revised camshaft for a power increase of 20 hp (15 kW). The engine used a 3.501 in bore, 3.625 in stroke and 8:1 compression.|$|R

50|$|Body styles for 1935 {{included}} 2-door business coupe, convertible coupe, roadster coupe, 5-passenger coupe and trunkback sedan. Four-door offerings {{included a}} base sedan and a trunkback sedan. The cars featured Chrysler’s vaunted “Floating Power” <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> which isolated engine vibration from the chassis. Optional features included carpeting {{for the front}} seat area, radio, twin windshield wipers and a heater.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 1924 Chrysler {{included a}} carburetor air filter, high-compression engine, full pressure lubrication inside the engine, and an oil filter, {{at a time}} when most autos came without all these features. Among the innovations in its early years would be the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed. Chrysler pioneered <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> to reduce vibration; Oilite bearings; and superfinishing for shafts.|$|R
50|$|In total, 540 TG&#8239;5s were built, {{with the}} last 40 {{examples}} equipped with Suspendu Amorti ("damped suspension") <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> - a response to Citroën's Moteur Flottant ("floating engine") of 1932. The TG&#8239;5 briefly remained available alongside the new ZC&#8239;2 - as a result, 48 late and still unsold TG&#8239;4 and TG&#8239;5 Nervastellas and Nervasports were rebodied with aerodynamic bodywork much {{like that of the}} succeeding ZC&#8239;2 (and ZD&#8239;2) models, thus forming a sort of intermediate variant.|$|R
5000|$|After {{accepting}} {{his first}} job at Harley-Davidson, Bleustein soon became an [...] "avid biker" [...] Early in his time with the company, he was embarrassed to discover that his new Harley-Davidson Sportster was leaking oil, and this motivated him to redesign the engine to eliminate the oil leak problem. He was responsible for other engineering innovations, including <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> to reduce vibration, redesign of the iconic Harley-Davidson V-twin engine, and introduction of Kevlar drive belts.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as <b>engine</b> balance shafts, <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts,</b> and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|R
5000|$|Erling Poppe’s {{design was}} {{originally}} {{based on a}} captured BMW R75 but so soon {{after the end of}} the war BSA did not want the S series to look too [...] "German", so an in-line OHC, parallel twin was designed instead of a flat twin [...] "across the frame". Serious problems with vibration made the new Sunbeam bikes uncomfortable to ride and the initial production originally sent to South Africa was recalled. The excessive vibration was cured by mounting the engine on two bonded <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The FLT Tour Glide was {{introduced}} in 1979 as a 1980 model. [...] Sold alongside the existing FLH Electra Glide, the FLT had a larger frame with <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts,</b> a five-speed transmission, the [...] engine, and a frame-mounted fairing. In order that the FLT frame, which was larger and heavier than the large and heavy FLH frame, would handle acceptably, the front forks were given radical steering geometry which had them mounted behind the steering head, with the frame behind the steering head being recessed to allow adequate steering lock.|$|R
50|$|The Honda CBX250RS was a {{motorcycle}} first sold by Honda in May 1983 in Japan as their new 250cc sports bike {{with a view}} to replacing the popular CB250RS. The engine was based on the XR series with particular links to the XR350 bottom end, including a six-speed gearbox and the same oil pump. The stroke is also the same, but the bore reduced to bring the capacity down to 249cc. The balance shaft was also discarded, with the <b>engine</b> instead being <b>rubber</b> <b>mounted.</b> Unlike any other XR engine the top was given two camshafts. The bike was also equipped with dual carburettors, only one of which was equipped with a pilot circuit and which open different amounts depending on how much the throttle is twisted.|$|R
5000|$|Compression {{ratio for}} the {{standard}} and optional engine is 8.0:1, as the engine was designed for low-lead and lead-free fuels. The single-barrel carburetor version produces the two-barrel version (RPO L11) produces [...] From 1972, ratings were listed as SAE net. The engine is prone to vibration, which is damped by large <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b> The 1972 Rochester DualJet two-barrel carburetor required an air pump for emission certification and was replaced in 1973 with a Holley-built 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. The 1973 emission control revisions reduced power from the optional engine by , and its noise levels were lowered. A high energy ignition was introduced on 1975 engines.|$|R
50|$|The boxer design also {{provides}} near-perfect vibration mitigation because {{the movement of}} each piston is exactly countered by the corresponding piston in the opposing cylinder bank, {{eliminating the need for}} a counterbalance shaft, and that the movement of the pistons is on a horizontal plane. The only vibration caused by the boxer engine is secondary caused by the cylinders being slightly offset on opposing banks. This vibration, however, is minimal and is largely absorbed by <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b> Torque steer is also reduced with this type of power train layout. This is achieved by having the front driveshafts being of equal weight and length, and extend from the transmission to the front wheels at almost perpendicular from the transmission.|$|R
5000|$|The Kawasaki Versys 650 (codenamed KLE650) is a middleweight motorcycle. It borrows design {{elements}} from dual-sport bikes, standards, adventure tourers and sport bikes; sharing characteristics of all, but not neatly fitting {{into any of}} those categories. [...] The name Versys is a portmanteau of the words versatile and system.It was introduced by Kawasaki to the European and Canadian markets as a 2007 model and to the US market in 2008. [...] A California emissions compliant version was released in 2009. In 2010 new styling {{was applied to the}} headlight and farings and several functional changes made including enlarged mirrors and improved <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts.</b> [...] In 2015, a new model was introduced with a new fairing style that abandoned the older, stacked headlights for the more conventional twin headlight style commonly found on sportbikes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Airmaster, the C-34, {{evolved into}} more advanced {{versions of the}} Airmaster. The C-37 had a wider cabin, improved landing gear and electric flaps. The C-38 had a taller vertical tail, curved main gear legs and a landing flap under the fuselage. [...] Changes common to both the C-37 and C-38 included wider fuselages and landing gear along with <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> to hold the [...] Warner Super Scarab engine. The final revisions of the C-34 were the C-145 and the C-165, of which 80 were built. On these models, the belly flaps added on the C-38 were removed and the overall length of the fuselage was increased. The only difference between the C-145 and C-165 was the engine horsepower, with the latter having an upgraded [...] Warner engine.|$|R
50|$|In January 1924, Walter Chrysler {{launched}} the well-received Chrysler automobile. The Chrysler was a 6-cylinder automobile, {{designed to provide}} customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, but at a more affordable price than they might expect. (Elements of this car are traceable to a prototype which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time. Among the innovations {{in its early years}} were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed, and <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> to reduce vibration.Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{hysteretic}} {{behavior of}} mechanical components permits efficient passive control of mechanical system vibrations but makes response prediction delicate {{due to their}} high non linearity. In this work, the generalized Dahl model is applied to <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> used to support automotive engine cooling module. The general idea is to define an analytical model for the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount,</b> and to implement it into a global finite element model of the engine cooling module. The work presented illustrates the method on a simplified system. The <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> exhibit a non-linear behavior which depends on preload and frequency. Analytical restoring force models are well adapted to simulate their behavior. An experimental investigation was conducted {{in order to identify}} the model parameters. The model considers: two envelop curves (upper and lower) which can be modeled by polynomial functions, a parameter beta that governs the transition between the compression and extension phases of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount.</b> Based on the load-deflection hysteretic loops measured, an automated procedure was realized to extract the polynomial coefficients of the envelop curves and beta. The calculated coefficients are function of the preload and the excitation frequency. Hence, the behavior of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> can predicted versus time. In a second time, the model identified is implemented in a finite element model of a cantilever beam supported by a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> at its free end.

Using the experimentally estimated values of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping, the dynamic response of the tested spring-mass system using a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> as the elastic element can be accurately reproduced. In contrast, it is found that the single degree of freedom (SDOF) ideal spring-mass model using constant stiffness and damping values can only predict the response of the system accurately at resonance but not at non-resonance frequencies.

50|$|The {{mid-engined}} Europa used {{a modified}} version of the Chapman strut. Owing to the need to isolate the engine and transaxle from the chassis in order to reduce noise and vibration, the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> led to an excessive sideways movement of the driveshafts. In this case, sideways location of the hubs was controlled by an enlarged diagonal radius rod to the front. <b>Rubber</b> sandwich <b>mounts</b> were developed that allowed vertical movement whilst controlling lateral movement. Similar vibration problems were encountered with the Elite, but as these only had the vibration of the differential to control rather than engine vibration, it could be managed by suitable design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
