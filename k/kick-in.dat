25|$|In June 2016 a United Nations-backed {{prosecutor}} {{described the}} administration of Pérez Molina to a crime syndicate and outlined another corruption case, this one dubbed Cooperacha (<b>Kick-in).</b> The head of the Social Security Institute and at least five other ministers pooled funds to buy him luxurious gifts such as motorboats, spending over $4.7 million in three years.|$|E
25|$|If {{the ball}} {{goes over the}} goal line or touchline, hits the ceiling, or the play is stopped by the referee, the ball is out of play. If it hits the ceiling of an indoor arena, play is {{restarted}} with a <b>kick-in</b> to the opponents {{of the team that}} last touched the ball, under the place where it hit the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|John Barrymore is {{on stage}} April 19 {{for a week}} in Willard Mack's <b>Kick-In.</b>|$|E
50|$|During <b>kick-ins</b> the ruckman can {{sometimes}} be a designated target. With extra height {{it is difficult for}} opposition players to take marks against them and they are an easier target to spot in a cluster.|$|R
25|$|Centre half-backs {{must have}} a great {{understanding}} of team structures, especially the strategies for <b>kick-ins.</b> They {{need to be able}} to compete and take contested marks, and also run off their opponent to win uncontested possessions and force their opponents to chase.|$|R
50|$|After {{his success}} in 2009, Russell {{continued}} {{to be used in}} two-way roles in the backline, and was a consistent contributor throughout 2010. He played every game, and also assumed responsibility for most of the <b>kick-ins.</b> Russell finished second behind Brownlow Medallist Chris Judd for the John Nicholls Medal.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the ball}} {{goes out of}} bounds from a <b>kick-in</b> without being touched by another player ...|$|E
50|$|If a <b>kick-in</b> {{goes out}} of bounds without being touched by another player, the {{boundary}} umpire will signal out on the full and award a free kick to the opposition, {{whether or not the}} ball has bounced before going out. This is to prevent teams from getting their longest kicker to kick for touch. Kicking to oneself satisfies the <b>kick-in</b> condition, so any further kick taken will be treated normally.|$|E
5000|$|... "So I ran {{straight}} {{towards the}} guy, we're {{all trying to}} get a <b>kick-in</b> at him, take a boot to subdue the guy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speed of Restart:With goal clearances, <b>kick-ins,</b> corner kicks, {{the ball}} must {{be put back}} into play within four seconds. Whenever the goalkeeper {{otherwise}} has possession of the ball in their own half, they also must give up possession of the ball within four seconds once {{they are ready to}} release the ball.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} at Carlton, Bryan was noted for his long, left-foot kicking, and he often assumed {{responsibility}} for <b>kick-ins.</b> In response to this, Carlton fans would always chant [...] "woof!" [...] whenever Bryan kicked the ball; Bryan was the third Carlton player to receive the traditional chant, after Val Perovic in the 1980s and Ang Christou in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Each team {{consists}} of five players, including the goalkeeper and an unlimited number of substitutions, from {{a selection of}} three to five players. Throw-ins and <b>kick-ins</b> mean the pace and flow of the game are much faster than regular football. Shoes are not allowed; players must play in bare feet, although ankle guards are permitted. Goal kicks are taken by the goalkeeper using their hands to throw the ball.|$|R
5000|$|The punt-out, or <b>kick-in,</b> was abolished. In {{the event}} of the ball being kicked into touch, play would restart with a scrum 10 yards infield.|$|E
50|$|Defensive Goal Line Restarts/Touch Line Restarts: The use of {{the foot}} on a Goal kick and the hands on Throw-in is {{reversed}} in futsal with the goal clearance and a <b>kick-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two goal squares, one at {{each end}} of the field, which are 6.4m×9m (7yd×10yd) in front of each goal-face. The line {{parallel}} to the goal line is called the kick-off line. The goal square is the area from which a <b>kick-in</b> can occur.|$|E
5000|$|Taking on and {{matching}} full-forwards like South Melbourne's Bob Pratt (whom Regan regarded as his most difficult opponent), Carlton's Harry Vallence, Richmond's Jack Titus and St Kilda's Bill Mohr, Regan earned his title as the [...] "Prince of Full-backs". He was a magnificent mark and a superb kick. Archival footage shows him using the now defunct drop kick for his <b>kick-ins.</b> In slow motion they demonstrate his perfect balance and timing.|$|R

50|$|Geelong's twenty-three behinds {{included}} eleven rushed behinds by Hawthorn, some {{of which}} were deliberate, and {{some of which}} occurred directly from <b>kick-ins.</b> Hawthorn defenders made a clear effort to rush behinds whenever there was any applied pressure from the Geelong forwards, which was reflected in Geelong's inability to defend against Hawthorn's rebounds. This was one of the major contributing factors to a rule change the following year, prohibiting defenders from conceding rushed behinds unless under immediate pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "7 point play" [...] {{was coined}} by {{commentators}} {{to describe the}} situation where a team {{has been able to}} convert a missed goal (behind) into 7 points by stealing the ball directly from a <b>kick-in</b> and scoring a goal.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>kick-in</b> {{technique}} is the huddle, often used before the zone, which involves {{all of the}} players from the opposition team to the player is kicking in huddling together and then breaking in different directions. The kicker typically aims in whichever direction that the designated target (typically the ruckman) runs in.|$|E
5000|$|In Round 16, Richmond player Joel Bowden {{deliberately}} conceded two behinds {{directly from}} the <b>kick-in,</b> to waste time while protecting his team's four-point lead over Essendon. This was a major motivation for {{the introduction of a}} rule from 2009 that allows the umpire to give award free kick for a deliberate rushed behind.|$|E
2500|$|There is no offside rule nor {{are there}} set {{positions}} in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams may disperse across the whole field {{before the start of}} play. However, a typical on-field structure consists of six forwards, six defenders or [...] "backmen" [...] and six midfielders, usually two wingmen, one centre and three followers, including a ruckman, ruck-rover and rover. Only four players from each team are allowed within the centre square (...) at every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (that is, after a mark or free kick) and during <b>kick-ins</b> following the scoring of a behind.|$|R
50|$|Playbrush's {{technology}} {{consists of}} hardware and software. The hardware is an Internet of Things device {{that has a}} colored TPE rubber part, which attaches to most manual toothbrushes and a white Copolyester (PCT) part that holds an electronics circuit board. The electronics include motion sensors to detect where users are brushing. That motion data is captured and transmitted in real-time to the users smartphone or tablet, where the software <b>kicks-in.</b> Playbrush's algorithm translate the brushing data in interactive games that children control via their brushing movements. In October 2016 Playbrush had four games available, on the Android Play Store and the Apple App Store, called the Utoothia Series. There is also a web-app which parents can use to monitor their children's toothbrushing and share brushing data with dentists.|$|R

50|$|In {{the modern}} game a quick <b>kick-in</b> exists when a behind is scored in a largely vacant forward-line; the rule change (see below) {{means that the}} {{opposition}} cannot man up, and {{the first couple of}} kicks generally come very easily. For non-quick kick-ins, huddles are sometimes used, which require man coverage. Otherwise, zone coverage is most common. Some teams will set their players up 25-50m out from goal, and these teams aim to take a couple of safe short passes to progress 30m down the field, at which stage the field is wider and the downfield options are more free. Other teams set up a longer <b>kick-in,</b> leaving the first 30m largely vacant. Teams who do this will seek to find a 40-50m pass on the lead; if no leads are available, then the player will kick to himself and begin to run into the empty space, forcing the downfield options into a wider area and potentially an easier pass.|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of rock friction under {{the conditions of}} seismic slip in the Earth crust (slip rates {{of the order of}} 1 m/s or more and normal stress of hundreds of MPa) is of paramount importance in earthquake mechanics. Fault friction controls the stress drop, the mechanical work and the frictional heat generated during the slip. However the essential engine of earthquakes is buried at several kilometers depth and only remote, indirect measurements, which are not sufficient to fully characterize fault dynamics, are available. Elucidating constraints are derived from experimental studies performed in powerful apparatuses applying rotary shear motion to rock samples. The experiments indicate that when slip velocities and normal stresses approach those of actual earthquakes, a significant decrease in friction <b>kicks-in</b> (of up to one order of magnitude), which we term fault lubrication, both for cohesive rocks (silicate-built, quartz-built and carbonate-built) and non-cohesive rocks (clay-rich, anhydrite, gypsum and dolomite gouges) typical of crustal seismogenic sources. The available mechanical work and the associated temperature rise in the slipping zone trigger a number of physicochemical processes (gelification, decarbonation and dehydration reactions, melting and so on) whose products are responsible for fault lubrication...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in brain science confirm {{that as a}} race we are in fact a punitive lot. Human beings actually derive pleasure from inflicting punishment on wrongdoers. We are wired {{in such a way}} that the part of our brain that reports pleasure is activated when we punish norm violators. This is even when punishment has no tangible or demonstrable benefits. However, we are not slaves lo our emotions. Another region of our brain 2 ̆ 7 <b>kicks-in</b> 2 ̆ 7 if punishment becomes self-defeating, in that it conflicts with our other interests. The implications of this research for punishment theory and the practice of sentencing are discussed in this paper. The findings give qualified support to the theory known as intrinsic retributivism, but do not suggest it is the soundest theory of punishment. This is because we stop punishing when it comes at a cost to us. The good feeling that punishment invokes in punishers is another consequential consideration in favour of the utilitarian theory of punishment. However, it is not clear that the utilitarian calculus is necessarily affected by the findings. The main implication of the research findings relates to the relevance of public opinion to sentencing practice. The findings support the view that public sentiment, which seems to support increasingly tougher sanctions, can be curtailed of the public are informed that punishment comes of a cost to community. <br /...|$|R
2500|$|After declaring his {{intentions}} {{to play in}} the midfield, Salem retained his spot on the half-back line whilst also playing on the wing and prior to the season, he was labelled as one of the players who could have a breakout season by AFL Media journalist, Ben Guthrie. Entrusted with the <b>kick-ins</b> for the season due to his elite kicking skills, Salem played the first six matches of the season before suffering from a concussion {{as a result of a}} head clash during the thirty-nine point loss against [...] at Etihad Stadium in round six. He returned two weeks later for the thirty-two point loss against the [...] at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. After being omitted the next week and playing for Casey in the VFL, a recurrence of his thyroid issue would see him miss two months of any form of football, and he returned for Casey when he played against [...] in round seventeen of the VFL season. After playing the next three weeks in the VFL, he returned to the senior side for the final match of the year in the 111-point loss against [...] at Simonds Stadium, which saw him finish with eight matches for the season. His time in the VFL saw him qualify for the finals, and he played in the winning preliminary final against [...] in which he was stretchered off in the second quarter after losing consciousness from a tackle where his head hit the ground heavily. He subsequently missed the grand final, in which Casey lost to [...] by thirty-one points at Etihad Stadium.|$|R
50|$|In {{the dying}} moments {{of his first}} game, with the Lions leading by 4 points, McStay over-stepped the goal square when taking a <b>kick-in</b> from full back {{resulting}} in a ball up in the Lions' defensive goal square. Luckily for McStay, the Kangaroos failed to score from the stoppage and the Lions held on to win by 4 points in Jonathan Brown's farewell game.|$|E

50|$|During play in futsal, if the attacking team {{sends the}} ball over the goal line, the goalkeeper restarts the ball through a goal clearance, where they throw the ball to another player outside of the penalty area. When either team sends {{the ball over}} the touch line in futsal, the other team kicks rather than throws the ball back into play in {{what is known as}} a <b>kick-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the sport}} of Australian rules football, a <b>kick-in</b> (sometimes known as a kick-out) occurs when an {{opposition}} team scores a behind, with a defender kicking the ball out from the defensive goalsquare. The team kicking in may elect any one of its players to take the <b>kick-in.</b> The man on the mark stands five metres {{in front of the}} goal square. The player kicking in is given approximately ten to fifteen seconds from when they pick up the ball to take their kick before the umpire will call play-on, at which point the man on the mark may advance. Players kicking in may either kick to a teammate, or kick to themselves to allow themselves to play on. Whichever option is taken, the player must kick from wholly within the white lines of the goal square, even if the umpire has already called play-on for taking too much time - if their foot touches the line of the goal square, then play is stopped and the umpire will bounce the ball at the centre of the kick-off line.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>kick-in</b> {{strategy}} {{would be that}} the team's longest kicker would send the ball as far down the field as possible, resulting in a marking contest; this way, even if an opponent took a contested mark, they would be one long kick plus ten metres away from the goal line, and would be hence unlikely to score. The 1970s saw the birth of the huddle, which pioneered the act of pinpointing a shorter pass to a teammate.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other sports, the huddle {{is a specific}} tactic in Australian football, used by the team kicking in after a behind is scored, or some delayed stoppage. All players in the backline gather together about fifty meters from goal. Then, the players individually lead away from the huddle in all directions. The technique means {{that there will be}} several leading players, making it difficult to defend the first <b>kick-in.</b> It also allows teams to run set plays for the second and third kicks. The huddle was developed during the 1970s, and is still used today by many teams.|$|E
