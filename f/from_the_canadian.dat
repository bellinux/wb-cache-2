5|$|In {{light of}} the {{widespread}} damage, 1,000personnel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> military were brought in for recovery efforts. The military operation, known as Operation Lama, was to last {{for the duration of}} the emergency phase in the immediate aftermath. An initial deployment of 120soldiers and 40vehicles arrived on September25 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Forces Base Gagetown in Oromocto, New Brunswick arrived in Newfoundland. Three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made. Operation Lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings, and simultaneously, emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500mi (900km) of roads in Newfoundland. On September27, government officials stated that it would take months for cleanup efforts to finish. Ten days after the storm, six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction was being made only slowly. Allocation of military aid continued through October6, though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier.|$|E

5|$|The breed gained {{official}} recognition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Kennel Club in January 1980 {{after five}} years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.|$|E
5|$|The record enjoyed similar chart success {{outside of}} the United States. It managed to peak within the top 5 on the charts in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and charted for eight weeks on both of them. It also entered the top 10 on the Japanese and Norwegian albums chart, while it charted {{slightly}} lower in several other countries as well. It was eventually certified three times platinum <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Music Association for shipping 300,000 copies and received a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry for having a shipment of 60,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) with resources <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months after his draft, Johansen signed with Columbus to a three-year, {{entry-level}} contract on September 9, 2010. With a base salary of $900,000, the deal could have reached $1.975 million per year if he achieved all his bonus incentives. Attending his first NHL training camp that month, he {{did not make the}} Blue Jackets roster and was returned to Portland on October 2 for another year of junior hockey. Back in the WHL, Johansen was chosen to represent the league at the 2010 Subway Super Series, a six-game exhibition tournament featuring all-stars <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Hockey League (CHL) against Russian junior players. He completed the 2010–11 season improving to 92 points (40 goals and 52 assists) in 63 games, ranking seventh among league scorers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1951-1952 season, the TSO {{refused to}} renew the {{contracts}} of these musicians, stating that they had not fulfilled their contractual agreements. The six musicians appealed this decision to its union, the Toronto Musicians' Association; the Mayor of Toronto; the Canadian Civil Liberties Association; and many other bodies, without success. They received support from the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts, but not <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Congress of Labour. The incident garnered extensive media coverage in both Canada and the United States, and sparked a protest against the TSO's decision. The orchestra's director, Ernest MacMillan, did not speak about the matter in public, which also prompted criticism, and two members of the TSO board resigned. The six musicians were viewed with suspicion by their colleagues and people avoided them to protect themselves from guilt by association. Budd and Staryk later returned to the TSO, while the four other musicians continued their careers elsewhere.|$|E
