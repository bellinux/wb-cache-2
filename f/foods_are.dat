5|$|Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the {{tradition}} of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, public institutions and many restaurants, including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish. During Passover, bread and other leavened <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> substituted.|$|E

Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

50|$|In {{the era of}} {{foraging}} for food, hunter-gatherers rarely {{knew where}} their next meal would come from. As a result, filling their stomachs up with lots of <b>food</b> <b>was</b> advantageous since <b>food</b> <b>was</b> scarce. Intense consumption of high-energy <b>foods</b> <b>was</b> selected for when the availability of <b>food</b> <b>was</b> low and it was more difficult to find. Now, <b>food</b> <b>is</b> readily available, and the neurological system that once helped people recognize the survival advantages of essential eating has now become disadvantageous as it promotes overeating. This has become especially dangerous after the rise of processed foods, as the popularity of foods that have unnaturally high levels of sugar and fat has significantly increased.|$|R
5|$|A typical day-to-day {{traditional}} {{vegetarian meal}} of Uttar Pradesh, {{like any other}} North Indian thali, consists of roti (flatbread), chawal, dal, sabji, raita and papad. Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter milk) with meals. On festive occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> consumed. A typical festive thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad, raita, salad and desserts (such as sewai or Kheer).|$|E
5|$|Belarusian cuisine {{consists}} {{mainly of}} vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. <b>Foods</b> <b>are</b> usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest {{meal of the}} day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{heritage}} cooking, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, {{has made}} a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society.

Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} summer, the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated. Shavuot marks {{the peak of}} the new grain harvest and the {{ripening}} of the first fruits, and is a time when milk was historically most abundant. To celebrate this holiday, many types of dairy <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> eaten. These include cheeses and yogurts, cheese-based pies and quiches called pashtidot, cheese blintzes, and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese (gvina levana) or cream cheese.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream American cuisine {{is similar}} to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain {{products}} made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These home grown <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E

50|$|Regenerists {{call for}} the {{creation}} of demand on agricultural systems to produce regenerative <b>foods.</b> This <b>is</b> often compared {{to the creation of the}} demand for organic food. Organic foods have a relation to regenerative foods in that regenerative <b>food</b> <b>is</b> all organic, but not all organic <b>food</b> <b>is</b> regenerative. Organic <b>food</b> <b>is</b> not regenerative if the byproduct of the <b>food</b> crop <b>is</b> not a resource for the next seasons crops and if other inputs for the crop did not come from other resources within the farm which it is grown in.|$|R

5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> scarce.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon, and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E

Among other things, our model allows us to ask whether a household’s frequency of purchase influences how much <b>food</b> <b>is</b> bought on any shopping occasion. This was not possible with past studies. We find that, in fact, the more time has elapsed between purchases, the greater the quantity of product a household will buy on its next shopping occasion.
