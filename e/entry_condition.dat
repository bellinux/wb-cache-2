Specifically, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in the initial local unemployment rate is associated with an approximate shortfall in lifetime earnings of 6. 5 %. We also show that bad <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> are associated with lower quality of a worker's first job and that initial wage shortfalls associated with bad <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> only partially evaporate upon involuntary job change. These and additional findings support the view that initial job assignment, in combination with accumulation of occupation or industry-specific human capital while on this first job, {{plays a key role in}} generating the observed wage persistencies...|$|R

50|$|Often {{endogenous}} growth theory assumes constant marginal product of capital at the aggregate level, {{or at least}} that the limit of the marginal product of capital does not tend towards zero. This does not imply that larger firms will be more productive than small ones, because at the firm level the marginal product of capital is still diminishing. Therefore, it is possible to construct {{endogenous growth}} models with perfect competition. However, in many endogenous growth models the assumption of perfect competition is relaxed, and some degree of monopoly power is thought to exist. Generally monopoly power in these models comes from the holding of patents. These are models with two sectors, producers of final output and an R&D sector. The R&D sector develops ideas that they are granted a monopoly power. R&D firms are assumed {{to be able to make}} monopoly profits selling ideas to production firms, but the free <b>entry</b> <b>condition</b> means that these profits are dissipated on R&D spending.|$|E
5000|$|According to David Hooper and Ken Whyld, San Sebastián 1911 was [...] "one of {{the strongest}} five tournaments held up to that time", as all the world's leading players competed except the World Champion, Lasker. At the {{beginning}} of the tournament, Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablanca's participation because he had not fulfilled the <b>entry</b> <b>condition</b> of winning at least third prize in two master tournaments. Capablanca won brilliantly against Bernstein in the very first round, more simply against Nimzowitsch, and astounded the chess world by taking first place, with a score of six wins, one loss and seven draws, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein, Milan Vidmar, Marshall, Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch, et al. His loss, against Rubinstein, {{was one of the most}} brilliant achievements of the latter's career. Some European critics grumbled that Capablanca's style was rather cautious, though he conceded fewer draws than any of the next six finishers in the event. Capablanca was now recognized as a serious contender for the world championship.|$|E
5000|$|The 2004 {{ruling by}} the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{regarding}} transitioned athletes led to a re-examination of rules in many sports. The IOC 2004 Stockholm Consensus, which researchers have criticized as [...] "a measure that polices the traditional gender binary while being disguised as a progressive and inclusive measure," [...] spells out specific requirements for a transitioned athlete. Bagger notes that the USGA policy requires [...] "a signed wavier by the entrant giving complete and unrestricted access to one’s medical records and pre-operative and post-operative psychiatric records." [...] Requirements that are unheard of for other competitors. In September 2004, after continued lobbying by Bagger, the Ladies European Tour voted on amending their membership entry criteria, allowing Bagger to compete on tour. Later that year, the ALPG also voted in favour of changing their constitution to remove the 'female at birth' clause, thus making Bagger eligible to join the ALPG Tour in Australia. On 9 February 2005, the Ladies Golf Union also announced a policy change allowing Bagger {{to compete in the}} Women's British Open. On 21 March 2005, the United States Golf Association announced it has adopted a new 'gender policy' that allows transitioned athletes to compete in USGA golf championships, including the upcoming U.S. Women's Open. In 2010, the LPGA amended their bylaws and removed the 'female at birth' <b>entry</b> <b>condition.</b> Although the various policy changes have enabled transitioned athletes to compete, the policies remain under review. Bagger, along with a few high profile athletes {{and a growing number of}} medical professionals and researchers around the world, continue to lobby the IOC, IAAF, WADA et al. in their approach to embracing the entirety of human diversity and more so, to stop their abuse and targeting of women in sport. Bagger also shares that many of these decisions are made by popular vote of members, ofter professionals in their sport, who are not doctors or medical professionals, and have no relevant medical training.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{conditions}} {{at the time of}} labour market entry can induce wage differentials between workers entering the labour market at different points in time. While there exists much empirical evidence on the existence and persistence of the effects of labour market <b>entry</b> <b>conditions,</b> little is known about their interaction with employees' mobility behaviour. Using German administrative data, this paper analyzes the determinants of job mobility, emphasizing the role of initial wage gaps. The analysis suggests that the effects of <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> {{play an important role in}} explaining job transitions. Labour market entrants earning less than the average starting wage are more likely to change jobs, directly as well as indirectly. Moreover, labour market transitions tend to reduce the effects of <b>entry</b> <b>conditions,</b> implying that job mobility operates as an adjustment mechanism that reduces the initial wage differences between workers...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{thermal analysis}} based on recently defined Saturn <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> has been conducted. The study, using viscous-shock-layer and engineering codes employed for Project Galileo, investigated nonequilibrium chemistry {{effects on the}} Saturn thermal environment, defined the primary heat-transfer mode for heatshield design, delineated some problem areas for future thermal studies, and validated BIRCHES (Blunt Body Inviscid Radiative and Convective Heating Engineering Solutions) for parametric or design studies. The effect of nonequilibrium chemistry appears to significantly influence only the radiative fluxes with effects localized to the stagnation region. However, the heat-transfer mode pertinent to the overall heat-shield design is convection. The convective results of BIRCHES and a detailed code are in good agreement. The resulting mass-loss rates for the currently prescribed nominal Saturn <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> are small {{when compared with the}} values for nominal Jupiter <b>entry</b> <b>conditions.</b> With coupled carbon-phenolic ablation injection, the convective heating rates are reduced substantially while the radiative heating rates are increased when compared with the corresponding no-injection results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. We {{assess the}} effects of {{coaching}} replacements on college football team performance. Methods. Using data from 1997 to 2010, we use matching techniques to compare the performance of football programs that replaced their head coach to those where the coach was retained. The analysis has two major innovations over existing literature. First, we consider how <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> moderate {{the effects of}} coaching replacements. Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects. Results. We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that did not replace their coach. However, for teams with middling records—that is, teams where <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> for a new coach {{appear to be more}} favorable—replacing the head coach appears to result in worse performance over subsequent years than comparable teams who retained their coach. Conclusions. The findings have important implications for our understanding of how <b>entry</b> <b>conditions</b> moderate the effects of leadership succession on team performance, and suggest that the relatively common decision to fire head college football coache...|$|R

Second, under a free <b>entry</b> <b>condition</b> assumption, the lifetime horizon of each variety will be characterized by decreasing prices accompanied by increasing demand levels...|$|E

We use German administrative labor market data to show that the matching function correlation solely based on idiosyncratic productivity and free entry is very close to the empirical matching function. Consequently, we argue that standard matching function estimations are seriously biased if idiosyncratic productivity plays a role for match formation.
