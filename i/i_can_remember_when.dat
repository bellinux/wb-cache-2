60|$|THE SERPENT. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> {{you were}} {{yourself}} {{a thing that}} could not happen. Yet you are.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> {{you were}} not above making love to a pretty girl. You {{certainly}} had me worn to a frazzle--before we became engaged," [...] said Carley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] Tom, who {{had been}} smoking his pipe gravely, began to counsel. [...] "Organized labor's gettin' {{stronger}} every day. Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> there wasn't any unions in California, Look at us now--wages, an' hours, an' everything." ...|$|E
60|$|MAUD. [Clearly and coldly] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> {{occasions}} <b>when</b> your indulgence hurt, father. [She wriggles {{her shoulders}} and back] We never forgot or forgave that.|$|R
60|$|They have a merry custom in Holland {{of keeping}} the railway time twenty minutes ahead of the town time--or is it twenty minutes behind? <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I'm there, and I am not sure now. The Dutchman himself never knows.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Our {{mother died}} before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> and <b>when</b> we were fifteen our father was seized with a {{dangerous}} illness which no spells could cure. Feeling death draw near, he called us to his bedside and took leave {{of us in}} these words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] {{interposed}} Captain Jenness. [...] "They {{used to keep}} Saturday night {{down our}} way, too. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I was a boy. It came pretty hard to begin so soon, {{but it seemed to}} kind of break it, after all, having a night in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderest thou whose are {{the feet}} that have worn away the rock, my Holly?" [...] she asked. [...] "They are mine--even mine own light feet! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> those stairs were fresh and level, but for two {{thousand}} years and more have I gone down hither day by day, and see, my sandals have worn out the solid rock!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will {{certainly}} be a wonderful tour for me," [...] declared Mrs. Laning, who had always been more or less of a home body. [...] "Gracious! Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I used to think a trip of ten or twenty miles on the steam cars was wonderful. Now just to think of our going {{hundreds and hundreds of}} miles in an automobile!" ...|$|E
6000|$|A faint, suggestive glint {{replaced}} the smile in the keen dark eyes. [...] "Then he acts {{on what he}} thinks himself. Though <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>when,</b> it seems to me, senhor, that I have {{had the pleasure of}} meeting you before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, as for that," [...] {{answered}} the yellow hen thoughtfully, [...] "I've clucked and cackled all my life, and never spoken a word before this morning, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> But <b>when</b> you asked a question, a minute ago, {{it seemed the}} most natural thing in the world to answer you. So I spoke, and I seem to keep on speaking, just as you and other human beings do. Strange, isn't it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I want {{to impress}} upon {{you that this}} Rainey's Creek country is level prairie, fine black land, owned by Germans. Gus and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> it was the {{greatest}} country, socially, in the world. The boys and girls who were raised there have proved to be the very highest type of manhood and womanhood. No one ever heard of trouble with the old settlers, that is, between themselves. Then we visited and loved each other and lived peaceably with all mankind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was about}} some property,' said Mrs Edmonstone, 'though I don't know {{the rights of}} it. But the Morvilles were always a fiery, violent race, and the enmity once begun between Sir Hugh and his brother, was kept up, {{generation}} after generation, in a most unjustifiable way. Even <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> the Morvilles of Redclyffe used to be spoken of in our family like a sort of ogres.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now, my dear. They've {{done away}} with all that since we had Jew members. An atheist can go into Parliament now; and I'm told {{that most of them}} are that, or nearly as bad. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> no Papist could sit in Parliament. But they seem to me to be doing away with everything. It's a great comfort to me that Frederic is what he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true. But {{nobody would}} {{understand}} nowadays {{what you meant}} by German-silver; it's perfectly gone out. How ugly it was! A sort of greasy yellowish stuff, always getting worn through; I believe it was made worn through. Aunt Mary had a castor of it, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I was a child; it {{went into the kitchen}} long before I grew up. Would a joke like that console you for the loss of Italy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not since <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> It {{happened}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was only}} a few months old, they tell me. And yet I must remember something, else how could I dream about colours. I see light in my dreams, and colours, but I never see them. I only hear them just as I do when I'm awake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are our masters,' {{answered}} the yard-dog. 'Really {{people who have}} only been in the world one day know very little.' That's the conclusion I have come to. Now I have age and wisdom; I know everyone in the house, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> a time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was not lying here in a cold kennel. Bow-wow!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not stand it!" [...] cried Robinson fiercely; [...] "me {{not stand}} it! By gad! I'm made for it. I just wish I {{had a taste}} of the old life again for a while. And as for innocence! Well, I'll bet you you weren't one-tenth as {{innocent}} as I was; no, nor one-fifth, nor one-third! What a grand old life it was! You'll swear this is a darned lie and refuse to believe it--but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> evenings <b>when</b> I'd have two or three fellows in, and we'd sit round and play pedro by a candle half the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} must be dull if she can't {{stand it}} {{for three weeks}} in the year," [...] said her husband dryly. [...] "But we really cannot open the San Francisco house for her summer vacation, nor can we move from the rancho to a more fashionable locality. Besides, it will do her good to run wild here. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> she wasn't so fastidious. In fact, I was thinking just now how changed she was from the day when we picked her up"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} a most unpleasant occurrence, Professor," [...] agreed {{the master of the}} Hall. [...] "But boys will be boys--you know that as well as I do. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I went to school, I loved to play practical jokes, and they were not always kindly jokes, either. But as for having these boys arrested, or anything of that sort, that, I think, would be going too far. We can punish them enough right here--that is, provided we can find out who they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bless you," [...] {{said the}} lady, [...] "I wasn't {{thinking}} of you, but of Mother Anastasia. It was the happiest news <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I heard {{that she was}} soon to drop that name and all that belonged to it, and to begin a life in which {{she would be a}} woman among her peers, no matter with what sex they happen to be classed. But if she stops short and remains in that miserable House of Martha, the result is bound to be disastrous. If she believes it is necessary to spend her life in protecting Sylvia from your assaults, she is the woman to spend her life in that way." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was during}} the period of the halt at Bloemfontein. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>remember</b> that then and for long {{afterwards}} the consideration which was shown upon this point seemed to those who were at the spot to be exaggerated and absurd. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>when</b> we applied for leave to use the deserted villas to put our sick soldiers into--the hospitals being full--we were told that it could only be done by private treaty with the owners, who were at that time on commando against us. I remember also suggesting that the corrugated-iron fencing round the cricket field should be used for making huts, and being told that it was impossible, as it was private property.|$|R
5000|$|Lincoln {{addresses}} {{the changes to}} his positions and actions regarding emancipation in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges. In that letter, Lincoln states his ethical opposition to slavery, writing, [...] "I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did not so think, and feel. ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling." [...] Lincoln further explained that he had eventually determined that military emancipation and the enlistment of black soldiers were necessary {{for the preservation of}} the Union, which was his responsibility as President.|$|R
60|$|I thought, after {{swallowing}} {{the first}} mouthful, that I would not eat {{any more of}} this cheese. Then {{it occurred to me}} that it was a pity to waste it after having ordered it, and, besides, I might get to like it before I had finished. The taste for most of the good things of this world has to be acquired. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did not like beer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excepting only you," [...] says Sally, {{putting her}} heavy arm very clumsily, but very gently {{at the same}} time, round Mary's feet, and looking hard at the pale, still face on the pillow. [...] "Excepting you, she's the only soul in this house as never swore at me, or give me a hard word that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>When</b> you made puddings on Sundays, and give her half, she always give me a bit. The rest of 'em calls me Dusty Sal. Excepting only you, again, she always called me Sally, as if she knowed me in a {{friendly}} way. I ain't no good here, but I ain't no harm, neither; and I shall take my turn at the sitting up--that's what I shall do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No." [...] Abel {{glanced at}} the house. [...] "Tamzine never likes to be alone o' nights. So I take my {{moonlight}} walks in the garden. The moon's a great friend of mine, master. I've loved her ever since <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>When</b> I was a little lad of eight I fell asleep in the garden one evening and wasn't missed. I woke up alone {{in the night and}} I was most scared to death, master. Lord, what shadows and queer noises there were! I darsn't move. I just sat there quaking, poor small mite. Then all at once I saw the moon looking down at me through the pine boughs, just like an old friend. I was comforted right off. Got up and walked to the house as brave as a lion, looking at her. Goodnight, master. Tell Mary the lilacs'll last another week yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, she's a foul-mouthed woman,' said Jinny of Mrs. Nixon. 'She {{may well}} talk about God's holy house, she had. It's first time she's {{set foot in}} it, ever since she dropped off from being converted. She's a devil and she always was one. Can't you {{remember}} how she treated Bob's children, mother, when we lived down in the Buildings? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I {{was a little girl}} she used to bathe them in the yard, in the cold, so that they shouldn't splash the house. She'd half kill them if they made a mark on the floor, and the language she'd use! And one Saturday I can remember Garry, that was Bob's own girl, she ran off when her stepmother was going to bathe her--ran off without a rag of clothes on--can you remember, mother? And she hid in Smedley's closes--it was the time of mowing-grass--and nobody could find her. She hid out there all night, didn't she, mother? Nobody could find her. My word, there was a talk. They found her on Sunday morning--' ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{condensed}} narrative the astonished Austin {{was told}} {{what had happened}} to himself and the world. The mystery of the dripping lubricators was also explained to him. He listened with an air of deep distrust when told how an amateur had driven his car and with absorbed interest to the few sentences in which our experiences of the sleeping city were recorded. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> his comment <b>when</b> the story was concluded.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> visited London {{at the age}} {{of sixteen}} the first thing I did after housing my luggage was to make a pilgrimage to Macaulay's grave, where he lies in Westminster Abbey, just under the shadow of Addison, and amid the dust of the poets whom he had loved so well. It was the one great object of {{interest}} which London held for me. And so it might well be, when I think of all I owe him. It is not merely the knowledge and the stimulation of fresh interests, but it is the charming gentlemanly tone, the broad, liberal outlook, the general absence of bigotry and of prejudice. My judgment now confirms all that I felt for him then.|$|R
5000|$|Staley {{was raised}} Christian Scientist, but was {{critical}} of religion in his adult life, stating in a 1991 interview: [...] "I have a fascination with how brainwashed people get with religion and how they'll give up their money, their time and their whole life for a cause that they're sure is right, but I'm sure is wrong. I think there's {{a lot of people}} who are scared of life and living and they want to make sure they get to Heaven or whatever. I try to stay away from it as much as <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> was raised in the church until I was 16 and I've disagreed with their beliefs as long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had the choice I chose not to believe in anything apart from myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a pretty}} snuff-box!" [...] he remarked, as I handed him mine, which I am still old-fashioned enough to carry. It {{is a pretty}} old gold box enough, but {{valuable}} to me especially as a relic of an old, old relative, whom I can just remember as a child, when she was very kind to me. [...] "Yes; a pretty box. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> many ladies--most ladies, carried a box--nay, two boxes--tabatiere, and bonbonniere. What lady carries snuff-box now, hey? Suppose your astonishment if a lady in an assembly were to offer you a prise? I can remember a lady with such a box as this, with a tour, {{as we used to}} call it then; with paniers, with a tortoise-shell cane, with the prettiest little high-heeled velvet shoes in the world!--ah! that was a time, that was a time! Ah, Eliza, Eliza, I have thee now in my mind's eye! At Bungay on the Waveney, did I not walk with thee, Eliza? Aha, did I not love thee? Did I not walk with thee then? Do I not see thee still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{no use to}} sit up for them," [...] Mrs. Elmore said, {{when she}} and her husband had come in from calling good wishes and last {{instructions}} after them from the balcony, as their gondola pushed away. [...] "We sha'n't see anything more of them till morning. Now this," [...] she added, [...] "is something like the gayety that people at home are always fancying in Europe. Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I used to imagine that American tourists figured brilliantly in salons and conversazioni, and spent their time in masking and throwing confetti in carnival, and going to balls and opera. I didn't know what American tourists were, then, and how dismally they moped about in hotels and galleries and churches. And I didn't know how stupid Europe was socially,--how perfectly dead and buried it was, especially for young people. It would be fun if things happened so that Lily never found it out! I don't think two offers already,--or three, if you count Rose-Black,--are very bad for any girl; and now this ball, coming right on top of it, where she will see hundreds of handsome officers! Well, she'll never miss Patmos, at this rate, will she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most {{nights are}} beautiful," [...] said Captain Jim. [...] "But I 'low that {{moonlight}} over Four Winds makes me sorter wonder what's left for heaven. The moon's {{a great friend}} of mine, Mistress Blythe. I've loved her ever since <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>When</b> I was a little chap of eight I fell asleep in the garden one evening and wasn't missed. I woke up along {{in the night and}} I was most scared to death. What shadows and queer noises there was! I dursn't move. Jest crouched there quaking, poor small mite. Seemed 's if there weren't anyone in the world but meself and it was mighty big. Then all at once I saw the moon looking down at me through the apple boughs, jest like an old friend. I was comforted right off. Got up and walked to the house as brave as a lion, looking at her. Many's the night I've watched her from the deck of my vessel, on seas far away from here. Why don't you folks tell me to take in the slack of my jaw and go home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A very able man. A very able man indeed. I'm afraid he's {{not popular}} in the office. A little inclined, perhaps, to be hard on mistakes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the time <b>when</b> he was quite different. He and I were fellow clerks in Morton and Blatherwick's. He got on better than I did. A great fellow for getting on. They say he {{is to be the}} Unionist {{candidate}} for Kenningford when the time comes. A great worker, but perhaps not quite the sort of man to be generally popular in an office.' ...|$|R
5000|$|All <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> {{was that}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was {{recording}} [...] "Somewhere in My Heart", {{we were in}} Boston. I was walking around with a Walkman playing Bruce Springsteen all the time. But it was all of his poppy stuff. I got into Springsteen back to front; I started with Born in the USA and Tunnel of Love and worked backward. I still like that period better than the Born to Run stuff, but I guess I {{was just trying to}} come up with something like [...] "Hungry Heart" [...] or something. Just something really strong and catchy.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I sez," [...] said Friesshardt, [...] "is, wot's {{the use of}} us wasting {{our time}} here?" [...] (Friesshardt {{was not a very}} well-educated man, and he did not speak good grammar.) [...] "None of these here people ain't a-going to bow down to that there hat. Of course they ain't. Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the time <b>when</b> this meadow was like a fair--everybody a-shoving and a-jostling one another for elbow-room; and look at it now! It's a desert. That's what it is, a desert. What's the good of us wasting of our time here, I sez. That's what I sez.|$|R
