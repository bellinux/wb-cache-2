5|$|<b>Distant</b> Worlds II: More Music From Final Fantasy was {{a concert}} in the <b>Distant</b> Worlds series {{featuring}} music from Final Fantasy that was performed on June 12, 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden, just as the first <b>Distant</b> Worlds concert was. Arnie Roth returned to the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra with a completely new program presenting more pieces from Final Fantasy. Simultaneously with the concert, a new CD with the same repertoire was released under the name <b>Distant</b> Worlds II: Music From Final Fantasy. The recording {{was done by the}} Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Arnie Roth in January 2010. The name <b>Distant</b> Worlds II only refers to the Stockholm concert; the series itself has continued under the original <b>Distant</b> Worlds name with the new arrangements added to its permanent rotation.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are <b>distant</b> detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a <b>distant</b> orbit and a <b>distant</b> encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, more <b>distant</b> objects recede {{from the}} Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very <b>distant</b> galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most <b>distant</b> objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a <b>distant</b> encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very <b>distant</b> circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a <b>distant</b> encounter with another star.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years <b>distant</b> from Earth and around 133,000 light-years <b>distant</b> from {{the centre of}} the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Four star {{systems are}} known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164light-years <b>distant</b> that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4days. Announced in 2004, {{it was the first}} planet {{discovered}} by the HARPS spectrograph. HD 148156 is a star 168 ± 7 light-years <b>distant.</b> Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun, it was found to have a roughly Jupiter-size planet with an orbital period of 2.8 years. HD 143361 is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20days. HD 142415 is approximately 113light-years <b>distant</b> and has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days.|$|E

5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a <b>distant</b> object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the <b>distant</b> object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a <b>distant</b> object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{observations}} of <b>distant</b> TypeIa supernovae indicated the unexpected result that the Universe seems to undergo an accelerating expansion.|$|E
5|$|New {{developments}} {{since the}} 2000s include {{the recognition of}} short gamma-ray bursts as a separate class (likely from merging neutron stars and not associated with supernovae), the discovery of extended, erratic flaring activity at X-ray wavelengths lasting for many minutes after most GRBs, and {{the discovery of the}} most luminous (GRB 080319B) and the former most <b>distant</b> (GRB 090423) objects in the universe. The most <b>distant</b> known GRB, GRB 090429B, is now the most <b>distant</b> known object in the universe.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study <b>distant</b> galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more <b>distant</b> galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very <b>distant</b> galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly <b>distant</b> galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so <b>distant.</b> However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that <b>distant,</b> they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more <b>distant</b> than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} <b>distant</b> mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the <b>distant</b> mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Within the constellation's borders lie NGC 2419, {{an unusually}} remote {{globular}} cluster; the galaxy NGC 2770, which has hosted three recent Type Ib supernovae; the <b>distant</b> quasar APM 08279+5255, whose light is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing {{effect of a}} foreground galaxy; and the Lynx Supercluster, which was the most <b>distant</b> supercluster known {{at the time of}} its discovery in 1999.|$|E
5|$|A <b>distant</b> {{relative}} of the Moscovite diplomat Pyotr Potemkin (1617-1700), Grigory {{was born in the}} village of Chizhovo near Smolensk into a family of middle-income noble landowners. The family claimed Polish ancestry.|$|E

5|$|<b>Distant</b> Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy Returning Home was {{a concert}} in the <b>Distant</b> Worlds series {{conducted}} by Arnie Roth featuring music composed by Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu from the Final Fantasy series. The concert was performed on November 6 and 7, 2010 in Tokyo, Japan, by the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra with guest performances from vocalists Frances Maya and Susan Calloway, among others. The concert premiered several arrangements from Final Fantasy XIII and XIV, which were then added to the general rotation. The entire 2010 Japan concert was recorded live for a DVD and 2-CD set which was later released on January 19, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Eta Circini is {{a yellow}} giant of {{spectral}} type G8III and magnitude 5.17, located around 276light-years <b>distant,</b> and Zeta Circini is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B3V and magnitude 6.09, located around 1273light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for {{the early}} {{appearance}} of galaxies was found in 2006, when {{it was discovered that}} the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making it the most <b>distant</b> and primordial galaxy yet seen.|$|E
5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with <b>distant</b> space probes, {{it can take}} minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} history of the universe by looking at <b>distant</b> objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision.|$|E
5|$|Further rebellions {{occurred}} in 1287–88 and, more seriously, in 1294, {{under the leadership}} of Madog ap Llywelyn, a <b>distant</b> relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. This last conflict demanded the King's own attention, but in both cases the rebellions were put down.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{predicts that}} the path of light will follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star. This effect was initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or <b>distant</b> quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 581d is {{probably}} too massive {{to be made}} only of rocky material. It may have originally formed on a more <b>distant</b> orbit as an icy planet that then migrated closer to its star.|$|E
5|$|If the Universe were {{contracting}} {{instead of}} expanding, {{we would see}} <b>distant</b> galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.|$|E
5|$|Ilium and its sequel Olympos by Dan Simmons {{are heavily}} {{influenced}} by The Tempest, {{a portion of the}} plot devoted to a re-imagining of The Tempests characters in a <b>distant</b> sci-fi future.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a <b>distant</b> extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too <b>distant</b> {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century further {{expansion}} took place in residential districts increasingly <b>distant</b> from the city centre. Bristol Hippodrome was designed by Frank Matcham, and opened on 16 December 1912.|$|E
