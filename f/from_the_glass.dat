The filmmakers {{had not been}} granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, {{the use of a}} tracking shot through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.|$|E

When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the Resident Evil game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.|$|E

25|$|Glass solders are {{frequently}} used in electronic packaging. CERDIP packagings are an example.

Removal of glass-soldered ceramic covers, e.g., for gaining access to the chip for failure analysis or reverse engineering, is best done by shearing; if this is too risky, the cover is polished away instead.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the glassblowing {{technique}} reached Egypt and {{was described}} in a fragmentary poem printed on papyrus which was dated to 3rd century AD. The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques. The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to the 1st century AD.|$|E

25|$|Surviving {{physical}} evidence, such as blowpipes and molds {{which are}} indicative {{of the presence of}} blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at Avenches in Switzerland. Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> workshop in Mérida of Spain, as well as in Salona in Croatia.|$|E
25|$|Thonemann {{continued}} {{working on}} the idea and began a rigorous programme to explore the basic physics of plasmas in a magnetic field. Starting with linear tubes and mercury gas, {{he found that the}} current tended to expand outward through the plasma until it touched the walls of the container (see skin effect). He countered this with the addition of small electromagnets outside the tube, which pushed back against the current and kept it centred. By 1949, he had moved on <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> tubes to a larger copper torus, in which he was able to demonstrate a stable pinched plasma. Frederick Lindemann and Cockroft visited and were duly impressed.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{materials}} obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> {{were subjected}} to differential thermal analysis and x-ray diffraction. Trends in <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> formation and transformation temperatures are explained by the formation of AlO 4 tetrahedral units and the consequent increase {{in the degree of}} polymerisation. From a kinetic point of view it is suggested that the Al 2 O 3 affects the relative positions of the nucleation and crystal growth temperature ranges until a concentration is reached at which AlO 4 units are themselves able to leave <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> network to form crystalline phase during cooling...|$|R
50|$|During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) <b>the</b> use of <b>glass</b> diversified. <b>The</b> {{introduction}} of <b>glass</b> casting {{in this period}} encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects. <b>The</b> Chinese <b>glass</b> objects <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Warring States period and Han Dynasty vary greatly in chemical composition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> imported <b>glass</b> objects. <b>The</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>from</b> this period contain high levels of barium oxide (BaO) and lead, distinguishing them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soda-lime-silica <b>glasses</b> of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.

25|$|In August 1959, Noyce {{formed at}} Fairchild {{a group to}} develop {{integrated}} circuits. On May 26, 1960, this group, led by Jay Last, produced the first planar integrated circuit. This prototype was not monolithic – two pairs of its transistors were isolated by cutting a groove on the chip, according to the patent by Last. The initial production stages repeated the Hoerni's planar process. Then the 80-micron-thick crystal was glued, face down, to the glass substrate, and additional photolithography was carried on the back surface. Deep etching created a groove down to the front surface. Then the back surface was covered with an epoxy resin, and the chip was separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> substrate.|$|E
25|$|Orville and Wilbur Wright, {{who made}} {{their home in}} Dayton, had flown {{for the first time}} a decade earlier. They were {{developing}} aviation in their workshop and the area around Huffman Prairie adjacent to the planned Huffman Dam. They had meticulously documented the flight efforts by using a camera and had an extensive collection of photographic plates. The flood caused water damage in their workshop, creating cracks and blemishes on these photographic plates. Prints made from the plates prior to the flood were better quality than the prints made after the flood. But they made few prints <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> negatives before 1913 because the Wrights kept evidence of their pioneering work a secret from the public. Those images lost to flood damage were irreplaceable.|$|E
25|$|The {{glass inside}} a {{cylinder}} {{is usually a}} black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using hot cell systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop {{the formation of the}} volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave left circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E
