5|$|In 1836, the Wisconsin Territory {{was formed}} {{from the western}} section of the Michigan Territory. Chapman became the first U.S. Attorney <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> {{territory}} when it was created. He was elected as colonel of the militia in 1836 after moving {{to what is now}} Dubuque, Iowa. Then in 1838, the Iowa Territory was carved from the Wisconsin Territory.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field of urban design. The guidelines <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists. The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the men {{received}} {{permission to}} work for the mental institutions as attendants or psychiatric aides.

By the end of 1945, more than 2000 CPS men worked in 41 institutions in 20 states.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons in mind for the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|In March 1383, Carrouges made a third {{effort to}} expand his family holdings, with the {{purchase}} of the neighbouring fiefs of Cuigny and Plainville from his neighbour Sir Jean de Vauloger. The sale required approval from Count Pierre, who was overlord of both fiefs, but as consequence of the previous legal difficulties Carrouges had caused him, Pierre refused to permit the sale and insisted that Carrouges turn the properties over to him in exchange for a full refund of the original price paid. Carrouges {{had no choice but to}} comply and subsequently blamed Jacques Le Gris' influence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

5|$|A remastered and {{extended}} {{cut of the}} film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015. The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean and the sequence of the Giant's dream. Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film but never finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> version, they were available as deleted storyboards on the 2004 DVD bonus features. They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film. The film's Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016. An official Blu-ray release was available on September 6, 2016. Along with the additional scene, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a nod to Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a joke regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{a series}} of {{newspaper}} supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, Le Petit Vingtième (The Little Twentieth), which subsequently appeared in Le Vingtième Siècle every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> venture, Hergé illustrated L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet), a comic strip authored {{by one of the}} paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus' Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.|$|E
5|$|Mechner's main preoccupation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> storyline {{was keeping}} the {{narrative}} simple and engaging, using his preferred writing style of keeping cutscenes short and working {{as much of}} the story as possible into the gameplay. He also aimed to mix narrative and gameplay genres that might normally clash with one-another. The three main characters he created were the hero (the Prince), the villain (the Vizier) and the love interest and sidekick (Farah). Two non-playable authority figures (the Prince's father Shahraman and the Sultan of Azad) were included to add weight to the Prince's burden as they were transformed into monsters by the Sands. The three artefacts each character used (the Dagger, Farah's medallion and the Vizier's staff) were created to explain their survival of the Sands' release, with the Dagger also becoming integral to gameplay. The Prince's narration was both difficult and satisfying for Mechner. It needed to be written to work on two levels: first to be understandable for first-time players, and to gain greater significance upon future playthroughs. The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player, and expand upon the setting and add depth to the experience. Among his cited reference points for the narration were the 1940s version of The Thief of Bagdad, the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and films such as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The Prince's interactions with Farah were also an important factor. As part of the character interaction, Farah was deliberately designed not to be a perfect archer, sometimes hitting the Prince if he strayed into her line of fire. Despite this, unspecified features planned for her needed to be cut.|$|E
