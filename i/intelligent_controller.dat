The basics of model-free control is now employing some old functional analysis and some elementary differential algebra. The estimation techniques become quite straightforward via a recent online parameter identification approach. The importance of iPIs and especially of iPs is deduced from the presence of friction. The strange industrial ubiquity of classic PID’s and the great difficulty for tuning them in complex situations is deduced, via an elementary sampling, from their connections with iPIDs.

Each access is to one bank, allowing unused banks to be refreshed at the same time. Additionally, each row read out of the active bank is copied to the bank-sized SRAM cache. In the event of repeated accesses to one bank, which would not allow time for refresh cycles, there are two options: either the accesses are all to different rows, in which case all rows will be refreshed automatically, or some rows are accessed repeatedly. In the latter case, the cache provides the data and allows time for an unused row of the active bank to be refreshed.|$|E
