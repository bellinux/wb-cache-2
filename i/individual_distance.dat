5|$|The bee-eaters are diurnal (active by day), {{although}} a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain en route is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so close that they touch (an <b>individual</b> <b>distance</b> of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.|$|E
