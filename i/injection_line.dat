5000|$|Osprey was {{developed}} by Shell in 1989/90 and employs two drill centres, one for production (with 8 subsea trees) and one for water injection (with 4 subsea tress).

50|$|Also, {{operators}} had {{to prepare}} an alternate <b>injection</b> <b>line</b> for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only {{while there is}} sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine; once reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. The normal AC driven Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were {{for the most part}} unavailable due to the loss of ultimate heat sink and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate <b>injection</b> <b>line</b> using a non-emergency system known as the Makeup Water Condensate System to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants. The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure. Operators had to also use the MUWC and the makeup water purification and filtering (MUPF) system to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS. While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression pool cooling and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent. Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} of the two Large Hadron Collider (LHC) <b>injection</b> <b>lines</b> has to fit within tight milestones of the LHC project and of CERN's accelerator activity in general.

It will first serve during the LHC sector test in 2006. Time constraints are also very strong on the {{installation of}} the transfer line from the SPS to LHC point 2 (for the clockwise LHC ring) : its tunnel is the sole access for the LHC cryo-magnets and {{a large part of the}} beam line can only be installed once practically all LHC cryo-magnets are in place.

40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} of perforated panels {{placed in the}} <b>injection</b> <b>line</b> of a turbulent swirled burner is investigated as a passive control solution for combustion instabilities. Perforated panels backed by a cavity are widely used as acoustic liners, mostly in the hot gas region of combustion chambers to reduce pure tone noises. This paper focuses on the implementation of this technology in the <b>injection</b> <b>line</b> of a burner. The system is used to control the inlet acoustic reﬂection coefficient of the burner to stabilize the combustion. This method is shown to be particularly efficient because high acoustic ﬂuxes issued from the combustion region are concentrated on a small surface area in the <b>injection</b> <b>line.</b> Theoretical results are used to design two types of perforated plates featuring similar acoustic damping properties when submitted to low amplitude pressure ﬂuctuations (linear regime). Their behaviors nonetheless largely differ when facing large pressure ﬂuctuations levels (non linear regime) typical of those encountered during self-sustained combustion oscillations. Design criteria are given to control the reﬂection coefficient of perforated panels submitted to high pressure ﬂuctuations levels and damp thermo-acoustic oscillations. While developed on a labora- tory scale swirled combustor, this method is more general and could easily be adapted to practical combustors...|$|E

40|$|Background Appropriate {{indications}} for radiologic {{evaluation of}} central venous ports {{are not fully}} understood. We aimed to quantitatively assess the utility of clinical history and imaging {{in the evaluation of}} malfunctioning central venous ports. Methods Clinical history, plain radiographs, and <b>line</b> <b>injections</b> intended to evaluate central venous port malfunction in 153 consecutive cases over a nearly 4 -year period were retrospectively reviewed by 2 radiologists. Radiographs and <b>line</b> <b>injections</b> were separately categorized as normal or abnormal, and a consensus was reached on the final imaging diagnosis. The likelihood of a port-related abnormality necessitating immediate intervention was determined for all represented combinations of clinical history, radiographic findings, and <b>line</b> <b>injection</b> results. Results A radiologic diagnosis was made in 96. 1 % of cases; 19. 7 % of these diagnoses were classified as critical, requiring prompt intervention. Very low risk histories had a 0. 0 % incidence of critical port abnormalities in our cohort, regardless of imaging findings. Low risk histories had a 10. 5 % incidence of a critical abnormality and were best evaluated either by <b>line</b> <b>injection,</b> either directly or following an abnormal chest radiograph. Intermediate and high risk histories were associated with a 30. 5 % and 61. 1 % incidence of critical port abnormalities, respectively, and were best evaluated by <b>line</b> <b>injection</b> without preceding chest radiograph. Conclusions There are several scenarios in which imaging does not meaningfully affect management of malfunctioning central venous ports. Recognizing these inefficiencies may allow for more appropriate and cost-effective use of radiographs and <b>line</b> <b>injections</b> to evaluate the cause of port malfunction. © 2014, ASSOCIATION FOR VASCULAR ACCESS.
