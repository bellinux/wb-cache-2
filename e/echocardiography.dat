5|$|Lanang and Oya Polyclinics {{are located}} in Sibu. There are also five 1Malaysia clinics in Sibu. The Bandong 1Malaysia clinic became the first 1Malaysia Clinic {{nationwide}} to offer <b>echocardiography</b> screening.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (<b>echocardiography),</b> angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. <b>Echocardiography</b> can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical <b>echocardiography</b> report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and <b>echocardiography</b> may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain {{on the right side}} of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Echocardiography</b> is {{performed}} by cardiac sonographers, cardiac physiologists (UK), or physicians trained in <b>echocardiography.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Echocardiography</b> {{produces}} a real-time {{image of the}} heart via ultrasound imaging, and can be performed {{in two or three}} dimensions. There are two ways of performing <b>echocardiography</b> depending on placement of <b>echocardiography</b> probe: transthoracic or transesophageal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Echocardiography</b> {{can help}} detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress <b>echocardiography</b> {{may also help}} {{determine}} whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to <b>echocardiography</b> {{is that it is}} not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.|$|E
25|$|Three-dimensional <b>echocardiography</b> (also {{known as}} four-dimensional <b>echocardiography</b> when {{the picture is}} moving) is now possible, using a matrix array {{ultrasound}} probe and an appropriate processing system. This enables detailed anatomical assessment of cardiac pathology, particularly valvular defects, and cardiomyopathies. The ability to slice the virtual heart in infinite planes in an anatomically appropriate manner and to reconstruct three-dimensional images of anatomic structures make it unique for {{the understanding of the}} congenitally malformed heart. Real-time three-dimensional <b>echocardiography</b> can be used to guide the location of bioptomes during right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, placement of catheter-delivered valvular devices, and in many other intraoperative assessments.|$|E
25|$|The American Society of <b>Echocardiography</b> (ASE) is a {{professional}} organization made up of physicians, sonographers, nurses, and scientists involved {{in the field of}} <b>echocardiography.</b> One of the most important rolls that the ASE plays is providing their recommendations through the ASE Guidelines and Standards providing a resource and educational opportunities for sonographers and physicians in the field.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantification}} of MI usually employs imaging studies such as <b>echocardiography</b> or {{magnetic resonance}} angiography of the heart.|$|E
25|$|<b>Echocardiography</b> {{can be used}} {{to detect}} the number and size of gas bubbles in {{the right side of the}} heart.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{non-invasive}} bubble detection include two-dimensional <b>echocardiography,</b> but Doppler {{appears to be}} more sensitive and picks up smaller bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{that have}} been used to assess the regurgitant {{fraction}} in mitral regurgitation include <b>echocardiography,</b> cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{accreditation}} {{is regulated}} by the British Society of <b>Echocardiography.</b> Accredited radiographers, sonographers, or other professionals are required to mandatorily pass an exam.|$|E
25|$|In transthoracic <b>echocardiography,</b> an atrial septal defect {{may be seen}} on color {{flow imaging}} as a jet of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium.|$|E
25|$|Angiography was {{historically}} used {{to detect}} coronary artery aneurysms, and remains {{the gold standard for}} their detection, but is rarely used today unless coronary artery aneurysms have already been detected by <b>echocardiography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{dimensional}} imaging {{can provide}} a cross-sectional view along a single plane of all four chambers of the heart, and therefore, unlike Doppler, which assesses blood prior to primary filtration by the lungs, can also assess blood which will be circulated systemically. <b>Echocardiography</b> equipment has developed from bulky laboratory equipment to portable battery-powered with sufficient resolution suitable for field studies. Transthoracic <b>echocardiography</b> is suitable for the sampling used in decompression studies to identify highly reflective gas bubbles. Detection of venous gas bubbles by ultrasound imaging is a sensitive, but not specific, predictor of adverse effects of decompression, similar to the published relationship between Doppler detected bubbles and decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac MRI is {{complementary}} {{to other}} imaging techniques, such as <b>echocardiography,</b> cardiac CT, and nuclear medicine. Its applications include assessment of myocardial ischemia and viability, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, iron overload, vascular diseases, and congenital heart disease.|$|E
25|$|An echocardiogram, often {{referred}} to as a cardiac echo or simply an echo, is a sonogram of the heart. (It is not abbreviated as ECG, because that is an abbreviation for an electrocardiogram.) <b>Echocardiography</b> uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.|$|E
25|$|This {{fellowship}} {{consists of}} at least eight months of adult Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, one month dedicated to transesophageal <b>echocardiography,</b> one month in cardiothoracic intensive care unit and two months of elective rotation which includes inpatient or outpatient cardiology or pulmonary medicine, invasive cardiology, medical or surgical critical care and extracorporeal perfusion technology.|$|E
25|$|Non-invasive <b>echocardiography</b> and pulse-wave {{cardiac output}} {{monitoring}} are concordant with (and much safer) {{if not better}} than invasive methods defining right and left heart performance. The advent of MRSA and similar hospital based catheter infections now clearly limits the utility {{of this type of}} invasive cardiac ICU intervention.|$|E
25|$|Regurgitation {{through the}} aortic valve, if marked, is {{sometimes}} audible to a practiced ear {{with a high}} quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope. Generally, {{this is a very}} rarely heard murmur, even though aortic valve regurgitation is not so rare. Aortic regurgitation, though obvious using <b>echocardiography</b> visualization, usually does not produce an audible murmur.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} echocardiogram is {{also known}} as a transthoracic echocardiogram, or cardiac ultrasound. In this case, the <b>echocardiography</b> transducer (or probe) is placed on the chest wall (or thorax) of the subject, and images are taken through the chest wall. This is a noninvasive, highly accurate, and quick assessment of the overall health of the heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{appearance of}} the right ventricle on <b>echocardiography</b> {{is referred to as}} the McConnell's sign. This is the finding of akinesia of the mid-free wall but a normal motion of the apex. This phenomenon has a 77% sensitivity and a 94% specificity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in the setting of right ventricular dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|The transesophageal {{echocardiogram}} (TEE) is {{a relatively}} good test in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97%. It has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected aortic dissection. It {{is a relatively}} noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the <b>echocardiography</b> probe. It is especially good {{in the evaluation of}} AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal <b>echocardiography</b> for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the aortic arch), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the stomach. A TEE may be technically difficult to perform in individuals with esophageal strictures or varices.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{invasive}} procedures {{completed by}} the cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellows include {{but are not limited}} to arterial line placement (femoral, axillary, brachial, radial), central venous cannulation (internal juggular, femoral, subclavian), pulmonary artery catheter placement, transvenous pacemaker placement, thoracic epidural analgesia, fiberoptic endotracheal tube placement, 2D/3D transesophageal <b>echocardiography,</b> intraspinal drainage placement, and advanced ultrasound guidance of vascular access.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} overuse of <b>echocardiography</b> when not {{indicated}} {{is the use}} of routine testing in response to a patient diagnosis of mild valvular heart disease. In this case, patients are often asymptomatic for years before the onset of deterioration and the results of the echocardiogram would not result in a change in care without other change in clinical status.|$|E
25|$|Alumni {{and faculty}} of Lund University are {{associated}} with, among other things: {{the creation of}} the first implantable pacemaker, the development of <b>echocardiography,</b> the spread of modern physiotherapy, the discovery of the role of dopamine as an independent neurotransmitter, the determination of the number of chromosomes of man, the establishment of osseointegration, the development of the Bluetooth technology, and {{the creation of the}} Rydberg formula.|$|E
25|$|The TEE {{has much}} better {{visualization}} {{of the left}} atrial appendage than transthoracic <b>echocardiography.</b> This structure, located in the left atrium, {{is the place where}} a blood clot forms in more than 90% of cases in non-valvular (or non-rheumatic) atrial fibrillation. TEE has a high sensitivity for locating thrombi in this area and can also detect sluggish bloodflow in this area that is suggestive of blood clot formation.|$|E
25|$|As the Duke {{criteria}} {{rely heavily}} {{on the results of}} <b>echocardiography,</b> research has addressed when to order an echocardiogram by using signs and symptoms to predict occult endocarditis among patients with intravenous drug abuse and among non drug-abusing patients. Unfortunately, this research is over 20 years old and it is possible that changes in the epidemiology of endocarditis and bacteria such as staphylococci make the following estimates incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Health {{societies}} {{recommend the}} use of <b>echocardiography</b> for initial diagnosis when {{a change in the}} patient's clinical status occurs and when new data from an echocardiogram would result in the physician changing the patient's care. Health societies do not recommend routine testing when the patient has no change in clinical status or when a physician is unlikely to change care for the patient {{based on the results of}} testing.|$|E
25|$|Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of {{striated}} muscle. A cardiac rhabdomyoma can {{be discovered}} using <b>echocardiography</b> in around 50% {{of people with}} TSC. However, the incidence in the newborn may {{be as high as}} 90% and in adults as low as 20%. These tumors grow {{during the second half of}} pregnancy and regress after birth. Many disappear entirely; alternatively, the tumor size remains constant as the heart grows, which has much the same effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{school is}} a pioneer in cancer, immunology, alcohol, neuroscience, and {{diabetes}} research (see section below). Notably, some of its recent research discoveries that have received international acclaim include a curative therapy in testicular cancer used to treat patient Lance Armstrong, the development of <b>echocardiography,</b> several genes linked to Alzheimer's, and creation of inner ear sensory cells from pluripotent stem cells. The IU School of Medicine {{is home to the}} Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, an NCI—designated Clinical Cancer Center.|$|E
25|$|In {{massive and}} submassive PE, {{dysfunction}} {{of the right}} side of the heart may be seen on <b>echocardiography,</b> an indication that the pulmonary artery is severely obstructed and the right ventricle, a low-pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure. Some studies (see below) suggest that this finding may be an indication for thrombolysis. Not every person with a (suspected) pulmonary embolism requires an echocardiogram, but elevations in cardiac troponins or brain natriuretic peptide may indicate heart strain and warrant an echocardiogram, and be important in prognosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Echocardiography</b> {{has become}} {{routinely}} {{used in the}} diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It {{is one of the}} most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).|$|E
25|$|Recognized as the “Father of Echocardiography”, the Swedish {{physician}} Inge Edler (1911-2001), {{a graduate}} of Lund University, {{was the first of}} his profession to apply in diagnosing cardiac disease ultrasonic pulse echo imaging technique, which the acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone had developed to detect defects in metal castings. In fact, Dr. Edler in 1953 produced the first echocardiographs using an industrial Firestone-Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope. In developing <b>echocardiography,</b> Edler worked with the physicist Carl Hellmuth Hertz, the son of the Nobel laureate Gustav Hertz and grandnephew of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz.|$|E
25|$|Physiologically, {{increased}} pressure in utero, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because {{the heart is}} located behind the sternum, and because individuals with pectus excavatum {{have been shown to}} have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum. While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function, no consensus has been reached based on newer physiological tests such as <b>echocardiography</b> of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function. Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery; A 2013 meta-analysis yielded conflicting results.|$|E
