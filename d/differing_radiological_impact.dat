40|$|When {{assessing}} the <b>radiological</b> <b>impacts</b> of radioactive waste disposal, irrigation using groundwater contaminated with releases from the disposal {{system is a}} principal means of crop and soil contamination. In spite of their importance for <b>radiological</b> <b>impact</b> assessments, irrigation data are scarce and often associated with considerable uncertainty for several reasons including limited obligation to measure groundwater abstraction and differences in measuring methodologies. Further uncertainty arises from environmental (e. g. climate and landscape) change likely to occur during the assessment long time frame. In this paper, we derive irrigation data using the crop growth AquaCrop model relevant {{to a range of}} climates, soils and crops for use in <b>radiological</b> <b>impact</b> assessments. The AquaCrop estimates were compared with actual irrigation data reported in the literature and with estimates obtained from simple empirical methods proposed for use in <b>radiological</b> <b>impact</b> assessments. Further, the AquaCrop irrigation data were analysed using mixed effects modelling to investigate the effects of climate, soil and crop type on the irrigation requirement. Irrigation estimates from all models were within a reasonable range of the measured values. The AquaCrop estimates, however, were at the higher end of the range and higher than those from the empirical methods. Nevertheless, they may be more appropriate for conservative radiological assessments. The use of mixed effects modelling allowed for the characterisation of crop-specific variability in the irrigation data, and in contrast to the empirical methods, the AquaCrop and the mixed effects models accounted for the soil effect on the irrigation requirement. The approach presented in this paper is relevant for obtaining irrigation data for a specific site under different climatic conditions as well as for generic dose assessments. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} most comprehensive analyses of irrigation data in the context of <b>radiological</b> <b>impact</b> assessment currently available...|$|R

40|$|Questions {{relating}} to the transport of radioactive materials are very much an issue of current interest due to the increasing mobility of the materials involved in the nuclear fuel cycle, commitment to the environment, the safety and protection of persons and the corresponding regulatory legal framework.

Thus, by determining the level of radiation at a distance of one metre from the transport vehicle and by selecting a route, the associated impacts will be obtained, such as the affected populations, the dose received by the most highly exposed individual, the overall <b>radiological</b> <b>impact,</b> the doses received by the population along the route and the possible detriment to their health.

40|$|Abstract Assessments of <b>radiological</b> <b>impacts</b> {{on humans}} and other biota from {{potential}} releases to the biosphere {{from a deep}} geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel are associated with several challenges. Releases, if any, will likely occur in a far future and to an environment that will have experienced substantial transformations. Such releases would occur over very long periods during which environmental conditions will vary continuously due to climate change and ecosystem succession. Assessments of <b>radiological</b> <b>impacts</b> must therefore be based on simu-lations using models that can describe the transport and accumulation of radionuclides for a large variety of envi-ronmental conditions.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades there has been some {{discussion}} concerning the increase of the natural background radiation originated by coal-fired power plants, due to the uranium and thorium content present in combustion ashes. The radioactive decay products of uranium and thorium, such as radium, radon, polonium, bismuth and lead, are also released in addition to a significant amount of 40 K. Since the measurement of radioactive elements released by the gaseous emissions of coal power plants is not compulsory, there is a gap of information concerning this situation. Consequently, the prediction of dispersion and mobility of these elements in the environment, after their release, is based on limited data and the <b>radiological</b> <b>impact</b> from the exposure to these radioactive elements is unknown.

The long-term target impact of HLW repositories is projected not to exceed one tenth of the background, natural radioactivity.

The areas under observations are 31 former classical underground uranium mining and exploratory sites in Bulgaria, named as objects. The extraction and processing of uranium ores in the Republic of Bulgaria were ended in 1992. To assess the <b>radiological</b> <b>impact</b> of radionuclides field expeditions were performed to sample water and bottom sediment.

The range of uranium concentration in water flowing from the mining sites was from 0. 012 to 6. 8 mgU l − 1 with a geometric mean of 0. 192 mgU l. The uranium concentrations in water downstream the mining sites were approximately 3 times higher than the background value (upstream). The concentrations of U nat, 226 Ra, 210 Pb, and 232 Th in the sediment of downstream river were higher than those upstream by 3. 4, 2. 6, 2, and 1. 7 times, respectively.
