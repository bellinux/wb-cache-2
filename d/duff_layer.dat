5000|$|Heterobasidion irregulare causes both {{above and}} below-ground {{symptoms}}. Above-ground symptoms of infected trees consist of reduced height growth, patches of dead and declining trees, wind-thrown trees, reduced shoot and diameter growth, and resin-soaking {{at the root}} collar. Additionally, the crown may become thin and foliage (leaves or needles) becomes chlorotic. The characteristic symptom of most tree root disease, including this type, is a disease center. This occurs when the fungus has infected one tree and then spreads through the roots to other trees and kills them too. This creates a pattern of old dead trees {{in the center of}} the pocket and progressively newer dead, chlorotic, then healthy trees, usually in a circular area. Below-ground symptoms of H. irregulare include excessive pitch production, stringy, white root decay, and root lesions. Signs include the formation of white mycelia between bark scales followed by conks (fruit bodies) that usually form in the <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> at the base of the tree or stump. The fruit bodies can also form as [...] "foam" [...] on the ground rising from roots under the surface.|$|E
50|$|There is {{continuing}} disagreement regarding ground cover within 30 ft of structures. In certain cases, TRPA regulations require ground cover to provide protection from soil erosion on disturbed soil. Ground cover may often be lawn or other landscaping, however site-specific native vegetation, or naturally occurring forest litter {{such as a}} thin layer of pine needles or wood chips is generally the environmentally preferable alternative, and is more cost-effective and easier to maintain. While some groups argue that utilizing pine needles and wood chips as ground cover up to the 30 foot perimeter of a structure is a violation of California Public Resources Code 4291 requiring defensible space in California, a ½ to 1 in covering of forest litter (<b>duff</b> <b>layer)</b> is not sufficient to carry a flame intense enough to burn structures from a distance of 30 ft away. Regardless, TRPA staff and local fire groups are investigating possible non-flammable or flame-retardant alternatives to provide both soil protection and fire prevention. In addition, TRPA staff and Board members are working with the local fire protection districts to simplify procedures for homeowners to implement defensible space requirements around their homes, and eliminate confusion and possible conflicts regarding TRPA erosion control requirements and defensible space requirements, and to ease restrictions on use of heavy machinery in sensitive areas near communities.|$|E
5000|$|J. Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.|$|E
30|$|Over {{the long}} term, process-based duff {{consumption}} models {{would be expected}} to provide a point of comparison for CONSUME (Ottmar et al. 1993) and would have greater potential to provide predictions where field measurements have not been conducted. Rein (2009) indicates that the severe lack of published thermophysical properties of materials constituting <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> is an impediment to future process-based duff combustion modeling.|$|R
40|$|We present pre-burn biomass and {{consumption}} data from 60 prescribed burns {{in the southeastern}} and western United States. The datasets include pre-burn biomass in Mg/ha by fuel category: herbaceous fuels, shrubs, 1 -hr, 10 -hr, 100 -hr, 1000 -hr, 10, 000 -hr, and > 10, 000 -hr downed wood, litter and duff. Pre-burn depth (cm) and reduction (cm) are provided for litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers.</b> Day-of-burn fuel moistures and weather are also listed by site...|$|R
50|$|Intact soils harbor many life-forms {{that rely}} on them. Intact soils {{generally}} have very well-defined horizons, or soil profiles. Different organisms may need certain well-defined soil horizons in order to live, while many trees need well-structured soils free of disturbance in order to thrive. Some herbaceous plants in northern hardwood forests must have thick <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> (which {{are part of the}} soil profile). Fungal ecosystems are essential for efficient in-situ recycling of nutrients back into the entire ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|Tricholoma matsutake - = syn. T. nauseosum, {{the rare}} red pine {{mushroom}} {{that has a}} very fine aroma. Its fragrance is both sweet and spicy. They grow under trees and are usually concealed under fallen leaves and the <b>duff</b> <b>layer.</b> It forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of {{a limited number of}} tree species. In Japan it is most commonly associated with Japanese red pine. However, in the Pacific Northwest it is found in coniferous forests of Douglas fir, noble fir, sugar pine, and Ponderosa pine. Farther south, it is also associated with hardwoods, namely tanoak and madrone forests. The Pacific Northwest and other similar temperate regions along the Pacific Rim also hold great habitat producing these and other quality wild mushrooms. In 1999, N. Bergius and E. Danell reported that Swedish (Tricholoma nauseosum) and Japanese matsutake (T. matsutake) are the same species. The report caused the increased import from Northern Europe to Japan because of the comparable flavor and taste. Matsutake are difficult to find and are therefore very expensive. Moreover, domestic productions of Matsutake in Japan have been sharply reduced over the last fifty years due to a pine nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, and it has influenced the price a great deal. The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan has since further decreased. The price for matsutake in the Japanese market is highly dependent on quality, availability and origin. The Japanese matsutake {{at the beginning of the}} season, which is the highest grade, can go up to $2000 per kilogram, while the average value for imported matsutake from China, Europe, and the United States is only about $90 per kilogram.|$|E
30|$|First Order Fire Effects Model. The {{soil heating}} module within the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) (Reinhardt 2003, {{based on the}} work of Campbell et al. 1995) is the only {{well-developed}} model for predicting soil heating under a range of burning conditions and fuel types (e.g., Choczynska and Johnson 2009). Using user-selected inputs or default values, it predicts mineral soil heating in two situations: when there is no surface <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> and when a surface <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> is present (D.M. Jimenez, Forest Service, unpublished report). When there is no <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> the heat source is calculated from the consumption of coarse woody debris. For soil covered by a <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> the heat source is the burning <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> modified by the amount of heat absorbed by unburned duff. However, FOFEM currently does not model the insulating effects of a thick, unconsumed <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> or the heating caused by a combination of duff and woody debris consumption. The weakest link in making accurate predictions of soil heating is uncertainty in predictions of the extent and spatial variability in fuel consumption, particularly duff (Butler and Dickinson 2010). Furthermore, FOFEM is a stand-level model. Its ability to resolve fine spatial detail related to the heating of highly variable soils and surface fuel conditions, such as open stands of ponderosa pine or juniper resulting from encroachment into shrub and grasslands with discontinuous litter and duff layers, is limited (Massman et al. 2010). It is also not known if the FOFEM soil heating model will apply in arid and semi-arid shrub communities.|$|E
30|$|None of the {{variables}} tested {{were significantly associated with}} percentages of seed in the duff, upper soil, or lower soil layers (analyses not shown). The only variable that approached significance was shrub cover, with a trend toward a higher percentage of shrub seed found in the <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> at collection locations with a greater cover of shrubs.|$|E
30|$|The study {{site was}} the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot (YFDP), a 25.6 ha study area {{situated}} at 1860 m elevation near Crane Flat in Yosemite National Park, California, USA (Lutz et al. 2012). Trees ≥ 1 cm dbh had been tagged, mapped, and measured using permanent monuments, providing {{a foundation of}} data for related studies. Fire has been excluded from the study site for at least 80 years, allowing deep litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> to accumulate (Lutz et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|We {{also used}} mixed-model {{analyses}} of variance to investigate whether {{the depth of the}} seed bank was associated with stand age, stand structure, or site environment variables. Percentage of seed in the <b>duff</b> <b>layers,</b> percentage of seed in the upper (0 cm to 4 cm) layer of soil, and percentage of seed in the lower (4 cm to 10 cm) layer of soil were dependent variables, with the same explanatory variables described above (except using total shrub cover rather than cover by genus).|$|R
30|$|Fuel {{consumption}} also {{varied by}} fuel type and fuel strata. For example, when estimating total downed woody fuel consumption, Consume estimated {{a higher rate}} of consumption in the more open forests, grasslands, and shrublands located in the west and southwest portion of the Tripod Fire Complex burn area compared to FOFEM (Figure 5). Consume-based woody fuel consumption rates were only slightly higher than FOFEM estimates in the east-northeast sections of the burn area, characterized by conifer forests with deeper <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> (Figure 5).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A large dataset of litter {{moisture}} measurements {{collected at}} several sites across Canada by the Canadian Forest Service {{over the period}} from 1939 to 1961 is analysed. The stands in which sampling was carried out were described by three main variables: forest type (pine, spruce, Douglas fir, mixedwood and deciduous), season (spring, summer and fall), and stand density (light, moderate and dense). All three variables {{were found to have}} a significant influence on the relationship between the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System’s Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) and surface litter moisture. Moisture in the upper <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> was also found to have a significant influence on the relationship between FFMC and litter moisture content, with a wetter <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> leading to moister surface conditions than would be indicated by the FFMC value. A model for litter moisture is developed, which provides a method of adjusting the standard FFMC value for the influences of forest type, stand density, season and duff moisture content...|$|E
30|$|Unlike the hotter burns, {{there was}} {{slightly}} greater water infiltration beneath the small-slash piles compared to unburned soil. Repellent mats of fungal mycelia were noted at the mineral soil-duff interface below the small-slash piles prior to burning, {{and we believe}} it was the consumption of these mats that allowed for increased infiltration. Rice and Grismer (2010) also noted a widespread presence of hydrophobic fungal mats between the mineral soil and <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> in unburned LTB soils that acted to restrict water infiltration.|$|E
30|$|The only fuel {{components}} consumed {{in a very}} moist fuel complex are needles and small twigs. As the fuel mass dries, the larger components become available for combustion {{and add to the}} available fuel. After 14 days larger twigs and branches burn and the <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> has dried out sufficiently to burn. Under very dry conditions only the larger branches and the bottommost layer of duff are not consumed. The fire has virtually burnt down to mineral soil and under these conditions fire damage would be accelerated.|$|E
30|$|We {{calculated}} dead downed woody debris loading (Mg ha− 1) {{according to}} Brown (1974), and used site-specific depth-to-loading regressions to calculate litter and duff loading (Mg ha− 1) (M. Harrington, retired, USDA Forest Service, Missoula, Montana, USA, unpublished data). Dead downed woody fuel loading were grouped into two pools for analysis: fine woody debris (FWD) {{was composed of}} fuel less than 7.62  cm diameter (1 -h, 10 -h, and 100 -h); coarse woody debris (CWD) was composed of sound fuel {{greater than or equal}} to 7.62  cm diameter (1000 -h). Litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> (LD) were combined for analysis.|$|R
30|$|Many of the {{environmental}} variables significantly associated with the ordination axes (Table 3) are {{either directly or indirectly}} related to fire intensity and severity. Proportion of the ground surface burned, litter depth, and duff depth were directly affected by patterns of fuel consumption and the resulting fire intensity. Prior to the burns, over half of the total fuel load in all units consisted of the litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers.</b> A greater proportion of the ground surface was burned in the late season than in the early season treatment, with no surface burned in controls; of the initial litter and duff loads, 33 percent remained following early season burns, while only 12 percent remained following late season burns (Knapp et al. 2005). This greater heterogeneity (more unburned patches) and reduced fuel consumption of the early season burns was attributed to higher fuel moisture levels (Knapp and Keeley, 2006).|$|R
30|$|The large {{differences}} {{noted in}} fuel loading for the Tripod Fire Complex (Table 3; Figure 4) illustrate {{different approaches to}} mapping fuels across landscapes. The current generation of fuel loading maps (FCCS 2, OkWen, LANDFIRE FLM; McKenzie et al. 2007, Lutes et al. 2009, French et al. 2011) has become increasingly comprehensive since {{the creation of the}} NFDRS as a tool for fire danger rating (Burgan et al. 1997 a, Burgan et al. 1998). Much of the resulting variability in the mapped fuel loadings we observed was due to the omission of specific fuels strata such as canopy, shrubs, litter, or <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> in the older fuel maps (NFDRS, Hardy 98). Use of the current generation of fuel loading maps resolves these issues, as these fuels maps were specifically created to model fuel consumption and smoke emissions and now include canopy fuels and improved modeling of litter and duff.|$|R
30|$|Prescribed burns were {{completed}} 20 to 22 July, and 12 to 20 October 1983. The July burns were conducted when the fine surface fuels were dry but the lower <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> was still moist, while the October burns were conducted after rain had dampened the fine surface fuels but the lower duff was still dry. Moist surface fuels {{at the time}} of the October burns resulted in a patchy burn pattern; however, forest floor consumption in areas that did burn was nearly complete. The lower duff (humus) layer was generally not consumed by the July burns. Actual fuel moisture values were not available.|$|E
30|$|In California, {{chaparral}} occupies approximately 4 million ha, 10 % of the state’s area (Fried et al. 2004). Five of California’s 10 largest wildfires {{have occurred}} in this vegetation type from 1923 to 2005 (Stephens and Sugihara 2006), and prescribed fire is frequently used to manage chaparral. Having accurate information on rates of spread and fireline intensity are important factors when planning prescribed fires. For example, in conducting prescribed fires to manage exotic weed species, if the fire moves too quickly it may not produce the desired ecological effect because of insufficient consumption of the <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> surface seeds, and seed heads.|$|E
30|$|Depth {{below the}} surface and whether {{regenerative}} structures are located in organic layers or mineral soil directly affect the potential for lethal heating from the consumption of surface fuel (Miller 2000, Choczynska and Johnson 2009). Buried regenerative structures within duff or other organic soil layers {{are at greater risk}} from fire because these layers can be consumed by smoldering combustion. On sites that experienced higher soil temperatures at the mineral soil surface as a consequence of <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> consumption, aspen (Populus sp. L.) suckers (Brown and DeByle 1987) and huckleberry (Vaccinium L.) shoots from rhizomes (Miller 1977) originated from deeper within the soil because buds closer to the surface had been killed.|$|E
40|$|The {{forest floor}} is an {{important}} part of carbon storage, biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and fire fuel hazard. This paper reports on a study of litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> of the forest floor for eastern U. S. forests. The U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) program currently measures variables related to duff and litter on a subsample of plots covering all U. S. forest lands regardless of ownership. The FIA soils protocol includes duff and litter thickness measurement and sample collection followed by lab measurement of mass and carbon content. We examined these lab data to test a model of duff and litter carbon storage based upon simple measurements of forest floor depth. Duff and litter data were compiled from 1, 468 plots sampled in 2001 and 2002 from most states in the eastern U. S. These data were combined with other available FIA data for regression modeling to predict duff and litter carbon from depth of <b>duff</b> and litter <b>layer</b> and several other classification variables (R 2 = 0. 56). Results on duff and litter model predictions show that duff and litter are an important carbon sink in eastern U. S. forests by containing about 50 percent of the forest floor carbon or 10 percent of total forest carbon (excluding mineral soil). ______________________________________________________________________...|$|R
30|$|Understory Response Model. The only {{existing}} model tailored {{for predicting}} understory response to fire is the Understory Response Model (URM) (Sutherland and Miller 2005). The URM is a species-specific computer model that qualitatively predicts change in total species biomass based on resprouting and seedling establishment. The model predicts {{the response of}} grasses, forbs, and shrubs after thinning, prescribed fire, or wildfire one, five, and ten years post-treatment. The model takes into account individual life history traits {{and changes in the}} site caused by thinning and fire. The URM would be significantly enhanced if it could be coupled with improved models for fuel consumption and subsurface heat transfer. Since the URM uses FOFEM to estimate mineral soil heating and mineral soil exposure, mortality of plant structures and seeds within litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> cannot be described, and mineral soil exposure is only coarsely estimated. The model outputs are also limited by lack of information on life history, below ground structural characteristics, and post-fire recovery mechanisms for most plant species.|$|R
30|$|From 1971 to 2000, {{the mean}} annual {{temperature}} at the study site was 16.7 °C, with winter monthly means ranging from 6.3 °C to 11.7 °C, and summer monthly means ranging from 20.6 °C to 26.6 °C. Average precipitation is 126.5 cm yr− 1 (NCSU 2000). Drought conditions prevailed throughout 2007 {{and much of}} 2008 prior to the wildland fire ignition, but had dissipated by late April {{in the study area}} (NCDMAC 2011). The Keech-Byrum Drought Index (KBDI), a key indicator of 1000 -hour fuel and organic soil moisture for firefighting, was 261 on the day of fire ignition, and rose to a maximum value of 490 on 13 June 2008. Keech-Byrum Drought Index values between 201 and 400 are indicative of late spring or early growing season, when litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> are drying and begin to contribute to severe fire behavior. Keech-Byrum Drought Index values between 401 and 600 are typical of late summer and early fall in the southeastern United States. At these KBDI values, litter and organic (O) horizons of histosol soils burn intensely (Melton 1996).|$|R
40|$|The {{forest floor}} {{data from the}} Savannah River Site {{consists}} of two layers, the litter layer and the <b>duff</b> <b>layer.</b> The purpose for {{the study was to}} determine bulk density conversion factors to convert litter and duff depth values in inches to forest floor fuel values in tons per acre. The primary objective was to collect litter and duff samples to adequately characterize forest floor depth and bulk density for combinations of 4 common forest types (loblolly/slash pine, longleaf pine, pine and hardwood mix, upland hardwood), 3 age classes (5 - 20, 20 - 40, 40 + years old) and 3 categories of burning history (0 - 3, 3 - 10, 10 + years since last burn) ...|$|E
3000|$|... b) {{found that}} raking took 16 min per person on average for large Jeffrey pine in California, and raking time {{increased}} with duff depth. Raking {{may not be}} appropriate under all conditions and Swezy and Agee (1991) and Kolb et al. (2007) have suggested that raking may negatively affect tree heath by killing fine roots within the <b>duff</b> <b>layer.</b> To avoid this, raking has sometimes been carried out {{at least one year}} prior to the fire to allow trees to recover from the loss of fine roots removed by raking and develop new roots deeper in the soil (Hood 2010). This may be less of a concern in ponderosa and Jeffrey pine forests, in which Noonan-Wright et al. (2010) found no negative effects of raking on growth rate and mortality in the absence of fire.|$|E
30|$|Sugar pine cones {{comprised}} 1.3 % of {{the total}} forest floor fuel (duff, litter, and woody fuels < 10 cm in diameter) mass in the YFDP (Lutz et al. 2012). On sites with active frequent fire regimes, sugar pine cones may comprise a larger fraction of the surface fuel load that is {{more in line with}} their relative representation in annual litterfall inputs (up to about 10 %; Stohlgren 1988): frequent fires preclude development of a deep <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> which should increase the proportional representation of apparently rapidly decaying pine cones in the surface fuel bed in an active fire regime (Figure 1). In addition, fire may stimulate cone production. For example, thinning alone, and in combination with prescribed fire, increased ponderosa pine cone production (Peters and Sala 2008).|$|E
30|$|Mature {{sugar pine}} cones, with flame lengths > 1 m and flame {{duration}} of 3 min to 6 min, clearly {{have the potential}} to contribute to surface fire behavior and spread (Fonda and Varner 2004). Under some circumstances, flaming mature cones might also ignite shrubs and tree saplings. Burning cones also contribute to fire spread when they roll downhill beyond the fire perimeter, {{part of the reason for}} the practice of cup-trenching fire lines on steep terrain. Cones that smolder for long periods, such as the approximately 35 min smoldering times observed here for classes I through III, become potential ignition sources in the litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> with negative consequences for large tree survival (Hood 2010). Our laboratory measurements did not examine differences in burning characteristics due to different moisture contents or due to admixtures of cones and needles (sensu Taylor and Fonda 1990, Fonda and Varner 2004). A combination of laboratory and field experiments would provide insights into the role of sugar pine cones as a flame and heat vector for surface and ladder fuel ignition, or as a vector for duff ignition.|$|R
30|$|There are {{relatively}} few {{data on the}} vertical distribution of below ground organs in soil. For understory species in eastern Canadian boreal forest, Flinn and Wein (1977) found the depths of underground reproductive structures (root or rhizome) to be species-specific. Of 23 herb and shrub species, structures of six species were predominantly located in the top few centimeters of the litter layer, structures of five species were found within the F and H layer, and structures of 12 species were found from 3 cm to 15 cm depth in mineral soil (Flinn and Wein 1977). In Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) forests of southern interior British Columbia, Canada, McLean (1969) assessed depth of regenerative tissue and whether it was located within <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> or mineral soil for 26 species. Based on depth and location, he classified species {{in terms of their}} relative fire resistance. Choczynska and Johnson (2009) found that most buds of three rhizomatous grasses occurred within a few centimeters of the soil surface, though the distribution had a long tail, with many buds occurring more deeply within the soil. Given that data on type and depths of reproductive structures are known, duff consumption and soil heating models are pivotal in predicting their mortality (e.g., Choczynska and Johnson 2009).|$|R
30|$|Tree size or DBH is {{a common}} {{variable}} in post-fire mortality models (Woolley et al. 2012). This contrasts with our findings that DBH was influential in predicting post-fire tree mortality {{for only a few}} species: whitebark pine, lodgepole pine, western larch, white fir, and Douglas-fir. Predicted mortality increases with increasing DBH for white fir and, if attacked by bark beetles, for Douglas-fir. The interaction between bark beetles and DBH is consistent with the findings of Hood and Bentz (2007), as Douglas-fir beetle is known to preferentially attack larger trees (Furniss 1965). Though many studies report a positive correlation between tree size and resistance to fire, others have reported either a negative or no relationship with DBH and resistance (Swezy and Agee 1991, Stephens and Finney 2002, McHugh and Kolb 2003, Varner et al. 2007, Hood et al. 2010, Lerch et al. 2016). Several reasons may account for the conflicting results in the literature between DBH and post-fire mortality. Biological reasons include indirect effects such as reductions in tree vigor with age, bark-beetles attack preferences, and deep <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> that can cause long-term smoldering (Hood 2010). The range of data used to develop models will also heavily influence variable importance, and the size range of trees varies widely in studies of post-fire tree mortality.|$|R
30|$|The Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI; Keetch and Byram 1968) {{was used}} as a proxy for soil {{moisture}} availability at each of the study sites. KBDI is used extensively in fire planning to index the moisture content of the upper soil layer {{as well as that of}} the <b>duff</b> <b>layer,</b> which affect potential fire intensity and difficulty of control. The index represents the net effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration on soil moisture content in the top 20.3 cm (8 in) of soil. For each day without more than 5.1 mm (0.2 in) of rainfall, the index is increased. More substantial increases are made when air temperature is high. The index is reduced for every 0.254 mm (0.01 in) above 5.1 mm (0.2 in) of rainfall received on the previous day. The minimum KBDI value is zero and the maximum value is 800.|$|E
30|$|Nutrient loading from {{tributary}} streams, surface runoff, {{fine soil}} particles, atmospheric deposition, and anthropogenic manipulation (such as fire) {{have contributed to}} increased algal growth and a 0.3 m yr− 1 decline in Lake Tahoe water clarity in recent decades (Reuter and Miller 2000). Nitrogen and P, in particular, are the primary nutrients stimulating algal growth. In this regard, Miller et al. (2006) measured sporadic increases in inorganic N and P concentrations in overland flow at the interface between the mineral soil surface and the <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> after wildfire in the LTB. Miller et al. (2005) measured even higher (although also sporadic) surface-flow N and P concentrations at an unburned site outside of the LTB. Therefore, an immediate concern of fuel reduction projects is their proximity to SEZs, where the potential exists to exacerbate nutrient and sediment runoff in streams.|$|E
30|$|Fuel loading. The {{accumulation}} of fuels {{on the forest}} floor that has occurred in the Southwest can be attributed to natural fire exclusion and suppression (Covington and Moore 1994). A stated objective of prescribed fire treatments is to decrease this abundance of dead and down fuels, and the second entry fires in this study significantly decreased the total fuel loading. Decreases in the litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layer</b> accounted for much of the reduction and were within the range of management objectives (40 % to 60 % decrease). Total fuel mass was still high at 31 Mg ha− 1 immediately after the second entry fire and 1000 hr fuel loading was not reduced, thus the fuel loading objective was only partially met by second entry fires (and not met by first entry fires). Additionally, the remaining fine and heavy fuels were enough to support high severity crown fires (Fulé et al. 1997, 2001).|$|E
30|$|Both {{early and}} late season {{prescribed}} burns appear to have significantly altered the feeding guild structure of the arthropod community in this forest. The reduced abundance of detritivores was likely due to fire’s consumption of the organic components of the litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> (Debano et al. 1998, Neary et al. 1999). A decrease in {{quantity and quality of}} available organic material, and an increase in ground surface exposed to sunlight would be expected to lead to fewer decomposers on the forest floor (Collett et al. 1993). The greater abundance of dead wood utilizing xylophages (e.g. Buprestidae and Cerambycidae) noted in burn treatments in this study was likely due to the higher number of standing dead trees. Between 2001 (preburn) and 2004 (one year after the conclusion of the sampling for this study), 6 percent of the trees in the control had died, as compared to 35 percent and 48 percent in the early- and late season burn treatments, respectively (Ferrenberg, unpublished data, Schwilk et al. 2006). Greater abundance of arthropods (particularly beetles) that utilize dead and dying wood is a widely reported trend following fires (Ehnström et al. 1995, Ganz et al. 2003, McHugh et al. 2003, Sullivan et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Water {{repellent}} (hydrophobic) soils {{impact the}} infiltration process {{of a water}} budget by restricting the movement of water into and through a soil body. The infiltration of water into a water repellent soil can be inhibited or completely impeded in which case much of the incoming precipitation reaching the soil surface becomes overland flow. One mechanism causing the formation of water repellent soils is the distillation of organic compounds in the litter and <b>duff</b> <b>layers</b> during combustion in a fire (DeBano 1981, 1999, 2003, Doerr et al. 2000). This mechanism resulted {{in the formation of}} water repellant soils following prescribed cool and warm season burning treatments and a wildfire on the Cascabel Watersheds in the oak savannas of the Malpai Borderlands Region {{in the eastern part of}} the Coronado National Forest. This paper complements the findings of an earlier study on the formation of water repellency on selected sites locations classified by accumulations of litter and other organic debris or dominant tree species on the watersheds before the fires (Neary et al. 2008) by reporting on the occurrences and levels of water repellency on a watershed-basis. An attempt to correlate the occurrences and levels of water repellency to the severity of the prescribed burning treatments and the wildfire is also presented...|$|R
30|$|Boreal {{forest fires}} are an {{important}} source of terrestrial carbon emissions, particularly during years of widespread wildfires. Most carbon emission models parameterize wildfire impacts and carbon flux to area burned by fires, therein making the assumption that fires consume a spatiotemporally homogeneous landscape composed of predominantly spruce forests and peat bogs with deep <b>duff</b> <b>layers.</b> While recent efforts have demonstrated that boreal forest fires heterogeneously consume aboveground vegetation, little remains known about the vegetation consumed during such fires. We examined climate, land cover, area burned, and fire impacts for large fires (2002 to 2009) across the Alaskan boreal landscape to address the validity of assumptions made by carbon emissions models for boreal fires. Results indicated that while coniferous vegetation, particularly spruce forests and spruce bogs, comprised the majority of the area burned in all years, shrub land cover comprised a substantial proportion (up to 35 %) of the area burned during warmer years of the study period. Interannual climate variability significantly influenced both the proportion of vegetation classes burned and the distribution of fire impacts across years and vegetation classes. We found that surface fuel modifications were sensitive to both the vegetation type that burned and climatic conditions. Area burned is an inadequate input metric for increasingly refined carbon emissions models, and consideration of heterogeneous fire impacts may improve carbon emissions modeling.|$|R
