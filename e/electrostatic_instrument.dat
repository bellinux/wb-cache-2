40|$|This paper {{describes}} an <b>electrostatic</b> positioning <b>instrument</b> which was {{developed at the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory to enable experimenters to conduct containerless material science experiments in space. Samples {{that are to be}} studied are electrically charged and controlled by the electrostatic force produced by a set of properly arranged electrodes. Three different types of positioners are described, i. e., the dish type, the ring type, and the tetrahedral type. In all these systems, the positioning and the damping of the sample is accomplished by a feedback control system. The advantage of this electrostatic positioning method, in comparison to the other methods, such as acoustic and electromagnetic, {{lies in the fact that}} it can operate in a high vacuum and does not require the material to be electrically conductive as long as the material can carry a certain amount of charge...|$|R

40|$|A new {{instrument}} for low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) is presented which employs {{a combination of}} electrostatic and time-of-flight analysis. In this <b>instrument,</b> <b>electrostatic</b> analysis is {{used to determine the}} kinetic energy of the ions, and flight-time analysis is used to select the mass of the ions. The combination allows us to discriminate the signals resulting from particles with a different mass than the primary ions, resulting in a very efficient suppression of signals caused by sputtered particles. The suppression of signals from sputtered particles enables more accurate determination of LEIS signals, especially for light elements. This technique is especially suited for the study of polymers and oxides, but can also be valuable for determination of low concentration of heavier elements. In this article the design of the instrument is presented and the method is demonstrated by some examples of LEIS spectr...|$|R
40|$|Transport and {{acceleration}} of the 5 – 50 keV electrons from the plasma sheet to geostationary orbit were investigated. These electrons constitute the low‐energy part of the seed population for the high‐energy MeV particles in the radiation belts and are responsible for surface charging. We modeled one nonstorm event on 24 – 30 November 2011, when the presence of isolated substorms {{was seen in the}} AE index. We used the Inner Magnetosphere Particle Transport and Acceleration Model (IMPTAM) with the boundary at 10 R E with moment values for the electrons in the plasma sheet. The output of the IMPTAM modeling was compared to the observed electron fluxes in 10 energy channels (from 5 to 50 keV) measured on board the AMC 12 geostationary spacecraft by the Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor II with <b>electrostatic</b> analyzer <b>instrument.</b> The behavior of the fluxes depends on the electron energy. The IMPTAM model, driven by the observed parameters such as Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) B y and B z, solar wind velocity, number density, dynamic pressure, and the Dst index, was not able to reproduce the observed peaks in the electron fluxes when no significant variations are present in those parameters. We launched several substorm‐associated electromagnetic pulses at the substorm onsets during the modeled period. The observed increases in the fluxes can be captured by IMPTAM when substorm‐associated electromagnetic fields are taken into account. Modifications of the pulse front velocity and arrival time are needed to exactly match the observed enhancements. Key Points Electron flux peaks due to substorm activity Solar wind driven inner magnetosphere model does not work for quiet times Substorm‐associated fields to explain electron flux peak...|$|R
40|$|High-pressure {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy is {{a rapidly}} developing technique with applications {{in a wide}} range of fields ranging from fundamental surface science and catalysis to energy materials, environmental science, and biology. At present the majority of the high-pressure photoelectron spectrometers are situated at synchrotron end stations, but recently a small number of laboratory-based setups have also emerged. In this paper we discuss the design and performance of a new laboratory based high pressure photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Ka X-ray anode and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer combined with a differentially pumped <b>electrostatic</b> lens. The <b>instrument</b> is demonstrated to be capable of measuring core level spectra at pressures up to 30 mbar. Moreover, valence band spectra of a silver sample as well as a carbon-coated surface (graphene) recorded under a 2 mbar nitrogen atmosphere are presented, demonstrating the versatility of this laboratory-based spectrometer.

40|$|Atmospheric density {{models are}} {{currently}} the limiting {{factor in the}} accuracy of the dynamic orbit determination and prediction of satellites in a low Earth orbit. Any improvement in these models would greatly aid in applications such as re-entry prediction, ground-track maintenance of Earth observation satellites and forecast of possible collisions with space debris objects. Because of their use in scientific studies, improving these models will also bene?t our understanding of the physical processes that occur in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Accelerometer instruments onboard of low Earth orbiting satellites are near perfect instruments for studying atmospheric density. They provide accurate observations of the non-gravitational accelerations acting on a satellite and for low flying satellites atmospheric drag is the dominant non-gravitational force. Unfortunately, the number of satellites equipped with an accelerometer is limited. Therefore, in this thesis a strategy is developed and implemented to optimally derive non-gravitational accelerations from precise GPS satellite tracking observations of low flying satellites. This estimation of non-gravitational accelerations using a precise GPS-based orbit determination scheme is referred to as GPS-based accelerometry. The developed GPS-based accelerometry processing strategy is applied to GPS data from the CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE satellites. These satellites carry <b>electrostatic</b> accelerometer <b>instruments,</b> which allows a validation of the GPS-based accelerometry performance. This validation shows that best results are generally obtained for lower flying satellites, due to the increased effect of drag at lower altitudes. In general, best performance is obtained in flight direction, due to the strong effect of accelerations in this direction on orbital dynamics. A comparison with state-of-the-art non-gravitational models shows that for all selected satellites, GPS-based accelerometry outperforms the non-gravitational models in the flight direction. These results indicate that with GPS-based accelerometry, satellites equipped with accurate GPS tracking instrumentation can contribute significantly to atmospheric density modeling. With the growing number of satellites equipped with accurate GPS receivers, this strategy could be applied to a large range of satellites, which offers great potential for the improvement of atmospheric density models.

40|$|This work employs in situ {{measurement}} {{data and}} constructive simulations to examine the underlying physical mechanisms that drive spacecraft plume interactions with the space environment in low‐Earth orbit. The study centers on observations of the enhanced flux of plasma generated during a maneuver of Space Shuttle Endeavour {{as part of the}} Sensor Test for Orion Relative Navigation Risk Mitigation experiment in May 2011. The Canary <b>electrostatic</b> analyzer (ESA) <b>instrument</b> mounted on the portside truss of the International Space Station indicated an elevated ion current during the shuttle maneuver. The apparent source of enhanced ion current is a result of interaction of the spacecraft thruster plume with the rarefied ambient ionosphere, which generates regions of relatively high density plasma through charge exchange between the neutral plume and ambient ions. To reconstruct this event, unsteady simulation data were generated using a combined direct simulation Monte Carlo/particle‐in‐cell methodology, which employed detailed charge exchange cross‐section data and a magnetic field model. The simulation provides local plasma characteristics at the ESA sensor location, and a sensor model is subsequently used to transform the local properties into a prediction of measured ion current. The predicted and observed total currents are presented as a function of time over a 30 s period of pulsed thruster firings. A strong correlation is observed in the temporal characteristics of the simulated and measured total current, and good agreement is also achieved in the total current predicted by the model. These results support conclusions that (1) the enhanced flux of plasma observed by the ESA instrument is associated with Space Shuttle thruster firings and (2) the simulation model captures the essential features of the plume interactions based on the observation data.

40|$|International audienceOne of the complicating {{factors of}} the future robotic and human lunar landing {{missions}} is {{the influence of the}} dust. Meteorites bombardment has accompanied by shock-explosive phenomena, disintegration and mix of the lunar soil in depth and on area simultaneously. As a consequence, the lunar soil has undergone melting, physical and chemical transformations. Recently we have the some reemergence for interest of Moon investigation. The prospects in current century declare USA, China, India, and European Union. In Russia also prepare two missions: Luna-Glob and Luna-Resource. Not last part of investigation of Moon surface is reviewing the dust condition near the ground of landers. Studying the properties of lunar dust is important both for scientific purposes to investigation the lunar exosphere component and for the technical safety of lunar robotic and manned missions. The absence of an atmosphere on the Moon's surface is leading to greater compaction and sintering. Properties of regolith and dust particles (density, temperature, composition, etc.) as well as near-surface lunar exosphere depend on solar activity, lunar local time and position of the Moon relative to the Earth's magneto tail. Upper layers of regolith are an insulator, which is charging as a result of solar UV radiation and the constant bombardment of charged particles, creates a charge distribution {{on the surface of the}} moon: positive on the illuminated side and negative on the night side. Charge distribution depends on the local lunar time, latitude and the electrical properties of the regolith (the presence of water in the regolith can influence the local distribution of charge). On light side of Moon near surface layer there exists possibility formation dusty plasma system. Altitude of levitation is depending from size of dust particle and Moon latitude. The distribution dust particle by size and altitude has estimated with taking into account photoelectrons, electrons and ions of solar wind, solar emission. Dust analyzer instrument PmL for future Russian lender missons intends for investigation the dynamics of dusty plasma near lunar surface. PmL consist of three blocks: Impact Sensor and two Electric Field Sensors. Dust Experiment goals are: 1) Impact sensor to investigate the dynamics of dust particles near the lunar surface (speed, charge, mass, vectors of a fluxes) a) high speed micrometeorites b) secondary particles after micrometeorites soil bombardment c) levitating dust particles due to <b>electrostatic</b> fields PmL <b>instrument</b> will measure dust particle impulses. In laboratory tests we used -min impulse so as 7 • 10 - 11 N•c, by SiO 2 dust particles, 20 - 40 µm with velocity about 0, 5 - 2, 5 m/c, dispersion 0. 3, and -max impulse was 10 - 6 N•c with possibility increased it by particles Pb-Sn 0, 7 mm with velocity 1 m/c, dispersion ± 0. 3. Also Impact Sensor will measure the charge of dust particle as far as 10 - 15 C (1000 electrons). In case the charge and impulse of a dust particle are measured we can obtain velocity and mass of them. 2) Electric field Sensor will measure the value and dynamics of the electric fields the lunar surface. Two Electric Field Sensors both are measured the concentration and temperature of charged particles (electrons, ions, dust particles). Uncertainty of measurements is 10 %. Electric Field Sensors contain of Lengmure probe. Using Lengmure probe to dark and light Moon surface we can obtain the energy spectra photoelectrons in different period of time. PmL instrument is developing, working out and manufacturing in IKI. Simultaneously with the PmL dust instrument to study lunar dust it would be very important to use an onboard TV system adjusted for imaging physical properties of dust on the lunar surface (adhesion, albedo, porosity, etc), and to collect dust particles samples from the lunar surface to return these samples to the Earth for measure a number of physic-chemical properties of the lunar dust, e. g. a quantum yield of photoemission, what is very important for modeling physical processes in the lunar exosphere...|$|R
