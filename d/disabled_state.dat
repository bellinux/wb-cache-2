5|$|In November HMS Eagle chased and {{captured}} the small French frigate Corcyre in a failed attempt by a French convoy to transport supplies to Corfu. A day later, {{the action of}} 29 November 1811 foiled the most significant French attempt to bring more forces to the Adriatic in 1811 when a British squadron under Captain Murray Maxwell in Alceste chased and engaged two frigates and an armed store ship. One frigate and the store ship were captured, the other reaching Ancona in a <b>disabled</b> <b>state.</b> This action had wide-ranging effects; Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the reports, and {{it has been suggested that}} it was this engagement that convinced him to change the direction of his plans for eastwards expansion from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a <b>disabled</b> <b>state</b> at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in imitation of the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a noose around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the Batavian Republic Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors. Lucas did not survive to see {{the conclusion of the}} trial, dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797, but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797.|$|E

500|$|In {{the absence}} of Morard de Galles and Hoche, Bouvet and his army counterpart, General Emmanuel de Grouchy, gave orders on 21 December for the fleet to anchor in {{preparation}} for landings the following day. Local maritime pilots, believing the fleet to be British, rowed out to the ships and were seized, providing the French with guides to the best landing sites. During the night of 21 December, the weather suddenly and significantly worsened, Atlantic gales bringing blizzards that hid the shoreline and forced the fleet to anchor or risk being wrecked. For four days they remained in the Bay, the inexperienced French sailors, lacking any winter clothing, unable to operate their ships in the coldest winter recorded since 1708. On shore, local militia forces were marshaled by local landowner Richard White, taking positions {{in anticipation of the}} French landing. On 24 December the wind slackened and a council of war was convened among the expedition's senior officers. Together they resolved to force a landing despite the weather, identifying a nearby creek as the safest point and giving orders for the operation to go ahead at first light on 25 December. During the night the weather deteriorated once more, and by morning the waves were so violent that they were breaking over the bows of many ships. Anchors dragged and a number of vessels were blown right out of the Bay and into the Atlantic, unable to return against the wind. In the storm, the largest ship of the line, the , collided with the frigate [...] and both suffered severe damage. HMS Monarch, flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir George Elphinstone returning from the successful Invasion of the Cape Colony, was battered by the storm and passed right through the French fleet without realising the danger, anchoring in a <b>disabled</b> <b>state</b> at Crookhaven.|$|E

Bissell was of the opinion that had the wind remained as calm as it was early in the morning, they might have succeeded, though at great cost. As it was, the French had over forty dead and wounded. Racoon had only one man injured. Though Racoon had little damage, only some shot to her sails, Bissell returned to port, stating that [...] "the very <b>disabled</b> <b>State</b> of the Prizes, and having expended nearly all the Shot on board, will, I hope, plead my excuse for returning to Port before I was regularly recalled."

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of allergic diseases in Peru {{as well as}} in the rest of the world is increasing every year, independently of any integral treatment and control measures instituted in the last few years. Consequently, direct and indirect costs in the public or private health systems are highly expensive and generate a global concern related with the search for prevention and early diagnosis, which will permit specific actions that minimize <b>disabling</b> <b>states</b> due to this reason. A detailed clinical history is the key to the proper identification and/or dismissal of the probable allergenic agents that will trigger many of the allergic states, {{as well as in}}dicating the auxiliary diagnostic tests to be chosen. For the different allergic diseases, various methods exist that can be used to help in diagnosis with proven specificity and sensibility, considering the different allergenic agents. Precise identification of such agents permits the introduction of secondary and tertiary prevention methods, which have as primordial purpose to avoid symptoms and exacerbations, preventing <b>disabling</b> <b>states</b> and improving patient life quality.

When he spoke of pile-driving and sluice-making, he left me not a leg to stand on, and I can never sufficiently acknowledge his forbearance with me in my <b>disabled</b> <b>state.</b> While he thus discoursed, he several times directed his eyes to one distant quarter of the landscape, and spoke with vague mysterious awe of 'the Yard.' Pondering his lessons after we had parted, I bethought me that the Yard was one of our large public Dockyards, and that it lay hidden among the crops down in the dip behind the windmills, as if it modestly kept itself out of view in peaceful times, and sought to trouble no man. Taken with this modesty on the part of the Yard, I resolved to improve the Yard's acquaintance.|$|E

60|$|Every {{exertion}} was {{now made}} {{to discover the}} criminals. Suspicion hesitated between the smugglers and the gipsies. The fate of Dirk Hatteraick's vessel was certain. Two men from {{the opposite side of}} Warroch Bay (so the inlet on the southern side of the Point of Warroch is called) had seen, though at a great distance, the lugger drive eastward, after doubling the headland, and, as they judged from her manoeuvres, in a <b>disabled</b> <b>state.</b> Shortly after, they perceived that she grounded, smoked, and finally took fire. She was, as one of them expressed himself, 'in a light low' (bright flame) when they observed a king's ship, with her colours up, heave in sight from behind the cape. The guns of the burning vessel discharged themselves as the fire reached them; and they saw her at length blow up with a great explosion. The sloop of war kept aloof for her own safety; and, after hovering till the other exploded, stood away southward under a press of sail. The Sheriff anxiously interrogated these men whether any boats had left the vessel. They could not say, they had seen none; but they might have put off in such a direction as placed the burning vessel, and the thick smoke which floated landward from it, between their course and the witnesses' observation.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} di#erent ways {{of combining}} discrete and timed condition/event systems in a modular, compositional way.

Condition symbols are used to describe system states and can enable or <b>disable</b> <b>state</b> changes, whereas event symbols denote instantaneous actions and are used to trigger state changes. A special class of CESs are discrete condition/event systems (DCESs), which use a finite transition system to control the input/output behavior of the system. CESs and DCESs can be represented as block diagrams using signal flows for the connection between the system. These models are widely used in system engineering and control theory...|$|R

Recently, there has been increased public awareness about this rare condition, and more cases are reported. The commonest causative lesion is bilateral ventral pontine damage secondary to vertebrobasilar artery occlusion. Clinicians need to be familiar with the condition because there is a high chance of erroneous diagnosis, such as coma or vegetative state, after a prolonged unconscious state. It is often the relatives or carers who recognize the conscious state first and report that the patient can communicate through his eyes. Because of complications, such as aspiration and sepsis, about 40 – 70 % of sufferers die in acute phase of illness.

The systems we consider are typically controlled by programmable logic controllers which directly turn on and off signals to devices in response to changing discrete sensor information. Such manufacturing systems can be represented as the composition of several elemental subsystems which each define the dynamics of a low-level state variable.
