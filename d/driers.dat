5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered <b>driers.</b> The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
25|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes. This led to portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, electric fans, and hair <b>driers)</b> being connected to light bulb sockets using lampholder plugs.|$|E
25|$|Trademark names can be {{registered}} by different entities {{in different countries}} and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name {{to be controlled by}} two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories. The result is that Unix {{has been used as a}} brand name for various products including book shelves, ink pens, bottled glue, diapers, hair <b>driers</b> and food containers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drier's</b> Meat Market, {{also known}} as <b>Drier's</b> Butcher Shop or the Union Meat Market, is a {{commercial}} meat market located at 14 South Elm Street in Three Oaks, Michigan. The building has been in continuous use as a butcher shop since the late 19th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Bandwidth {{to support}} the Air Force’s AN does not {{currently}} exist. Only time can tell until enough bandwidth is freed up by obsolete technology. This creates the challenge of creating better ways of compressing data and developing more efficient ways to utilize the bandwidth currently available. One interim solution developed by Northrop Grumman is the Dialup rate IP over existing radios (<b>DRIER).</b> <b>DRIER</b> enables airborne or ground-based tactical users to select and download mission-critical data directly from the Joint STARS platform using existing, narrowband line-of-sight or beyond-line-of-sight UHF communications links. Users can {{also serve as a}} relay point, providing critical handover information between aircraft entering and exiting mission orbits.|$|R

25|$|A {{familiar}} {{sight in}} several Asian countries is paddy laid {{out to dry}} along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical <b>driers</b> or both. Drying has {{to be carried out}} quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple hullers, with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.|$|E
25|$|Refineries {{examine whether}} {{it makes sense}} {{economically}} to install alkylation units. Alkylation units are complex, with substantial economy of scale. SAAU and HFAU have comparable capital investment costs. It {{is not surprising that}} the two processes are competitive on a capital cost basis, when one considers the basic process differences. The SAAU has a more expensive reactor section and requires refrigeration. However, equal costs are realized in the HF unit by the need for feed <b>driers,</b> product treating, regeneration equipment and more exotic metallurgy. In addition, most refiners will require a dedicated cooling system for an HF unit, to remove the risk of site-wide corrosion in the case of an HF leak. It should be noted that these capital cost estimates do not account for the additional safety and mitigation equipment now required in HF units. Due to the possible hazardous aerosol formation when the HF catalyst is released as a superheated liquid, expensive mitigation systems are now required in many locations throughout the world where HF is used as an alkylation catalyst.|$|E

2500|$|... 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is a {{non-flammable}} gas used {{primarily as a}} [...] "high-temperature" [...] refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners. [...] These devices began using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in the early 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the more environmentally harmful R-12 and retrofit kits are available to convert units that were originally R-12-equipped. [...] Other uses include plastic foam blowing, as a cleaning solvent, a propellant for the delivery of pharmaceuticals (e.g. bronchodilators), wine cork removers, gas dusters, such as Dust-Off, and in air <b>driers</b> for removing the moisture from compressed air. [...] 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has also been used to cool computers in some overclocking attempts. It is the refrigerant used in plumbing pipe freeze kits. It is also commonly used as a propellant for airsoft airguns. The gas is often mixed with a silicon-based lubricant.|$|E
2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air <b>driers</b> or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{passenger}} terminal, at {{the western}} end, was closed down and a new temporary terminal was converted from the old RAF buildings, {{in preparation for the}} start of the rebuild. Check-in was in a converted hangar and adopted the now familiar layout. The main difference from today was that not just the luggage was weighed. All passengers too, were required to stand on the big Avery scales, and were charged accordingly. The departure lounge, known as the Traffic Hall, was converted from one of the big brick [...] "H" [...] blocks. Along with comfortable seating, the lounge contained a long bar, backed by a full length, brightly coloured, three-dimensional collage. On a table, in the centre of the hall, was a large display case containing an architect's model of how the new airport would look. The modernity was even taken into the toilets, which had the first warm-air hand <b>driers.</b> Outside, the remainder of the ex RAF buildings became the Freight Village. A new but smaller viewing enclosure was allocated adjacent to the west end of the new terminal. No cafe, no toilets, just a bare rectangle of concrete. The chain link fence was usually lined with bicycles, which were regularly blown over when the BEA and Dan-Air DC3 Dakotas opened up both engines before turning right and taxiing out. No push-back then. No steerable nose wheels either. Just full power and hard right rudder.|$|E
50|$|Stand dryers {{are also}} {{available}} for a quick drying of the dog's coat. Commonly, when a dog is brought to a groomer this implies a thorough cleaning of the coat as well. And because the dog cannot leave the shop while wet, special <b>driers</b> have been manufactured. These can be stand <b>driers,</b> cage <b>driers</b> or hand <b>driers</b> and are more common in professional grooming places than in the owner's house. Drying a dog with a dryer designed for humans is not recommended as it could cause scalp irritation, dry skin or skin sores.|$|E
50|$|In {{technical}} literature, oil drying agents, such as naphthenates, {{are described}} as salts, but they are probably also non-ionic coordination complexes with structures similar to basic zinc acetate.These catalysts were traditionally hydrocarbon carboxylate chelates of lead, but due to lead's toxicity, cobalt and other elements, such as zirconium, zinc, calcium, and iron, have replaced the lead in more popular products. Most <b>driers</b> are colorless but cobalt <b>driers</b> are a deep blue purple color and iron <b>driers</b> are reddish orange. These colored <b>driers</b> are therefore compatible only with certain darker pigmented paints where their color will be unseen.|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} <b>driers</b> are litharge, sugar of lead, patent <b>driers,</b> sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid <b>driers,</b> such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese <b>driers</b> are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead <b>driers.</b> Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, vegetable black, ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and Vandyke brown. The term enamel paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are spirit varnishes ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying enamels oil varnishes form the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|A {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 17th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Munich, Germany in 2007 by the University of Bradford and Dyson showing that for a set drying time of 10 seconds, the Airblade led to significantly less bacterial transfer than with the other <b>driers</b> (p < 0.05). When the latter were used for longer (30-35 s) the trend was for the Airblade to still perform better; however, these results did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).
