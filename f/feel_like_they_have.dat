5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E

He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E

With their actions being executed, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> get a knack for it and they incorporate it into their daily activity. In this stage they feel most comfortable with what they are doing and do not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are doing anything wrong.

When growers <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{control over their own}} lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} is a disorder in which patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations usually {{occur in the}} evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down and relaxing. Patients <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to move their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, {{this can lead to}} insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} other main games in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest IIIs {{scenario}} was designed by Yuji Horii, whereas the artwork was done by Akira Toriyama, of Dragon Ball fame. Koichi Sugiyama composed all the music for Dragon Quest III. Chunsoft president [...] Koichi Nakamura, co-creator of Dragon Quest, stated he contributed about [...] "10%" [...] of the games programming. The game was released {{a year after the}} original, a longer period of development than its predecessor, and reflected the ever-lengthening game development process of the series. Yuji Horii, in a 1989 interview, said that developers had perfected the series' game structure in Dragon Quest III, and this was reflected by the transition from one character's quest to a party of heroes. The password system used on the first two Dragon Quest titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record [...] Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, {{which turned out to be}} unworkable during Dragon Quest IIIs development when the game's world map concept was used first by another game maker in Mirai Shinwa Jarvas, but Horii's team was too far into development to change anything. Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, [...] "Leave him to us! Run! Quick!" ...|$|E
50|$|When {{people do}} not conform to the normal standard, they are often {{labelled}} as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or stigmatization. Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large. Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society. The abnormal person <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not experienced themselves. Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual.|$|R

The Australian Film Commission and ABC TV announced the initiative on 21 December 2007, and applications closed on 15 February 2008. Lori Flekser, Director of Film Development at the AFC said, [...] "We are all very excited about Good Game as it provides a terrific opportunity within a reasonable budget for a games developer to have this exposure through a television program {{and to create a}} game which they can exploit in the future". The competition was set up in 3 phases. Janet Carr said [...] "We're going to have input at every single stage so by the end of it, hopefully, anyone who's really interested in being part of it will <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been." [...] In Phase 1, Good Game asked their viewers for ideas for a [...] "game they would want to play & build". Entrants were aged from years 10 to 54, and game ideas ranged from Outback Rescue (rescuing lost tourists) to Full Turtle Racket (about baby sea turtles), and two entries suggested a game based around then-Prime Minister John Howard. Troy's Office Wars idea was chosen from over 800 entries, after being chosen as the top choice for each judge in a panel of industry experts.

50|$|The self-licensing {{effect was}} {{examined}} by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, {{they were more}} willing to express politically incorrect opinions {{despite the fact that}} the audience was unaware of their credentials. Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans. Essentially, the endorsement made people <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> shown that <b>they</b> were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express racially prejudicial views.|$|R
25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> actually received what they expected in return and this made them <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> less power in their relationship. They felt that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> given something up and did not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> this action was recognized.|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{understand}} how our students viewed themselves as writers, particularly {{in relation to their}} self-identified best piece of college writing. Our study was conducted with 104 undergraduate students at a medium-sized public university. Students responded to a survey asking open-ended questions about their best paper in college. Responses were analyzed to identify four broad themes: paper attributes, reflections on the process, actions taken by students, and actions taken by professor. The results led us to an examination of which pedagogical practices by faculty members enabled students to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> achieved their best piece of writing. We conclude with a description of how faculty members across the disciplines can attend to both the cognitive and affective domains of writing to best help their students achieve good writing...|$|R

5000|$|A {{study done}} by Michelle Davies and Samantha McCartney {{discusses}} why men are often blamed or stigmatized for their rape. They found that heterosexual {{men were more}} likely to blame the victim, show less empathy for the victim, deny or diminish the seriousness of the attack, and {{were more likely to}} believe rape myths than heterosexual women and homosexual men. One reason for this is the societal pressure placed on men to be strong, tough, and assertive rather than passive, gentle and [...] "feminine" [...] as mentioned earlier. Another cause for negative reaction toward male rape victims is linked to homophobia. Davies and McCartney and previous research has found a correlation between male victim blame and homophobia, since male rape involving a male rapist is (nonconsensual) sex between two men. The study also revealed that heterosexual men {{were more likely to be}} against the victim if the victim was perceived to be homosexual rather than heterosexual. Homosexual men, similar to heterosexual women, were made to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> [...] "asked for it" [...] based on their behavior.|$|R

With a group contributing to the purchase decision, the shopper is more likely to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> properly inspected the product or service. This confidence allows the shopper to reach a decision faster than if they had to look at the product/service from all angles on their own, and evaluate each aspect deemed important.|$|E
50|$|The mode of {{exchange}} (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides {{a description of}} the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between.|$|R

5000|$|Symbolic interactionism {{was first}} coined by George Herbert Mead, {{who came up}} with this school of sociological thought in the 1930s. Its premise is {{primarily}} based on [...] "objects acquire meaning, thus becoming symbols, through communication". One of his most famous books Mind, Self And Society is famous for describing this theory in depth. Here, he pinpoints the self as an object and other create meaning around it. At the same time, we change the self depending on how we perceive other's ideas of our selves. So in studying something like sexuality or acts related to sex, a sociologist under this perspective could look at pornography and the messages it communicates, or look at magazines and the messages they send to people. One graphic example provided is the [...] "power" [...] symbol communicated in pornography. In pornography, men are implied to be powerful and dominant, whereas women are not. This is especially true in violent pornography, where the person watching <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a complete sense of control over the content, where women are depicted as enjoying it, so that communicates that it may be okay to be violent towards women.|$|R
