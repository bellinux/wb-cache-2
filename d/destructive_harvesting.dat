5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came {{at a cost to}} the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress <b>destructive</b> <b>harvesting</b> methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.|$|E
5|$|The rubber vine {{could be}} destructively {{harvested}} by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it {{lay on the}} ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession. Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited <b>destructive</b> <b>harvesting</b> methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines. This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held {{more than one million}} plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure {{due in part to the}} fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper. Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons. By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.|$|E

40|$|The spear {{leaves of}} the palms Astrocaryum chambira and A. standleyanum have been {{traditionally}} used by Colombian indigenous communities {{as a source of}} fiber for handicraft production. Traditional management practices, including <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest,</b> have reduced population sizes of both species. We monitored a population of A. chambira in the Amazon, and one of A. standleyanum at the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. We then constructed integral projection models (IPM) to evaluate the transient population dynamics of populations under different exploitation regimes. Our results show that during the next 50 years the population of A. standleyanum will grow {{at an annual rate of}} 2. 0 percent, and that of A. chambira at a rate of 0. 8 percent. However, projected population growth is highly sensitive to harvest in both species: a <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest</b> of 5 percent of all usable individuals (subadults and adults) would cease population growth, while a 10 percent harvest intensity would cause populations to decrease by 0. 5 – 0. 6 percent annually. Our simulations further indicate that management practices associated with indigenous slash-and-burn agriculture would reduce fiber production, whereas caring for seedlings would increase population growth and fiber production in the coming decades. In order to sustain viable populations of both species and maintain a steady fiber supply, it is vital to prevent <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest</b> practices, and to leave some forest areas untouched, where populations can regenerate and act as a source of seedlings for intervened areas...|$|R

Growth of R and NR populations was compared, under hard defoliation (H, 50 mm stubble), lax defoliation (L,  100 mm stubble), or without defoliation (U, uncut). Populations were cloned and grown in a glasshouse and defoliated every three weeks, with <b>destructive</b> <b>harvests</b> performed at 6, 12 and 18 weeks. R plants allocated more biomass to root and less to pseudostem than NR plants. Plant tiller numbers were greatly reduced by defoliation, and R and NR populations differed in leaf formation strategy. R plants had narrower leaves than NR, but their leaves were longer, because of greater leaf elongation duration. R plants were more plastic than NR plants in response to defoliation. Ultimately, biomass allocation to rhizomes did not differ between populations but R plants exhibited a subtle shift in distribution of internode length with a few longer internode segments typically located on secondary and tertiary tillers...|$|R
50|$|In plant physiology, RGR is {{a measure}} used to {{quantify}} the speed of plant growth. It is measured as the mass increase per aboveground biomass per day, for example as g g−1 d−1. It {{is considered to be}} the most widely used way of estimating plant growth, but has been criticised as calculations typically involve the <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest</b> of plants. Another problem is that RGR nearly always decreases over time as the biomass of a plant increases, but traditionally this has been ignored when modelling plant growth. The RGR decreases for several reasons - non-photosynthetic biomass (roots and stems) increases, the top leaves of a plant begin to shade lower leaves and soil nutrients can become limiting. Overall, respiration scales with total biomass, but photosynthesis only scales with photosynthetic biomass and as a result biomass accumulates more slowly as total biomass increases. The RGR of trees in particular slow with increasing size {{due in part to the}} large allocation to structural material of the trunk required to hold photosynthetic material up in the canopy. A novel approach to separate size effects from intrinsic growth differences is implemented and described in detail in Philipson et al. (2012).|$|R

40|$|Non-destructive {{estimation}} using {{digital cameras}} {{is a common}} approach for estimating leaf area index (LAI) of terrestrial vegetation. However, no attempt has been made so far to develop non-destructive approaches to LAI estimation for aquatic vegetation. Using the submerged plant species Potamogeton malainus, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine whether the gap fraction derived from vertical photographs could be used to estimate LAI of aquatic vegetation. Our results suggested that upward-oriented photographs taken from beneath the water surface were more suitable for distinguishing vegetation from other objects than were downward-oriented photographs taken from above the water surface. Exposure settings had a substantial influence on the identification of vegetation in upward-oriented photographs. Automatic exposure performed nearly as well as the optimal trial exposure, making it a good choice for operational convenience. Similar to terrestrial vegetation, our results suggested that photographs taken for the purpose of distinguishing gap fraction in aquatic vegetation should be taken under diffuse light conditions. Significant logarithmic relationships were observed between the vertical gap fraction derived from upward-oriented photographs and plant area index (PAI) and LAI derived from <b>destructive</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The model we developed to depict the relationship between PAI and gap fraction was similar to the modified theoretical Poisson model, with coefficients of 1. 82 and 1. 90 for our model and the theoretical model, respectively.

40|$|Assessment of crop {{nitrogen}} use efficiency (NUE) {{is important}} in agricultural research. Various approaches exist to analyze NUE. A recently proposed NUE concept is further developed and a calculation tool for practical use presented. A critical component in the NUE concept is the plants’ mean nitrogen (N) content during the main growth period (N’). The N’ is delimited by the critical crop phenology stages initiating and terminating accelerated crop N uptake. Especially when experimental treatments and/or crop cultivars cause great variation in phenology, it is often not feasible to perform <b>destructive</b> plant <b>harvests</b> at the critical phenology stages for all treatments and cultivars, which may result in inaccurate estimates of N’ and, ultimately, the NUE components N uptake efficiency and yield-specific N efficiency.

Sites {{were selected to}} take advantage of the spatial variability in phosphorus (P) availability and salinity climates across the bay. Aboveground biomass and NPP of T. testudinum were determined five to six times annually. Short-shoot demography, belowground biomass, and belowground NPP were assessed from a single <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest</b> at each site and short-shoot cohorts were estimated from leaf scar counts multiplied by site-specific leaf production rates. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), and overall NPP were positively correlated with P availability. Additionally, a positive correlation between P availability and the ratio of photosynthetic to non-photosynthetic biomass suggests that T. testudinum increases allocation to aboveground biomass as P availability increases. Population turnover increased with P availability, evident in positive correlations of recruitment and mortality rates with P availability. Departures from seasonally modeled estimates of RGR were found to be influenced by salinity, which depressed RGR when below 20 psu or above 40 psu. Freshwater management in the headwaters of Florida Bay will alter salinity and nutrient climates.

In the case of the non-destructively approach available generalized models are often used for estimating biomass in forests, agroforestry and plantation forestry (Brown and Schroeder 1999; Chave et al. 2001; Houghton et al. 2001). However, due to variations in plant architectures and complexity in associations of trees, biomass estimation through generalized models is fraught with errors (Ter-Mikaelian and Korzukhin 1997; Shepashenko et al. 1998; Brown and Schroeder 1999; De Oliveira and Mori 1999). Generalized models have often been used without consideration of the tree age or plantation age.

P transport was not unidirectional towards the roots, as P- 32 was also transported from the root compartment to the hyphal compartment. Net P flux rates were calculated for hyphae crossing between compartments, taking bidirectional flow into account. Amounts of transported P were poorly correlated with extra-radical hyphal length and root d. wt, but highly correlated with the number of hyphae crossing the barrier separating the two compartments. Such correlations were highest when only hyphae with detectable protoplasmic streaming were considered. The method was tested using radiolabeled P sources, H 2 PO 4 - and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), and the AM fungi, Glomus intraradices and G. proliferum. Fungal transport of P- 32 from CTP was much slower than from PO 4 for both fungi. (C) New Phytologist (2002) 154 : 809 - 819...|$|R
40|$|Growth and {{yield data}} from a loblolly pine {{plantation}} in southeastern Louisiana were obtained yearly from 1993 to 1996 on numbered trees within two stands initially planted on a 1. 22 - by 1. 22 -meter spacing, and two stands planted on a 2. 44 - by 2. 44 -meter spacing. Using allometric equations derived from a 1994 on-site <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest,</b> cited nitrogen concentrations of various tree tissues, and accounting for foliar nitrogen retranslocation, stand growth and soil nitrogen demands were determined. Results showed that production of all aboveground tissues increased as stand density index (SDI) increased. Annual soil nitrogen demand increased with SDI primarily {{as a result of}} an increase in nitrogen-rich foliage on the denser sites. Below ground production, as estimated from minirhizotron censuses, also increased as SDI and aboveground nitrogen demands increased. More fine-root production per unit aboveground nitrogen demand was observed on less fertile plots. Stemwood production per unit leaf biomass decreased with increasing SDI, and is assumed to be the result of a greater percentage of total net primary production being partitioned to fine-root production in the denser plots. The results of this study suggest that the density of forest stands may influence nutrient demands from the soil and subsequent belowground productivity through differential aboveground biomass allocation patterns and tissue nitrogen concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Herbivores can {{indirectly}} affect ecosystem productivity by modifying feedbacks {{that occur}} between dominant plants and below-ground properties, especially through altering nutrient availability in soil. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine, under controlled conditions, the effect of simulated browsing by large herbivores on the growth characteristics of downy birch (Betula pubescens), a dominant tree species of native regenerating forests in northern Britain, and to determine how effects of browsing on tree growth cascaded through to soil microbial communities, thereby affecting nutrient availability in soil. Downy birch seedlings were grown in mesocosms for 2 years and subjected to simulated browsing in the form of defoliation and clipping treatments. Upon <b>destructive</b> <b>harvest,</b> a number of measures of both tree growth characteristics and soil biological and nutrient properties were made. Clipping of birch trees significantly reduced total root biomass (27 %), fine root biomass (29 %), coarse root biomass (27 %) and above-ground biomass (18 %), whereas defoliated trees were significantly shorter than non-defoliated trees. Despite these significant and negative effects of browsing on tree growth, soil biological properties remained largely unaffected, other than rates of N mineralisation, which were greater under defoliated trees. We conclude that other factors, such as herbivore effects on litter quantity and quality which feedback to soil biological properties in the longer-term are more important in determining ecosystem responses to browsing...|$|R
