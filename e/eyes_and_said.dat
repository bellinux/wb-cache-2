2500|$|During this period, Tidwell {{would often}} return home from New York to Virginia Beach, to be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] and {{teach at the}} studio with his mother. [...] While still active in dance, Tidwell's career was losing focus, and his mother feared that he was losing his love for dance. That changed in late 2006 when the two went to see Tidwell's brother, Travis, perform in the So You Think You Can Dance tour in Madison Square Gardens. Travis had come in second place during the {{previous}} season, and was heavily featured in the touring show. His mother recalled, [...] "At Madison Square Garden, Danny {{looked at me with}} tears in his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I want to do that. My brother's up there on that stage, dancing and living, and I want to do that.'" [...] The following season he attended the show's open auditions in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the freshmen}} {{arrived in the}} fall of 1969, Schembechler asked Revelli to teach them how to sing [...] "The Victors". [...] Schembechler said, “He didn't just teach them ‘The Victors.’ He taught them Michigan tradition!” [...] Schembechler {{gathered}} the freshmen at Yost Field House, and Revelli entered in full uniform – described by Schembechler as “a lean, short, distinguished-looking older gentleman—a band director right out of central casting.” [...] Revelli rose to the podium, tapped his baton, looked right into their <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "John Philip Sousa called this the greatest fight song ever written. [...] And you will sing it with respect!" [...] Revelli brought out a pitch pipe and began the instructions. [...] “You sing from down in here, in your diaphragm. [...] You bring it up from down here with feeling.” [...] Then he blew the starting note on his pitch pipe. [...] The players started, [...] "Hail to the Victors, valiant –" [...] Revelli interrupted, “No, No, No! [...] That’s terrible! [...] There’s no enthusiasm [...] You didn’t sing with enthusiasm!” [...] They started again, and Revelli interrupted again. [...] “No, no, no! [...] We’re gonna get this right if I’m here all night!” ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E

50|$|During an {{interview}} in his pub with a Dutch sports magazine in 2001, Boere joked about his artificial <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he had no regrets about his career having played, {{at the peak of his}} career, for West Ham United. <b>And,</b> as he <b>said,</b> at least he was still alive.|$|R
6000|$|The Ohioan {{had once}} before {{cleared his throat}} {{as if he were}} going to speak. Now, he leaned far enough forward to catch Triscoe's <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> slowly <b>and</b> distinctly: [...] "I don't know just what reason you have to feel as you do about the country. I feel {{differently}} about it myself--perhaps because I fought for it." ...|$|R
60|$|Fitzpiers {{followed}} {{the direction of}} her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he did not recognize anybody.|$|E
60|$|The {{skipping}} {{one looked}} at her companion with a startled air, blushed, cast down her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cliff {{wiped her}} <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{they ought to}} consult. If {{anything}} could be done, {{it should be done}} immediately.|$|E
6000|$|Dunham {{lay in a}} stupor for twenty-four hours, {{and after}} that he was delirious, with dim {{intervals}} of reason in which they kept him from talking, till one morning he woke {{and looked up at}} Staniford with a perfectly clear <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> as if resuming the conservation, [...] "I struck my head on a pile of chains." ...|$|R
60|$|Billy Windsor {{suddenly}} became militant. There was a feline smoothness about the visitor {{which had been}} jarring upon him ever since he first spoke. Billy was of the plains, the home of blunt speech, where you looked your man in the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it quick. Mr. Parker was too bland for human consumption. He offended Billy's honest soul.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a sample}} baby-shoe office pin-cushion on the manager's desk. Mr. Wrenn <b>eyed</b> this, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing. The manager: ...|$|R
6000|$|Roy {{said this}} so cheerfully {{that the child}} felt a little comforted, dried her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> she would [...] "help to make the camp." ...|$|E
60|$|He had accidentally {{touched the}} right chord this time. It vibrated at once. Junkie looked up with {{sparkling}} <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that Milly did it.|$|E
6000|$|Will {{followed}} her only with his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I presume {{you know that}} Mr. Casaubon has forbidden {{me to go to}} his house." ...|$|E
6000|$|After Godolphin had gone, Louise came down, {{and found}} Maxwell in a dreary muse over his manuscript. He {{looked up at}} her with a lack-lustre <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Godolphin is jealous of Salome now. What he really wants is a five-act {{monologue}} that will keep him on the stage all the time. He thinks that as it is, she will take all the attention from him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, after UNITE HERE won an {{agreement}} with the San Francisco Marriott hotels, Marriott executive Hank Biddle said about Casey at a banquet to mark the agreement, [...] "The things you said you were going to deliver, you delivered. And when you looked me in the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> you were going to have 1,000 (demonstrators) out in front of this hotel, damned if you didn't do that, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{began the}} moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with {{theatrical}} declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and ended with the very proper aspiration {{that we might be}} truly grateful. Upon which my sister fixed me with her <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in a low reproachful voice, [...] "Do you hear that? Be grateful." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last utterly {{overcome}} {{she leaned}} her head against my arm, closed her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Take me home. I can't stand any more of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth {{opened her}} <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it by syllables. [...] "Christabel Angela! that's a prettier name than Ida. Does {{it make you}} very glad to have it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jakin {{threw out}} his chest, which Lew smote {{with all his}} might. Jakin turned very pale, gasped, crowed, screwed up his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> - [...] "That's all right." ...|$|E
60|$|Alwyn {{lifted his}} soft brown <b>eyes</b> reverently <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'It is {{something}} good,' speaking, {{as he always}} did, in a baby lisp inimitable here.|$|R
5000|$|She competed at the 1936 European Figure Skating Championships {{and placed}} 15th. Later that season, she competed at the 1936 Winter Olympics, where she placed 17th. During the games, she {{personally}} met and insulted Adolf Hitler. Hitler {{asked her if}} she would like to [...] "skate for the swastika." [...] As she later boasted, [...] "I looked him right in the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that I'd rather skate on the swastika. The Führer was furious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] he replied, with a jovial {{gleam in}} his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Ida <b>said</b> no more in protest. Bradley, in great trepidation, {{took a seat}} beside her.|$|R
6000|$|Everybody {{seemed to}} hear of her {{as soon as they}} arrived; for the {{milliner}} sat up in bed, drying her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> just as the dancing-master had said: ...|$|E
60|$|The man's {{face was}} white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, {{he turned away}} his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> no more. The {{sergeant}} did not understand.|$|E
60|$|Walter twisted {{about and}} muttered, {{but he could}} not resist his sister's earnest face and tearful <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} about not making so much noise in the house.|$|E
50|$|Robinson {{looked him}} in the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> they would pass soon enough, and more than that, he would tell Bruner when it was coming. With the ball on its own 25-yard line, first down, St. Louis called for a pass on the first down. Robinson went back into punt {{formation}} and shouted to Bruner {{that they were going to}} show him the pass and to warn the rest of his team, because they were going to see something.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Blahnik had {{a chance}} to meet Diana Vreeland, the {{editor-in-chief}} of U.S Vogue, while he was travelling in New York. He then presented his portfolio of fashions and set designs to Vreeland, at which point she looked him straight in the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Young man, make things, make accessories, make shoes." [...] She admired his shoe sketches and advised him to concentrate on designing footwear. Blahnik followed her advice and worked on designing shoes.|$|R
6000|$|Both of {{the young}} ladies were in the parlour when Corey entered with their father, and both were frankly {{indifferent}} to the few books and the many newspapers scattered about on the table where the large lamp was placed. But after Corey had greeted Irene {{he glanced at the}} novel under his <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in the dearth that sometimes befalls people at such times: [...] "I see you're reading Middlemarch. Do you like George Eliot?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Turnbull, whose {{powers of}} {{surprise}} were exhausted, rolled his round grey <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mr. Wilkinson, I think," [...] {{because he could}} not think of anything else to say.|$|E
6000|$|Trotty sat quite still. Meg dried her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> more gaily: {{that is to}} say, {{with here}} a laugh, and there a sob, and here a laugh and sob together: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{changed the}} bitter tone of {{affected}} pleasantry into {{an attempt to}} laugh, then drew his swarthy hand across his swarthy <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a more natural accent, 'Poor Jess!' ...|$|E
5000|$|Her single mother, Debra {{played a}} huge role in her {{political}} beliefs. Fritsch often recalled a moment {{between the two}} of them when she ran for governor in 2014. Her mother had abruptly stopped the Vega: [...] "She looked me in the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘I would rather us both starve than for me to put you on a path where you didn’t have dignity and you would feel like a victim,’” Fritsch said. “At that moment, I was transformed.” ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Yeobright {{strained}} her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> at last <b>said</b> {{that she}} did perceive him.|$|R
6000|$|This cool snub rasped me all over, but {{it seemed}} to subjugate me, too, for a moment. The pygmy {{contemplated}} me awhile with his weasel <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>said,</b> in a peculiarly sneering way: ...|$|R
