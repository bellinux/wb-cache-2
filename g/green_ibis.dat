50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> (Mesembrinibis cayennensis), {{also known}} as the Cayenne ibis, is a wading bird in the ibis family Threskiornithidae. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Mesembrinibis.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{found in}} the area include: the golden-green woodpecker, the sunbittern, the king vulture, the {{undulated}} tinamou, the <b>green</b> <b>ibis,</b> the harpy eagle, the white-necked jacobin, the white-throated toucan, the red-and-green macaw, the red-throated caracara, the muscovy duck, the agami heron, etc.|$|E
50|$|The Snowdon Aviary was {{designed}} by Cedric Price, Frank Newby and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, and was built in 1964. A variety of birds have been kept in the aviary since it was opened, and it currently houses <b>green</b> peafowl, sacred <b>ibis,</b> little egrets, cattle egrets, northern bald ibis and grey-headed gulls.|$|R
50|$|It {{lies on the}} {{passageway}} of many migratory birds such as harriers. These birds pass through this area during September. Birds commonly seen in the sanctuary are harriers, eastern imperial eagle, tawny eagle, short-toed eagle, sparrow, and little <b>green</b> bee-eaters, black <b>ibis</b> and demoiselle cranes, which stay till March. Skylarks, crested larks, ring doves, and brown doves are seen throughout the year.Desert fox and desert cat can also be spotted along with typical avifauna such as partridge and sand grouse.|$|R
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is largely}} crepuscular. Less gregarious than its relatives, {{it is usually}} seen alone or in pairs. When it does forage in mixed-species flocks, it tends {{to remain on the}} fringes, usually among other green ibises. It {{regularly}} perches in trees.|$|E
50|$|If seen in good light, the <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> is distinctively dark, and {{unlikely}} {{to be confused with}} any other ibis. In poor light, however, it might be confused with the glossy ibis; the latter (which is bronzy-maroon in color) has longer legs and a slimmer build.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its huge}} range and large population, the <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> is rated {{as a species}} of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature; however, its numbers do appear to be decreasing. It is at least {{occasionally}} hunted (and eaten) by residents of Central and South American countries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is found}} from Costa Rica south to {{northern}} Argentina and Paraguay. However, {{there have been}} sightings from {{as far north as}} Honduras, and fossil records show the species formerly occurred as far north as Kansas in the United States. It is found in a variety of forested wetland habitats, particularly swamps and along the edges of rivers and lakes, at altitudes up to 500 m.|$|E
5000|$|The 600-acre (242-ha) reef {{is known}} to have at least 35 species of coral, 140 species of molluscs, 44 species of crustaceans, and 123 species of fish. The outer reef is about 4 km long. [...] On land there are many types of animal as well {{including}} northern tamanduas, pacas, white-nosed coatis, raccoons, sloths, agoutis, mantled howlers and white-headed capuchins.It has a variety of birds as well including the <b>green</b> <b>ibis,</b> green-and-rufous kingfisher and keel-billed toucan.|$|E
50|$|When {{he first}} {{described}} the <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> in 1789, from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana, Johann Friedrich Gmelin {{gave it the}} scientific name Tantalus cayennensis, assigning it to the same genus {{as a number of}} Old World ibis species. In 1930, James Lee Peters moved it to the monotypic genus Mesembrinibis; it has no subspecies. DNA-DNA hybridization studies show that the species falls squarely into the New World ibis clade, with its closest relatives being the sharp-tailed ibis, the American white ibis and the buff-necked ibis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> is a {{medium-sized}} ibis, with short legs and a long, slender, decurved bill. It measures 45 - 60 cm {{in length and}} ranges from 700 to 890 g in mass. The sexes, which are identical in plumage, overlap somewhat in measurements, though the largest birds are male. Breeding adults have glossy greenish-black bodies, pale green legs and bill, and grey bare facial skin patches. Juveniles are much duller, but can be distinguished from the similar glossy ibis by their bulkier shape, shorter legs and broader wings. This species, like other ibises, flies with neck outstretched. Its flight is heavy, with fewer glides and jerkier wingbeats than its relatives.|$|E
50|$|During the floods, {{almost every}} aquatic {{species in the}} park {{can be found in}} the {{interconnected}} backwaters. During the dry season, prey fish become concentrated in isolated water bodies, providing a veritable feast for predators like the giant otter, the Amazon river dolphin, the pirarucú, and the black and spectacled cayman. Along lake edges, five species of kingfisher, nine species of heron, and specialists like the sunbittern and the <b>green</b> <b>ibis</b> forage for fish and invertebrates. Neotropical cormorants and anhingas fish away from the shore. Even jaguars join in the feast, diving into forest pools to catch large fish, or sitting in ambush for them as they pass through the shallow water channels that connect deeper lakes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} animals {{live in the}} montane forest. Some are residents, and others visit from the {{surrounding}} land. Various species of monkeys, several antelopes, tree hyrax and some larger animals such as elephant and buffalo all live in the forest. Zebra are only found on the northern slopes, where the forest belt is narrowest, and more open. Some rare species, such as the giant forest hog, suni, mountain bongo, and maned rat {{are found in the}} forest. Larger predators include hyena and leopard, and occasionally lion. Many bird species are also found here, including turacos, francolins and hornbills. Various types of sunbirds, parrots, swallows and mountain buzzards are common. At the Met Station, on the Naro Moru route, the olive ibis (Bostrychia olivacea; also called the African <b>green</b> <b>ibis),</b> and Abyssinian ground-thrush can be found, both of which are rare. Also on the Naro Moru route buffalo have been observed digging the soil with their horns and eating it. This is probably because of the nutrients in the soil.|$|E
