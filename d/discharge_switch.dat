40|$|Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) {{applies the}} {{electromagnetic}} principles postulated in the XIXth century and later demonstrated. In {{recent years the}} process has been developed to meet highly demanding market needs involving dissimilar material joining, specially involving difficult-to-weld materials. It is a very high speed joining process that uses an electromagnetic force to accelerate one material against the other, resulting in a solid state weld with no external heat source and no thermal distortions. A high power source, the capacitor, a <b>discharge</b> <b>switch</b> and a coil constitute the minimum equipment necessary for this process. A high intensity current flowing through a coil near an electrically conductive material, locally produce an intense magnetic field that generates eddy currents in the flyer according to Lenz law. The induced electromotive force gives rise to a current whose magnetic field opposes the original change in magnetic flux. The effect of this secondary current moving in the primary magnetic field is the generation of a Lorentz force, which accelerates the flyer at a very high speed. If a piece of material is placed in the trajectory of the flyer, the impact will produce an atomic bond in a solid state weld. This paper discusses the fundamentals of the process in terms of phenomenology and analytical modeling and numerical simulation. Recent industrial applications are presented in terms of materials, joint configurations and real examples as well as advantages and disadvantages of the process...|$|E

40|$|High voltage multi-gap gas {{discharge}} switches {{are very important}} tools for pulsed power applications in accelerator laboratories. They have applications for example in driving fast injection- and extraction magnets and beam dumps. Basically, {{there are two different}} principles used to realise a high voltage switch. One is based on the use of several semiconductor switches, and the other is based on a triggered breakdown in gases or in vacuum. We introduce in this report a new type of high voltage gas <b>discharge</b> <b>switch,</b> which consists of multi-gap coaxial electrode geometry. Initially the inner electrode serves as anode, the outer electrodes as voltage divider for the applied high voltage. This switching device is called, based on its underlying effect, a multi-gap Lorentz Drift Switch (multi-gap LDS). For the initial investigations a two-gap LDS was designed (Fig. 1). For the first investigations the breakdown voltages depend on the product of the pressure and electrode distance of the two-gap LDS was measured. Figure 2 shows the voltage breakdown curve depending on the pressure which is similar to the characteristic of a Paschen branch. For low pressures in the range of several 10 - 2 mbar the breakdown voltage was increasing to a value of 30 kV.

40|$|Switching high {{currents}} {{in the order}} of kA between high voltage potentials is of considerable interest for pulse power, plasma and particle accelerator applications [1, 2]. A main drawback of available switching devices like Thyratrons, Ignitrons and Spark Gaps is the matter of electrode erosion when it comes to switching high currents. Solid State devices like Thyristors or IGBT´s still face serious problems switching voltages of more than 15 kV, because of the limited breakdown voltage of solid state devices. Though staking of solid state switches is a solution [1], it makes the anticipated switch highly expensive. For this reason a new gas <b>discharge</b> <b>switch</b> called the LDS (Lorentz Drift Switch) was invented by the authors [3] and is now under investigation at the J. W. Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt. The main component of this new switch is a coaxial electrode system consisting of a central electrode at positive potential and a outer electrode at ground potential. Situated between the main electrodes is a pin electrode which triggers a discharge if a high voltage pulse is applied. A high current discharge created between the main electrodes will generate a significant amount of Lorentz force, which propels the discharge upwards towards the open end of the coaxial electrode system [2]. The following schematic drawing shows the working principle of the LDS. Fig. 2 : Experimental setup of the LDS Using a pulse transformer and a digital oscilloscope enabled us to determine the switching characteristics of the LDS for a inductive load. The following Fig. 3 shows the measured current flow through the experimental circuit after a trigger impulse has been applied to the pin electrode. C u rren t...|$|E

The {{authors have}} been engaged in coordinated experimental, analytical, and {{computer}} modeling investigations to better characterize the early-time turn-on behavior of high-speed gas <b>discharge</b> <b>switching</b> for a selected range of operating parameters. The investigations have focused on quantifying the first few nanoseconds of plasma closing switch turn-on behavior as a function of key operational parameters (e. g., gas type, gas pressure, gap length, drive circuit impedance, etc.). Various gas species (e. g., hydrogen, nitrogen, SF 6, helium) have been studied experimentally over a pressure range of 0. 1 -bar to 50 -bar using several high-speed <b>discharge</b> <b>switching</b> test fixtures of conical configuration with differing discharge circuit impedances. The near-term objective has been to characterize, through complementary experimental measurements and modeling, the macroscopic turn-on behavior of high-speed gas closing switches under a selected range of operational conditions having practical interest. Longer-term goals of this work are to bring about I improvements in modeling, design, and operational performance of high-speed gas switches for use in ultra-fast, short-pulse-duration, low-impedance circuit applications. Under such conditions, the voltage collapse time and energy losses within the switch itself can significantly degrade overall system performance. This collaborative effort has involved the use of high-resolution 3 -D time-domain electromagnetic modeling, simulation, and digital signal processing to complement and extend the available experimental data. Work has also been underway to develop and incorporate improved discharge channel physics modeling. This paper specifically describes the systems modeling, signal processing, and data analysis aspects of the investigations, and reports on results achieved to date.

Although up to 9000 switching events could be obtained, all the devices failed at some combination of current and repetition rate. Failure was attributed to temperature increases caused by average power dissipated in the thyristor during the switching sequence.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the properties of a magnetically delayed pseudospark switch (PSS). One of the challenges of all low pressure gas <b>discharge</b> <b>switches</b> is {{the reduction of the}} lifetime due to commutation losses resulting in anode heating. This effect can be minimized by carefully dimensioning the saturating inductors. For many decades, this method has been successfully used for thyratrons. In principle, a saturating inductor prevents current flow {{until the end of the}} commutation phase. In contrast to thyratrons a PSS is based on a cold cathode electrode. To reach the low-resistive phase in a PSS, a significant current flow is necessary to allow self-heating of the cathode. A useful compromise has to be found to fulfill these opposing needs. The test setup is shown in Figure 1. Different saturating inductors are connected in series with the PSS, on the anode side. Three different designs of the FINEMET (FT- 3 H) pulsed power core types were used. These cores use a thin ceramic insulation to provide a high break down voltage.

40|$|Axial {{emission}} {{profiles in}} a parallel plate dc micro discharge (feedgas: argon; discharge gap d= 1 mm; pressure p= 10 Torr) were studied by means of time resolved imaging with a fast ICCD camera. Additionally, volt-ampere (V-A) characteristics were recorded and Ar* metastable densities were measured by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). Axial emission profiles in the steady state regime are similar to corresponding profiles in standard size discharges (d= 1 cm, p= 1 Torr). For some discharge conditions relaxation oscillations are present when the micro <b>discharge</b> <b>switches</b> periodically between low current Townsend-like mode and normal glow.

40|$|The {{commonly}} used current-voltage characteristics are found inadequate for describing the pulsed {{nature of the}} high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) discharge, rather, the description needs to be expanded to current-voltage-time characteristics for each initial gas pressure. Using different target materials (Cu, Ti, Nb, C, W, Al, Cr) and a pulsed constant-voltage supply it is shown that the HIPIMS discharges typically exhibit an initial pressure dependent current peak followed by a second phase that is power and material dependent. This suggests that the initial phase of a HIPIMS discharge pulse is dominated by gas ions whereas the later phase has a strong contribution from self-sputtering. For some materials the <b>discharge</b> <b>switches</b> into a mode of sustained self-sputtering. The very large differences between materials cannot be ascribed to the different sputter yields but they indicate that generation and trapping of secondary electrons {{plays a major role}} for current-voltage-time characteristics.

The model is a flat plate in a Mach 2 air flow, equipped with a plasma actuator composed of two electrodes. A weakly ionized plasma was created above the plate by generating a glow discharge with a negative dc potential applied to the upstream electrode. The natural flow exhibited a shock wave with a hyperbolic shape. Pitot measurements and ICCD images of the modified flow revealed that when the discharge was ignited, the shock wave angle increased with the discharge current. The spatial distribution of the surface temperature was measured with an IR camera. The surface temperature increased with the current and decreased along the model. The temperature distribution was reproduced experimentally by placing a heating element instead of the active electrode, and numerically by modifying the boundary condition at the model surface. For the same surface temperature, experimental investigations showed that the shock wave angle was lower with the heating element than for {{the case with the}} <b>discharge</b> <b>switched</b> on.

40|$|Research {{interest}} in the Ar-Xe laser has been strengthened considerably because this laser now produces output powers {{at the level of}} Watts and is becoming the most promising light source in the wavelength region of a few microns. The lasing occurs on the IR transitions (1. 73 - 3. 51 ¿m) between the 5 d- 6 d manifolds of atomic xenon. Our breakthrough in this type of laser came when our results obtained with the electron beam sustained technology showed the beneficial effect of operating at high gas densities. From these observations and the accompanying modeling, the idea was supported to consider the dissociative recombination of ArXe+ or Xe 2 + molecular ions with electrons as the primary channel for filling the upper laser level. Apart from this recombination process by three body collisions the increased density leads to homogeneous line broadening which has also a favourable effect on the power and efficiency. However, a homogeneous inversion density requires a homogeneous discharge in a high-density gas. This is from a technical point of view a great challenge. For continuous operation the waveguide structure with RF excitation has shown so far the best prospects for maintaining a homogeneous discharge at high densities, say above 100 Torr.
