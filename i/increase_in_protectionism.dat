40|$|A low Canadian {{dollar and}} {{competitive}} tax credits {{have created a}} prosperous but volatile film industry in Québec. Film and television production in Québec generated 32, 990 direct and indirect full-time equivalent jobs in 2003 / 2004. This note describes the workflows of the North American film industry in Québec. It examines Technicolor Creative Services, a multinational film processing and distribution company with operations in Québec, and Muse Entertainment Enterprises, a production services company based in Québec. Muse, Technicolor and their customers have located in Québec because of the low Canadian dollar, as well as provincial and federal tax incentives. The industry in which they participate has become technically competitive, producing films of the same quality as those produced in Hollywood. The rise of the Canadian dollar, the introduction of tax incentives in American states rivalling those available in Québec, the decline in made-for-television movie audiences and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>protectionism</b> of the American film industry {{have led to a}} decline in foreign location production in Québec...|$|E

And while Doha will help the world economy, it will also create winners and losers across countries and across sectors within countries (Polaski, 2006). How much developing countries can win or lose depends, to a large extent, on how the issue of agricultural subsidies in developed countries is resolved. But it also depends on the definition of sensitive commodities and the effects of further liberalising trade in manufacturing goods. Developing countries will have to look very carefully at the gains and losses from proposed Doha Round agreements, the so-called ?modalities?. For many developing countries, the nature of any agreed package will be more important than reaching any agreement by a specific deadline.

They initiated a period of fiscal reform, which included several tax increases, limits to wage <b>increases,</b> but <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>protectionism</b> and reorganization of state-owned enterprises. Congress passed an anti-terrorism law, criticized for its vague and imprecise terms, that may {{allow it to be}} used against political opponents of the government. Hugo Moyano, main union leader, who was a strong supporter of kirchnerism, began to oppose the President. Moyano would later organize a big protest at Plaza de Mayo, with 30,000 people, requesting the abolition of capital gains tax. However, her close union ally Enrique Omar Suárez, another powerful union leader, has remained in support of her. The Vice President Amado Boudou got involved in a political scandal, suspected of favoring the Ciccone currency printing business. The poor maintenance of rail services led to a rail disaster that left 51 dead and 703 injured. The government has also begun to devote more attention to the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute (prompted by the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War). Fernández also supported the nationalization of YPF.|$|R
50|$|After 1985, {{a new and}} {{important}} incentive materialised for such investments. The rapid rise {{in the value of}} the yen seriously undermined the international competitiveness of many products manufactured in Japan. While this situation had been true for textiles in the 1960s, after 1985 it also affected a much wider range of more sophisticated products. Japanese manufacturers began actively seeking lower cost production bases. This factor, rather than any <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> foreign <b>protectionism,</b> appeared to lie behind the acceleration of overseas investments after 1985.|$|R

Real per capital income grew much faster than in the 1970 s both in South and East Asia, and the income gap between the Asia Pacific region and industrialised countries narrowed substantially (Table 1). Projections of e. g. the World Bank [1990] and the Nomura Research Institute [Kwan, 1990] indicate that these favourable trends {{are likely to be}} sustainable throughout the 1990 s. Estimates of per capita income growth range from 5 to 7 per cent for East and Southeast Asia and around 3 per cent for South Asia. The good prospects for the coming decade are, nonetheless, overshadowed by rising uncertainties and concerns about persistent and severe trade imbalances, the emergence of trading blocs and the future destiny of the former socialist economies. ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{language}} of our model, the reform process initiated in the 1990 s redirected capital to the primary sector and labor to the tertiary sector within the area of diversification of production and trade. The balance of power shifted away from the industrialists and toward the coalition of agricultural producers and service providers. During the 2000 s, the improvement in terms of trade has helped them to consolidate their power. The distributional conflict has not disappeared; there are urban sectors that would benefit from an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>protectionism.</b> However, the pro-agricultural coalition appears stronger than in the past. Indeed, in March 2008 a government attempt to increase export taxes on soybeans and sunflower was met with a nationwide lockout by farming associations. The proposal was finally defeated in Congress after 4 months of large-scale demonstrations in urban areas and road blocks in rural areas. 12 However, as we learned from the country’s experiences {{in the early twentieth}} century, such coalition between landowners and service workers is viable only under favorable external conditions and it is politically weak.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of trade policies in the crisis of 2008, this paper constructs the overall trade restrictiveness indices {{for a wide range}} of countries using their tariff schedules in 2008 and 2009. The index summarizes the trade policy stance of a country, taking into account the share of each good in trade as well as its corresponding import demand elasticity. Results show that there is no widespread <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>protectionism</b> via tariff policies since the global financial crisis has unfolded. While many countries have adjusted tariffs upward on selected products, only a handful of countries, such as Malawi, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and China focus on products that have significant impacts on trade flows. The United States and the European Union, by contrast, rely mainly on anti-dumping duties to shield domestic industries. Overall, while the rise in tariffs and anti-dumping duties in these countries may have jointly caused global trade to drop by as much as US$ 43 billion during the crisis period, it explains less than 2 percent of the collapse in world trade.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new model}} of trade policy under dictatorship and democratization. The paper makes two contributions. One is to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} relationship between political institutions and economic performance by studying the endogenous interaction between the form of government and trade policy. If a ruling elite own a factor that is scarce then democratization goes hand in hand with trade liberalization and an increase in economic efficiency, as argued by classical scholars. But if the elite own an abundant factor then democratization is accompanied by an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>protectionism</b> and a reduction in e¢ ciency. The paper also characterizes the circumstances under which a dictatorship can use trade policy to forestall democratization. The paper?s second contribution is to show how trade policy can be manipulated to maintain the status quo in the face of world price shocks, thus opening the door to a re-examination of trade policy responses to technology shocks. The model is used to explain an interesting episode of trade policymaking between 1815 and 1846, during which time Britain substantially liberalized trade while Prussia, on the other side of the grain market, signi?cantly increased protectionism. It is also used to shed light on the wide-spread imposition of export restrictions in response to the 2007 - 08 food crisis.

40|$|During {{the recent}} global {{recession}} world trade fell sharply and greater competition {{has been accompanied}} by an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> global <b>protectionism.</b> Global protectionism threatens to restrict the development of trade relations between China and the U.

Chinese industries suffered various protectionist measures or safeguard measures imposed by other foreign nations especially the U. S. This research study focuses on an empirical investigation of the impacts of global protectionism on recent trade {{relations between the two countries}} with the illustration of impact of these measures on two Chinese industries toys and tires. Based on two hypotheses, the research suggests that U. S. protectionist measures negatively impacted on the toy industry. However, the protectionist impacts on the tire industry appeared to be outweighed by recessionary impacts. Recommendations for strategies that could help avoid or minimize the negative impacts from the global protectionism are made...|$|R

40|$|The word {{globalization}} conjures {{the image}} of a globe with a singular mass of humanity. It has been suggested that globalization will inevitably bring about a world of singular economic, cultural and political system.

There were four periods of trade policy at that time: from Czechoslovakia's {{establishment}} to 1922 - 1923 : this period can be described by a high level of protectionism; liberalization of import and export was typical of the period until 1929; the years 1930 - 1933 were influenced by <b>increasing</b> <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> international trade {{as a result of the}} world economic crisis; after 1933, gradual liberalization of trade-policy tools occurred, but the level of liberalization from the twenties was not renewed any more. Differences in the results reflected by foreign trade indicators were in agreement with the lines of trade policy in these different periods. Achievements in the second half of the twenties (import and export growth, active balance of trade, contribution of foreign trade to economy development) are evident. Commodity structure and destinations corresponded to indicators of industrialized economy. A drop of Czechoslovak import and export, a reversal of balance of trade and other negative macroeconomic trends were recorded at the beginning of the thirties. The performance level improved in the second half of the thirties, but it did not match the values of the late twenties. foreign trade, Czechoslovakia between the two world wars, protectionism and liberalism, import and export, balance of trade, commodity structure...|$|R
