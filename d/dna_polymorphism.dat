50|$|Genetic Linkage studies {{attempt to}} find a {{correlation}} between the diagnosis and inheritance of certain alleles within families who have two or more ill relatives. An analysis of a linkage study uses a wide chromosomal region, whereas a genetic association study endeavors to identify a specific <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> {{which can be a}} deletion, inversion, or repletion of a sequence. Case-control association studies can be used as an exploratory tool for narrowing the area of interest after preliminary mapping of a gene by a linkage study.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} detect <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> {{is essential for}} the completion of a high-resolution polymorphic linkage map of the human genome. Currently the most informative polymorphisms are the multiallelic dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms. However, many gene sequences lack an associated dinucleotide repeat sequence. We used GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to screen for <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in the following six gene sequences: MCC, p 53, prealbumin (transthyretin), rhodopsin, S-antigen, and TGF-alpha. A single-base sequence polymorphism was identified in each of these gene sequences. Some of these polymorphisms were multiallelic and highly informative. Our results demonstrate the value of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for both identifying and analyzing human <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms.</b> The ability to detect highly informative polymorphisms within gene sequences will greatly contribute to a gene-based polymorphic linkage map...|$|R

At least one study by the International Institute of Anthropology in Paris, France, confirmed similarities in the Y-haplotype frequencies in Lebanese, Palestinian, and Sephardic Jewish men, identifying them as [...] "three Near-Eastern populations sharing a common geographic origin." [...] The study surveyed one Y-specific <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> (p49/Taq I) in 54 Lebanese and 69 Palestinian males, and compared with the results found in 693 Jews from three distinct Jewish ethnic groups; Mizrahi Jews, Sephardi Jews, and Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{naturally}} occurring mutations humans {{differ in their}} DNA, which is called variation or polymorphism of DNA. The {{most common type of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> are SNPs (short for “single nucleotide polymorphism”). SNPs may influence the way individuals absorb, transport, store or metabolize nutrients. This may determine requirements for different nutrients and this assumption forms the basis for nutrigenetic sciences.Moreover, different metabolic potential of the human body can imply an advantage in terms of natural selection. For that reason, for example, the ability to digest lactose, the principal sugar of milk, also in adulthood spread in cattle-rising populations.|$|E
50|$|The gene of {{interest}} directly causes production of protein(s) or RNA that produce a desired trait or phenotype, whereas markers (a DNA sequence or the morphological or biochemical markers produced due to that DNA) are genetically linked to the gene {{of interest}}. The {{gene of interest}} and the marker tend to move together during segregation of gametes due to their proximity on the same chromosome and concomitant reduction in recombination (chromosome crossover events) between the marker and gene of interest. For some traits, the gene of interest has been discovered {{and the presence of}} desirable alleles can be directly assayed {{with a high level of}} confidence. However, if the gene of interest is not known, markers linked to the gene of interest can still be used to select for individuals with desirable alleles of the gene of interest. When markers are used there may be some inaccurate results due to inaccurate tests for the marker. There also can be false positive results when markers are used, due to recombination between the marker of interest and gene (or QTL). A perfect marker would elicit no false positive results. The term 'perfect marker' is sometimes used when tests are performed to detect a SNP or other <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> in the gene of interest, if that SNP or other polymorphism is the direct cause of the trait of interest. The term 'marker' is still appropriate to use when directly assaying the gene of interest, because the test of genotype is an indirect test of the trait or phenotype of interest.|$|E

Twenty-four cases were of maternal origin, and three were of paternal origin. Twenty-two unequivocal crossover events were identified. Sixteen crossovers were observed in 22 chromosome pairs nondisjoining at the second meiotic division. Fifty percent of crossover events in MI nondisjunction are detectable by molecular genetic means. Thus, the results suggest that, in this sample, each nondisjoined chromosome 21 pair has been involved in at least one crossover event...|$|R
50|$|Specific {{regions of}} DNA, such as {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL), include genes affecting observable traits {{and thus have}} statistically detectable associations with those traits. However, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> that are not linked to specific traits are now more commonly used as markers for genetic diversity studies; Different levels of genetic diversity information {{can be obtained from}} different kinds of genetic markers. For example, autosomal polymorphisms are used for population diversity estimates, estimation of genetic relationships and population genetic admixture, whereas mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> are used to detect geographic regionsof domestication, reconstructing migration routes and the number of female founders. Drawing such inferences is possible because mitochondrial DNA sequences are transferred only through egg cells of the female.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} mobility shift {{analysis of}} single-stranded DNAs on neutral {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} to detect <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms.</b> This method follows digestion of genomic DNA with restriction endonucleases, denaturation in alkaline solution, and electrophoresis on a neutral polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane, the mobility shift due to a nucleotide substitution of a single-stranded DNA fragment could be detected by hybridization with a nick-translated DNA fragment or more clearly with RNA copies synthesized on each strand of the DNA fragment as probes. As the mobility shift caused by nucleotide substitutions {{might be due to}} a conformational change of single-stranded DNAs, we designate the features of single-stranded DNAs as single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs). Like restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), SSCPs were found to be allelic variants of true Mendelian traits, and therefore they should be useful genetic markers. Moreover, SSCP analysis has the advantage over RFLP analysis that it can detect <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> and point mutations at a variety of positions in DNA fragments. Since <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> have been estimated to occur every few hundred nucleotides in the human genome, SSCPs may provide many genetic markers...|$|R

In three families, the OI phenotype segregated independently of the <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> whereas in one family, the OI phenotype cosegregated with a <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> in a manner suggesting linkage.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{advances}} in next-generation sequencing (NGS), datasets for DNA polymorphisms among various species and strains have been produced, stored, and distributed. However, reliability varies among these datasets because the experimental and analytical conditions used differ among assays. Furthermore, such datasets have been frequently distributed from the websites of individual sequencing projects. It is desirable to integrate <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> data into one database featuring uniform quality control that is distributed {{from a single}} platform at a single place. <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> annotation database (DNApod; [URL] is an integrated database that stores genome-wide <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> datasets acquired under uniform analytical conditions, and this includes uniformity {{in the quality of}} the raw data, the reference genome version, and evaluation algorithms.

40|$|Breeding {{for wood}} quality {{is limited by}} the long {{generation}} times and the delay before wood quality can be measured reliably. Association studies allow links between phenotype and genotype to be made, and are a prelude to accelerated domestication of trees by molecular breeding approaches. This study uses association genetics to identify <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> that correlate with solid wood properties of Eucalyptus pilularis Smith (blackbutt). We undertook extensive phenotyping of dimensional stability, growth and structural wood properties on a nine-year-old progeny trial established by Forests NSW at Hannam Vale, near Port Macquarie in NSW. A subset of 372 phenotyped individuals representing 284 families collected from 37 provenances was used as the association population for genotypic assessment. Fifty-two out of 127 novel <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> were surveyed within four candidate genes, CCR, CAD, MYB 1 and MYB 2. Several putative associations between wood quality traits and selected <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> are reported, along with the likely mechanism of action on wood quality.

40|$|Knowing {{the amount}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> is {{essential}} to understand the mechanism of maintaining <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> in a natural population. The amount of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism</b> can be measured by {{the average number of}} nucleotide differences per site (π), the proportion of segregating (polymorphic) site (s) and the minimum number of mutations per site (s*). Since the latter two quantities depend on the sample size, θ is often used as a measure of {{the amount of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> where θ = 4 Nμ, N is the effective population size and μ is the neutral mutation rate per site per generation. It is known that θ estimated from π, s and s* under the infinite site model can be biased when the mutation rate varies among sites. We have therefore developed new methods for estimating θ under the finite site model. Using computer simulations, {{it has been shown that}} the new methods give almost unbiased estimates even when the mutation rate varies among sites substantially. Furthermore, we have also developed new statistics for testing neutrality by modifying Tajima's D statistic. Computer simulations suggest that the new test statistics can be used even when the mutation rate varies among sites...|$|E
