5|$|After <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> the {{unsuccessful}} Ogaden {{campaign of}} the late 1970s, the Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{sensed that}} he would be traded that offseason due to the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> his suspension. On December 11, Ellis was traded to the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) along with pitcher Ken Brett and top infield {{prospect}} Willie Randolph, in exchange for pitcher Doc Medich. Tired of Ellis' behavior, Pittsburgh general manager Joe L. Brown insisted that the Yankees take Ellis as part of the deal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fallout</b> <b>from</b> {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> {{the collapse of the}} InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019.|$|E

5|$|Following a light {{microscopy}} examination in 2001, it was initially {{thought that the}} rains were coloured by <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study commissioned by the Government of India concluded that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial green alga from the genus Trentepohlia. An international team later identified the exact species as T. annulata.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2011, the Irish Examiner {{reported}} that Micheál Martin {{had moved to}} pull the party out of the presidential race over the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> the approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected. On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív told Raidió na Gaeltachta that he believed the party should put forward a candidate.|$|E
50|$|This {{foundation}} {{paid off}} with Yankee championships in 1996, and from 1998-2000. However, Michael was fired before the Yankees dynasty began, {{as a result}} of the <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> the 1994 strike, which ruined the Yankees having the best record in the American League that year in 1995. It was the second time that the Yankees fired Michael {{as a result of}} a strike; in 1981, he was fired as manager {{as a result of the}} strike that year.|$|R
50|$|A fallout shelter is {{a shelter}} {{designed}} specifically for a nuclear war, with thick walls made from materials intended to block the radiation <b>from</b> <b>fallout</b> resulting <b>from</b> a nuclear explosion. Many such shelters were constructed as civil defense measures during the Cold War. A blast shelter protects against more conventional bomb blasts. Its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure and also from earthquake.|$|R
30|$|From Table 7, the {{prominence}} of tax as the principal component {{in the first four}} phases indicates that the loopholes in the tax administration policy in Nigeria is so obvious, and serves as an advantage to entrepreneurs. Whereas, in South Africa, {{the prominence}} of market regulation in all the five phases indicates that the market regulation policies are favourable in promoting entrepreneurial activities. This position in South Africa is not farfetched; given the <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> the abolishment of apartheid regime and the standardized market policies.|$|R
5|$|The British {{government}} formally {{requested a}} permanent test facility on 30 October 1953. Due to concerns about nuclear <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> the previous tests at Emu Field and the site's inadequate infrastructure and water supply, the recently surveyed Maralinga site {{was selected for}} this purpose. The new site was announced in May 1955. It was developed as a joint, co-funded facility between the British and Australian governments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> {{these tests}} was {{measured}} using sticky paper, air sampling devices, and water sampled from rainfall and reservoirs. The radioactive cloud from Buffalo 1 (One Tree) reached a height of , exceeding the predicted , and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland. All four Buffalo tests were criticised by the 1985 McClelland Royal Commission, which concluded that they were fired under inappropriate conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E

But even as you have studied and researched these individual issues, you have probably wondered whether something bigger is going on.

5|$|There was {{an opinion}} that by {{analyzing}} the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> this test, the Soviets (led in their H-bomb work by Andrei Sakharov) could have deciphered the new American design. However, this was later denied by the Soviet bomb researchers. Because of official secrecy, little information about the bomb's development was released by the government, and press reports often attributed the entire weapon's design and development to Teller and his new Livermore Laboratory (when it was actually developed by Los Alamos).|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{also played}} four non-conference games. The game against Penn State was {{originally}} scheduled {{as part of}} the 2004 season, however the series was moved back at the request of Alabama due to <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> NCAA sanctions being levied on the program. The non-conference schedule also included games against San Jose State of the Western Athletic Conference, Duke of the Atlantic Coast Conference and Georgia State of the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). On December 5, it was announced Alabama would face Big Ten co-champion Michigan State in the Capital One Bowl. In what was the first meeting between the programs, the Tide defeated the Spartans 49–7 and secured their third consecutive ten-win season.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> the Watergate scandal.|$|E

The <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> the Evergreen Game are surprising: (1) Although the game is about solving MAX-CSP problems, a simple, efficient algorithm is sufficient {{to play the game}} well. The best game-playing strategy leads to a significant reduction of the huge search space for both formula generation and solving. (2) The Evergreen Game shows us how to systematically translate a CSP formula into a polynomial that is fundamental in playing the game well. (3) We show evidence that those polynomials are useful for efficient MAX-CSP as well as MAX-SAT solvers...|$|R

The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E
