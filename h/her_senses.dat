5|$|Shirley {{resolves}} {{to complete}} a ritual to fully become the Merines and fulfill her destiny, meeting with Walter and the Ferines leader Maurits Welnes. However, soldiers from the country of Gadoria attack during the ceremony attempting to kill her thinking she willfully sided with Vaclav, with Fenimore jumping {{in the way of}} one of their blades and dying instead. The traumatic event causes Shirley to be fully engulfed by Nerifes, the malevolent spirit of the ocean itself, before leaving with Maurits. Senel and his friends go after her, passing through the deeper areas of the ship where they discover from fractured recordings that the Legacy was a colony ship from another world, and the Ferines came to the planet and made war with the Orerines 4000 years ago. Arriving at Maurits' stronghold, the party faces Walter, who reveals his jealousy over Shirley choosing Senel over him, and fights until his life gives out. They learn from Maurits that it was in fact the Orerines, not the Ferines, who are the outsiders. He explains that the Orerines' terraforming technology upset the will of the sea so much that his people can no longer live in it, and wishes to use Shirley to flood the world and appease the ocean so that the Ferines can thrive once more. After he is beaten and Shirley brought back to <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> Maurits summons a physical manifestation of Nerifes itself, which is driven back by Senel and his friends. In the end, Maurits resolves to put aside old hatreds and work towards an era of peace between Orerines and Ferines as the characters return to their old lives.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{artists with}} synesthesia, such as Carol Steen and Marcia Smilack (a {{photographer}} who waits until {{she gets a}} synesthetic response from what she sees and then takes the picture), use their synesthesia to create their artwork. Brandy Gale, a Canadian visual artist, experiences an involuntary joining or crossing of any of <b>her</b> <b>senses</b> – hearing, vision, taste, touch, smell and movement. Gale paints from life rather than from photographs and by exploring the sensory panorama of each locale attempts to capture, select, and transmit these personal experiences.|$|E
25|$|To bring Fanny to <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> Sir Thomas {{sends her}} for a visit to her parents in Portsmouth, hoping that the {{contrast}} will awaken her {{to the value of}} Henry's offer. She sets off with William and sees him in his first berth as a commissioned officer. At Portsmouth, she develops a firm bond with her younger sister, Susan, but is taken aback by the contrast between her dissolute surroundings — noise, chaos, unpalatable food, crude conversation, and filth everywhere — and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits her there. Although Fanny still refuses him, her attitude begins to soften, particularly as Edmund and Mary seem to be moving toward an engagement.|$|E

25|$|When Nina woke up {{from the}} cryosleep, she {{suffered}} heavy amnesia, a fate from which her sister Anna was spared. She was also controlled by the recently awakened Ogre, the God of Fighting who sent her to participate in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 to assassinate Jin Kazama - Heihachi Mishima's grandson. Near {{the end of the}} tournament, Jin managed to beat Nina back to <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> allowing her to break free from Ogre's control. As an act of compassion, Anna wanted to end Nina's job of an assassin, however wanted to continue their rivalry. So Anna worked intensively with Dr. Boskonovitch to bring her sister's memories back. However, the project failed when Nina recovered the memory about the fact that she and her sister did not get along. After this, Nina left and did not contact Anna for some time.|$|E
25|$|Their predicament {{began on}} June 9, 1976, {{the day of}} her twenty-sixth birthday. The day before, she and Kevin had moved into a house a few miles away from their old {{apartment}} in Los Angeles. While unpacking, Dana suddenly becomes dizzy, and her surroundings begin to fade away. When she comes to <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> she finds herself {{at the edge of a}} wood, near a river where a small, red-haired boy is drowning. Dana wades in after him, drags him to the shore, and tries to resuscitate him. The boy's mother, who had been unable to save him, begins screaming and hitting Dana, accusing her of killing her son, whom she identifies as Rufus. A man arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. She becomes dizzy again and arrives back at her new house with Kevin beside her. Kevin, shocked at her disappearance and reappearance, tries to understand if the whole episode was real or a hallucination.|$|E

25|$|After some time, Artemis {{returned}} to Themyscira to aid her Amazon sisters in the uneasy living conditions {{they continued to}} work in due to lingering animosities between the two tribes. Civil war eventually broke out {{between the two groups}} of Amazons, leaving Artemis to take up the title of her tribe's chief warrior, or Shim'Tar. She did this in the hopes of ending the war and to guide both tribes to peaceful negotiations. As Shim'Tar, Artemis battled Queen Hippolyta, who was acting as the newest Wonder Woman. During their battle, Artemis reminded Hippolyta that the Themyscirian queen was not given the armor of Wonder Woman out of honor, but rather as a punishment for causing the death of not only Artemis, but of her daughter Diana as well. Ultimately coming to <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> Hippolyta finally forgave the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall for their previous transgressions, and joined her daughter Diana on the battlefield. Together Queen Hippolyta and Princess Diana renounced their crowns, leaving the island without a structured government in the hopes of ending the needless slaughter brought on by the war. They were successful, and Artemis and the Themyscirian General Philippus were later voted to be co-rulers of the island. Philippus was given the title of Chancellor and Archon Eponymous, whereas Artemis was given the title of Polemarch. It is explained that Archon Eponymous equates to the Civic Office of a Presidential title, whereas the position of Polemarch translates to War Leader, similar to the position of Commander-In-Chief.|$|E
500|$|Scully and Bonsaint {{drive to}} the Turner home. Scully, peering through the windows, discovers Melissa {{attempting}} to {{set fire to the}} house, with her, her daughter and Chinga all trapped inside. Bonsaint breaks down the nailed door as Melissa runs to a closet and grabs hold of a hammer which she, against her will, turns upon herself. Thinking quickly, Scully grabs the Chinga doll and throws it inside a microwave oven in the kitchen. As the doll melts, Melissa drops the hammer and regains <b>her</b> <b>senses.</b> Returning to the office on Monday, Scully downplays any excitement or involvement regarding the case, insisting that she was only relaxing on her vacation. [...] In the final scene, a fisherman is seen pulling up a lobster trap, and in it is the burned doll, which comes back to life.|$|E
500|$|... "Alejandro" [...] {{created a}} media uproar {{after the release}} of the video because of its use of {{religious}} imagery. One of the most discussed scenes in the video was when Gaga, dressed in a latex nun outfit, swallowed rosary beads. The Catholic League criticized the video for its use of religious imagery, accusing Gaga of [...] "playing a Madonna copy-cat". Moncia Herrara said of the mayhem: [...] " [...] courts religious controversy {{in much the same way}} that Madonna's 'Like a Prayer' video once did, intermingling Catholic imagery like rosary beads and nun's robes with sexual cues." [...] In an interview with MTV, Klein explained that the religious symbolism was not meant to denote anything negative, but to represent Gaga's battle between the darker and lighter forces. Thus at the end of the film, she is portrayed again in her nun's habit. Klein added that the significance behind her mouth and eyes disappearing was [...] "because she is withdrawing <b>her</b> <b>senses</b> from the world of evil and going inward towards prayer and contemplation." [...] He added that the scene where Gaga devours the rosary beads was her act of theophagy, the desire to consume the body of God, the rosary being symbolic of the Holy.|$|E

500|$|The {{cancelled}} {{journey was}} the beginning of the end. A crying, defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort Hornbæk in Denmark, a much shorter trip, but to <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> a delightfully refreshing one. [...] There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure any attention to Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. [...] This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. [...] "For the sake of us both it is best that I do not return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. [...] "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." [...] At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, Anne McCormick {{wrote to}} Arthur Hays Sulzberger, [...] "I hope you won't {{expect me to}} revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff." [...] Later, she interviewed major {{political}} leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, [...] " [...] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, [...] "'It will {{come as a surprise to}} you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl, he began... asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all <b>her</b> <b>senses,</b> not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'" [...] The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune, where [...] "he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs." ...|$|E
