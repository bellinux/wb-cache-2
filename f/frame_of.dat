In this paper, we {{investigate}} induced <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> refer-ence {{that provide a}} new means to improve localisations, to increase the precision of localisations, and to compensate the lack of posi-tional information. We first review existing approaches to classify and define <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> reference in general. We then introduce induced <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> reference and provide several examples for this concept. A prototypical implementation {{in the context of}} a mobile tourist guide demonstrates the utility <b>of</b> induced <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> references.

50|$|This {{pulldown}} {{method is}} sometimes used {{in order to}} convert 24 frame/s material to 25 frame/s. Usually, this involves a film to PAL transfer without the aforementioned 4% speedup.

In order to accommodate this mismatch in frame rate, 24 <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> film have to be distributed over 50 PAL fields.
