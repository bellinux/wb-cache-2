25|$|During the week-long clashes that {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} May 2008 in Beirut and other regions of the country, the army was unable to prevent rival Lebanese groups from fighting each other. This was because the army, along with the government, had thought it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> rival groups would eventually end the violence and sort out the dispute between them, alone, other than involving the national army which may have led to great divisions between the soldiers, just like in the civil war. It would have also caused an out cry to the soldiers that could have died, leading to even greater divisions and blame to the political forces. However, whenever ceasefire was brought into action in a specific area or district in Beirut or else where in the country, the LAF would straight away enforce peace. On May 13, the national army had announced that if the clashes would not end as soon as possible, it would have to intervene and use force if necessary to stop them.|$|E

Square Enix President Yoichi Wada has stated that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but the lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song instead.

[...] Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation thought that the episode could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> the guest cast was up to a better quality. However, she felt that the episode fell foul of several TNG season one writing errors, such as Deanna Troi's statements breaking any mounting tension and the crew failing to do such quite simple steps such as separating feuding aliens and William Riker being held hostage {{for the second time in}} successive episodes.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said the}} episode {{included}} some good laughs but [...] "never kicks into high gear" [...] {{and said the}} themes might have worked better as subplots than a full episode: [...] "'Fishsticks' {{is one of those}} episodes that typically occur around now in the South Park season. It's not great, not bad – hovering somewhere around amusing towards forgettable." [...] Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said he was disappointed by the episode and thought the message about celebrity self-delusion might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> it focused on only West or Mencia, rather than both. Although O'Neal liked the West song in the episode's final scene, O'Neal said [...] "cramming (West and Mencia) together — even mixed in with Cartman's very funny fantasy sequences — felt too cobbled to me, and the time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made the respective digs start to feel a little too one-note." ...|$|E

On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating [...] "I need all the strength for the occasion I can have." [...] In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president.

Although Uematsu was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role {{was taken over by}} Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy XIV. The score features some pieces orchestrated by Yoshihisa Hirano, Toshiyuki Oomori, and Kunihito Shiina, with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra.

500|$|F.R. Leavis {{argued that}} Boswell's {{criticisms of the}} play – [...] "that [...] has no sense of the theatre, and worse, cannot present or {{conceive}} his themes dramatically" [...] – were [...] "obvious", and that Irene was a failure because Johnson's best poetry (such as The Vanity of Human Wishes) was [...] "a poetry of statement, exposition and reflection: nothing could be remoter from the Shakespearean use of language [...] than the Johnsonian." [...] Like Eliot, Leavis suggested that the play might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> Johnson had not been determined to write it in blank verse:He is clearly determined that his verse shall not be changed into the 'periods of a declaimer', and that it shall not {{be said that the}} audience cannot easily perceive 'where the lines end or begin' (see his remarks on blank-verse in the Life of Milton). [...] In couplets, of course, he couldn't have written so dismally. [...] With the absence of rhyme and of the movement goes the absence of wit. [...] And without the wit he is without the Johnsonian weight. Johnson biographer Walter Jackson Bate has attempted to defend Irene, arguing that the reason why it is considered so bad is that the reader cannot help being aware that [...] "it is by one of the masters of English prose style (who also had a powerful command of one kind of poetic style), and it is also by one of the supreme critics of literature in whatever language". Bate claims that if contemporary readers were able to encounter the play without knowing who had written it, [...] "it would not seem too bad"; but since we cannot forget Johnson's achievements in other fields of literature, reading Irene is an especially depressing experience: [...] "the heart begins after a while to sink except in the most resolute Johnsonian, and sometimes even then." ...|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost feel the pain in her delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E
500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{described}} it as a [...] "motorcycle mayhem meets biblical betrayal." [...] MTV News' James Montogomery called the video as a pure pop clip, [...] "albeit one that looks great and is sure to earn the ire of a few folks on the religious right." [...] He added that [...] "Judas" [...] is, at its sacred heart, an artistic explosion contained within the confines of a traditional pop clip. Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly did not like the video at first, calling it her weakest effort to date and attributing it to Gibson's choreography and the literal storyline. However, he admitted that after watching the video a few times, he became fond of it. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger felt that there was neither anything blasphemous about the video, nor anything too daring about it. McCall explained that the dancing in the video is a [...] "pleasure to watch", but would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> the camera work was more professional. According to him, the only eye-catching prop in the video was the gun that turned into a lipstick. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone was certain that the video would offend some Christians for its irreverent and highly sexualized take on Jesus Christ; he also said that Gaga interpreted the Biblical story in her own style. Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine complimented the production of the video by calling it [...] "visually stunning", while adding that [...] "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary. It takes familiar swatches from Gaga's palette (the leather-and-chain aesthetic of [...] "Telephone"; the plaintive, tear-stained camera stare of [...] "Bad Romance") and puts them all together for a competently executed work." [...] Phil Fox Rose, while reviewing the video for The Washington Post, gave it a positive review stating that he found it [...] "moving, both artistically and spiritually." [...] He then went on to explain how the religion related accusations against Gaga were completely biased. VH1 found that the video was inspired by Madonna's [...] "Like a Prayer", the films Our Lady of the Assassins, The Wild Angels and Romeo + Juliet, and the American television series Lost. NME named 'Judas' the fourth worst music video ever, describing it as [...] "an attempt to jump on the Madonna/Catholicism bandwagon that so incredibly misjudged it's quite comical." ...|$|E
