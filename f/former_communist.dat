5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> states in Eastern Europe).|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa's {{contention}} for the 2000 {{presidential election}} {{ended with a}} crushing defeat when he polled 1.01 percent of the vote. His humiliation was increased because Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was re-elected {{in the first round}} with 54 percent of the vote, is a <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> apparatchik. Wałęsa polled in seventh place, after which he announced his withdrawal from Polish politics.|$|E
5|$|In addition, it {{was often}} claimed that the Party did not allow any member to resign, so {{a person who had}} been a member for a short time decades {{previously}} could be considered as suspect as a current member. Many of the hearings and trials of McCarthyism featured testimony by <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> Party members such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, and Whittaker Chambers, speaking as expert witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Within the Socialist Party, {{there was}} a bitter dispute over the {{permanent}} name of the party, which may have reflected underlying tensions between the two merged parties. The former Social Democrats preferred [...] "Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party", while <b>former</b> <b>Communists</b> wanted [...] "Hungarian Socialist Communist Workers' Party" [...] instead. Within {{the ranks of the}} <b>former</b> <b>Communists</b> themselves, a split developed between the rural and urban factions.|$|R
50|$|Even some <b>former</b> <b>Communists</b> {{were leading}} {{members of the}} party, such as {{national}} party coordinator Sandro Bondi and Fernando Adornato.|$|R

5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the <b>former</b> <b>communist</b> secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, {{who was also a}} law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of {{constitutional}} rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> Party members); Rodham worked on child custody and other cases. Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California; the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school. The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973, having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton. He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages of Ceaușescu's rule, when {{liberalization}} was curbed, matein writings were rediscovered and reclaimed by the Optzeciști group of authors, themselves noted for attempting to evade cultural guidelines by adopting fantasy and avant-garde literature. Mircea Cărtărescu, a leading exponent of the Optzeciști and an advocate of Postmodernism, referred to Caragiale as one of his interwar precursors, while Ștefan Agopian acknowledged he pursued Mateiu's interests in his 1981 novel Tache de catifea ("Tache de Velvet"). According to critic Dumitru Ungureanu, it was mainly through Radu Albala that the matein model seeped into the work of various Optzeciști—Cărtărescu, Horia Gârbea and Florin Șlapac among them. Another Postmodernist author, Fundulea native Mircea Nedelciu, paid tribute to matein prose by basing a character of his 1986 novel Tratament fabulatoriu ("Confambulatory Treatment") on Caragiale, and again much later, by adopting the same practice in his final novel Zodia Scafandrului ("Sign of the Deep-sea Diver"). The isolated Postmodernist figure and <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> Party ideologue Paul Georgescu is also believed to have used elements of Craii... as inspiration for his novels of the 1980s. In parallel, as an echo of mateism, more critics grew interested in subjects relating to Caragiale's work. Various comprehensive monographs were published after 1980, including a volume edited by the Museum of Romanian Literature and two influential works written by, respectively, Alexandru George and philosopher Vasile Lovinescu. The latter, with its claim to uncover esoteric layers in Matein texts, remains controversial.|$|E

50|$|The Latvian Unity Party (Latvijas Vienības partija), {{abbreviated}} to LVP was a left-wing political party in Latvia in the 1990s. Established in December 1992, the party primarily represented <b>former</b> <b>communists.</b>|$|R

5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} also {{opened the door for}} the first honest look at Czechoslovakia’s past by Czechoslovakia’s people. Many of the {{investigations}} centered on the country’s history under communism, especially in the instance of the Joseph Stalin-period. In another television appearance, Goldstucker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of <b>former</b> <b>communist</b> leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writer’s Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert, to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world. Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily Prace (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists Union, which by March 1968 had already convinced the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions for foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.|$|E
5|$|German Georg Hackl won {{a silver}} in the singles luge, {{becoming}} the first athlete in Olympic history to win medals in the same individual event in five consecutive Olympics. Canada achieved an unprecedented double by winning both the men's and women's ice hockey gold medals. Canada became embroiled with Russia in a controversy that involved the judging of the pairs figure skating competition. The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze competed against the Canadian pair of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier for the gold medal. The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win the competition, yet the Russians were awarded the gold. The judging broke along Cold War lines with judges from <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> countries favouring the Russian pair and judges from Western nations voting for the Canadians. The only exception was the French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, who awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed {{that she had been}} pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition. The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second medal ceremony held later in the Games. Australian Steven Bradbury became the first gold medallist from the southern hemisphere when he won the 1,000metre short-track speed skating event.|$|E
5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and <b>former</b> <b>Communist</b> Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.|$|E

50|$|While {{the party}} had been {{generally}} aligned with the centre-left, its members had been very diverse ideologically, ranging from the far left (i.e. Franca Rame, {{a former member of}} Soccorso Rosso, and Pancho Pardi, a former activist of Potere Operaio) to the right, thanks to the populist message of the party. The party includes <b>former</b> <b>Communists</b> and <b>former</b> Leghisti, as well as former Missini and several former Christian Democrats. According to 2009 a study by Pino Pisicchio, a political scientist who was then deputy of IdV, 57.1% of the party's MPs were former Christian Democrats or members of post-Christian Democratic parties (including 11.9% from the UDEUR Populars), 9.5% were <b>former</b> <b>Communists,</b> 4.8% came from far-left parties and movements, 2.4% were former Missini and 2.4% former Leghisti.|$|R
25|$|The protesters {{accused the}} FSN of being {{made up of}} <b>former</b> <b>Communists</b> {{and members of the}} Securitate. The protesters did not {{recognize}} the results of the election, which they deemed undemocratic, and were asking for the exclusion from the political life of the <b>former</b> high-ranking <b>Communist</b> Party members. The protest rapidly grew to become an ongoing mass demonstration (known as the Golaniad). The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, with some of the protesters attacking the police headquarters, national television station, and the Foreign Ministry.|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the course}} of a month-long {{demonstration}} in University Square, many protesters had gathered with the goal of attaining official recognition for the 8th demand of the popular Proclamation of Timișoara, which stated that <b>communists</b> and <b>former</b> <b>communists</b> (including President Iliescu himself) should be prevented from holding official functions. Many people, most of them intellectuals, were dissatisfied with Iliescu's first government, made up mostly of <b>former</b> <b>communists,</b> because it implemented reforms very slowly or not at all. There had been a protest and hunger strike since 20 May, the general elections day, when the protesters were angry that Iliescu's FSN won the elections mostly because the opposition had no chance to mount an effective campaign, and that <b>former</b> <b>communists</b> were in power [...] - [...] the only other country of the ex-Soviet bloc in which this happened was Bulgaria, where the Bulgarian Socialist Party won a 52.7% majority. Some among the protesters in University Square grew violent and attacked the police headquarters and the national television station. When the police were unable to contain the violence, Iliescu appealed to the miners to defend the country. Special trains transported some 10,000 miners to the capital, where the miners violently confronted anyone they saw as opposing the government.|$|R
25|$|In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Enver Hoxha, who led Albania {{for four}} decades, died on 11 April 1985.

Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the <b>former</b> <b>Communists</b> in power, but a general strike and urban opposition {{led to the formation}} of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists.
