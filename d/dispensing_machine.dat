25|$|Adoption of telepharmacy in Canada {{began as}} a {{response}} to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation. Remote dispensing machines for medication began operation in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine,</b> the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes. As of 2009, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.|$|E

50|$|Coin-operated {{machines}} that dispensed tobacco were being operated {{as early as}} 1615 in the taverns of England. The machines were portable and made of brass. An English bookseller, Richard Carlile, devised a newspaper <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> for the dissemination of banned works in 1822. Simeon Denham was awarded British Patent no. 706 for his stamp <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1867, the first fully automatic vending machine.|$|E
40|$|Reaching {{hard-to-reach}} and high-risk injecting {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{is one of}} the most important challenges for contemporary needle syringe programs (NSPs). The aim of this review is to examine, based upon the available international experience, the effectiveness of syringe vending machines and mobile van/bus based NSPs in making services more accessible to these hard-to-reach and high-risk groups of IDUs. A literature search revealed 40 papers/reports, of which 18 were on <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> (including vending and exchange machines) and 22 on mobile vans. The findings demonstrate that syringe <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> and mobile vans are promising modalities of NSPs, which can make services more accessible to the target group and in particular to the harder-to-reach and higher-risk groups of IDUs. Their anonymous and confidential approaches make services attractive, accessible and acceptable to these groups. These two outlets were found to be complementary to each other and to other modes of NSPs. Services through <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> and mobile vans in strategically important sites are crucial elements in continuing efforts in reducing the spread of HIV and other blood borne viruses among IDUs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the safety and}} security impact, feasibility, and cost of a program to provide condoms to inmates. A 1 -year pilot study of wall-mounted condom <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> in one California state prison compared pre- and post-intervention rates of penal code violations related to sexual misconduct, contraband, controlled substances, and violence. The rates of penal code violations were unchanged or decreased compared to the pre-pilot year. Discreetly located condom dispensers were vandalized less frequently than those in plain view (p <. 05). Distributing condoms using the pilot model would cost less than $ 2 per inmate annually. Results suggest {{that the use of}} discreetly located <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> is an acceptable, feasible, low-cost option to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and poses no safety or security risk in a typical medium-security prison setting...|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} patent misuse made the patent {{unenforceable}} regarding monetary relief in Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co. Suppiger Co. owned {{a patent on}} salt-tablet <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> that it manufactured. The sales agreement for the machines required customers to purchase salt tablets exclusively from Suppiger. Morton Salt Co., a competitor that also sold salt tablets, manufactured and leased <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> that infringed Suppiger's patent. The Supreme Court denied Suppiger Co. compensation for Morton Salt's infringement, holding that Suppiger's patent was unenforceable because it was using it to restrain competition in unpatented salt. The Court said its ruling would not be different if Morton Salt were not Suppiger's competitor. The Court added that misuse {{could be found in}} conduct falling short of an antitrust violation.|$|R

50|$|Rimmer triumphantly {{returns to}} his {{universe}} with the formula written down only to find Red Dwarf a flaming inferno falling apart with the others gone. The <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> tells him that the other Dwarfers had repaired the prism and {{followed him into the}} mirror universe and, ironically, Rimmer is now the ship's Captain since he's now the only crew member remaining. Rimmer tries to return to the mirror universe, but the microbe has destroyed the laser. Believing it to be his only hope, he prepares to create the antidote but the <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> points out that the formula he has written down is now the formula for the virus, having reverted into its mirror opposite. After exchanging insults, the machine finally gets its own back on Rimmer by launching a can at his head and hitting, knocking him to the ground and causing the now useless slip of paper containing the formula to burn up from the surrounding flames.|$|E
50|$|There was {{originally}} a full-time station master and ticket office. The 1929 ticket office was constructed of timber on tall wooden piles attached {{to both the}} Brook Road bridge and the ground below. It was located at the Moorland Road {{side of the bridge}} at road level. This has now been replaced by a portacabin styled ticket office on the westbound platform and a ticket <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine.</b> The ticket office is manned on weekdays during the morning peak times.

50|$|The Slurpee {{machine has}} a {{separate}} spout for each flavor {{at the front}} of a tumbler or freezer, where patrons pour their own Slurpees. When Slurpees were first introduced, the <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> was located behind the counter, and the clerk was tasked with dispensing the product. Common flavors are frozen Cherry, Coke, and Mountain Dew. But new flavors are introduced regularly. In the Slurpee's early history, flavors rotated much more frequently than today. Slurpee flavors were given novelty names such as Pink Fink, Adults Only, Moonshine, Kissin' Cousin, Gully Washer, Sticky Icky, and Redeye.|$|E
50|$|An {{automated}} dispensing cabinet (ADC) is {{a computerized}} drug storage device or cabinet designed for hospitals.

50|$|After the war, the Vendo {{company began}} {{expanding}} globally. By 1956, vending machines were being shipped internationally to 20 different countries. At the same time, Vendo began experimenting with new ideas. Vending machines that dispensed varieties of goods were manufactured and distributed and existing beverage vending machines {{were given a}} new, sleeker look. It was this time that the company began creating completely automated convenience stores and restaurants as well as drive-in refreshment stations. In 1956, Vendo merged with its primary rival, Vendorlator. It became a major supplier for the entire soft-drink industry and, for a brief period, the company went public. The company's expansion continued into the 1970s as the company expanded its international market and began manufacturing the world's first canned beverage <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Remote {{dispensing}} has {{the potential}} to undermine the services offered by physically present pharmacists. Hands-on patient training on inhalers and glucose meters is not feasible with remote dispensing, and administration of injections is impossible without a physically present pharmacist. Other cognitive services such as in-depth medication consultations are also impractical to conduct over such audiovisual technology, which do not provide acoustic privacy for the patient, nor do they meet mandatory criteria for conducting such services that require an “in-person discussion” to occur. Furthermore, the variety of drugs offered by remote dispensing is limited in comparison to traditional pharmacies, which in the province of Ontario are required to maintain a dispensary of at least 9.3 m2 in area, far greater than that of any remote <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{main area}} of any station has a ticket counter where tickets are {{purchased}} and T-Money transportation cards are recharged. A row of automatic ticket <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> offer tickets. There had been ticket-sellers, at every station, but to cut expenses {{and protect the}} environment, Korail abolished paper tickets. Since then, {{people who do not}} have T-money have to get plastic electronic tickets from the machines. When you arrive at your destination, there are also refund machines, which return \500, that you paid with your ticket price. Maps above the ticket <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> explain the cost for each destination in the system; prices are charged by how far the user rides. These main areas of the station are often decorated with art, and often feature a fish tank. Also, a [...] "library" [...] area is common, with books and chairs for people waiting to meet someone. Each main area leads to at least one ticket gate. In order to enter or exit ticket gates, riders must insert a ticket, or scan a T-Money card against the card pad.|$|R

5000|$|Mortgage Foundation has {{a number}} of {{branches}} which it calls [...] "Occasio Branches". Occasio is Latin for [...] "favorable opportunity" [...] or [...] "special occasion" [...] (which is also the root of the English word, occasion). These branches are designed to provide a more open space than a traditional bank branch, and to have a look and feel similar to that of a contemporary retail store. Instead of teller windows at a counter with a roped-off queue for customers, tellers process customer transactions at individual stations. At these branches, the tellers ordinarily do not give cash directly to customers, but instead give customers a receipt with a PIN. Customers then walk over to an ATM-like money <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> where they enter the one-time generated PIN to receive cash. At some Occasio branches, the money is dispensed directly from the teller station, instead of a central machine.|$|E
50|$|In August 1958 Dotto, {{a popular}} CBS daytime game show, was {{abruptly}} canceled after a contestant found a notebook containing {{the answers to}} every question {{that was to be}} asked to the show's current champion, future journalist Marie Winn. Stempel's allegations about Twenty One began to gain credulity. A grand jury was convened in Autumn 1958 to investigate Dotto and other possible game show fixing, investigated by Joseph Stone, assistant New York district attorney. Stone says in his book Prime Time and Misdemeanors that question writer Glorianne Rader was instructed by Dan Enright and associate producer Al Freedman, who had chosen the categories for the next broadcast earlier in the week, to place them in Barry's <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> a few minutes before airtime; this was done to avoid any slipups in the planned outcome. Stone reached out to former contestants of Twenty One, including one Richard Jackman. Jackman, asked by Enright if he would tell the truth if approached by Stone, said that he would confess to the fixing of Twenty One. Three days after Jackman confessed to Stone, and without advance public warning, Twenty One was canceled after its broadcast of October 17, 1958 amongst plummeting ratings. A nighttime version of Concentration took over its time slot the following week.|$|E
