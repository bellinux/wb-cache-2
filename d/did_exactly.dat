5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E
5|$|Although John was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E

TIA <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> that, accumulating shares of Trans World Airlines (TWA), an even bigger target than National. TWA had airline revenues about 14 times those of TIA, and the total revenue of TWA's parent corporation, Trans World Corp., was 20 times TIA's.|$|E

25|$|When {{only four}} fresh eggs were {{available}} one morning at a London hotel, he awarded {{them to the}} bowlers because Lancashire {{were likely to be}} fielding all day.

The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.|$|E
25|$|The system <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what had}} been asked of it; it {{provided}} very accurate range measurements {{on the order of}} 50yards. However, in the field it became clear that this was simply not enough. By late 1939 the spectre of night bombing was a major concern, and as the GL system could not provide accurate bearing information, and no elevation, it was unable to direct the guns at night. Instead the World War I style of operation was used, with searchlights hunting for targets largely at random, and conventional optical instruments being used to determine bearing and elevation once a target was lit up.|$|E
25|$|The year 383 denotes a {{significant}} point in Welsh history, remembered {{in literature and}} {{considered to be the}} foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus would strip all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators and launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. Welsh legend provides a mythic story that says he <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> that.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, {{as part of}} the {{contract}} with Major League Baseball it had signed the year before, Fox gained an additional outlet for its coverage. Its recently launched cable sports network, Fox Sports Net, was given rights to two Thursday night games per week, one for the Eastern and Central time zones and one for the Mountain and Pacific time zones. In 2000, as part of an exclusive contract Fox signed with MLB, that coverage passed to Fox Family Channel and was reduced to one game per week. After the 2000 season, Fox also gained rights to the entire postseason and moved a large portion of its Division Series coverage to Fox Family. This lasted for one season due to The Walt Disney Company making a bid for Fox Family. As part of the negotiations Fox Family was renamed ABC Family and ESPN gained the rights to Fox Family and FX's MLB coverage, although the 2002 Division Series aired on ABC Family due to contractual issues, but with ESPN production, a sign of things to come at ABC Sports. Control of the overall contract remained with Fox, meaning they could renegotiate following the 2006 season and not allow ESPN to retain its postseason coverage. For the 2007 season Fox <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> that, and TBS is now the cable home of the postseason as part of its new baseball contract.|$|E
25|$|After an interval, Servetus {{returned}} to Paris to study medicine in 1536. In Paris, his teachers included Sylvius, Fernel and Johann Winter von Andernach, who hailed him with Andrea Vesalius as his most able assistant in dissections. During these years {{he wrote his}} Manuscript of the Complutense, an unpublished compendium of his medical ideas. Servetus taught mathematics and astrology while he studied medicine. He predicted an occultation of Mars by the Moon, and this joined to his teaching generated much envy among the medicine teachers. His teaching classes were suspended by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Jean Tagault, and Servetus wrote his Apologetic Discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in Favour of Astrology and against a Certain Physician against him. Tagault later argued {{for the death penalty}} in the judgment of the University of Paris against Servetus. He was accused of teaching De Divinatione by Cicero. Finally, the sentence was reduced to the withdrawal of this edition. As a result of the risks and difficulties of studying medicine at Paris, Servetus decided to go to Montpellier to finish his medical studies, maybe thanks to his teacher Sylvius who <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> the same as a student. There he became a Doctor of Medicine in 1539. After that he lived at Charlieu. A jealous physician ambushed and tried to kill Servetus, but Servetus defended himself and injured one of the attackers in a sword fight. He was in prison for several days because of this incident.|$|E
25|$|Liang overcame Jamie Burnett 5–1 in {{the first}} round of the 2014 Wuxi Classic and then inflicted the first defeat on Mark Selby since he won the World Championship, beating him 5–3. He was knocked out in the last 16 5–2 by Joe Perry. He lost 5–3 against Robert Milkins in the opening round of the Australian Goldfields Open and in the {{wildcard}} round of the Shanghai Masters 5–1 to Yan Bingtao. Liang failed to get past the last 64 of the next two ranking events, but won two matches to reach the German Masters, where he eliminated Li Hang 5–1 {{in the first}} round. He reached the quarter-finals by coming back from 4–3 down against Stuart Bingham to win 5–4 on the final pink. He <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> the same in edging Ryan Day 5–4 to play in his second career ranking event semi-final. There, he took four frames in a row to hold a narrow 4–3 advantage over Shaun Murphy, before losing three successive frames in a 6–4 defeat. Liang didn't drop a frame in seeing off Cao Xinlong and Gerard Greene at the Welsh Open, but was then the victim of a whitewash in the third round at the hands of John Higgins. At the inaugural World Grand Prix, Liang lost 4–3 to Graeme Dott in the second round. In the final round of World Championship qualifying he lost the last three frames against compatriot Zhang Anda to be narrowly defeated 10–9.|$|E

500|$|Before Rimsky-Korsakov {{went to the}} Conservatory, in March 1868, Tchaikovsky wrote {{a review}} of his Fantasia on Serbian Themes.

Tchaikovsky's notice, worded in precisely a way to find favor within the Balakirev circle, <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> that.

500|$|Once again, the {{selection}} {{and management of the}} Australian team to tour England in 1909 caused friction between leading players and the Board of Control. [...] Clem Hill, unwilling to tour on the terms offered by the Board, withdrew his name from consideration. [...] Regardless, the tour was a success, both for the Australians, who won the series two-one, and for Armstrong, who made 1,451runs at an average of just under 44 and took 133wickets at an average of 16.40 [...] Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his role in the tour as [...] "to keep the side together by means of his impregnable defence, and he <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> what was required, only on rare occasions giving free play to his hitting power.

500|$|This {{proved a}} {{tactical}} blunder: when a British army under General John Burgoyne arrived in July 1777, Burgoyne <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> what Kościuszko had warned of {{and had his}} engineers place artillery on the hill. With the British in complete control of the high ground, the Americans realized their situation was hopeless and abandoned the fortress with hardly a shot fired in the Siege of Ticonderoga. The British advance force nipped hard {{on the heels of}} the outnumbered and exhausted Continentals as they fled south. Major General Philip Schuyler, desperate to put distance between his men and their pursuers, ordered Kościuszko to delay the enemy. [...] Kościuszko designed an engineer's solution: his men felled trees, dammed streams, and destroyed bridges and causeways. Encumbered by their huge supply train, the British began to bog down, giving the Americans the time needed to safely withdraw across the Hudson River.|$|E
500|$|On October 19, 1875, Grant {{made another}} {{reforming}} cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior.

Chandler had discovered that during Delano's tenure, money had been paid to fictitious clerks while other clerks had been paid without performing any services. Chandler next turned to the Department of Indian Affairs to reform another Delano debacle. President Grant ordered Chandler to fire everyone, saying, [...] "Have those men dismissed by 3 o'clock this afternoon or shut down the bureau."

500|$|TISM were {{distinguished}} from other 'joke' or 'gimmick bands', by, among other things, their musical style. The band rarely in any seriousness stated actual {{influences on the}} type of music they played, except that The Residents were a band which TISM 'did' notice and 'possibly' took some influence from. A clear link can be drawn from The Residents' The Third Reich 'n' Roll video, in which that band wore Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper: TISM <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> this at their first gig. Another link may be drawn to early TISM tracks [...] "The Ballad of the Semitic Nazi" [...] or [...] "I'm Gonna Treat Ya to a Neitschze [...] Double Feature" [...] (sic) which use a similar naming convention to The Residents. Other bands which may have influenced TISM are difficult to pinpoint, although a Sydney Morning Herald article on the band described them as [...] "a cross between Skyhooks, Dave Warner, Talking Heads and The Residents".|$|E

However, Charlotte Wilder, a writer on USA Todays sports column For The Win, was unimpressed by Vinicius's design, stating, [...] "Whoever was in charge of coming up with this creature of the huge hands and feet <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> what it looks like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, stuff it with some synthetic filling, and call it day."

500|$|The [...] "enhanced" [...] video {{states that}} there are 724 {{references}} to Twin Peaks in the episode's closing scene. Among them, Jack Smith wears an eye patch and a red suit and dances funny, referencing not only the aforementioned [...] "One Eyes Jacks" [...] brothel and Nadine Hurley, but a dream sequence in Peaks, where a character known as the Man from Another Place wore a similar suit and danced in a bizarre fashion. In the final scene Carlton is seen holding his hand up and stating [...] "that is a damn fine cup of cider". In the Twin Peaks pilot Agent Cooper holds his hand {{the same way and}} states [...] "that is a damn fine cup of coffee." [...] Additionally, Carlton is later holding a cup of coffee on its side, displaying that the coffee is now solid in a fashion mimicking the same action by Agent Cooper in the final episode. A seven-foot tall man (John DeSantis) wearing a bow tie looks much like the giant from Agent Cooper's dream. Randy is seen at the end barking out the window like Bobby Briggs did to James Hurley in the holding cells. Bob Barker is seen dancing with a picture just as Leland Palmer did in Twin Peaks.
