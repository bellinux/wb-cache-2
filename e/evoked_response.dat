25|$|Curtiss, Fromkin, and Krashen {{continued}} to measure Genie's mental age {{through a variety}} of measures, and she consistently showed an extremely high degree of scatter. She measured significantly higher on tests which did not require language, such as the Leiter Scale, than on tests with any kind of language component, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. In addition, throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers they tested a variety of her brain functions and her performance on different tasks. For these they primarily used tachistoscopic tests, and during 1974 and 1975 they also gave her a series of <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> tests.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1971 {{scientists}} {{administered a}} series of neurolinguistics tests on Genie, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed brain examinations. Based on tests and observations in everyday situations, doctors concluded that she was right-handed and that her brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant for all functions. On tests specifically measuring Genie's language, her results were congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. On a tachistoscopic test in 1975, Genie had little difficulty when asked to point to words which rhyme. Genie also did very well on one <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> test involving familiar homophones, demonstrating that, similar to these patients, her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension. An EEG consistently picked up more activity from her right hemisphere than they did from the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area in a right-handed person, especially finding {{a high level of}} involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex.|$|E

Patients with dissociated vertical deviation (both unilateral and alternating), patients with congenital esotropia without dissociated vertical deviation, and normal subjects were investigated.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{assess whether}} {{transplantation}} of intact sheets of fetal retina with {{retinal pigment epithelium}} (RPE) into a retina with photoreceptor degeneration restores visually <b>evoked</b> <b>responses.</b> METHODS. Sheets of fetal retina with RPE were transplanted into the subretinal space of Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats at 37 to 69 days of age. Sixty-three days to 10 months after transplantation, multiunit visual responses were recorded in the superior colliculus (SC) of transplanted rats, age-matched untransplanted rats, and rats with sham surgery. RESULTS. In 19 of 29 RCS rats with transplants, visually <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were recorded from and restricted to a small area of the SC that corresponds topographically to {{the portion of the}} retina in which the transplant was placed. Outside of this area, no visual <b>responses</b> were <b>evoked.</b> Visually <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were never recorded in age-matched, nontransplanted RCS rats. Visually <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were recorded in 6 of 13 RCS rats with sham surgery, but these responses were significantly different from responses in rats with transplants. CONCLUSIONS. These results demonstrate that this transplantation technique restores visually <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> in the brain. Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, we propose that the central visual response results from increased synaptic efficacy within the host retina. If it can be established that functional connections between the transplant and the host retina produce the effect, then it would indicate that the technique could be explored as a therapeutic strategy in some diseases of retinal degeneration...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} role of nitric oxide (NO) in {{blunting}} sympathetically evoked muscle vasoconstriction during acute and chronic systemic hypoxia. Experiments were performed on anaesthetized normoxic (N) and chronically hypoxic (CH) rats that had been acclimated to 12 % O 2 for 3 – 4 weeks. The lumbar sympathetic chain was stimulated for 1 min with bursts at 20 or 40 Hz and continuously at 2 Hz. In N rats, acute hypoxia (breathing 8 % O 2) reduced baseline femoral vascular resistance (FVR) and depressed increases in FVR evoked by all three patterns of stimulation, but infusion of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), so as to similarly reduce baseline FVR, did not affect sympathetically <b>evoked</b> <b>responses.</b> Blockade of NO synthase (NOS) with l-NAME increased baseline FVR and facilitated the sympathetically evoked increases in FVR, but when baseline FVR was restored by SNP infusion, these <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were restored. Acute hypoxia after l-NAME still reduced baseline FVR and depressed <b>evoked</b> <b>responses.</b> In CH rats breathing 12 % O 2, baseline FVR was lower than in N rats breathing air, but l-NAME had qualitatively similar effects on baseline FVR and sympathetically evoked increases in FVR. SNP similarly restored baseline FVR and <b>evoked</b> <b>responses.</b> Inhibition of neuronal NOS or inducible NOS did not affect baselines, or <b>evoked</b> <b>responses.</b> We propose that in N and CH rats sympathetically evoked muscle vasoconstriction is modulated by tonically released NO, but not depressed by additional NO released on sympathetic activation. The present results suggest that hypoxia-induced blunting of sympathetic vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle is not mediated by NO...|$|R

40|$|Phase-locked <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and event-related modulations of {{spontaneous}} rhythmic activity {{are the two}} main approaches used to quantify stimulus- or task-related changes in electrophysiological measures. The {{relationship between the two}} has beenwidely theorized upon but empirical research has been limited to the primary visual and sensorimotor cortex. However, both <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and rhythms have been used as markers of neural activity in paradigms ranging from simple sensory to complex cognitive tasks.

In this study, we sought to systematically clarify the connection between <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and rhythmic activity. Using both measures, we identified the spatiotemporal patterns of task effects in three magnetoencephalography (MEG) data sets, all variants of a picture naming task. <b>Evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and rhythmic modulation yielded largely separate networks, with spatial overlap mainly in the sensorimotor and primary visual areas. Moreover, in the cortical regions thatwere identified with both measures the experimental effects they conveyed differed in terms of timing and function.

40|$|AbstractSome {{forms of}} {{tinnitus}} {{are likely to}} be perceptual consequences of altered neural activity in the central auditory system triggered by damage to the auditory periphery. Animal studies report changes in the <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> after noise exposure or ototoxic drugs in inferior colliculus and auditory cortex. However, human electrophysiological evidence is rather equivocal: increased, reduced or no difference in N 1 /N 1 m evoked amplitudes and latencies in tinnitus participants have been reported. The present study used magnetoencephalography to seek evidence for altered <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> in people with tinnitus compared to controls (hearing loss matched and normal hearing) in four different stimulus categories (a control tone, a tone corresponding to the audiometric edge, to the dominant tinnitus pitch and a tone within the area of hearing loss). Results revealed that amplitudes of the <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> differed depending on the tone category. N 1 m amplitude to the dominant tinnitus pitch and the frequency within the area of hearing loss were reduced compared to the other two categories. Given that tinnitus pitch is typically within the area of hearing loss, the differences in the <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> pattern in tinnitus participants seem to be related more to the hearing loss than to the presence of tinnitus...|$|R
