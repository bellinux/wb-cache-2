50|$|The Dickson {{multiplier}} {{is frequently}} employed in integrated circuits where the supply voltage (from a battery for instance) {{is lower than}} that required by the circuitry. It is advantageous in integrated circuit manufacture that all the semiconductor components are of basically the same type. MOSFETs are commonly the standard logic block in many integrated circuits. For this reason the diodes are often replaced by this type of transistor, but wired {{to function as a}} diode - an arrangement called a diode-wired MOSFET. Figure 8 shows a Dickson voltage doubler using diode-wired n-channel <b>enhancement</b> <b>type</b> MOSFETs.There are many variations and improvements to the basic Dickson charge pump. Many of these are concerned with reducing the effect of the transistor drain-source voltage. This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.|$|E

This article examines how L 2 form recognition and reading comprehension are affected by different types of textual enhancement. Participants (n = 109) in the experimental group read a passage that contained one type of textual enhancement (underline, bold, italics, change in font size, use of capital letters or change of font) on the target structure (Spanish present and preterit tense) morphemes. A control group (n = 16) read the same passage without any type of enhancement. To measure L 2 form recognition, all groups completed pre- and post-tests consisting of an L 2 to first language (L 1) translation task. To assess the effects of <b>enhancement</b> <b>type</b> on L 2 reading comprehension, the participants completed a 40 item multiple choice test with questions focusing on form or meaning from the reading.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA thorough understanding and a well developed fabrication procedure of MIS structures are the prerequisite for CCD applications. The object of this thesis is {{to study the}} narrow gap semiconductor MIS and investigate its feasibility for IR-CCI applications. Two MIS studies were made. First, MIS of five lead-tin semiconductors were fabricated using E-gun evaporated 100 - 450 A thick Al(2) 0 (3) or Si 0 (2) layers as insulators. C-V measurements indicated that these MIS behave qualitatively like that of Si-MOS. Accumulation, depletion and inversion layers were controlled by the gate voltage. However, comparisons of measured C-V with theoretical calculations did not yield quantitative agreement. Second, MIS of 0. 05 D-cm p-type and 40 D-cm n-type Ge were also studied. C-V and C-t measurements indicated standard MOS behavior although some small hysteresis was found. Analysis based on C-V data showed that the flatband voltage was approximately - 1. 2 volts and interface state density was {{on the order of}} 10 (13) /cm(2). In addition, effects of electron bombardment simulating the space environment around Jupiter on a n-channel depletion MOSFET were studied.

40|$|Scientific {{interpretation}} of the driving forces of built-up land expansion is essential to urban planning and policy-making. In general, built-up land expansion results from the interactions of different factors, and thus, understanding the combined impacts of built-up land expansion is beneficial. However, previous studies have primarily been concerned with the separate effect of each driver, rather than the interactions between the drivers. Using the built-up land expansion in Beijing from 2000 to 2010 as a study case, this research aims to fill this gap. A spatial statistical method, named the geographical detector, was used to investigate the effects of physical and socioeconomic factors. The effects of policy factors were also explored using physical and socioeconomic factors as proxies. The {{results showed that the}} modifiable areal unit problem existed in the geographical detector, and 4000 m might be the optimal scale for the classification performed in this study.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{transportation}} agencies in Oregon have systematically enhanced many pedestrian crossings at mid-block locations with Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs), Flashing Yellow Beacons (Flash), and high visibility crosswalk markings (Hi-Vis). Enhancements often included {{the installation of}} refuge medians. This study explored the safety performance of these enhanced crossings, categorized by <b>enhancement</b> <b>type.</b> Data were collected on 191 crossings that included installation year, geometric features, surrounding land use, traffic volumes, {{and the number of}} crashes. Because pedestrian volume at the locations was unavailable, a pedestrian activity level variable was developed. Target crashes for analysis were identified as pedestrian and rear-end. The analysis of the before-after crash patterns showed a reduction in the pedestrian crash severity after the installation of the crosswalk enhancements. Risk ratios, calculated by the unadjusted crash frequency relative to the years of operation in each analysis category, were calculated. For pedestrian crashes, risk ratios increased with the number of lanes, posted speed, and estimated pedestrian activity level. Similar trends were observed for rear-end crashes. Due to sample size limitations, safety effectiveness was only estimated for the 19 RRFBs locations. Lack of pedestrian volumes limited the development of a safety performance function (SPF) for the pedestrian crash types. However, a rear-end crash SPF was estimated. Standard methods to estimate a crash modification factor (CMF) were attempted. The recommended CMF for pedestrian crashes is 0. 64 +/- 0. 26 using a simple before-after analysis and 0. 93 +/- 0. 22 for rear-end crashes using an empirical Bayes analysis.

40|$|Background: Abnormalities in {{postprandial}} {{lipid metabolism}} may explain, in part, the 2 to 4 fold {{increased risk of}} coronary heart disease (CHD) in diabetic individuals compared with the general population. Aims: To develop an Oral Triglyceride Tolerance Test (OTTT) to evaluate reliably post challenge metabolism and to determine whether more physiologic insulin profiles can improve lipid responses in diabetic subjects. Methods: Post 50 g fat and 50 g carbohydrate challenge triglyceride and glucose profiles were measured 2 hourly for 8 hours on 2 occasions to establish test reproducibility and to characterise responses in type 2 diabetic and non diabetic subjects. The potential effects on post challenge lipid and glucose metabolism of modifying endogenous insulin delivery via the portal system or augmenting post challenge systemic insulin levels were assessed using the OTTT. Results: Reproducible post challenge triglyceride, NEFA, glycerol, glucose, insulin and C peptide responses were obtained in non diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects. In type 2 diabetic subjects both ultra rapid endogenous and exogenous insulin delivery decreased post challenge hyperglycaemia and improved NEFA-glycerol suppression, relative to placebo and soluble insulin respectively. Enhancing portal insulin secretion {{had no effect on}} triglyceride levels. Increasing peripheral insulin levels showed no difference in triglyceride profiles between insulins tested although 6 hour triglyceride excursions were less than endogenous <b>enhancement.</b> <b>Type</b> 1 diabetic subjects displayed triglyceride profiles similar to non diabetic subjects, and reduced triglyceride excursion was seen with soluble than analogue insulin replacement.

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed consent from all participants were obtained. Sixty consecutive patients with untreated celiac disease, 45 patients with celiac disease treated with a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year, and 30 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was performed by using a 1. 5 -T MR unit. For each MR imaging examination, maximum enhancement, slope of enhancement, and time-signal intensity curves were calculated {{at the level of}} the descending duodenal wall. Duodenal wall thickness was also evaluated. Statistical evaluation was performed by using one-way analysis of variance, and the results were confirmed by using the Bartlett test for equal variances and complemented by using Bonferroni multiple comparison, linear correlation, and the Student t test for paired data. Results: Mean maximum enhancement of the duodenal wall was significantly higher in patients with untreated celiac disease (229. 1 +/- 46. 4 [standard deviation]) than in patients with treated celiac disease (109. 8 +/- 27. 8) and control subjects (94. 7 +/- 17. 9) (P <. 001 for each comparison). All 60 untreated patients showed a curve characterized by fast enhancement and washout (type 4), while all 45 treated patients and the 30 control subjects showed a curve characterized by slow constant <b>enhancement</b> (<b>type</b> 2).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2005. As {{mid-latitude}} cyclones {{move across}} mountain ranges, {{the distribution of}} precipitation is altered. The windward slopes experience enhancement of precipitation, which is determined by dynamical and microphysical factors. Detailed radar observations collected near the European Alps and the Oregon Cascade Mountains reveal that the windward terrain-modified flows have characteristics that are repeated from storm to storm and from mountain range to mountain range. These flow patterns and their precipitation formation mechanisms are synthesized in conceptual models of orographic enhancement of precipitation. In Type A pattern, low static stability low-level air rises easily as it encounters the first peaks of the terrain. Lifting of moist low-level air produces high liquid water contents over these peaks, which favor growth of pre-existing precipitation by riming and coalescence. If the upstream flow is potentially unstable, convective cells will be triggered in the upslope ascent. These cells produce pockets of especially high liquid water content where the coalescence and riming processes are accentuated. A mesoscale model simulation suggests that subsequent peaks may also be subjected {{to this kind of}} precipitation <b>enhancement.</b> <b>Type</b> B pattern exhibits a shear layer on the windward slopes. The combination of high shear and static stability produces conditions that support dynamical instability manifested in the form of Kevin-Helmholtz billows and turbulent overturning cells. Aggregation of ice particles falling from the baroclinic system into the layer of cells is aided by the turbulent motions. The strong updrafts produce pockets of high liquid water content; which favor riming and coalescence. Idealized numerical simulations indicate that a shear layer may develop on the windward side of a mountain as a result of strong static stability and/or surface friction. During mid-latitude cyclone passage over a mountain range, windward precipitation is enhanced by small-scale updrafts regardless of the character of the low-level flow. In Type A (Type B) storms static (dynamic) instability is responsible for the updraft generation.

This facility is used to study the local and area-averaged heat transfer characteristics of three orifice designs having the same total open area: a single orifice, a 3 × 3 array of orifices, and a 5 × 5 array of orifices. The jet arrays result in higher area-averaged heat transfer than the single jet; however, they display a larger relative nonuniformity in local heat transfer coefficient. The pressure drop {{is found to be}} independent of heat flux (i. e., vapor generation) for all orifices investigated. ^ To improve the heat dissipation capabilities of two-phase jet impingement, boiling surface enhancements are investigated. Because the pressure drop is dominated by the orifice and minimally influenced by the flow on the heated surface, adding surface structures can improve heat transfer with little penalty in pressure drop. A hybrid enhancement surface having pin fins coated with a microporous layer is designed to provide increased nucleation site density and macroscale surface area. A study with the single jet is performed to first understand the heat transfer characteristics of this surface with jet impingement. The hybrid surface and surfaces representing each constituent <b>enhancement</b> <b>type</b> are investigated, including: a baseline smooth flat surface, a flat surface coated with the microporous layer, a surface with extended pin fins, and the hybrid surface. ^ With these characteristics of the hybrid surface understood, the heat transfer and pressure drop performance of the surface with the 5 × 5 array of jets is investigated. The array more effectively distributes liquid into the hybrid enhancement structures and results in superior vapor evacuation. This scheme drastically extends critical heat flux, more than doubling it compared to the single jet on the same hybrid surface with only a slight increase in pressure drop. Compared to the single jet impinging on the smooth flat surface, the array of jets with the hybrid enhancement results in a more than four-fold increase in critical heat flux at each flow rate investigated. This impingement scheme displays low wall superheats in nucleate boiling, high critical heat fluxes, and only small increases in pressure drop with increasing heat flux. ^ The influence of vapor generation on the flow field within the confinement gap is studied to better understand the interaction between liquid and vapor during confined jet impingement boiling. Liquid flow measurements with simultaneous vapor visualizations are performed using time-resolved stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) with fluorescence illumination. A single jet of subcooled water impinges onto a circular heat source and measurements are acquired across a range of heat fluxes at jet Reynolds numbers of 5, 000 and 15, 000. The liquid flow pattern in the confinement gap (with the height maintained at four jet diameters) is found to be governed by the vapor motion. Boiling is found to disrupt both the horizontal wall jet and the vertical impinging jet flow. Specifically, rising bubbles from the heat source interact with the impinging jet causing an increase in the jet velocity decay rate prior to impingement. Vapor is a significant source of turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation, with the bubbly regions above the heat source experiencing the most intense turbulence modification. Vapor-induced turbulence is found to be significant downstream of the heat source only once saturated conditions in the flow are reached. ^ Tomographic PIV is then implemented to further study the interaction between vapor motion and the turbulent liquid flow as the confinement gap height is varied. This first application of tomographic PIV to flow boiling is significant given the complexity of confined two-phase jet impingement. Three confinement gap heights are studied; 8, 4, and 2 jet diameters. A visual hull method is used to reconstruct the time-varying region of vapor in the flow, allowing a time-resolved estimate of the vapor void fraction. Special attention is given to the interaction of vapor with turbulence and coherent vortices in the confinement gap during boiling. The three-dimensional measurements allow asymmetries in the flow, which are found to be augmented during boiling, to be described in detail. The vapor interface motion is shown to cause the formation of coherent vortices in the flow. The primary locations of these vortices do not coincide with the regions of most-intense turbulent kinetic energy, suggesting that irrotational velocity fluctuations contribute significantly to the magnitudes of turbulent kinetic energy measured in this two-phase flow. Reduced confinement gap heights are found to confine vapor within the gap, which results in less turbulence but greater bulk liquid flow unsteadiness. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|E
