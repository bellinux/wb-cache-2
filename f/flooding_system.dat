500|$|On 16 August 1913, Kongō was {{completed}} and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy (I.J.N.). Twelve days later, she departed from Portsmouth headed for Japan. She was docked at Singapore from 20 October to 27 October, before arriving at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 5 November, {{where she was}} placed in First Reserve. In January 1914, she docked at Kure Naval Base for armament checks. On 3 August 1914, the German Empire declared war on France and then invaded via Belgium, sparking the beginning of World War I in the West. Twelve days later, Japan issued a warning to Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire, ordering him to withdraw the German troops from their base at Tsingtao, China. When the German Empire did not respond, Japan declared war on Germany on 23 August, occupying the former German possessions in the Caroline Islands, Palau Islands, Marshall Islands, and Marianas Islands. Kongō was quickly deployed towards the Central Pacific to patrol the sea lines of communication of the German Empire. Kongō returned to the port of Yokosuka, Japan, on 12 September, and one month later, she {{was assigned to the}} First Battleship Division. In October, Kongō and her new sister ship [...] sortied off the Chinese coast in support of Japanese army units during the Siege of Tsingtao. Then Kongō returned to Sasebo Naval Base for upgrades to her searchlights. On 3 October 1915, Kongō and Hiei participated in the sinking of the old [...] as a practice target. She was a Russian pre-dreadnought that had been captured in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War that had next served as an I.J.N. warship. With the defeat of the German East Asia Squadron by the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, there was little or no need for I.J.N. operations in the Pacific Ocean. Kongō spent the rest of World War I either based at Sasebo, or on patrol off the coast of China. In December 1918, following the end of the hostilities of World War I, Kongō was placed in [...] "Second Reserve". In April 1919, she was fitted with a new seawater <b>flooding</b> <b>system</b> for her ammunition magazines.|$|E

50|$|For example, Halon 1301 total <b>flooding</b> <b>systems</b> are {{typically}} used at concentrations {{no higher than}} 7% by volume in air, and can suppress many fires at 2.9% v/v. By contrast, carbon dioxide fire suppression <b>flood</b> <b>systems</b> operate from 34% concentration by volume (surface-only combustion of liquid fuels) up to 75% (dust traps). Carbon dioxide can cause severe distress at concentrations of 3-6%, and has caused death by respiratory paralysis {{in a few minutes}} at 10% concentration. Halon 1301 causes only slight giddiness at its effective concentration of 5%, and even at 15% those exposed remain conscious but impaired and suffer no long-term effects. (Experimental animals have also been exposed to 2% concentrations of Halon 1301 for 30 hours per week for 4 months, with no discernible health effects.) Halon 1211 also has low toxicity, although it is more toxic than Halon 1301, and thus considered unsuitable for <b>flooding</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{flooding}} is {{a problem}} of increasing relevance in low-lying coastal regions worldwide. In addition to the anticipated increase in likelihood and magnitude of coastal floods due to climate change, there is rapid growth in coastal assets and infrastructure. Sustainable and integrated coastal flood management over large areas and varying coastline types cannot be simply treated as local combinations of flood defences and floodplains. Rather, a system level analysis of floodplains is required to structure the problem as a first step before applying quantitative models. In this paper such a model is developed using system diagrams and the Source-Pathway-Receptor (SPR) concept, to structure our understanding of large and complex coastal <b>flood</b> <b>systems.</b> A graphical systems model is proposed for the assessment of coastal <b>flood</b> <b>systems</b> with regard to individual elements and their topological relationships. Two examples are discussed – a unidirectional model for a large-scale <b>flood</b> <b>system,</b> and a multi-directional model for a smaller-scale system, both based on the Western Scheldt estuary. The models help to develop a comprehensive understanding of system elements and their relationships and provide a holistic overview of the coastal <b>flood</b> <b>system.</b> The approach shows that a system level analysis of floodplains is more effective than simple topographic maps when conveying complex information. The models are shown to be useful as an apriori approach for making the assumptions about flood mechanisms explicit and for informing inputs to numerical models. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|While gnutella uses a query {{flooding}} {{method of}} searching, Gnutella2 uses a random walk system, where a searching node gathers {{a list of}} Hubs and contacts them directly, one at a time. However, as Hub organize themselves in, so called, [...] "Hub clusters", where each Hub mirrors the information stored by its neighbors, the Leaf is returned the information of the entire Hub cluster (usually 7 Hubs). This has several advantages over the gnutella's query <b>flooding</b> <b>system.</b> It is more efficient, as continuing a search does not increase the network traffic exponentially, queries are not routed through as many nodes, and it increases the granularity of a search, allowing a client to stop, once a pre-defined threshold of results has been obtained, more effectively than in gnutella. However, the walk system also increases {{the complexity of the}} network and the network maintenance and management required, as well as requiring safeguards to prevent a malicious attacker from using the network for denial-of-service attacks.|$|E

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognized that a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} existing <b>flood</b> <b>system</b> is necessary to effectively manage coastal flood risk. This involves consideration {{of the social and}} ecological dimensions in addition to the hydrological aspects that have been the traditional focus of flood analysis. Social aspects are important, as they represent both the reason for flood management and the growth in exposure, as well as providing the context within which any decision will be made. Coastal species and habitats are inherently important for the flood management ecosystem services that they provide for flood management. The flood flow, depth, and extent determine the potential for flood damage. The conceptual model adopted here for coastal risk assessment is based on the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence model, which is a simple linear conceptual model for representing <b>flood</b> <b>systems</b> and processes that lead to a particular flooding consequence.
