40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an Optical 3 D Shaft Inspection System needed for the survey and monitoring of Water <b>Handling</b> <b>Shafts</b> in the German Ruhrgebiet. The development is part of the RAG R&D project “ABSMon”. The end of the German hard coal mining at the end of 2018 has been determined with the Steinkohlefinanzierungsgesetz (SteinkohleFinG) from 2007 - 12 - 20. About three hundred years before now the near surface hard coal mining began in the southern Ruhr Area and in our days advanced to the northern Ruhr Area with mining depth of around - 1. 500 meters. The mine workings are kept dry by mine water pumping. When the active mining activities will have finished a controlled Water Handling will raise and keep the mine water to levels predetermined by the Mining Authorities. A monitoring with a mobile wireline shaft survey system is needed to run the Water <b>Handling</b> <b>Shafts</b> for an enduring Water Management. At the moment only laser scanner systems are available, but also optical systems are needed to enable the near real-time inspection with 3 D presentation and 3 D examination during the measurement campaign. An approach is presented that uses a camera to generate high resolution and textured 3 D models of mining shafts and tunnels for inspection purposes...|$|R

40|$|Recycling can {{be defined}} as the “act of {{processing}} used or abandoned materials for use in creating new products”. A recycling bin is a container which used to keep garbage or disposed item before being act by the respective authority to bring it the recycling centre. Recycling bins can be found in various forms and sizes. Nowadays, {{there are a lot of}} models of recycle trash bin which do not have the correct specification and yet have the disadvantage. The trash was not compacted, so it will requires a lot of space at the landfill. As a result, some of the landfill cannot afford to take all the trash. Part of the objective of this project is to overcome the problems occur nowadays by fabricating and designing the new concept of the recycle trash bin. The main scopes of this research are for two type of trasher, which are the 325 ml cans and 600 ml bottles. The design of the new concept of recycle trash bin for this project is basically from the research of existing models found in the current market. It comes with the lots of advantages from two major models, which are “separated trash model” and “un separated trash model”. The main materials that being use to fabricate the recycle trash bin is metal. The cover of recycle trash bin is made from acrylic. In creating and fabricate the recycle trash bin it will use a lot of machines. After the fabrication process, this recycle trash bin will be able to compact the trash successfully. Compare to the other model that exists in today’s market, this new recycle trash bin in more suitable for the use of the household. It is because the size of this recycle trash bin is smaller and the specialty is that in one recycle trash bin, consumer will found two different containers. So it will able to reduce the space used. The shaft will connect to the compactor and the <b>handle</b> <b>shaft</b> of the recycle trash bin can support the load when being use to compress the trash. There are no failures found during compacting the trash. As the conclusion from this project, this new design of recycle trash bin will be able to help and overcome the problems occurs nowadays and give advantages to users...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study of}} the biomechanical load when working with manually <b>handled</b> <b>shaft</b> tools. The tools studied are shovels, rakes and push hoes. The most comprehensive measurements study the effects of varying shovel design. Especially the load on the muscles in the back and the compression and shear forces directly on the spine are studied. The mounting angle and length of the shovel shaft are varied. The effects of using a tool with a higher and bent shaft are also studied, just as the effects of varying operator anthropometry. One conclusion of the results is that the spine forces can be decreased if an alternatively designed shovel is used. Another conclusion is that the anthropometry of the operator has major effects on the load levels. The method used for the analysis of the biomechanical load uses optoelectronic measurement data of body positions as input to an computerized biomechanical analysis model. The external forces acting on each hand are simultaneously measured. The measurement procedure is standardized and the transfer of data from the optoelectronic measurements to the biomechanical model is computerized in order to increase the accuracy and also to enable analysis of measurement time series with reasonable time consumption...|$|R

Further examples of the tools have been found at sites including Barnfield Pit and Rickson's Pit, near Swanscombe in Kent and Barnham in Suffolk; similar industries have been identified across Northern Europe. The Clactonian industry involved striking thick, irregular flakes from a core of flint, which was then employed as a chopper. The flakes would have been used as crude knives or scrapers. Unlike the Oldowan tools from which Clactonian ones derived, some were notched implying that they were attached to a <b>handle</b> or <b>shaft.</b> Retouch is uncommon and the prominent bulb of percussion on the flakes indicates use of a hammerstone.|$|R

This design has been reviewed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the 1996 WIPP Compliance Certification Application (CCA). An effective shaft sealing system for the WIPP will limit liquid and gas flows, and permanently prevent the migration of radiological or other hazardous constituents through the sealed shafts from repository to accessible environment.

50|$|A {{screwdriver}} is a tool, manual or powered, {{for turning}} (driving or removing) screws.

Handles are typically wood, metal, or plastic and usually hexagonal, square, or oval in cross-section to improve grip and prevent the tool from rolling when set down. Some manual screwdrivers have interchangeable tips that fit into a socket {{on the end of}} the shaft and are held in mechanically or magnetically. These often have a hollow handle that contains various types and sizes of tips, and a reversible ratchet action that allows multiple full turns without repositioning the tip or the user's hand.|$|R

One is the biopsy catheter, consisting of a handle, a coil and forceps. The coil is a tubular shape and flexible spiral, made of stainless steel and coated {{with a layer of}} polyethylene. Currently, the process of coating the coils with polyethylene is done automatically, in an extrusion line which has three drive shafts that carry the coils through the process phases. However, there are problems of quality because the coating is not remain homogeneous, presenting a thickness less than the acceptable or even exposed areas of the coil’s stainless steel. This forces to discard several batches of the product, generating economic losses to the company, It was determinate that the problem is due the lack of coordination between the principal drive shaft, the extruder machine worm and the other two drive shafts. Thus, it is required to design and implement an automatic control system for the drive shafts speed; using the variable frequency drives (VFD) that <b>handles</b> those <b>shafts,</b> the programmable logic controller (PLC) which governs the entire extrusion line and feeding back the worm’s shaft state through the Profibus communication network.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the change from discoidal flake production to prismatic blade-making during the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition in Europe led to enhanced technological efficiency. Specifically, blade-making is thought to promote higher rates of blank production, more efficient and complete reduction of the parent core, and a large increase in the total length of cutting edge per weight of stone. Controlled replication experiments using large samples, computer-assisted measurements, and statistical tests of several different measures failed to support any of these propositions. When resharpened, the use-life of flake edges actually surpasses that of blades of equivalent mass because the narrower blades are more rapidly exhausted by retouch. Our results highlight the need to replace static measurements of edge length that promote an illusion of efficiency with a more dynamic approach that takes the whole reduction sequence into account. An unexpected by-product of our replications was the discovery that real gains in cutting-edge length per weight of stone are linked to surface area. There is now a need to test the proposition that all the perceived advantages currently bestowed upon blades only occurred during the shift from macroblade to bladelet production. If our results are duplicated in further experiments, the notion of "economical" blades {{will have to be}} rejected and alternative explanations sought for their appearance in the early Upper Paleolithic. While Aurignacian bladelet (Dufour) production could signal the advent of composite tool technology (wooden <b>handles</b> or <b>shafts</b> with bladelet inserts), this does not help to explain why macroblades were also produced in large numbers. We may need to reexamine the notion that macroblades were of more symbolic than functional significance to their makers...|$|R

The standard task entailed closure of a 50 -mm enterotomy in a nonliving porcine small-bowel model. Fifty enterotomies were performed with each angle in a random sequence. Setting Research laboratory in the Surgical Skills Unit at Ninewells Hospital. Participants Ten surgeons with previous experience in laparoscopic surgery. Main Outcome Measures The execution time (in minutes), leakage pressure (in centimeters of water), and suture error placement score (deviations of the entry and exit points 5 mm from the enterotomy edge or between sutures). Results: The 400 handle-to-shaft angle had a higher mean (SD) leakage pressure of 43. 8 (20. 0) cm H 2 O compared with the 800 and 00 angles (31. 1 [21. 0] and 26. 3 [19. 0] cm H 2 O, respectively) (P<. 001).
