5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the building.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the library to lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of Bel Air Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, {{the doors of the}} presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 27, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at {{the small town of}} Centralia and {{proceeded}} to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists, and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.|$|E
50|$|After Thompson {{was elected}} to the Senate, two of his sons {{followed}} him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> business, but generally avoided clients where a possible conflict-of-interest might appear.

50|$|Shrieks {{and screams}} of choking, trampled people were terrible. Fights for places grew; Constables were beaten back, the boxes were invaded.

5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E
25|$|As they debouched from dress circle stairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> they {{encountered}} {{a stream of}} other patrons on their right rushing from the parquet and wheeling toward the Washington Street exit. After Thomas Rocheford had opened the Flood's Alley exit, they collided with an opposing stream working toward that door, which was situated beneath the flight of stairs descending from the dress circle. (See Floor Plan 2). The crush developing from these cross-currents soon bought the pace on the dress circle stairs to a halt, inducing a frenzied panic when people further up pressed downward, unaware of the jam below.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with her back against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E

25|$|In <b>lobbying,</b> <b>the</b> {{revolving}} door is the cycling of former federal employees into jobs as lobbyists while former K Street employees are pulled into government positions. Government officials can only work certain terms in their positions, for example senators, and afterwards they form valuable connections {{that could help}} influence future law making. The other form of the {{revolving door}} is pushing lobbyists into government positions, and then developing connections and returning <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> world to use said connections. This is a controversial issue in <b>the</b> political <b>lobbying</b> world.|$|R
25|$|When Joplin and her back-up band {{performed}} at Vets Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday night, May 11, 1969, Columbus Dispatch reviewer John Huddy wrote: Frequently suggestive {{with a series}} of limited but obvious moves, Miss Joplin wears hip-hugging silk bellbottoms and alternates between a wail and a teeth-rattling scream. Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling coarsely at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also has something to say in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> and watched customers arrive. She was not recognized.|$|E
25|$|Austin's next {{definitive}} {{chance to}} exact revenge on Mr. McMahon {{came during the}} 1999 Royal Rumble match. On Raw Is War, McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon {{slipped out of the}} ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It {{turned out to be a}} trap as McMahon led Austin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> restroom where he was ambushed by members of The Corporation. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announce table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to Big Boss Man and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|After {{flashing}} over in {{the ballroom}} (which witnesses confused with an explosion), the super-heated gases swept up the grand staircase <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the hotel. From there, the fire was drawn through the open doors of the casino by the smoke-eaters (devices in the ceiling that sucked the smoke from cigarettes out of the room) present throughout the casino. With more than 150 guests estimated {{to be in the}} casino when the fire broke out, most of the deaths occurred in that area. Several months before the fire, hotel management had had the emergency exit doors locked to prevent theft, and the only other way out was through a pair of inward-opening doors. Some people pressed against the doors to no avail. Others leaped from the second-story casino through plate-glass windows to the pool deck below; many were injured. Others died of smoke inhalation on upper floors of the casino. Still others were killed as they rode the elevators to the lobby, only to discover their path blocked by the fire when the doors opened. Those who were able to do so climbed to the hotel's roof, where an improvised helicopter rescue, including civilian, Commonwealth Police, Puerto Rico National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Navy helicopters from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station, transported people to safety.|$|E
5000|$|An {{estimate}} from 2007 {{reported that}} more than 15,000 federal lobbyists were based in Washington, DC; another estimate from 2011 suggested that the count of registered lobbyists who have actually lobbied was closer to 12,000. While numbers like these suggest that lobbying is a widespread activity, most accounts suggest that <b>the</b> Washington <b>lobbying</b> industry is an exclusive one run by a few well-connected firms and players, with serious barriers to entry for firms wanting to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> business, since it requires them to have been [...] "roaming the halls of Congress for years and years." ...|$|R

40|$|Washington's `revolving door '- the {{movement}} from government service <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> industry- {{is regarded as}} a major concern for policy-making. We study how ex-government staffers benefit from the personal connections acquired during their public service. Lobbyists with experience in the office of a US Senator suffer a 24 % drop in generated revenue when that Senator leaves office. The effect is immediate, discontinuous around the exit period and long-lasting. Consistent with the notion that lobbyists sell access to powerful politicians, the drop in revenue is increasing in the seniority of and committee assignments power held by the exiting politician...|$|R
500|$|According to Ralph Klein, {{former mayor}} of Calgary and premier of Alberta, the Stampede symbolizes the province's spirit. He cited the {{friendly}} and welcoming attitude and festival spirit of the city's populace during the event, which community booster groups export around the world. [...] Among examples cited was the infamous 1948 Grey Cup game in which two trains of Stampeder football fans descended on Toronto and launched an unprecedented series of celebrations before, {{during and after the}} game that included riding a horse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the Royal York Hotel. [...] The events helped turn the Grey Cup into a national festival and the largest single-day sporting event in the country.|$|E
500|$|Local {{reactions}} to the controversial material varied greatly. [...] San Francisco's large hippie population considered the show {{an extension of the}} street activities there, often blurring the barrier between art and life by meditating with the cast and frequently finding themselves onstage during the show. [...] An 18-year-old Princess Anne was seen dancing onstage in London, and in Washington DC, Henry Kissinger attended. [...] In St. Paul, Minnesota, a protesting clergyman released 18 white mice <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> hoping to frighten the audience. Capt. Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert, after dubbing Apollo 13's lunar module [...] "Aquarius" [...] after the song, walked out of the production at the Biltmore in protest of perceived anti-Americanism and disrespect of the flag.|$|E
500|$|More than 450 snakes {{were used}} for filming to {{represent}} thirty different species of snakes. The different species include a 19-foot Burmese python named Kitty (which the crew called Kong for film purposes), a scarlet kingsnake (the non-venomous double for the coral snake), a milk snake to fill in for the taipan (which attacks the couple having sex), corn snakes, rattlesnakes, and mangrove snakes. About two-thirds of the snakes seen throughout the film were either animatronic or CGI. [...] The snakes that were real were mostly the non-venomous ones that are never seen attacking anyone. The scenes where someone is clearly bitten were often done with animation. [...] According to the DVD, all the snakes had production names, but only Scarface (an animated pit viper), Peanut (a cobra), and Kong are mentioned by name in the audio commentary. During filming, Samuel Jackson did not {{come into contact with}} any live snakes, due to a contract clause preventing snakes from being within [...] (25ft) of the actor. When the film was released in theaters, two live western diamondback rattlesnakes were released at a showing of the film on August 22, 2006, in Phoenix, Arizona. One snake had made its way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the theater on its own, and another had been found in the parking lot. Nobody was harmed and the snakes were released back into the desert.|$|E

500|$|Nicknamed Canada's [...] "Grand National Drunk", the Grey Cup party {{originated}} in the 1948 championship when hundreds of Calgary Stampeders fans descended on Toronto for their team's first appearance in the game. Bringing chuckwagons and horses, the fans organized a pancake breakfast – {{a staple of the}} Calgary Stampede – for bewildered Torontonians. According to historian Hugh Dempsey, [...] "The Grey Cup was just another game until Calgary went down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and turned it into an event." [...] The Stampeders won the game on the strength of the [...] "sleeper play", a touchdown scored by Norm Hill after he hid himself from the Ottawa defence by lying down on the sidelines, as if asleep. [...] He received the pass from quarterback Keith Spaith while still on his back. The victory completed the only undefeated season in the history of Canadian professional football. The boisterous celebrations that followed the win gave rise to the legend of Calgary alderman and future mayor Don Mackay riding his horse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> of the Royal York Hotel. [...] This event was repeated in the 2012 Grey Cup game in Toronto to much of the delight of the fans of both teams. The Calgary Grey Cup Committee maintains the tradition of organizing a pancake breakfast at each year's championship.|$|E
