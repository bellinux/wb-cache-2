In 1948, the film Scott of the Antarctic was released in cinemas and was the third most popular film in Britain the following year. It portrays the team spirit of the expedition and the harsh Antarctic environment, but also includes critical scenes such as Scott regarding his broken down motors and ruefully remembering Nansen's advice to take only dogs. Evans and Cherry-Garrard were the only surviving expedition members to refuse participation in the film, but both re-published their respective books in <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b>|$|E
5|$|The power vacuum the Vietnamese {{communist}}s left in <b>its</b> <b>wake</b> in Cambodia {{was soon}} filled by {{the return of}} a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries, many of whom received their communist education in France. In 1960, the KPRP {{changed its name to}} the Kampuchean Communist Party (KCP), and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan as the ‘true’ political institution memorialising the KCP. This clique became the genesis of the Khmer Rouge, and its doctrine was heavily influenced by the Maoist ideology.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical disaster for the communists. Regardless, the offensive {{was a turning point}} in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions of imminent victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory. In <b>its</b> <b>wake</b> President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b> The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E
5|$|Intrepid steamed from Ulithi {{back to the}} Philippines {{with orders}} to strike Nichols and Nielsen airfields, destroy {{shipping}} in Manila Bay and to attack concentrations of enemy aircraft encountered between Manila and Batangas. This effort began on November 19. The first strike of the day ran into token resistance {{from a handful of}} Zeros, but the enemies did not press home attacks on the bomber squadrons. Instead, VF-18 fighters initiated combat, chasing down and destroying two enemy aircraft. A solitary Zero flying at higher altitude was spotted by Harris, who led his division in pursuit. Harris put holes in the enemy fighter's starboard wing root firing from long range. The Japanese pilot bailed out, but his plane continued flying for four or five minutes with curious Hellcats following in <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b> They eventually shot down the unmanned aircraft. Intrepid went to general quarters a number of times throughout the day's strikes and into the evening as enemy planes tested the perimeter of the task group.|$|E
5|$|Ninth Army {{eventually}} evacuated {{the salient}} in Operation Buffalo (Büffel) in March 1943, {{as part of}} a general shortening of the line. Large-scale anti-partisan sweeps were carried out in the weeks before the operation (the army's sector was a hotbed for partisan activity), in which an estimated 3,000 Russians were killed, the great majority of whom were unarmed, as shown by the inventory of the seized weapons: 277 rifles, 41 pistols, 61 machine guns, 17 mortars, 9 antitank rifles and 16 small artillery pieces. The withdrawal itself took two weeks, with minimal casualties or disruption in a move of an Army group numbering approximately 300,000 men, 100 tanks and 400 artillery pieces.

Grooming takes place between the adults earlier in the day, and then the adults groom the juveniles later in the day. Adult males are the most involved in grooming.|$|R
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in <b>its</b> <b>wake</b> a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua tornado was {{an intense}} tornado that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this tornado ranks as the strongest tornado to touch down in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The tornado formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The tornado quickly began to produce damage in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were knocked off their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the tornado dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b> Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures.

5|$|The 2011 Super Outbreak was the largest, costliest, {{and one of}} {{the deadliest}} tornado {{outbreaks}} ever recorded, affecting the Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States and leaving catastrophic destruction in <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b> The event affected Alabama and Mississippi the most severely, but it also produced destructive tornadoes in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, and affected many other areas throughout the Southern and Eastern United States. In total, 362 tornadoes were confirmed by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) and Government of Canada's Environment Canada in 21 states from Texas to New York to southern Canada. Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, with April 27 being the most active day with a record of 218 tornadoes touching down that day from midnight to midnight CDT (0500 – 0500 UTC). Four of the tornadoes were destructive enough to be rated EF5, which is the highest ranking possible on the Enhanced Fujita scale; typically these tornadoes are only recorded about once each year or less.|$|E

5|$|The December 1960 nor'easter was a {{significant}} early-season winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine, amounting to 10in (25cm) or more in parts of 13states and peaking at 21.4in (54.4cm) at Newark, New Jersey. The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting to over 90mph (145km/h) in coastal New England, and left in <b>its</b> <b>wake</b> a dangerously cold air mass. The storm originated in a weak low pressure area which formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December 10. A secondary low developed over South Carolina on the next day, supported by the merger of two troughs aloft. Sliding southeast of New England, the new storm explosively deepened to become a full-fledged nor'easter, with a minimum central air pressure of 966 mbar. It began to weaken over the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in {{an attempt}} to {{expedite}} its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh. Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b> Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers. Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons. He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors. The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed {{the fact that they had}} just crossed. Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in <b>its</b> <b>wake</b> {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
