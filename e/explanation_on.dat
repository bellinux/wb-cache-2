She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage.

The transfer was canceled without <b>explanation</b> <b>on</b> 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard <b>explanation</b> <b>on</b> most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{multimedia}} interpretation, and {{in particular}} for the combined interpretation of information coming from different modalities, a semantically well-founded formalization is required {{in the context of}} an agent-based scenario. Low-level percepts, which are represented symbolically, define the observations of an agent, and interpretations of content are defined as explanations for the observations. We propose an abduction-based formalism that uses description logics for the ontology and Horn rules for defining the space of hypotheses for explanations (i. e., the space of possible interpretations of media content), and we use Markov logic to define the motivation for the agent to generate <b>explanations</b> <b>on</b> the one hand, and for ranking different <b>explanations</b> <b>on</b> the other. 1...|$|R

25|$|Controversy {{occurred}} when Barry suddenly departed {{the group with}} no public <b>explanation</b> <b>on</b> the program.

She stated that she accidentally kept Monk's weekly money allowance with the intention of giving it back to her, but forgot to do this and was therefore removed from the group. In a 2017 Woman's Day interview, Barry stated that she was paid $1000 to leave and keep quiet on the matter, and blamed her actions on her youth and naivety.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 2015, the Vatican Press Office {{confirmed}} that Pope Francis recognised a second miracle attributed to Teresa: {{the healing of}} a Brazilian man with multiple brain tumours back in 2008. The miracle {{first came to the}} attention of the postulation (officials managing the cause) during the events of World Youth Day 2013 when the pope was in Brazil that July. A subsequent investigation took place in Brazil from 19–26 June 2015 which was later transferred to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints who issued a decree recognizing the investigation to be completed. A team of medical experts first analyzed and approved this miracle to have no scientific <b>explanation</b> <b>on</b> 10 September 2015, while theologians ascertained the miracle came about after prayers directed to Teresa after they met on 8 October. The members of the Congregation themselves met and approved the findings of the two previous boards on 15 December which allowed for them to pass on their findings to the pope two days later for his approval which he subsequently granted.|$|E

25|$|The {{return to}} {{democracy}} allowed Peruvians {{to choose among}} strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Belaúnde and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Belaúnde government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach {{never had a chance}} to get very far because of a series of macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the <b>explanation</b> <b>on</b> monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Belaúnde's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to appreciate, and increasing government investment spending.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} film's plot originated when veteran Indian writer Dayanand Rajan {{claimed that the}} plot of the film was plagiarised from his unpublished novel Summer Snow. It's shocking that the main plot, the love story, the hero being wheelchair-bound due to an accident and even the mercy killing are the same as in the movie. The other similarities include a serious accident, in both the scripts, which require the protagonist to begin using a wheelchair and introduce him to the woman taking care of him – it is the nurse who falls in love with Hrithik, while in the novel it is his wife who looks after him. Both scripts having key flashback scenes and the woman supporting mercy killing for the hero. Raajan has dashed off a legal notice to the producers, UTV and Bhansali asking them for an <b>explanation</b> <b>on</b> how their film has so many similarities with his novel but Bhansali's office refused to accept the notice. In late-October, a PIL was filed by Aditya Dewan, a lawyer, in Delhi High Court alleging that Guzaarish promotes euthanasia or mercy killing, which is illegal, and portrays the legal profession in bad light. He demanded a disclaimer from the producers saying mercy killing is not legal in India {{and that there is a}} debate on whether such deaths can be allowed. But the case was dismissed by the court saying the facts averred were inadequate for the court to appreciate and that it cannot be entertained in its present form..|$|E
