25|$|Reason {{and logic}} can however {{be thought of}} as distinct, {{although}} logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter, in Gödel, Escher, Bach, characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> change the rules of the system.|$|E

[...] While crediting Starved for [...] "a few inventive laughs," [...] the language and sexuality of the show are described as [...] "exceptionally coarse" [...] and [...] "outrageous for cable television, even later at night." [...] Worse than these issues, the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them. [...] "his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness, with a sour aftertaste. As if you had just, you know, hurled." ...|$|E

When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> take out the clip." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Cocker contributed Born to Cry, (originally a Pulp song {{released}} on the Notting Hill soundtrack CD – though not {{featured in the}} film and co-written by Richard Hawley) to Tony Christie's album of songs by Sheffield-based songwriters, Made in Sheffield. Around 2008, Cocker also participated in a project that tackled the question, [...] "What is Music?", designed {{to enter into the}} debate over the future of the music industry. Cocker asked: [...] "Does this mean that music can now go back to being an art form again? Also, what <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get a band to rehearse in an art gallery instead of a rehearsal space?" [...] Consequently, Cocker and his band installed themselves in an art gallery in Paris, France for five days. Each day, Cocker and his musicians performed a variety of different tasks. These included sound-tracking a relaxation class, inviting local musicians to join them in a jam and arranging activities with local school-children. Films of the exhibition remain accessible online in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 September 2014, Mark Carney, {{governor}} of the Bank of England, said that a currency union between an independent Scotland and {{the remainder of the}} UK would be [...] "incompatible with sovereignty". Carney was involved in a [...] "Q" [...] session at the Trades Union Congress and further explained that cross-border ties on tax, spending and banking rules are a prerequisite: [...] "You only have to look across the continent to look at what <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't have those components in place ... You need tax, revenues and spending flowing across those borders to help equalise, to an extent, some of the inevitable differences [...]" [...] A spokesperson for the SNP's finance minister responded, saying [...] "Successful independent countries such as France, Germany, Finland and Austria all share a currency – and they are in charge of 100% of their tax revenues, as an independent Scotland would be. At present under devolution, Scotland controls only 7% of our revenues." [...] Carney's comments received vocal support from Darling and the GMB trade union, the latter of which supports the retention of the current UK formation.|$|E

60|$|And as we see, the {{establishment}} of the upper love-and-cognition circuit inevitably provokes the lower sex-sensual centers into action, even though there be no correspondence on the sensual plane between the two individuals concerned. Then see what <b>happens.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to see the real desirable wife-spirit, look at a mother with her boy of eighteen. How she serves him, how she stimulates him, how her true female self is his, is wife-submissive to him as never, never it could be to a husband. This is the quiescent, flowering love of a mature woman. It is the very flower of a woman's love: sexually asking nothing, asking nothing of the beloved, save that he shall be himself, and that for his living he shall accept the gift of her love. This is the perfect flower of married love, which a husband should put in his cap as he goes forward into the future in his supreme activity. For the husband, it is a great pledge, and a blossom. For the son also it seems wonderful. The woman now feels {{for the first time as}} a true wife might feel. And her feeling is towards her son.|$|E

If you're a strong man, you get there, and if you're a weak man, all the righteousness in the universe won't help you. But I propose to do what's right about Cynthia, and not what's wrong; and according to your own theory, of life--which won't hold water a minute--I ought to be blessed to the third and fourth generation. I don't look for that, though. I shall be blessed if I look out for myself; and if I don't, I shall suffer for my want of foresight. But I sha'n't suffer for anything else. Well, I'm going to cut some of my recitations, and I'm going up to Lion's Head, to-morrow, to settle my business with Cynthia.

60|$|There is a {{difference}} between boys and men, but it is {{a difference}} of self-knowledge chiefly. A boy wants to do everything because he does not know he cannot; a man wants to do something because he knows he cannot do everything; a boy always fails, and a man sometimes succeeds because the man knows and the boy does not know. A man is better than a boy because he knows better; he has learned by experience that what is a harm to others is a greater harm to himself, and he would rather not do it. But a boy hardly knows what harm is, and he does it mostly without realizing that it hurts. He cannot invent anything, he can only imitate; and it is easier to imitate evil than good. You can imitate war, but {{how are you going to}} imitate peace? So a boy passes his leisure in contriving mischief. If you get another fellow to walk into a wasp's camp, you can see him jump and hear him howl, but if you do not, then nothing at all <b>happens.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> set a dog to chase a cat up a tree, then something has been done; but if you do not set the dog on the cat, then the cat just lies in the sun and sleeps, and you lose your time. If a boy could find out some way of doing good, so that he could be active in it, very likely he would want to do good now and then; but as he cannot, he very seldom wants to do good.|$|E
