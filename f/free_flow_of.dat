5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E

25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|International {{efforts to}} define fair {{information}} practices for global networks derive from two distinct paradigms. Traditionally, regulatory standards have been cast in trade terms. The trade perspective seeks to promote <b>free</b> <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> information and define standards that balance <b>free</b> <b>flows</b> against human rights values. Fair information practices also draw on another rarely emphasized technical paradigm. This approach seeks to eliminate any technological obstacles to <b>free</b> <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> information by defining standards for system integrity and interoperability. Nevertheless, these technical standards {{are set in}} ways that also define fair information practices. While each paradigm provides a basis to establish rules for global electronic highways, the two are surprisingly self-contained and tend not to fit within the broader trends in global information networks and practices. Instead of facilitating the definition of fair information practice standards, the distinct trade and technical perspectives obscure the tendency of global networks to shift norms for the regulation of private sector actors into a combined arena of both national and network jurisdiction. Global information networks challenge regulatory and political assumptions and defy simple regulation of fair information practice. These independent approaches {{to the establishment of}} fair information practice rules suggest that international data flows require complex standards, including overlapping regulation, rather than isolated one-dimensional rules...|$|R

The Bahá'í teachings see improved communication between peoples throughout the world as a vital part of world unity and peace. The Bahá'í teachings see the current multiplicity of languages as a major impediment to unity, since the existence of so many languages cuts the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> information and makes it difficult for the average individual to obtain a universal perspective on world events.|$|E

Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When Nature failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an insane person, for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger.|$|E

25|$|Still-larger discs {{are used}} for {{railroad}} cars and some airplanes. Passenger rail cars and light rail vehicles often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> cooling air. However, on some modern passenger rail cars, such as the Amfleet II cars, inboard disc brakes are used. This reduces wear from debris, and also provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery, and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. In contrast, some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling and the brake gets quite hot in a stop, but this is acceptable as there is then time for cooling, and where the maximum braking energy is very predictable.|$|E
