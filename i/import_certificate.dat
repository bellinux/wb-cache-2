5000|$|Government authorizations are not {{required}} for each import or export of preparations in Schedule III. The <b>import</b> <b>certificate</b> and export authorization system laid down in Article 31, paragraphs 4 to 15, which governs the international transactions in drugs and their preparations, {{does not apply to}} the preparations in Schedule III.|$|E
5|$|Introduced by {{the second}} International Opium Convention, the Permanent Central Opium Board had to {{supervise}} the statistical reports on trade in opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin. The board also established a system of <b>import</b> <b>certificates</b> and export authorisations for the legal international trade in narcotics.|$|R
50|$|The Geneva Convention of 1925 {{supplemented}} {{and extended}} that of The Hague. It rendered the <b>import</b> <b>certificates</b> compulsory, and provided for more effective supervision {{of production and}} international trade.The Convention further provided for the setting up of a Permanent Central Opium Board. The Board {{was set up in}} 1928, and build up the international system of control.|$|R
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the <b>import</b> <b>certificates,</b> {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the role of {{non-tariff}} barriers (NTBs) for new member states (NMSs) exports in the agri-food sector, in the period just before the EU accession actually stepped into force. The assessment {{is based on a}} detailed sectoral gravity model, which was enhanced with inclusion of different categories of NTBs: sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), quality measures and <b>import</b> <b>certificates.</b> While the first two categories have implications primarily on production costs, the last category relates to transaction costs. SPS and quality measures do not so much act as barriers to trade for NMSs agro-food exports in the period immediately before joining the single market (year 2003), and their diminishing role, confirmed by the use of gravity modelling technique rather reflects the progress made in implementing the acquis communautaire. In contrast, <b>import</b> <b>certificates</b> still act as a barrier to trade, for reasons relating to the transaction costs involved. While developing the model on the product level, prices and two ratios of competitiveness (bilateral, global) were introduced, by which the multilateral resistance to trade is indicated. non-tariff barriers, Eastern European enlargement, acquis communautaire, gravity equation, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
50|$|<b>Import</b> <b>certificates</b> are a {{proposed}} mechanism to implement balanced trade, and eliminate a country's trade deficit. The idea was proposed by Warren Buffett in 2003 {{to address the}} U.S. trade deficit. In the United States, the idea was first introduced legislatively in the Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 2006. The proposed legislation was sponsored by Senators Byron Dorgan (ND) and Russell Feingold (WI), two Democrats in the United States senate. Since then {{there has been no}} action on the bill.|$|R
5000|$|In both a 1987 guest {{editorial}} to the Omaha-World Herald and a {{more detailed}} 2003 Fortune article, Buffett proposed a tool called <b>Import</b> <b>Certificates</b> {{as a solution to}} the United States' problem and ensure balanced trade. [...] "The rest of the world owns a staggering $2.5 trillion more of the U.S. than we own of other countries. Some of this $2.5 trillion is invested in claim checks—U.S. bonds, both governmental and private—and some in such assets as property and equity securities." ...|$|R
50|$|Encouragement of {{domestic}} and foreign investment. Changing and eliminating legislation and legal contradictions that currently hinder investment. Procedures must be streamlined to allocate land under long-term leases to investors who will build new facilities in Ukraine, especially in the technology sector. Other proposals include transparent and open privatization and tender processes {{and the establishment of}} a network of regional ombudsman to simplify processes for obtaining <b>import</b> <b>certificates.</b> Special emphasis will be made to attract investment in the power sector and all new legislation enacted will be in accordance with WTO practices.|$|R
25|$|Overall {{development}} of the Il-86 occupied over a decade. The length of this period {{was due to the}} sensitivity of the airliner's configuration, problems with its powerplant, prolonged avionics development and the low priority of civil as opposed to military aircraft. In its earlier stages, the Il-86 programme was also held back by hopes of US airliner <b>imports.</b> <b>Certificating</b> the Il-86 to the very demanding set of Soviet and Comecon standards called NLGS-2 also delayed progress; it was the first Soviet aircraft to undergo a full certification programme since certification was introduced in the USSR in 1967 and became mandatory five years later.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advocate}} of Balanced Trade has been Kenneth Davis Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Commerce and former Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for IBM Inc. In 2014 Mr. Davis and Will Wilkin formed Balanced Trade Associates {{to advocate for}} a Balanced Trade policy in the United States. They drafted model legislation, the Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 2014, that would use an electronic form of <b>Import</b> <b>Certificates</b> to taper down imports 10% each year for 3 years, then, beginning in the 4th year, limit imports each year to the same value as the previous year's exports.|$|R
50|$|Under his plan, {{the budget}} would be {{balanced}} {{and the national}} debt would be retired, {{with the help of}} progressive taxation and a wealth tax on the super-rich, as Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, and others have proposed. The trade balance would be restored with <b>import</b> <b>certificates,</b> which balances <b>imports</b> with exports, and would function like a tariff, but be based on supply and demand. Treasury securities would no longer be issued because the government's own money would be spent into existence at a rate that would keep inflation at a low rate, and help prevent new debt from being created.|$|R
50|$|Buffett's plan proposes {{creating}} {{a market for}} transferable <b>import</b> <b>certificates,</b> (ICs) that would represent the right to import a certain dollar amount of goods into the United States. These transferable ICs would be issued to US exporters in an amount equal to the dollar amount of the goods they export and they could only be utilized once. They could be sold or traded to importers, who must purchase {{them in order to}} legally import goods into the USA. The price of ICs are set by (free-market) forces, and are therefore dependent on the balance between entrepreneurs' willingness to pay the ICs market price for importing goods into the USA and the global volume of goods exported from the USA, (i.e. supply and demand).|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{while on}} a cat finding trip to Singapore, American breeder Jerry Mayes {{discovered}} importation papers which revealed that the three foundation cats were actually taken into Singapore from the US in 1974. Lucy Koh, a friend of Mayes, made efforts to correct {{the history of the}} Singapura presented by the Meadows but that went relatively unnoticed until 1990, when the Singapore Tourist and Promotion Board (now Singapore Tourism Board) started a campaign to use the Singapura as a national mascot. Reporter Sandra Davie was informed of the discrepancy and published an article about it in the national broadsheet The Straits Times.Because the cats were registered as Abyssinians in the <b>import</b> <b>certificates,</b> and because the Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, as well as the Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|R
50|$|Other {{measures}} {{include a}} smart grid, smart meters and feed-in tariffs, a green investment bank would be created, {{and promotion of}} anaerobic digestion of waste for energy, marine energy, home energy improvement, green spaces and wildlife corridors, and electric car recharging networks. Home Information Packs would be abolished, albeit retaining the energy performance <b>certificates.</b> <b>Import</b> or export of illegal timber would be criminalised.|$|R
5000|$|A Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR) is {{a private}} person {{designated}} by the United States Federal Aviation Administration to act on its behalf in the certification of type certificated and amateur-built aircraft for the issuance of airworthiness certificates, special flight permits, <b>import</b> aircraft, export <b>certificates</b> for products and articles, conformity inspections and field approvals for repair and alterations. Most DARs have limited and/or certain [...] "functions" [...] authorized by the FAA based on their experience and technical background. A DAR [...] may charge a fee {{for his or her}} services.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the use of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) has recently been growing because it is becoming more important to encourage the use of current FTAs than {{to increase the number of}} FTAs. In this paper, we discuss some practical issues in the computation of FTA utilization rates, which provide a useful measure to discover how much FTA schemes are used in trade. For example, compared with the use of customs data on FTA utilization in <b>imports,</b> when using <b>certificates</b> of origin data on FTA utilization in exports, there are several points about which we should be careful. Our practical guidance on the computation of FTA utilization rates will be helpful when computing such rates and in examining the determinants of those rates empirically...|$|R
40|$|This work envisages {{minimizing}} many shortcomings including associated {{delays in}} the cargo clearance process when the <b>import</b> and export <b>certificate</b> which is legally known as license/permit become applicable. Preliminary survey conducted revealed that there is undue delay. The work then systematically identifies the factors that hamper efficient and effective enforcement of such regulations in the import and export of goods in the Sri Lankan context. A questionnaire was circulated among a sample of 100 importers and exporters or their representatives in order to gather information on ground level practical problems faced by them. Existing laws and regulations as well as regulatory processes at several agencies were examined to identify the correct legal position and any existing automated solutions. Various authorities were interviewed {{in order to identify}} their requirements as well as the problems they face. It was found that in almost all the instances manual procedures are in use in the issuance of certificates (licenses/permits) and in subsequent debit/write-off steps introducing delays, duplications and poor control effects. The study shows that certain commodities require certificates from more than one regulatory agency for identical purpose. It is recommended that Automated Certificate Processing System be put into use integrated with the existing Customs Automated System. It is also recommended that the simplification and standardizing of procedures at regulatory agencies as well as at Customs need to be carried out before introducing an automated system. Proposed e-Certificate system will not only expedite the clearance process but also will prevent the certificates being misused. Much superior controls could be implemented as online information will be available for all regulatory agencies. Main goal of the proposal is to eliminate paper requirement and pave the way for paperless trade in Sri Lanka...|$|R
