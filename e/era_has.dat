5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian <b>era</b> <b>has</b> taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca's salient {{architecture}} is primarily Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic. The modern <b>era</b> <b>has</b> also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the mid-century style. The mostly utilitarian Communist-era {{architecture is}} also present, although {{only to a}} certain extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large systematisation programme. Of late, the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.|$|E
5|$|No {{recession}} of the post-World War II <b>era</b> <b>has</b> come {{anywhere near the}} depth of the Great Depression. In the Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of the second quarter of 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession).|$|E

5|$|India, Japan, China, the United States, and the European Space Agency each sent lunar orbiters, and {{especially}} ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 {{has contributed to}} confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith. The post-Apollo <b>era</b> <b>has</b> also seen two rover missions: the final Soviet Lunokhod mission in 1973, and China's ongoing Chang'e 3 mission, which deployed its Yutu rover on 14 December 2013. The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.|$|E
5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II <b>era</b> <b>has</b> come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{probably}} {{arrived in}} Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority {{emerged in the}} 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Oghaminscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now {{generally considered to be}} of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times. The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse <b>era</b> <b>has</b> provided a variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.|$|E

5|$|The 2000s saw {{formation}} of several pioneering Oriental metal bands from the Arab world, the best-known {{of which is}} Myrath from Tunisia. They have released four albums (three internationally) and have toured in Europe with Orphaned Land. Their sound combined progressive metal (in the vein of Dream Theater, et al.) with specifically Arab & North African melodies and themes. The Kordz from Lebanon straddle the line between hard rock and progressive metal, and again draw on local folk melodies (produced mainly via keyboards) to broaden the sonic palette. Hard rock band Lazywall from Morocco frequently makes use of oud and djembe in their music, producing something analogous to Oriental metal (though generally no heavier than Alice in Chains). North Africa has had a growing metal scene for some time, {{and a few of}} those bands have ventured into folk-metal, notably Andaz Azzul from Algeria, which blends Berber melodies & themes with violin and metal. And Egypt's truly path-breaking female-fronted Oriental metal band Massive Scar <b>Era</b> <b>has</b> recently broken through and has posted official videos on YouTube, though they continue to face considerable discrimination at home, with frontwoman Sherine reporting harassment on account of her participation. Their sound has broadened to include the heavy use of violin (in effect making them a folk-metal band, rather than simply another of the growing profusion of heavy metal bands in the Middle East).|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} is {{normally}} {{defined as the}} 25 years preceding the current year.

25|$|Until the 1980s, it was universally {{believed}} by academic historians that technological innovation was {{the heart of}} the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine. However, recent research into the Marketing <b>Era</b> <b>has</b> challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The Kandyan army {{consisted}} of forces raised {{from the five}} divisions of the kingdom. None of the muster rolls from this <b>era</b> <b>has</b> survived, from which to accurately determine the initial strength of the Kandyan army, but a reasonable estimate of 10,000 men has been made from studies of revenue registers.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate between}} {{politicians}} and economists {{over the role}} of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality. Economists such as Paul Krugman, Peter Orszag, and Emmanuel Saez have argued that tax policy in the post World War II <b>era</b> <b>has</b> indeed increased income inequality by enabling the wealthiest Americans far greater access to capital than lower-income ones.|$|E

25|$|The modern <b>era</b> <b>has</b> {{unfolded}} {{in the shadow}} of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor. Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as La Marseillaise and Liberté, fraternité, égalité, ou la mort, became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the Russian Revolution over a century later.|$|E

It is named for William Woodbridge, governor of Michigan in 1840–1, who owned a large farm on which much of the neighborhood was subsequently built.|$|E
