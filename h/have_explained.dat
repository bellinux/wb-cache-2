5|$|Some writers <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> {{the crucifixion}} {{darkness}} {{in terms of}} sunstorms, heavy cloud cover, {{the aftermath of a}} volcanic eruption, or a khamsin dust storm that tends to occur from March to May. A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an 'oppressive gloom' and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject matter}} of the third letter {{is similar to that of}} the second letter, and some {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report. The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of his audience, the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Modern mythographers {{have seen}} the story of Orion {{as a way to}} access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E

5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> that the objective {{in mind when}} designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> agoraphobia as {{an attachment}} deficit, i.e., the temporary {{loss of the}} ability to tolerate spatial separations from a secure base. Recent empirical research has also linked attachment and spatial theories of agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{media outlets}} like the New York Times <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> to their American readers that {{although}} 5000 years ago, soothsayers were prized advisers to the Assyrians, they lost respect and reverence during {{the rise of}} Reason in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

25|$|Saaremaa (Ã˜sel): from 1603, last used by King Frederick VI: Azure, {{an eagle}} {{displayed}} Sable. Several historians <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> this {{violation of the}} heraldic rule of tincture as the black colour being {{the result of an}} oxidation of white paint containing lead.|$|E
25|$|Different {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> these anamolies {{in different}} ways. Scholars such as R. G. Bhandarkar, D. C. Sircar and H. C. Raychaudhuri theorized that the Vayu Purana mentions only the main imperial {{branch of the}} dynasty, while the Matsya Purana puts together princes of all its branches.|$|E
25|$|It {{also sought}} to take some blame away from Tinsley, because {{he may have been}} {{suffering}} from a form of epilepsy which affected his short term memory, which they argued would <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> why he might have simply not been aware of the waiting local train.|$|E

25|$|One {{scientist}} {{believed that}} the lander's thrusters splashed a pocket of brine from just below the Martian surface onto the landing strut during the vehicle's landing. The salts would then have absorbed water vapor from the air, which would <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> how they appeared to grow in size during the first 44 sols (Martian days) before slowly evaporating as Mars temperature dropped.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{according}} to Halt's memo, three starlike lights {{were seen in}} the sky, two {{to the north and}} one to the south, about 10 degrees above the horizon. Halt said that the brightest of these hovered for two to three hours and seemed to beam down a stream of light from time to time. Astronomers <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> these starlike lights as bright stars.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1790s {{after the}} Revolution, slaveholders manumitted an {{unprecedented}} number of African Americans in Maryland and Virginia. Historians <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> the numerous manumissions in three ways: {{as a consequence}} of Revolutionary ideals, religious fervor, and depressed crop prices in the Upper South decreasing the need for labor. In addition, changes in types of crops, from tobacco to mixed crops, had decreased the need for labor.|$|E

25|$|Adam Air {{is being}} sued by Indonesian {{consumer}} and labour groups over the accident, {{for a total}} of one trillion rupiahs (US$100 million), to be paid {{to the families of the}} victims. According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty rudder control valve although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which went down in the early 1990s. They <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> that, as a result, they are suing Boeing and Parker Hannifin, the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the 737 have been warned about problems with the rudder control valves.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} various {{scientific}} research in evolutionary biology, comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> the phylogeny of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. From {{the point of}} view of biological evolution, the pineal gland represents a kind of atrophied photoreceptor. In the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles, it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also called the pineal eye or third eye.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry {{concluded}} that DIMIA officials had simply acted on unfounded assumptions about Solon, rather than discovering real evidence. They assumed that Solon's surname was Alvarez (actually her middle name) and conducted their initial searches {{based on this}} name. As such, they found no record of her. There were eleven different spellings used by various officials, which also led to confusion. The initial investigation did {{not take into account}} the fact that Solon had been treated in the psychiatric ward in Lismore, which might <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> inconsistencies in evidence she gave to DIMIA officials.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} plate {{tectonics}} <b>has</b> <b>explained</b> {{the vast majority}} of orogenic belts and their features. The cooling earth theory (principally advanced by Descartes) is dispensed with, and tephrotectonic style vertical movements <b>have</b> been <b>explained</b> primarily by the process of isostasy.|$|R

25|$|Manfred had no {{involvement}} in German politics, where the interregnum lasted longer {{and there was}} no emperor until 1274. He first styled himself as vicar of his nephew Conradin, Conrad's son. However, following a false rumour that Conradin was dead, Manfred later had himself crowned as king. He wished for a reconciliation with the papacy, which may <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> his support for the landless Baldwin II, Latin Emperor. However, Pope Urban IV and later Pope Clement IV were not prepared to recognize Manfred as lawful ruler of Sicily and first excommunicated then sought to depose him by force of arms.|$|E
25|$|Penderel Moon simply {{attributes}} the League's {{rise to power}} to the alluring and irresistible appeal of the Pakistan cry to the Muslim masses. Peter Hardy's explained that the Muslim League gained its electoral success in the Punjab by making a religious appeal {{over the heads of}} the professional politicians. Pakistani historians <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> the League's success in the Punjab, as elsewhere in the subcontinent, solely in terms of the Two Nation Theory. Whatever the historians may suggest, one thing is clear that League's success was due to the political vision, farsightedness of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a man of high personal integrity and intelligence who became a Grandmaster of the game by his clever, and clever calculations.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{completion}} of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure. Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model. He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery. There {{is no doubt that}} Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, <b>have</b> <b>explained</b> this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because {{it would have been very}} difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.|$|E
