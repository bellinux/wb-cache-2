30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston rod, <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston rod and <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|E

30|$|From Figure  13, one can {{see that}} under the same {{conditions}} as those described above, the conventional hydrostatic symmetrical support structure must provide a much greater force when the horizontal articulated servo cylinder is reciprocating. A maximum of 250 % of a given load force is required in response, which is not achievable for this structure. Furthermore, over the entire movement, the direct force fluctuation in the piston rod and <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve</b> is very large, reaching a maximum value of 232 N, which {{is much higher than}} the maximum value for the asymmetric hydrostatic support structure design proposed in this paper. From Figure  11, {{one can see}} that the response to the maximum eccentric load of 2000 N for the proposed system is less than 10 % of that value. The asymmetric static-pressure support structure proposed in this paper can effectively overcome the issues of wear, leakage, and insufficient output force caused by the weight and external load characteristics of a heavy-duty servo cylinder with a horizontal hinged installation. From Figure  12, one can see that the direct maximum force between the piston rod and <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve</b> is 50 pN for the proposed structure.

New systems allow matching optical scans with three-dimensional radiographic images. PURPOSE To test whether digitally designed three-dimensional printed templates (D-temp) fabricated by matching surface scans and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images differ from the templates fabricated in-lab (L-temp) by using a physical transfer device for the positioning of the <b>guiding</b> <b>sleeves.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS L-temp were fabricated for eight human lower cadaver-jaws applying a digital planning software program (smop, Swissmeda AG, Zürich, Switzerland) using a Lego® (Lego Group, KIRKBI A/S, Billund, Denmark) brick as reference element and the respective transfer device (X 1 -table). Additionally, digital templates (D-temp) using the identical planning data sets and software were virtually designed and three-dimensional printed, after matching a surface scan with CBCT data. The accuracy of both templates for each planning was evaluated determining the estimated coronal, apical, and angular deviation if templates were used for implant placement. RESULTS Mean coronal deviations for L-temp were 0. 31 [*]mm (mesial/distal), 0. 32 [*]mm (lingual/buccal), and 0. 16 [*]mm and 0. 23 [*]mm for D-temp, respectively. The mean apical deviations for L-temp were 0. 50 [*]mm (mesial/distal), 0. 50 [*]mm (lingual/buccal). and 0. 25 [*]mm and 0. 34 [*]mm for the D-temp, respectively. Differences between both devices were statistically significant (p[*]<[*]. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the applicability of tubular manipulators as an actuator mechanism for intracochlear positioning of the electrode array (EA) of a cochlear implant (CI). This is motivated by the vision of an atraumatic insertion of the EA into the inner ear (cochlea) without any damage to the intracochlear structures in combination with a well-defined final position. To realize this, an actuator mechanism is required which allows consideration of the patient-specific anatomy. We propose a tubular manipulator for this task. It consists of three concentric tubes: A straight outer tube serves as a <b>guiding</b> <b>sleeve</b> to enter the inner ear (cochlea) and two additional telescoping, superelastic, helically precurved tubes. By selecting helical tube parameters of both tubes prior insertion, a patient-specific curling behaviour of the tubular manipulator can be achieved. For preliminary investigation, segmentation and skeletonization of 5 human scala tympani were performed to determine their centrelines. These centrelines were considered as individual ideal insertion paths. An optimization algorithm was developed to identify suitable tube set parameters (curvature, diameter, length, torsion, stiffness) as well as configuration parameters (translation and rotation of the 2 inner tubes). Different error values describing the deviation of the shape of the tubes with respect to the insertion path were used to quantify the optimization results. In all cases tube set parameters for a final position within the cochlea were found, while keeping the maximum error below 1 mm. These preliminary results are promising in terms of the potential applicability of tubular manipulators for positioning auditory prosthesis inside the scala tympani of the inner ear...|$|R

30|$|The servo {{cylinder}} {{is the executive}} component of a hydraulic servo system.

30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the servo cylinder piston rod, <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and piston, as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|E
30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E
30|$|The single-incision TT ACL {{reconstruction}} technique {{still seems}} to be the procedure most commonly performed by orthopedic surgeons [36]. Nevertheless, when using an in–out technique, the surgeon {{may not be able to}} place the tunnel within the margins of the anatomical ACL footprint [3]. In fact, femoral tunnel anatomical placement could be achieved if the starting point is close to the tibial joint line, resulting in a short tibial tunnel with concerns regarding sufficient tunnel length for graft fixation and graft incorporation [23]. Therefore, as suggested by some authors [37], if anatomical positioning of the femoral tunnel cannot be achieved with TT drilling, then an alternative approach may be indicated [38]. The TP technique has been shown to allow for slightly greater femoral tunnel obliquity compared with TT drilling [39]. However, a reported risk of the TP technique for ACL femoral tunnel creation is short tunnel length, which can result in reduced length of tendon graft within the femoral bone tunnel [40, 41]. This is an issue for surgeons desiring to avoid the risk of inadequate graft tissue within a tunnel, particularly when using suspensory fixation devices with fixed loop length, as the loop of the device leaves less length of graft within the tunnel. In fact, the drill angle in TP technique is somewhat constrained due to the combination of knee hyperflexion and portal fixed position just above the medial meniscus and lateral to the medial femoral condylar articular cartilage. On the other hand, the OI technique has the advantage of the flexibility of the over-the-top guides, which allow intraosseous distance measurement before drilling by observing marks on the <b>guide</b> pin <b>sleeve.</b> Therefore, if the distance is too short, manipulation of the drill angle and starting position can be performed to achieve a longer tunnel before drilling, whereas with the TP portal technique, intraosseous distance cannot be measured before pin passage.|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be <b>guided</b> by spring-loaded <b>sleeves</b> or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, necking, flange curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|R
30|$|The gripper {{cylinder}} {{that provides}} braced force for Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) might fail due to severe vibration when the TBM excavates in the tunnel. Early fault {{diagnosis of the}} gripper cylinder {{is important for the}} safety and efficiency of the whole tunneling project. In this paper, an online condition monitoring system based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is established for fault diagnosis of the gripper cylinder while TBM is working. Firstly, the lumped mass parameter model of the gripper cylinder is established considering the influence of the variable stiffness at the rock interface, the equivalent stiffness of the oil, the seals, and the copper <b>guide</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The dynamic performance of the gripper cylinder is investigated to provide basis for its health condition evaluation. Then, the EMD method is applied to identify the characteristic frequencies of the gripper cylinder for fault diagnosis and a field test is used to verify the accuracy of the EMD method for detection of the characteristic frequencies. Furthermore, the contact stiffness at the interface between the barrel and the rod is calculated with Hertz theory and the relationship between the natural frequency and the stiffness varying with the health condition of the cylinder is simulated based on the dynamic model. The simulation shows that the characteristic frequencies decrease with the increasing clearance between the barrel and the rod, thus the defects could be indicated by monitoring the natural frequency. Finally, a health condition management system of the gripper cylinder based on the vibration signal and the EMD method is established, which could ensure the safety of TBM.|$|E
