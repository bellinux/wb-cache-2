5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{metal can}} be isolated by <b>electrolysis</b> of its hydroxide {{in a process}} that has changed little since it was first used by Humphry Davy in 1807. Although the <b>electrolysis</b> process was developed and used in industrial scale in the 1920s, the thermal method by reacting sodium with potassium chloride in a chemical equilibrium reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{was first}} isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) {{by the use}} of <b>electrolysis</b> of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Previous attempts at <b>electrolysis</b> of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by <b>electrolysis.</b> Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different. Later that year, the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared by Humphry Davy through the <b>electrolysis</b> of molten caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|Also, pure {{lanthanum}} can {{be produced}} by <b>electrolysis</b> of molten mixture of anhydrous LaCl3 and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by <b>electrolysis</b> of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the <b>electrolysis</b> of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an <b>electrolysis</b> of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the <b>electrolysis</b> experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal <b>electrolysis</b> they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} <b>electrolysis</b> of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the <b>electrolysis</b> of sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|The direct <b>electrolysis</b> of a molten {{mixture of}} {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul Lebeau in 1898 {{resulted in the}} first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium. The first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt. Their process involves the <b>electrolysis</b> of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and barium, which causes molten beryllium to collect on a water-cooled iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{produced}} from the oxide (reduced) either by <b>electrolysis</b> or by reacting the tellurium dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{solution}} of tin(II) chloride containing a little hydrochloric acid {{is used for}} the tin-plating of steel, in order to make tin cans. An electric potential is applied, and tin metal is formed at the cathode via <b>electrolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by <b>electrolysis</b> in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the <b>electrolysis</b> solution.|$|E
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on <b>electrolysis,</b> Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. <b>Electrolysis</b> then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Electrochemistry {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and <b>electrolysis</b> cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.|$|E
5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is <b>electrolysis</b> of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} produced and {{consumed in the}} same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process {{for the production of}} ammonia, hydrogen is generated from natural gas. <b>Electrolysis</b> of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.|$|E
5|$|James Hargreaves (1834–1915) was {{a chemist}} and inventor, who, along with Thomas Bird, {{developed}} {{a process for}} the <b>electrolysis</b> of brine using asbestos diaphragms. In 1899, he became director of the newly opened General Electrolytic Alkali Company at Middlewich.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{production}} has greatly increased {{since the end}} of World War II. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals. The metal is produced through <b>electrolysis</b> from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450°C.|$|E
5|$|Many metals are geologically most {{abundant}} as ionic compounds within ores. To obtain the elemental materials, these ores are processed by smelting or <b>electrolysis,</b> in which redox reactions occur (often with a reducing agent such as carbon) {{such that the}} metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.|$|E
5|$|Membrane cell <b>electrolysis</b> employs {{permeable}} membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride {{solution is}} {{passed through the}} anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration. This method also produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by <b>electrolysis</b> of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by <b>electrolysis</b> of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by <b>electrolysis.</b> Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, {{it took some time}} before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the <b>electrolysis</b> of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (lye) {{is used in}} soap manufacture, and sodium chloride (edible salt) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes thorium is {{extracted}} by <b>electrolysis</b> of a fluoride {{in a mixture}} of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800°C in a graphite crucible. Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN) can be {{deposited}} by {{catalytic decomposition}} of borazine at a temperature ~1100 °C in a {{chemical vapor deposition}} setup, over areas up to about 10 cm2. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as substrates for graphene-based devices. BN nanosheets are also excellent proton conductors. Their high proton transport rate, combined with the high electrical resistance, may lead to applications in fuel cells and water <b>electrolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in <b>electrolysis</b> for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electrolysis</b> of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following {{the success of a}} similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.|$|E
5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that <b>electrolysis</b> of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by <b>electrolysis</b> in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell <b>electrolysis,</b> an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by <b>electrolysis.</b> The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the <b>electrolysis</b> of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through <b>electrolysis</b> of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was generally made from the <b>electrolysis</b> of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by <b>electrolysis</b> into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The zirconium-containing mineral zircon {{and related}} {{minerals}} (jargoon, hyacinth, jacinth, ligure) were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral {{was not known}} to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (zirconia). Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through <b>electrolysis,</b> but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.|$|E
