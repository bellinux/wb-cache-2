50|$|A <b>hemoglobinometer</b> is {{a medical}} {{measuring}} device of hemoglobin blood concentration. It can operate by spectrophotometric measurement of hemoglobin concentration. Portable hemoglobinometers provide easy and convenient measurement of hematological variables, especially in areas where no clinic laboratories are available.|$|E
40|$|Background: One of the {{responsibilities}} of blood center is to provide safety to blood donors. It is mandatory to screen a blood donor for hemoglobin (Hb) or hematocrit which should not be less than 12. 5 g/dl or 38 % Hct. Most commonly applied method for hemoglobin estimation is copper sulphate method, but this method has chances of false acceptance as well as false deferral. In order to avoid this chance of error, digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> is used. This study was planned to analyze effect of application of digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> for detection of Hb on donors, who are deferred by copper sulphate method. Materials and Methods: Total 35, 339 voluntary non renumareted altruistic donors were {{included in this study}} between the periods of September 2005 to July 2006. Total deferred donors were 8622 (24. 39 %) and donors deferred due to hemoglobin by copper sulphate method were 4391 (50. 92 %). Digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> was applied on 3163 deferred donors (72. 03 %). Results of digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> were validated by known controls. Result: Digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> was applied on 3163 donors who were deferred by copper sulphate method. Out of this, donors accepted by digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> were 1196 (37. 01 %). Total repeat donors were 629 (52. 50 %) and first time were 567 (47. 40 %). Male donors were 891 (74. 44 %) and females were 305 (25. 50 %). Donors deferred with digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> were 2135, out of them 1097 (51. 14 %) were repeat, 1038 (48. 38 %) were first time, 1349 (60. 79 %) were male, 786 (34. 47 %) donors were female donors. Range of hemoglobin in deferred donors was 7. 0 to 12. 4 and in accepted donors 12. 5 to 16. 4. Conclusion: By the application of digital <b>hemoglobinometer</b> 37. 81 % donors were found hemoglobin > 12. 5 which were deferred with copper sulphate method and unnecessary deferral of donors can be reduced to a great extent. In country like India, where blood supply is always less than the requirement, this new technique may be helpful to increase donor population but cost benefit ratio should be analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Determinations of {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) {{levels and}} packed cell volumes (PCV) {{can be performed}} by various methods, including rapid testing using a portable <b>hemoglobinometer.</b> As a simple method that requires small blood samples and provides results in seconds, the utilization of portable hemoglobinometers has become increasingly widespread. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of the Hemo_ Vet, a portable <b>hemoglobinometer,</b> in Hb measurements and PCV determinations in dogs. A total of 100 blood samples were used to compare the Hb and PCV values provided by the Hemo_Vet with those obtained using an automatic hematology analyzer (BC 2800 VET) and the microhematocrit technique. The Bland-Altman method was used for data analysis. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a high level of agreement between the Hb values obtained from the BC 2800 VET and those obtained using the Hemo_ Vet. The bias was close to zero (0. 17), and although it was statistically significant (p = 0. 0003), it unlikely would result in any clinically significant effects. The differences in the PCV values generated using the <b>hemoglobinometer</b> and the BC 2800 VET technique and those generated using the <b>hemoglobinometer</b> and microhematocrit technique exhibited a bias of 7. 80 and 2. 80, respectively, indicating a high degree of variability between these methods. In addition, the <b>hemoglobinometer</b> was not able to determine PCV values below 18 % and above 59 %. The precision, standard deviation and coefficients of variation for the device all showed low variation. These results indicate that the <b>hemoglobinometer</b> exhibits good precision and fulfills its primary purpose, which is to measure Hb levels. However, this device was less effective in determining PCV values, where it exhibited high level of variation in both methods of comparison. These results revealed the need to change the conversion factor for estimations of PCV values from 2. 94 to 3. 54 for dog...|$|E

Misra Medical College and Hospital, 3 Department of Transfusion Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India Abstract: Blood donor {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) estimation is {{an important}} donation test that is performed prior to blood donation. It serves the dual purpose of protecting the donors’ health against anemia and ensuring good quality of blood components, which has an implication on recipients’ health. Diverse cutoff criteria have been defined world over depending on population characteristics; however, no testing methodology and sample requirement have been specified for Hb screening. Besides the technique, there are several physiological and methodological factors that affect accuracy and reliability of Hb estimation. These include the anatomical source of blood sample, posture of the donor, timing of sample and several other biological factors. Qualitative copper sulfate gravimetric method has been the archaic time-tested method that is still used in resource-constrained settings. Portable <b>hemoglobinometers</b> are modern quantitative devices that have been further modified to reagent-free cuvettes. Furthermore, noninvasive spectrophotometry was introduced, mitigating pain to blood donor and eliminating risk of infection. Notwithstanding a tremendous evolution in terms of ease of operation, accuracy, mobility, rapidity and cost, a component of inherent variability persists, which may partly be attributed to pre-analytical variables. Hence, blood centers should pay due attention to validation of test methodology, competency of operating staff and regular proficiency testing of the outputs. In this article, we have reviewed various regulatory guidelines, described the variables that affect the measurements and compared the validated technologies for Hb screening of blood donors along with enumeration of their merits and limitations.

40|$|Measurement of {{hemoglobin}} {{concentration is}} among the most common clinical procedures. It is necessary in screening for anemia and is a means of providing a general assessment of physical well-being. Current methods for measuring hemoglobin concentration are invasive, requiring blood access. This paper describes a novel technique for measuring hemoglobin concentration noninvasively. The method takes advantage of the unique optical properties of hemoglobin to make the measurement. A vascularized tissue bed is transilluminated with a narrow linewidth optical source at an isobestic wavelength of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. The transmitted light intensity is measured as the tissue is compressed, which causes an increase in the transmitted optical signal by forcing blood out of the optical path. The Lambert-Beer Law, modified to include optical scattering by tissue, provides the basic principle upon which the technique is based. The theory is discussed and an experimental prototype device is described. Preliminary analysis of experimental results shows a correlation between measurements obtained using the noninvasive tissue compression/transillumination method and hemoglobin concentrations measured by a clinical (invasive) <b>hemoglobinometer.</b> However, noise in the data are cause for concern, and may limit the clinical utility of the technique. Possible explanations for the variability in experimental results are given, along with suggestions for possible improvements to the device and technique. 1...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} iron-deficiency anemia in children aged less than 60 months and the conditioning factors in Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted from February 2007 to July 2008 in Minas Gerais included {{a random sample of}} 725 male and female children aged less than 60 months. A household survey was administered to the children's parents or guardians to collect socioeconomic, demographic, food security, and the child's anthropometric data. The hemoglobin level was determined by a portable <b>hemoglobinometer.</b> Anemia was considered present when hemoglobin levels were below 11. 0 g/dL. Statistical analyses estimated the prevalence of anemia and its association with socioeconomic, demographic, and food security-related variables. The model was adjusted by multivariate logistic regression. The significance level was set at 5 % (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia was 37. 4 %. The greatest prevalence occurred in the age group 6 to 24 months (43. 0 %).

40|$|Introduction: Iron {{deficiency}} {{is estimated}} to affect one-half of the school going children in developing countries and school years are opportune time to intervene. Rationale: No coherent, co-ordinate and effective health services {{are available in the}} country for below 16 years. So attempt was made to know real scenario of iron deficiency. Objectives: To assess the effect of whey guava beverage supplementation on the haemoglobin level of school going children. Methodology:  An experimental research design was taken to conduct the study in which 200 children of 6 ≥and 7 ≥ years in low socio economic status of both the genders were taken. For hemoglobin testing Sahil’s <b>hemoglobinometer</b> was used. Each child in experimental group was given 200 ml of whey guava beverage for 90 days except holidays. Results and Discussion: The initial mean Hb levels of 6 ≥and 7 ≥ year’s old boys and girls of control groups and experimental groups were ranging from 9. 50 to 10. 24 which were 79. 17 % to 85. 33 %. The results revealed that almost all the respondents were anaemic. After 90 days of feeding supplement the final mean Hb levels of 6 ≥ 7 years old boys and girls of control group  ranged from 10. 10 to 10. 65 which was 84. 17 % to 88. 75 %. Whereas in experimental group it ranged from 11. 06 to 11. 42 which were 91. 92 % to 95. 17 %. The study clearly evidences that the respondents in experimental group had improved with more Hb levels when compared to control group. Also children who were suffering from anaemia in experimental group became normal. Conclusion: Distribution of whey guava beverage through school feeding program may prove as an outstanding strategy to combat iron deficiency in school children. </p...|$|E

We explored the overlap of STH infection and podoconiosis in Southern Ethiopia and quantified their separate and combined effects on prevalent anemia and hemoglobin levels in podoconiosis patients and health controls from the same area. A two-part comparative cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} Wolaita zone, southern Ethiopia. Data were collected from adult patients presenting with clinically confirmed podoconiosis, and unmatched adult neighborhood controls living in the same administrative area. Information on demographic and selected lifestyle factors was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Stool samples were collected and examined qualitatively using the modified formalin-ether sedimentation method. Hemoglobin level was determined using two different methods: <b>hemoglobinometer</b> and automated hematology analyzer. A total of 913 study subjects (677 podoconiosis patients and 236 controls) participated. The prevalence of any STH infection was 47. 6 % among patients and 33. 1 % among controls (p< 0. 001). The prevalence of both hookworm and Trichuris trichiura infections was significantly higher in podoconiosis patients than in controls (AOR 1. 74, 95 % CI 1. 25 to 2. 42, AOR 6. 53, 95 % CI 2. 34 to 18. 22, respectively). Not wearing shoes and being a farmer remained significant independent predictors of infection with any STH. There was a significant interaction between STH infection and podoconiosis on reduction of hemoglobin level (interaction p value =  0. 002). Prevalence of any STH and hookworm infection was higher among podoconiosis patients than among controls. A significant reduction in hemoglobin level was observed among podoconiosis patients co-infected with hookworm and 'non-hookworm STH'. Promotion of consistent shoe-wearing practices may have double advantages in controlling both podoconiosis and hookworm infection in the study area...|$|E

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study aimed {{to identify the}} social and biological determinants of anemia in children enrolled in the Brazilian Income Transfer Program (PBF). The study evaluated 446 children (69. 1 % of the total enrolled) ranging from 6 to 84 months of age, of whom 262 were receiving the income transfer (60. 2 % of the beneficiaries) and 184 were not (87. 6 % of the non-beneficiaries). Testing for anemia was performed with the Hemocue portable <b>hemoglobinometer,</b> and the cutoff points were set at 11. 0 and 11. 5 g/dL, according to age bracket. The {{data were analyzed using}} Poisson hierarchical regression with robust variance for multivariate analysis. There was no difference in the anemia prevalence rates between the beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups. Risk factors for anemia were low paternal schooling, cesarean birth, consumption of untreated water, stunting, and age less than 24 months. Prevalence of anemia in the group of non-beneficiary children under two years of age was significantly higher than in the beneficiary group in the same age bracket, suggesting the importance of the PBF income transfer for preventing anemia in children.

40|$|First {{published}} online June 14, 2017 Background: Anemia affects 45 % {{of women}} of childbearing age in Cambodia. Iron supplementation is recommended in populations in which anemia prevalence is high. However, there are issues of cost, distribution, and adherence. A potential alternative is a reusable fish-shaped iron ingot, which, when added to the cooking pot, leaches iron into the fluid in which it is prepared. Objective: We sought to determine whether there was a difference in hemoglobin concentrations in rural Cambodian anemic women (aged 18 - 49 y) who cooked with the iron ingot or consumed a daily iron supplement compared with a control after 1 y. Design: In Preah Vihear, 340 women with mild or moderate anemia were randomly assigned to 1) an iron-ingot group, 2) an iron-supplement (18 mg/d) group, or 3) a nonplacebo control group. A venous blood sample was taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo. Blood was analyzed for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was used to detect structural hemoglobin variants. Results: Anemia prevalence was 44 % {{with the use of a}} portable <b>hemoglobinometer</b> during screening. At baseline, prevalence of iron deficiency was 9 % on the basis of a low serum ferritin concentration. There was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin concentrations between the iron-ingot group (115 g/L; 95 % CI: 113, 118 g/L; P = 0. 850) or iron-supplement group (115 g/L; 95 % CI: 113, 117 g/L; P = 0. 998) compared with the control group (115 g/L; 95 % CI: 113, 117 g/L) at 12 mo. Serum ferritin was significantly higher in the iron-supplement group (73 μg/L; 95 % CI: 64, 82 μg/L; P = 0. 002) than in the control group at 6 mo; however, this significance was not maintained at 12 mo (73 μg/L; 95 % CI: 58, 91 μg/L; P = 0. 176). Conclusions: Neither the iron ingot nor iron supplements increased hemoglobin concentrations in this population at 6 or 12 mo. We do not recommend the use of the fish-shaped iron ingot in Cambodia or in countries where the prevalence of iron deficiency is low and genetic hemoglobin disorders are high.

METHOD: This cross-sectional study included 2 715 infants between 6 and 12 months old in 12 cities, in all five of the geographic regions of Brazil. Information regarding the child and its feeding habits {{was obtained from the}} mother or other caregiver, using a questionnaire. Nutritional status was determined based on height and weight measurements. The hemoglobin concentration was measured using the HemoCue portable <b>hemoglobinometer.</b> Anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 11 g/dL. The infants’ eating habits were assessed based on what they were eating {{around the time of the}} questionnaire interviews. The association between anemia and the different variables was evaluated through bivariate analysis, followed by multiple logistic regression using a hierarchical selection model. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia for the entire group was 65. 4 %. Multiple regression analysis identified the following risk factors for anemia: living in the Southeastern Region of Brazil (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 57, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 1. 25 - 1. 99), maternal age < 20 years (OR = 1. 58, 95 % CI = 1. 21 - 2. 07), birthweight < 2 500 g (OR = 2. 09, 95 % CI = 1. 48 - 2. 95), not being breast-fed (OR = 1. 28, 95 % CI = 1. 02 - 1. 61), receiving both breast milk and other foods (OR = 1. 40, 95 % CI = 1. 10 - 1. 78), and male gender (OR = 1. 24, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 1. 46).

40|$|A weekly {{medication}} scheme, {{followed by}} nutritional guidance on diets in child-care centers, was evaluated {{in order to}} make it feasible for routine use. The study was conducted in six child-care centers in the town of Cuiabá - Brazil. The supplement (6 mg/kg) was provided on a weekly basis to all children (n= 178) less than three years old during four months at the institution by the classroom staff. After this initial phase, nutritional guidance was provided regarding the child-care center's normal diet as a way to control hemoglobin levels. This is an intervention study whose individuals were examined at three different periods: at the beginning of treatment (T 0); after four months of iron supplementation (T 1) and after five months of nutritional guidance (T 2). Hemoglobin measurements were obtained using a portable <b>hemoglobinometer</b> - HemoCue. A significant improvement was observed in the hemoglobin levels of anemic children after controlling for age and initial hemoglobin. The hemoglobin concentration of these children improved an average of 0. 1 g/l after each dose of iron sulfate. At the end of four months there was an average gain of 1. 6 g/l, and prevalence of anemia reduced by 1 / 3, sufficient to meet the United Nations target adopted by Brazil. At the end of nine months (four months of weekly drug intervention followed by 5 months of nutritional guidance) the prevalence of anemia dropped by 1 / 4 in the child-care centers. The intervention proved to be feasible for child-care centers and pre-school population. Um esquema terapêutico semanal, seguido de orientação alimentar aos cardápios, foi avaliado com o intuito de verificar viabilidade como rotina em creches. O estudo foi realizado em seis creches no município de Cuiabá. O suplemento (6 mg/kg) foi oferecido semanalmente a todas as crianças (n= 178) menores de 3 anos durante 4 meses, na própria Instituição, pelas funcionárias. Após essa primeira etapa seguiram-se orientações alimentares ao cardápio da creche, como forma de controle desses níveis de hemoglobina. Este é um estudo de intervenção, onde os indivíduos foram avaliados em três momentos: no início do tratamento (T 0), após a primeira etapa (T 1) e após a segunda etapa (T 2).

Para caracterizar a população estudada foram obtidas informações junto às fichas cadastrais nas creches sobre variáveis relativas à criança: data de nascimento e sexo. Para mensuração da dosagem de hemoglobina sangüínea, foram coletadas amostras de sangue na ponta do dedo médio, para leitura em hemoglobinômetro portátil (Hemocue). A prevalência da anemia nas creches estudadas foi de 42, 9 %, ou seja 67 das 156 crianças em que se determinou a concentração de hemoglobina com valores inferiores a 11 g/dl. A prevalência para o sexo feminino foi de 42, 3 %, ou seja, entre as 71 meninas, 30 delas apresentaram concentração de hemoglobina com valores inferiores a 11 g/dl e, para o sexo masculino igual a 43, 5 %, ou seja, entre os 85 meninos, 37 deles apresentaram concentração de hemoglobina com valores inferiores a 11 g/dl. Dentre as 67 crianças com anemia, 25 (37, 3 %) crianças apresentaram anemia grave, sendo que no grupo das 30 meninas com anemia, 10 (33, 3 %) apresentaram anemia grave e, no grupo dos 37 meninos com anemia, 15 (40, 5 %) apresentaram anemia grave. Ainda nas 67 crianças com anemia 45 (67, 2 %) apresentavam idade inferior a 24 meses, sendo que no grupo das 30 meninas com anemia, 21 (70 %) apresentavam idade inferior a 24 meses e para o grupo das 37 meninos com anemia, 24 (64, 9) apresentavam idade inferior a 24 meses. Dentre as 25 crianças com anemia grave, 17 (68, 0 %) apresentavam idade inferior a 24 meses, sendo que para o grupo de 10 meninas com anemia grave, 9 (90 %) apresentavam idade inferior a 24 meses e, para o grupo de 15 meninos com anemia grave, 8 (53, 3 %) apresentavam idade inferior a 24 meses. Alguns fatores podem ter contribuído para esse resultado. Um deles é o estado nutricional das crianças antes de ingressarem nas escolas infantis, o qual poderia já estar comprometido. Outro importante fator a ser considerado é a baixa inserção sócio-econômica das crianças que freqüentam as creches municipais, a qual impõe condições de vida que as tornam mais vulneráveis à diarréia, às infecções respiratórias e às parasitoses intestinais, podendo comprometer, de forma marcante, o consumo de alimentos por redução do apetite e por diminuição da absorção de nutrientes entre eles o ferro. Espera-se que os resultados forneçam subsídios para um melhor conhecimento e acompanhamento da situação nutricional destas crianças, já que constituem instrumento essencial para a aferição das condições de saúde da população infantil, além de oferecer medidas objetivas das condições de vida da população em geral.

To characterize the studied population information together to the fiches had been gotten register in cadastre in the day-care centers on relative variable the child: date of birth and sex. For measuring of the dosage of sanguine hemoglobin, samples of blood in the tip of the average finger had been collected, for portable reading in <b>hemoglobinometer</b> (Hemocue). The prevalence of the anemia in the studied daycare centers was of 42. 9 %, or either 67 of the 156 children where if determined the concentration of hemoglobin with the lower values 11 g/dl. The prevalence for the feminine sex was of 42. 3 %, or either, between the 71 girls, 30 of them had presented concentration of hemoglobin with lower values 11 g/dl and for equal the masculine sex 43. 5 %, or either, between the 85 boys, 37 of them had presented concentration of hemoglobin with lower values 11 g/dl. Amongst the 67 children with anemia, 25 (37. 3 %) children had presented serious anemia, being that in the group of the 30 girls with anemia, 10 (33. 3 %) had presented serious anemia and in the group of the 37 boys with anemia, 15 (40. 5 %) had presented serious anemia. Still in the 67 children with anemia 45 (67. 2 %) they presented lower age the 24 months, being that in the group of the 30 girls with anemia, 21 (70 %) presented lower age the 24 months and for the group of the 37 boys with anemia, 24 (64. 9 %) presented lower age the 24 months. Amongst the 25 children with serious anemia, 17 (68. 0 %) presented lower age the 24 months, being that for the group of 10 girls with serious anemia, 9 (90 %) presented lower age the 24 months and, for the group of 15 boys with serious anemia, 8 (53. 3 %) presented lower age the 24 months. Some factors can have contributed for this result. One of them is the nutricional state of the children before entering the infantile schools, which could already be engaged. Another important factor to be considered is low the partnereconomic insertion of the children who frequent municipal day-care centers, which imposes life conditions that become them more vulnerable the diarrhea, to the respiratory infections and the intestinais parasatisms, being able to compromise, of marcante form, the food consumption for reduction of the appetite and reduction of the absorption of nutrients between them the iron.
