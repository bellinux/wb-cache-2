[...] This gave rise to [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in South Pacific. To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] for her. [...] When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. [...] Rodgers <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, [...] "That's exactly what I want. [...] Never do it differently. [...] We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound." ...|$|E

60|$|Razumov <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} silent, scrutinizing attention. Her puffy yellow countenance {{was working with}} emotion. She screwed up her eyes at him entreatingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] he said, morosely. He <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her for {{a moment}} with a sombre stare, as one looks at ruins, at the devastation of some natural disaster.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{looked up}} with a start to find the soft, {{beautiful}} eyes of Lightfoot the Deer <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him {{over the top of}} a little hemlock tree.|$|R

60|$|His scorn and {{repudiation}} of her gave Carley intense relief. She {{sat up and}} endeavored to collect her shattered nerves. Ruff <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her with great disapproval and even disappointment.|$|E
60|$|Ricardo paused, {{sinister}} in {{the stillness}} of his pose. Suddenly he got up with a swift movement and <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his chief in moody abstraction. Mr. Jones did not stir.|$|E
60|$|Nigel {{sat down}} with a {{tendency}} to laugh, for at that moment he chanced to glance at the rafters above, where he saw a small anxious-faced monkey <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the sound}} of Agatha's voice and the rustle of her dress which {{restored}} me. I looked up, and saw her blue eyes, so full of tenderness and pity, <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful," [...] he answered, {{rising to}} his feet and {{standing}} with his elbow upon the mantelpiece, <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her. [...] "But then you are wonderful, aren't you, Maggie? You know I always thought so." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{next was}} the long interval. Jim and Josephine <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the orchestra. The musicians were laying aside their {{instruments}} and rising. The ugly fire-curtain began slowly to descend. Jim suddenly bolted out.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was easier}} done than I anticipated," [...] muttered Martin, grimly, as he <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his young prisoner. [...] "Now {{what is best}} to do? It's good I remembered these rooms were empty." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked up}} the black trunk through the network of slender branches, and saw the bear snuggling in a fork. His sharp ears stood up against the sky. He was most anxiously <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> us.|$|R
60|$|Kaplan hurried over. Reinhart {{handed him}} the envelope, and moved over to the window, <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the scene below. Men and cars scurried frantically everywhere. Officials coming and going like ants, hurrying in all directions.|$|R
60|$|Tasso {{drank the}} rest. Time passed. The clouds of ash {{moved across the}} dark sky above them. Hendricks rested, his mind blank. After awhile he became aware that Tasso was {{standing}} over him, <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{began to}} howl. Burton looked around once {{more at the}} scene of his desolation. He moved to the {{fireplace}} and <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the charred remnants of his novel. The boy continued to howl.|$|E
6000|$|... "This won't do. We've got {{to carry}} them over to your shack, Corliss." [...] As he spoke, Jacob Welse clambered nimbly up the cabin and <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the big barrier. [...] "Where's McPherson?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|Tying to {{the bank}} above, where lay a score of other anxious boats, Kit and his companions went ahead on foot to investigate. They crept to the brink and <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the swirl of water. Sprague drew back, shuddering.|$|E
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} Mr. Pike {{proceeded}} to interrogate the watches. He {{stood at the}} break of the poop, in the high place, leaning on the rail and <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the crew assembled on the main deck beneath him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is true,' the Herr Over-Superintendent observed, in a musing voice, <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me with relenting eyes. 'The {{masculine}} habitually {{embraces the}} feminine.' And {{he brought his}} massive intellect to bear upon the problem once more with prodigious concentration.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, {{the hot sun}} so incommoded the {{unsheltered}} traveller, that {{he shouted}} forth another impatient summons. Happening, at the same moment, to look upward, he saw a figure leaning from an embrasure of the battlements, and <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|These {{and other}} remarks were made, {{as the boys}} on the highway <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the craft that was {{speeding}} along in such an erratic fashion {{over the surface of}} the river. A closer look confirmed their first opinion, that nobody was on board.|$|E
60|$|He <b>gazed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her sunken grave; {{a little}} wind, that came {{stealing}} {{along the floor}} of the grove, raised and swayed the long, hair-like grass on it, giving the curious suggestion of something prisoned under it trying to draw a long breath and float upward.|$|E
60|$|There was {{an awkward}} silence for a moment, while all eyes turned curiously upon Louise, who served {{this side of the}} triangle.

60|$|Carmichael lunged himself erect {{and stood}} <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her. He seemed {{completely}} detached now from that frank, amiable cowboy {{of her first}} impressions. The redness was totally gone from his face. Something strange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes.|$|R
60|$|They were in {{the front}} row of the gallery, and {{presently}} she leaned over to <b>gaze</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the panorama below, the women in the boxes and stalls, whose bare shoulders and skillfully coiffured hair flashed with jewels. Suddenly her hand fell upon Aynesworth's arm.|$|R
60|$|For {{a little}} while I stood <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my work, my mind full of the {{unsolvable}} mysteries of life and death; then I bethought me that time stood not still for me, and that something yet remained to be accomplished ere my evening's task were done.|$|R
