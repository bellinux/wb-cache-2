5|$|Flight Unlimited II is a 1997 flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. The player controls one of five planes in the airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the aerobatics focus of its predecessor, Flight Unlimited, in favor of general civilian aviation.

He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material.

5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Today {{physicists}} {{continue to}} look for applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> into problems in general relativity.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D.

When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E

5|$|By late on December4, the NHC was {{no longer}} anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm {{and there was no}} interaction. At 0600UTC on December5, the hurricane's {{appearance}} generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system used to estimate intensity from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's duration, and suggested winds of 85mph (140km/h), which was its peak intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage of a cold front. Despite the cold water temperatures and unfavorable strong upper-level winds, Epsilon maintained its intensity, and the Geophysical <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Laboratory (GFDL) model predicted it would remain a hurricane for nearly three days.|$|E
5|$|In <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics,</b> Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within a deep easterly steering current provided by a ridge to its north. Expected to track across sea surface temperatures greater than 82°F (28°C), the cyclone was forecast to gradually strengthen and within four days attain hurricane status; the Geophysical <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Laboratory predicted the depression to reach Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale within three days. Increased northeasterly wind shear shifted the center to the northeastern edge of the deep convection, and despite the shear and its relatively low latitude of 9.7°N, the depression strengthened to attain tropical storm status early on September 3; upon reaching the intensity, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Storm Ivan.|$|E
30|$|Systems of differential–algebraic {{equations}} (DAEs) {{are often}} used to model many important problems in real applications. These equations arise, for instance, in electrical networks, optimal control, mechanical systems, incompressible <b>fluids</b> <b>dynamics</b> and chemical process simulations. DAEs are characterized by the so called index, which has several definitions (Günther and Wagner 2001; Kunkel and Mehrmann 1996; Martinson and Barton 2000). The most used index is the differentiation index, which is the minimum number of times that all or {{a part of the}} DAE must be differentiated with respect to time, in order to obtain an ordinary differential equation (Martinson and Barton 2000). In real applications, higher-index DAEs (differentiation index greater than one) arise naturally in many important application problems like constrained multibody systems (Benhammouda and Vazquez-Leal 2015; Simeon 1996; Simeon et al. 1994), vehicle system dynamics (Simeon et al. 1991), space shuttle simulation (Brenan 1983) and incompressible <b>fluids</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Unfortunately, higher-index DAEs are known to be difficult to solve. Therefore, they are usually transformed to ordinary differential systems (index-zero) or index-one DAEs before solving them. This transformation, called index-reduction, can be computationally very expensive and may also change the properties of the solution. Therefore, new techniques are required to solve higher-index DAEs efficiently.|$|R
