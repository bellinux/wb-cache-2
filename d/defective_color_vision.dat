40|$|The human red {{and green}} photopigments are {{specified}} by genes on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq 28). In individuals with normal color vision, the locus was proposed to consist of a single red pigment gene upstream {{of one or more}} copies of green pigment genes. The presence of a single red pigment gene in the array was confirmed by demonstration of only one retinal mRNA transcript coding for the red opsin. In individuals with multiple green pigment genes, it is unknown whether all genes are expressed. We analyzed the sequence of red- and green-specific mRNA from retinas of individuals with multiple green pigment genes in comparison with the corresponding genomic DNA sequences. The data showed that only a single green pigment gene is expressed. We therefore suggest that a locus control-like element, already known to be located 3. 8 kilobases upstream of the transcription initiation site of the red pigment gene, allows transcription of only a single copy of the green pigment genes, probably the most proximal copy. This finding provides an explanation for the not-infrequent presence of 5 ' green-red hybrid genes in individuals with normal color vision. Such hybrid genes are usually associated with <b>defective</b> <b>color</b> <b>vision.</b> We suggest that 5 ' green-red hybrid genes produce <b>defective</b> <b>color</b> <b>vision</b> only when their position in the gene array allows expression in the retinal cone cells. status: publishe...|$|E

In this study, we wanted to clinically characterize and investigate the molecular etiology of an atypical form of autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy in two consanguineous Spanish families. Affected members of the respective families exhibited an array of clinical features including reduced visual acuity, photophobia, <b>defective</b> <b>color</b> <b>vision,</b> reduced or absent ERG responses, macular atrophy and pigmentary deposits in the peripheral retina. Genetic investigation included autozygosity mapping coupled with exome sequencing in the first family, whereas autozygome-guided candidate gene screening was performed by means of Sanger DNA sequencing in the second family.

40|$|AbstractThe {{contributions}} of genetics research {{to the science}} of normal and <b>defective</b> <b>color</b> <b>vision</b> over the previous few decades are reviewed emphasizing the developments in the 25 years since the last anniversary issue of Vision Research. Understanding of the biology underlying color vision has been vaulted forward {{through the application of}} the tools of molecular genetics. For all their complexity, the biological processes responsible for color vision are more accessible than for many other neural systems. This is partly because of the wealth of genetic variations that affect color perception, both within and across species, and because components of the color vision system lend themselves to genetic manipulation. Mutations and rearrangements in the genes encoding the long, middle, and short wavelength sensitive cone pigments are responsible for color vision deficiencies and mutations have been identified that affect the number of cone types, the absorption spectra of the pigments, the functionality and viability of the cones, and the topography of the cone mosaic. The addition of an opsin gene, as occurred in the evolution of primate color vision, and has been done in experimental animals can produce expanded color vision capacities and this has provided insight into the underlying neural circuitry...|$|E

The {{color change}} reached in two {{commercial}} disinfecting solutions for soft contact lenses using new color indicators has been analyzed, {{and its relationship}} with the temporal evolution of the hydrogen peroxide concentration, responsible for the disinfection process, has been examined. The results are compared with another commercial solution using a different color indicator. Methods. Color measurements of the disinfecting solutions were performed at 2 -minute intervals for over 2 hours using a Photo-Research PR- 704 spectroradiometer with horizontal optical axis. Samples were placed at the floor of a VeriVide CAC 120 light booth with a Munsell gray mask behind them.

40|$|Hereditary retinal {{degeneration}} (HRD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases that cause visual loss due to progressive loss of rod and/or cone photo-receptor {{cells in the}} retina. In cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), cone involvement initially exceeds that of rods, and therefore the predominant symptoms are reduced visual acuity, photo-phobia, <b>defective</b> <b>color</b> <b>vision,</b> and decreased sensitivity in the central visual field, later followed by progressive loss in peripheral vision and night blindness. Additional ophthal-mologic findings include pigment deposits visible on fundus examination, predominantly localized to the macular region. The prevalence of CRD is approximately 1 / 40, 000 [1, 2]. CRD is a heterogeneous disorder. In most patients, the disease {{is limited to the}} eye (nonsyndromic), with no extraocular manifestations. Nonsyndromic CRD can be inherited as autosomal recessive (ar), autosomal dominant (ad), or X-linked (XL). More than 20 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic CRD, of which at least six are associated with an autosomal recessive mode of inheri-tance (Retnet- Retinal Information Network, RetNet). One is CDHR 1. CDHR 1 (previously known as PCDH 21) encodes for cadherin-related family member 1. Members of the cadherin family of transmembrane proteins are often involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. Cadherins are character-ized by the presence of 1 â€“ 34 extracellular cadherin (EC) domains (composed of about 110 amino acids), which contain highly conserved Ca 2 +-binding motifs. Variations in the cytoplasmic domains impart functional specificity by confer-ring to each molecule the ability to interact with different ligands (reviewed in [3]).

40|$|Research {{into the}} nature of {{subliminal}} stimulation has indicated its influence upon perception, memory, drive level, thinking, and perhaps consumer buying behavior. Studies assessing the connotations of color have generally found red to be an exciting, affect-arousing hue. The present study assessed the impact of subliminal pictorial modifications (happy or angry), chromatic background (red or white), and their interactions upon impressions of a neutral human face. A complete factorial design allowed the investigation of every combination of these variables. It was hypothesized that the subliminal facial modifications would influence conscious perception of the neutral supraliminal face in the desired direction, and that color (red) would enhance the impact of the subliminal modifications. A series of researchers have found subliminal suggestion (pictorial, semantic, or figural) to affect conscious perceptual impression. The color red has been associated with both verbal reports and physiological indices of heightened emotion. Few studies, however, have systematically explored the influence of subliminal stimulation in interaction with color. One study demonstrated that a subliminal aggressive stimulus, projected upon a red background, diminished analytic performance; another study found subliminal sexual stimuli, when presented upon a red background, to be associated with an exaggerated affective response. In order to investigate subliminal stimulation, color, and their interaction, 52 volunteer college students were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six treatment conditions, providing 8, 9, or 10 subjects per group. All subjects were screened for <b>defective</b> <b>color</b> <b>vision.</b> The luminance of the red and white stimuli were equated through heterochromatic flicker photometry. The stimulus presentations utilized a computer-programmed multiple slide projector format. Subjects viewed a supraliminal neutral face with or without subliminal/chromatic modifications and rated their impressions on a simplified, 13 -item, bipolar-adjective scale, representing the dimension of pleasantness/unpleasantness. All groups received the same basic experimental procedure: color vision screening, random assignment to seating, ascending method of limits to calibrate 2 Ì† 2 subliminal 2 Ì† 2 levels of illumination, 2 Ì† 2 priming 2 Ì† 2 of relaxed cognitive set, stimulus presentation, rating of impressions, discrimination task, disclosure of subliminal stimulus, and discussion. The data regarding the pleasantness/unpleasantness of impression of the human face were subjected to a 3 x 2 Analysis of Variance-Fixed Effects Model. The null hypothesis was not rejected in regard to group differences due to the main effects (subliminal modification and chromatic background) or their interactions. The subliminal modifications were at a level of illumination which was below the level of awareness, in all four subliminal groups. The internal consistency of the items on the dependent measure (Impressions Sheet) yielded an Alpha Reliability Coefficient of. 95. Thus, neither the chromatic background, nor subliminal pictorial modification significantly altered impressions of a clearly visible, but briefly exposed, neutral face in this study. The results were explained in relation to factors which may attenuate the impact of the subtle and complex subliminal phenomenon...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the frequency of <b>color</b> <b>vision</b> defect in students of Mashhad Dental School and evaluation of related factors. Materials & Methods: In this descriptive analytical study, 356 students of Mashhad Dental School were evaluated. Demographic data including age, gender, <b>color</b> <b>vision</b> defect in relatives, use of glasses and contact lenses, refractive errors (myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism) were documented in the designed questionnaire. To determine the impaired <b>color</b> <b>vision,</b> Ishihara diagnostic test was used.
