40|$|Background and Goal of Study: Atropine is a {{competitive}} antagonist of cholinergic receptors and {{is widely used}} to blunt the increased vagal tone that is often caused by surgical manipulations. It increases heart rate(HR)  with minimal effects on mean arterial pressure(MAP) and cardiac output(CO).  Norepinephrine(NOR) is a catecholamine used to increase MAP and CO in several medical conditions. Its effect {{is based on the}} positive inotropic and chronotropic effects via cardiac β 1  receptors and at higher doses on vasoconstriction via vascular α receptors.  There are currently no studies revealing the pharmacological interaction of these drugs in patients under total intravenous anesthesia. We therefore studied the effects of atropine on HR, MAP and CO of atropine in combination with (NOR+) or without low-dose NOR (NOR-). Materials and Methods: After local <b>EC</b> <b>approval</b> and written informed consent,  23 patients scheduled for ophthalmic surgery under general anaesthesia were included. If the MAP decreased < 80 % of baseline value, NOR 0. 05 µg/ kg/min was started. If the HR was < 60 bpm when vagal stimulation was imminent, atropine 0. 5 mg was administered(all patients). HR, MAP and CO were recorded noninvasively(Nexfin, BMEye, Amsterdam). All recordings were synchronised at the moment of atropine administration and analysed in two groups (with or without NOR). Results and Discussion: Changes in HR, MAP and CO were larger in the NOR+ group (14 patients) than in the NOR-group (9 patients). At 300 seconds, the mean(SD) HR increased 32 (18) vs 19 (11) bpm from baseline. The MAP increased 24 (11) vs 5 (8) mmHg. The CO increased 3 (1. 9) versus 0. 7 (0. 8) L/min. All differences were significant (p< 0. 05) Conclusions: The haemodynamic effects of atropine are more prominent in the presence of NOR. This study reveals that atropine exerts more advantageous hemodynamic effects in the presence of low-dose NOR...|$|E
40|$|Background and Goal of Study: Electroencephalogram during {{anaesthesia}} may {{be affected}} by brain tumour. (1) We studied whether patients with a brain tumour have different BIS responses after laryngoscopy (LAR). We compared tumour patients with healthy control patients. Materials and Methods: After <b>EC</b> <b>approval,</b> 40 ASA 1 or 2 patients (control) and 41 intracranial tumour patients(tumour) received standardized anaesthesia while measuring bilateral BIS (BIS VISTAXP 4 with bilateral sensor). (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) Remifentanil was randomized to 3 or 5 ng/ml effect‐site concentration (Minto) and maintained throughout the study. Propofol effect‐site concentration(CePROP) (Schnider) was set at 2 μg/ml and increased with incremental steps of 0. 5 μg/ml until loss of consciousness was observed. After 3 minutes, laryngoscopy was performed and BIS was monitored during one minute. The median BIS of 1 minute before LAR is subtracted from the median BIS one minute after LAR to obtain delta BIS for each hemisphere. We tested if delta BIS is significantly different between hemispheres in control, between healthy and diseased hemispheres in tumour and between ipsilateral control and tumour hemispheres. Statistical significance was set at p< 0. 05. Results and Discussion: No demographic differences were present except for age. (table 1) Delta BIS is not statistically different, neither between hemispheres in control, nor between healthy and diseased hemispheres in tumour groups. (table 2) No {{significant difference was found}} in delta BIS between ipsilateral control and pathological hemispheres. Conclusion(s) : Bilateral BIS does not provide additional information on responsiveness to a standardized stimulus. We could not observe major differences in bilateral BIS response between control and brain tumour patients. Unilateral BIS monitoring seems to be equally informative in healthy and brain tumour patients compared to bilateral monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Background and Goal of Study: The Masimo Radical 7 (V 7. 6. 0. 1, Masimo Corp, Irvine, USA) pulse co-oximeter® uses multi-wave length spectrophotometric analysis (sensor R 2 - 25) to {{calculate}} total hemoglobin concentration (SpHb). SpHb is monitored continuously and non-invasively, which may reveal advantages over invasive, snap-shot hemoglobin concentration (Hbin)  monitoring. We compared SpHb and Hbin during surgery for major hepatic resection. Materials and Methods: After local <b>EC</b> <b>approval,</b> 17 patients undergoing hepatic resection were included. Central venous blood samples were drawn every 30 min and analyzed using ABL 800 Flex (Radiometer GmbH, Copenhagen, Denmark). SpHb and Hbin were correlated and a regression curve was plotted. Prediction error analysis was done. Change in trend direction between consecutive Hbin measures in correspondence {{with a change}} in SpHb trend direction was studied.   Results and Discussion: 306 data points were obtained. Mean duration of surgery was 426 min (± 97 min) and median blood loss was 420 ml (range 50  - 1500 ml). Hbin ranged from 4. 8 to 9. 5 mmol/L and SpHb ranged from 4. 5 to  9. 5 mmol/L. Mean Hbin and SpHb was 7. 5 ± 0. 9 mmol/L and 7. 2 ± 1. 0 mmol/L, respectively. Regression was significant between SpHb and Hbin (p< 0. 01, R² linear= 0. 348, fig. 1). Pearson Correlation= 0. 59. Compared to Hbin, SpHb showed a median prediction error (=bias) of 3. 4 % (SD 1. 0 %) revealing a slight underestimation.  Median absolute prediction error is 9. 4 % (SD 5. 8 %) revealing a moderate bias.  Pulse co-oximetry failed to adequately predict the trend of changes in hemoglobin concentration at a threshold value of 0. 3 mmol/L (good trend= 51. 2 %; false trend= 48. 8 %). Conclusion(s) : SpHb showed a significant relation and moderate correlation with Hbin. SpHb slightly underestimated Hbin with moderate bias. In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, SpHb might become an alternative for Hbin. Further studies have to reveal if SpHb might replace Hbin in its current version...|$|E

40|$|AIMS Regulatory {{requirements}} for new drugs have increased. Special approval procedures with priority assessment are possible for drugs with clear 'unmet medical need'. We question whether these Exceptional Circumstances (<b>EC)</b> or Conditional <b>Approval</b> (CA) procedures {{have led to}} a higher probability of serious safety issues. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed of new drugs approved in Europe between 1999 and 2009. The determinant was EC/CA vs. standard procedure approval. Outcome variables were frequency and timing of a first Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC). An association between approval procedure and the time from market approval to DHPC was assessed using Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis and Cox-regression to correct for covariates. RESULTS In total 289 new drugs were approved. Forty-six (16. 4 %) were approved under EC or CA, of which seven received a DHPC (15 %). This was similar to the standard approval drugs (243), of which 33 received one or more DHPC (14 %, P = 0. 77). The probability of acquiring a DHPC for standard approval drugs vs. EC/CA drugs during 11 -year follow-up is 22 % (95 % CI 14 %, 29 %) and 26 % (95 % CI 8 %, 44 %), respectively (log-rank P = 0. 726). This difference remained not significant in the Cox-regression model: hazard ratio 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 40, 2. 20). Only drug type was identified as a confounding covariate. CONCLUSION The EC/CA procedure is not associated with a higher probability of DHPCs despite limited clinical development data. These data do not support the view that early drug approval increases the risk of serious safety issues emerging after market approval...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{modification}} {{in plant}} {{cells in the}} early 80 ´s allowed Biotechnology to introduce characteristics in plants creating stronger crops (compared to the ones created by conventional breeding) {{to be used in}} different sectors: Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Production and Industry. A new technology was developed to face the upcoming global challenges: climate change, overpopulation, erosion, and a new socio-economic environment. This new technology is subject to international regulations to ensure environmental sustainability of crop production on the basis of which genetically modified organisms have to be assessed for safety before being released in to the environment or on the market. Although there is a wide range of biotechnology legislation applying to the use of GMO’s in order to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, legislation is not uniform. In the European Union, the Precautionary Principle or Precautionary Approach {{is one of the major}} legal arguments originating law conflicts within third states. For example, the alleged general <b>EC</b> moratorium on <b>approvals</b> of biotech products (Dispute DS 291) brought by the United States and other third countries to the WTO triggered strong disagreements between these two major trade partners. As a result, there was not only an adoption of an extensive review over all the EU legislation policies on gmo’s regardless the new EU rules to approve GM products agreed in 2004. The European Union has developed research programs and practices to evaluate risks and benefits to the environment of GMOs; on the basis of the Precautionary approach (Article 191 (2) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) and under its secondary law, specifically on its Environmental Liability Directive (Directive 2004 / 35 EC); as an early conclusion, it is clear that, the interaction between law and policies on the Precautionary Principle will continue to be contentious; the purpose of this research is: 1) To demonstrate how this important legal principle, has been shaping the legal approaches in the WTO and the European Union on regards of biosafety disputes and policies. 2) Determine the status quo of the existing biosafety regulations in the European Union and identify the initiatives and proposals from the EU Institutions and other organisms towards effective and uniform regulations...|$|R
40|$|Background Some {{investigators}} {{have claimed that}} caffeinated energy drinks negatively impact children’s behaviour and academic attainment. The present study therefore investigated associations between energy drink use and school attendance, English and mathematics attainment, and the occurrence of behavioural sanctions (eg, detention). Methods Two cross-sections of data were collected at two timepoints (December, 2012; June, 2013). All children (n= 3071) attending three secondary schools in the South West of England were invited to participate, and no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were imposed. Questionnaires were used to record dietary and lifestyle information, and data relating to demography and school performance were acquired through the School Information Management System. Cross-sectional, cross-lag, and change score analyses were initially conducted with χ 2 tests. Binary logistic regression was then used to control for additional aspects of diet, demography, and lifestyle. The Cardiff University School of Psychology Ethics Committee granted ethics <b>approval</b> (<b>EC.</b> 12. 09. 11. 3187). All {{children and their parents}} gave written informed consent. The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Findings 2030 children responded to the questionnaire at the first timepoint and 2307 at the second. Cross-sectional analyses showed that energy drink consumption was negatively associated with school performance. The effects appeared to be dose dependent. For example, relative to never using the products, each frequency of consumption was associated with below average English attainment at the second timepoint: “once a month” (odds ratio 1 · 6, 95 % CI 1 · 2 – 2 · 1), “once or twice a week” (1 · 9, 1 · 3 – 2 · 6), “most days (3 – 6) ” (2 · 1, 1 · 3 – 3 · 5), “every day” (2 · 3, 1 · 1 – 4 · 9). Cross-lag analyses yielded similar results, though the effects were not significant at the multivariate level. Increasing frequency of energy drink usage between the two timepoints was predictive of not increasing in English and mathematics attainment, and with increasing in number of behavioural sanctions incurred. This last effect remained significant after covariates were controlled for (odds ratio 1 · 9, 95 % CI 1 · 3 – 2 · 7, p= 0 · 0003). Interpretation Energy drink consumption was consistently associated with low school performance. Although only some effects remained significant at the multivariate level, the results as a whole suggest that energy drinks might be a cause for concern. Intervention studies are now required to better determine the nature of the associations observed. The Waterloo Foundation (grant number 503692...|$|R
