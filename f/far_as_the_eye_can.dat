25|$|As part of {{the peace}} between England and France, Pope Sixtus IV issued in 1483 a Papal bull {{granting}} the Privilege of Neutrality, by which the Islands, their harbours and seas, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see, were considered neutral territory. Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E
500|$|Chay Wa's grave is in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery's Buddhist sector, grave number 3222, Block 8. It is {{difficult}} to locate, as it stands {{in a sea of}} tombstones that stretch almost as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see. In 1985, it was reported that the inscription of the tombstone had been whited out with plaster by members of Tan's own family who wished to obscure any glorification of Chay Wa's [...] "martyrdom" [...] in the communist cause. At that time, all that could be seen clearly was a photograph of Chay Wa and some lettering showing his name and the years of his birth and death.|$|E

2500|$|A {{visitor to}} the {{township}} in about May 1881 remarked that Maude was [...] "chiefly remarkable for its pigs", adding that [...] "one sees them scattered {{up and down the}} prospect as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> reach, and in any variety". The writer made these additional observations: [...] "Maude (from what fair creature the place has taken its name, I can’t say) boasts a store, a pub., post office, a police barracks, a punt over the river, and a talking cockatoo".|$|E
2500|$|Cuppy's best-known work, a satire {{on history}} called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was {{unfinished}} when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see, is [...] "covered by Egyptologists", to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, {{in the chapter}} on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace. The book's appeal can be gauged {{by the fact that}} CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from it on the air [...] "until the announcer cracked up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bilston-born Samuel Griffiths, in his 1876 Griffiths Guide to the Iron Trade of Great Britain , stated [...] "The Black Country commences at Wolverhampton, extends a {{distance}} of sixteen miles to Stourbridge, eight miles to West Bromwich, penetrating the northern districts through Willenhall to Bentley, The Birchills, Walsall and Darlaston, Wednesbury, Smethwick and Dudley Port, West Bromwich and Hill Top, Brockmoor, Wordsley and Stourbridge. As the atmosphere becomes purer, {{we get to the}} higher ground of Brierley Hill, nevertheless here also, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> reach, on all sides, tall chimneys vomit forth great clouds of smoke". He also stated that [...] "Wolverhampton is considered to be The Capital of the Black Country", as well as [...] "The Capital of the Iron Trade in the Black Country".|$|E

The 4th hole is also called the Devil's Dip, as the fairway from the tee-box to the green is a solid dip, which runs on as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see. The 6th hole is named Tiger Hole because Tigers used to be sighted near it. The 12th hole is called the Cardiac Hole, due to the strenuousness of the walk. A [...] "hard hitters" [...] course, the 13th Twister green is not visible from the tee box. The 15th hole (New Long'un) which has the longest yardage of , needs two long shots to sight the green.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} Durga Puja the {{immersion}} {{ceremony in}} the Ichamati offers a unique spectacle along the India-Bangladesh river border. The Ichhamati river, which acts as a natural border between the two countries, becomes the scene of tremendous revelry on this day, when boats crammed with people from both countries converge here to immerse their respective idols. Boats of {{all shapes and sizes}} can be seen on the river, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see — each one flying the flag of its respective country. It is the only day during the year when border patrolling is relaxed and people can cross {{over to the other side}} of the river. [...] While earlier, after immersing their idols, people could even disembark from their boats on the other side, restrictions imposed by border officials in the last few years has put an end to this practice.|$|E

It is described as being full of pyramids, bridges, palaces and towers with a great river having once run through it that has since turned to dust. [...] Jadis describes viewing the city while it was full of life, quoting, [...] "It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, the creaking of wheels, the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red." ...|$|E

60|$|As we have said, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{could see}} in any direction, the {{frowning}} cliffs rose perpendicularly out of deep water. There {{was not even a}} strip of sand or a bay into which they could run in case of the wind increasing.|$|R

60|$|A fine pathway {{skirted the}} edge of the bank; and often we paused to admire the scenery. The evening was still and fair, even for so heavenly a climate; and all round, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> could reach, was the {{blending}} blue sky and ocean.|$|R
60|$|To my left <b>the</b> sea {{extended}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> could reach, {{before me}} only a vague, dim line indicated its further shore, while at my right a mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me.|$|R

60|$|A fifteen minutes' walk {{brought me}} to the camp, where tents for some twenty-five {{thousand}} whiten the plain <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> reach.
