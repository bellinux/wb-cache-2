5|$|Boston was {{an early}} port of the Atlantic {{triangular}} slave trade in the New England colonies, but was soon overtaken by Salem, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. Boston eventually became a center of the abolitionist movement. The city reacted strongly to the <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Act of 1850, contributing to President Franklin Pierce's attempt to make an example of Boston after the Anthony Burns <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Case.|$|E

50|$|The Israelis {{forced the}} {{hundreds}} of policemen and <b>fugitives</b> who surrendered to strip naked, fearing that some were armed or packed with explosives. They were then given jumpsuits, loaded onto buses and taken to Ofer Prison. Shin Bet asked Jibril Rajoub, head of the Preventive Security Force, to point out which men were police officers and which were <b>fugitives.</b> Rajoub instead identified his policemen as <b>fugitives</b> and the <b>fugitives</b> as policemen, and the <b>fugitives</b> were all released. Shin Bet retaliated by releasing an official account that branded Rajoub as a traitor for turning over the <b>fugitives</b> in a CIA-brokered deal, costing Rajoub his job.|$|R

They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county.

5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of <b>fugitive</b> slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E

The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute resolution which softened the most objectionable language but retained the call for <b>fugitive</b> slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Before Gardner's election, on May 24, 1854, Anthony Burns {{was arrested}} in Boston as a <b>fugitive</b> under the <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Law of 1850. Edward G. Loring, a Suffolk County probate judge who also served as U.S. {{commissioner}} of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia, outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts. Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills of Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Judge Loring {{to be removed from}} his state office, but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring. A third Bill of Address to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner's Republican successor, Nathaniel Prentice Banks.|$|E

50|$|As 1951 began, {{only three}} of the {{original}} top ten <b>fugitives</b> from the prior year still remained at large. The FBI had also added six additional <b>fugitives</b> to the list during the prior year, and had already caught one of those as well. As a result of the late year captures in 1950, 1951 began with only eight wanted <b>fugitives</b> named on the list.

5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} <b>fugitive</b> slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin's {{plan was}} to unite the slave states around a set of minimum {{concessions}} {{to see if the}} North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment repealing any state law that interfered with enforcement of the <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Act, passage of amendments to the <b>Fugitive</b> Slave Act ensuring that any state that would not return a <b>fugitive</b> slave or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the slave, passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a slave, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation. After the slave state governors refused Magoffin's plan, he endorsed the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.|$|E
