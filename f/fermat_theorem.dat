5000|$|In fact, a {{primitive}} {{element of a}} finite field is usually defined as a generator of the field's multiplicative group. More precisely, by little <b>Fermat</b> <b>theorem,</b> the nonzero elements of [...] (i.e. its multiplicative group) are {{the roots of the}} equation that is the (q−1)-th roots of unity. Therefore, in this context, {{a primitive}} element is a primitive (q−1)-th root of unity, that is a generator of the multiplicative group of the nonzero elements of the field. Clearly, a group primitive element is a field primitive element, but the contrary is false.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, <b>Fermat's</b> <b>theorem</b> (also {{known as}} {{interior}} extremum theorem) {{is a method}} to find local maxima and minima of differentiable functions on open sets by showing that every local extremum of the function is a stationary point (the function derivative is zero at that point). <b>Fermat's</b> <b>theorem</b> is a theorem in real analysis, named after Pierre de Fermat.|$|R
5000|$|As General Foy died in November 1825 and {{he could}} not find any paying {{position}} in France, Dirichlet had to return to Prussia. Fourier and Poisson introduced him to Alexander von Humboldt, who had been called to join the court of King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Humboldt, planning to make Berlin a center of science and research, immediately offered his help to Dirichlet, sending letters in his favour to the Prussian government and to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Humboldt also secured a recommendation letter from Gauss, who upon reading his memoir on Fermat's theorem wrote with an unusual amount of praise that [...] "Dirichlet showed excellent talent". With the support of Humboldt and Gauss, Dirichlet was offered a teaching position at the University of Breslau. However, as he had not passed a doctoral dissertation, he submitted his memoir on the <b>Fermat</b> <b>theorem</b> as a thesis to the University of Bonn. Again his lack of fluency in Latin rendered him unable to hold the required public disputation of his thesis; after much discussion, the University decided to bypass the problem by awarding him an honorary doctorate in February 1827. Also, the Minister of Education granted him a dispensation for the Latin disputation required for the Habilitation. Dirichlet earned the Habilitation and lectured in the 1827/28 year as a Privatdozent at Breslau.|$|E

30|$|The {{gradients}} of ϕ and ϕ^* are inverse to each other. This {{can be seen}} as follows. For any fixed ω ^*∈X, evaluating ϕ^*(ω)=_x∈X{(x, ω)-ϕ(x)} at ω ^*, we obtain ϕ^*(ω^*)=_x∈X{(x, ω^*)-ϕ(x)}. Denoting {{the maximum}} by x^*, we have (x^*, ω ^*)=ϕ(x^*)+ϕ ^*(ω ^*) or equivalently (x^*, ω ^*)=ϕ^**(x^*)+ϕ^*(ω ^*). It then follows that the supremum in ϕ(x^*)=ϕ^**(x^*)=_ω∈X{(ω, x^*)-ϕ^*(ω)} is achieved at ω ^*. Since x^* and ω ^* are respectively the maxima of ϕ^*(ω ^*)=_x∈X{(x, ω^*)-ϕ(x)} and ϕ (x^*)=_ω∈X{(ω, x^*)-ϕ^*(ω)}, by the <b>Fermat</b> <b>theorem</b> we have ω *=∇ϕ(x^*) and x^*=∇ϕ^*(ω ^*). Therefore, ω ^*=∇ϕ(∇ϕ^*(ω ^*)). By the arbitrariness of ω ^* it follows that (∇ϕ)^- 1 =∇ϕ^* and (∇ϕ^*)^- 1 =∇ϕ.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{stability}} of dark matter is ensured by a discrete subgroup of the U(1) B-L gauge symmetry, Z_ 2 (B-L). We introduce a set of chiral fermions charged under the U(1) B-L {{in addition to the}} right-handed neutrinos, and require the anomaly-cancellation conditions associated with the U(1) B-L gauge symmetry. We find that the possible number of fermions and their charges are tightly constrained, and that non-trivial solutions appear when at least five additional chiral fermions are introduced. The <b>Fermat</b> <b>theorem</b> in the number theory {{plays an important role in}} this argument. Focusing on one of the solutions, we show that there is indeed a good candidate for dark matter, whose stability is guaranteed by Z_ 2 (B-L).
