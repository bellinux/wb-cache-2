60|$|In {{his first}} astounded sight of her, in her limp nankeen sunbonnet, thrown {{back from her}} head by the impetus of her flight, he saw only too much hair, two much white teeth, too much <b>eye-flash,</b> and, above all,--as it {{appeared}} to him,--too much confidence {{in the power of}} these qualities. Even as she ran, {{it seemed to him that}} she was pulling down ostentatiously the rolled-up sleeves of her pink calico gown over her shapely arms. I am inclined to think that the young gentleman's temper was at fault, and his conclusion hasty; a calmer observer would have detected nothing of this in her frankly cheerful voice. Nevertheless, her evident pleasure in the meeting seemed to him only obtrusive coquetry.|$|E
50|$|Abralia veranyi is {{a species}} of squid in the family Enoploteuthidae. Common names include the <b>eye-flash</b> squid, Verany's enope squid and the {{midwater}} squid. It {{is found in the}} Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It undergoes a daily vertical migration from deep waters to near the surface.|$|E
50|$|Counterillumination is {{camouflage}} {{using the}} production of light to blend in against a lit background. In the sea, light comes down from the surface, so when marine animals are seen from below, they appear darker than the background. Some species of cephalopod, such as the <b>eye-flash</b> squid and the firefly squid, produce light in photophores on their undersides to match the background. Bioluminescence is common among marine animals, so counterillumination may be widespread, though light has other functions, including attracting prey and signalling.|$|E
5000|$|... "Darna and Ding" [...] was {{the last}} time Vilma played Darna. For the first time, Ding was {{mentioned}} in the title. The film begins with a pre-credit sequence recounting Darna's origin. Apparently the notion of Darna's alter-ego having a bum leg, introduced in [...] "Darna vs. the Planet Women", has since been abandoned. In this film, Darna was joined by Ding who now has his own superpowers. Niño also played Darna in this film. Also, Lito Anzurez stole the magic stone and transformed into Darna. Dr. Irene Vontesberg played by Marissa Delgado in an <b>eye-flashing</b> performance addressing a past injustice by raising the recently dead and setting them upon the villagers. This provides for a lot of creepy moments. Veronica Jones played Babaeng Lawin. As is typical of the series, [...] "Darna and Ding" [...] shows Narda's tiny rural village to be the locus of every imaginable kind of extraterrestrial, criminal and paranormal activity—and shambling, green slime slobbering ghouls. Vilma displayed her faux kung fu skills, but then it takes a darker turn, with one of the cons gunning down an innocent bystander. Much as with Dr. Vontesberg, {{there seems to be a}} tragic dimension to Lei Ming, as she follows many of her acts of evil with extended crying jags. Darna and Ding's final episode sees the pair following a trail of missing children to the doorstep of Lei Ming, an evil Chinese sorceress played—in a yet another <b>eye-flashing</b> performance by Celia.|$|R
