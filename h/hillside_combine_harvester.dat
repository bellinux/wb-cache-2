40|$|Labour scarcity, {{harvesting}} loss, timely harvesting {{and harvesting}} cost are crucial in rice and wheat harvesting in Bangladesh. <b>Combine</b> <b>harvester</b> is a newly introduced harvesting machine in Bangladesh. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} technical and economic performance of <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> available in farmers ‟ field and farmer‟s perception {{regarding the use of}} combine. Field tests of two new (CLASS andDaedong) and two refresh (Kukje and Anower) <b>combine</b> <b>harvesters</b> were conducted for harvesting rice and wheat in the farners ‟ field of Jessore, Pabna,Dinajpurand Thakurgaon districts during 2011 - 12. Primary data were collected from 30 adopter and 30 non-adopter farmers from each district of Bogra, Rangpur, Dinajpur and Thakurgaon through direct interviewingduring 2012 - 13. Information was also collected from different <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> traders available in Bangladesh. Average time, cost and grain saving by <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> over manual methods were 97. 50, 35. 00 and 2. 75 %, respectively. Benefit cost ratio of CLASS, Daedong, Kukje and Anower <b>combine</b> <b>harvesters</b> were found to be 2. 68, 2. 11, 2. 29 and 2. 70, respectively. The payback periods of refresh <b>combine</b> <b>harvesters</b> were lower than the new <b>combine</b> <b>harvester.</b> There were some mechanical problems observed in refresh <b>combine</b> <b>harvesters</b> during field operations. New harvester was observed almost trouble free and popular to the famers.

40|$|Crop-harvesting {{operations}} are typically {{carried out with}} <b>combine</b> <b>harvesters.</b> The harvested product is transferred {{to one or more}} tractors every time the <b>combine</b> <b>harvester’s</b> storage capacity is reached. The efficiency of the process can be significantly improved by computing optimal routes and interactions for the harvest vehicles in the field. Furthermore, an automated method for generating itineraries for the harvest vehicles facilitates the planning for autonomous agricultural vehicles. The infield logistics problem is formulated as an integer linear programming vehicle routing problem with additional turn penalty constraints, but, because of the high number of decision variables, {{it is not possible to}} solve cases of realistic field size. The solution time of the infield logistics problem is considerably reduced by reformulating it as a modified minimum-cost network flowproblem. This specific structure allows the exact solution of intermediate-size planning problems in a much shorter time period. The result of solving the infield logistics problem with the proposed modelling approaches is a set of itineraries (‘tours’), covering the entire field. Each ‘tour’ is characterized by the <b>combine</b> <b>harvester’s</b> start and end points and the positions where the <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> needs to be unloaded. The planning models minimize non-productivity (i. e. the time when a <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> travels in a field without harvesting). The results indicate that coordination between <b>combine</b> <b>harvesters</b> and tractors is also improved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Rice is a main {{food for}} Iranian people {{and has an}} {{important}} role in providing food security. Regarding the population growth, increase of rice production and reduction of losses have special importance in prevention of rice import. Rice losses in the harvest stage are the highest through the whole production period of this crop and hence the reduction of these losses is necessary. Provision of this purpose depends on on-time harvesting and separation of grains from chaff with the least grain losses, and choosing a suitable harvesting method. The choice of harvesting method depends on various factors in each region; thus, different harvest methods in each region must be compared while conducted in the same conditions. In order to recommend the beast harvest method in Shivan-Chardavol region, three harvesting methods (manually, rice-specific <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> and conventional cereals <b>combine</b> <b>harvester)</b> were considered as three experimental treatments and four different parts of this region considered as experimental blocks. The experimental design was randomized complete block design. This study was carried out on Anbarboo variety and the measured factors were: effective farm capacity, percent of total losses, percent of harvesting losses, number of workers and harvesting cost. The results of this study indicated that the total difference of factors was significant at the 1 % error level among all treatments. The effective farm capacity in harvesting by cereals <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> was more than other treatments. The lowest percent of loss was observed for harvesting by rice-specific <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> (2. 32 %) and the highest percent of loss was obtained for cereals <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> (3. 816 %). The manual harvesting method had the highest harvesting cost and the lowest cost was found {{to be associated with the}} rice specific <b>combine</b> <b>harvester.</b> Therefore, from the results of this study, the use of this <b>combine</b> <b>harvester</b> is recommended for rice harvesting in this region...|$|R
