5|$|In 1947, the John, {{the fifth}} Marquess, {{inherited}} the castle {{on the death}} of his father and faced considerable death duties. He sold the very last of the Bute lands in Cardiff and gave the castle and the surrounding park to the city on behalf of the people of Cardiff; the family flag was taken down from the castle as part of the official <b>hand-over</b> ceremony. The castle was protected as a grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the <b>hand-over.</b> Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the Carnation Revolution, a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in Lisbon, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, {{and the new}} head of government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete <b>hand-over</b> of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the overall}} command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began {{arriving}} on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With {{the withdrawal of}} the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The <b>hand-over</b> of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and {{on a number of occasions}} Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.|$|E
25|$|The Saale-Unstrut {{region was}} spared {{destruction}} during the Second World War. The liberation by American {{troops in the}} spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by <b>hand-over</b> of the area to the Red Army and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of East Germany (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the reuniﬁcation of the two German states in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt.|$|E
25|$|In August 1572, Pedro Menéndez de Aviles {{arrived from}} Florida with thirty {{soldiers}} and sailors to take revenge for the massacre. Initially, Menéndez de Avilés believed that Don Luís' uncle {{was responsible for the}} killings. He lured several natives aboard his ship with gifts and used them as hostages. From them, Menéndez de Avilés learned of Alonso de Olmos' survival and was able to secure the boy's return. After gaining a fuller picture of the massacre from Olmos, Menéndez de Avilés attempted to use other natives as hostages to bargain for the <b>hand-over</b> of Don Luís. Don Luís did not turn himself over to the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Finally in 504, the Romans {{gained the}} upper hand with the renewed {{investment}} of Amida leading to the <b>hand-over</b> of the city. That year, an armistice was agreed {{as a result of}} an invasion of Armenia by the Huns from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was the distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials; once released, the Persians preferred to stay in Nisibis. In November 506, a treaty was finally agreed, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were. Procopius states that peace was agreed for seven years, and it is likely that some payments were made to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, {{the inquiry}} was reopened to hear new evidence. The final report into the {{accident}} was published on 7 May. It was established {{that there was nothing}} mechanically wrong with the aircraft at the time it crashed, although the engines were operating at idle power. A number of issues were raised, including the rostering of the crew, the captain's failure to ensure that he had all necessary navigational information, the captain's decision to divert to Le Bourget instead of returning straight to England, the inability of Cormeilles to handle two aircraft at once, and the captain's decision to return to England being made too late. Five recommendations were made {{as a result of the}} investigation. These were in relation to crewing, crew route familiarisation, provision of route information to crews, the ability of airfields to handle more than one aircraft at a time by radio and the introduction of new systems of working between the United Kingdom and France in respect of the control of air traffic and the <b>hand-over</b> of flights between the two countries. The latter was reported as already being under consideration at the time the report was published.|$|E
25|$|A {{need for}} greater {{expertise}} within the project, along with difficult relations between Rover management and Frank Whittle (not least because Rover under AM approval had secretly designed a different engine layout, known within Rover as the B.26, which {{they thought was}} superior), led to Rover handing over their part in the jet engine project and the Barnoldswick factory to Rolls-Royce {{in exchange for the}} latter's Meteor tank engine factory at Ascot Road, Nottingham, the result of a handshake deal between Rover's Spencer Wilks and Rolls-Royce's Ernest Hives made in a local inn in Clitheroe. The official <b>hand-over</b> date was 1 April 1943, though there was a considerable overlap, and several key Rover staff such as Adrian Lombard and John Herriot, the latter being at Rover on secondment from the Air Inspection Department (AID) of the AM, moved to Rolls-Royce. In exchange for the jet engine project and its facilities, Rover was given the contract and production equipment to make Meteor tank engines, which continued until 1964. Although Rolls-Royce under Stanley Hooker were soon to be able to start producing the Whittle-designed W.2B/23 engine (known within Rover as the B.23, later named by Rolls-Royce the Welland), they evaluated the 4 Lombard/Herriot re-designed Rover W.2B/B.26 engines under test {{at the time of the}} takeover, and selected the Rover design for their own jet engine development (it became the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine).|$|E

Brannon Braga was brought on as co-{{executive producer}} because Jeri Taylor was intending to leave the show and wanted a <b>hand-over</b> period.

500|$|In 1963, Australia had {{selected}} the F-111 swing-wing bomber {{as a replacement}} for the Canberra. Murdoch attended the much-anticipated official <b>hand-over</b> ceremony for the aircraft on 4September 1968 at Fort Worth, Texas, with Defence Minister Sir Allen Fairhall, various US dignitaries, and RAAF F-111 crews. Within eight days a US Navy F-111B crashed, followed by a USAF F-111A twelve days later, creating a [...] "public relations disaster", and contributing to the type's entry into RAAF service being delayed until 1973. In late 1969, Murdoch accompanied Secretary of Defence Sir Henry Bland to the United States to gain assurance of an adequate [...] "safe life" [...] for the F-111's swing-wing mechanism, amid the Australian government giving serious consideration to abandoning the program.|$|E
500|$|The cars {{appeared}} at the Paris Motor Show in October 1954 on the Ford France stand, {{but there was no}} mention of the Ford name on the covers of the brochures offered to potential customers. [...] The name [...] "Ford" [...] appeared just once, in very small print, on the final page, presumably in order to avoid confusing customers who would be expected to call the cars [...] "Simcas" [...] from 1 December 1954, the date set for the formal <b>hand-over</b> of the [...] business. [...] In export markets the name change was less immediate, and even in adjacent Belgium, in January 1955 at the Brussels Motor Show the cars were still appearing on the stand of the Belgian Ford importer, sharing the space with models imported from Ford of Britain.|$|E
500|$|The issue became {{central to}} the demand by many Okinawans and other Japanese {{citizens}} for the significant reduction and eventual elimination of U.S. military forces stationed in Okinawa. [...] In the opinion of many Japanese citizens living in Okinawa, the U.S. used the SOFA to shield U.S. servicemembers who committed crimes against Japanese citizens from the Japanese criminal justice system. [...] The September 4, 1995, widely reported rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen caused the U.S. and Japan to revise the SOFA, stating that in the future, the U.S. would give [...] "sympathetic consideration" [...] to the <b>hand-over</b> of U.S. servicemembers accused of violent crimes such as rape or murder to Japanese authorities before indictment. [...] To many in Okinawa, the incident involving Brown appeared to fall under this new provision in the SOFA. [...] After the initial allegations involving Brown were publicized and before charges had even been filed, Okinawa Governor Keiichi Inamine publicly stated, [...] "This is a heinous crime trampling on female human rights. Moreover, this is a crime committed by a marine corps major, a person who {{should be in a}} leadership position." ...|$|E
500|$|Japan had {{requested}} that the U.S. hand over suspects before indictment in three previous cases to which the U.S. had complied. [...] On December 3, 2002, Japan's national government asked that Brown be transferred to Japanese police officials for confinement, {{but in this case}} the United States declined to do until an indictment was handed down. [...] The U.S. embassy stated, [...] "The government of the United States has concluded that the circumstances of this case as presented by the government of Japan do not warrant departure from the standard practice as agreed between the United States and Japan." [...] On December 10, 2002, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the United States to immediately transfer Brown to Japanese authorities and called on the Japanese national government to again demand Brown's immediate <b>hand-over.</b> [...] The resolution condemned the United States' refusal to hand over Brown, calling it, [...] "in defiance of our country's judicial setup and in disregard of its sovereignty" [...] and [...] "intolerable". [...] Keiichi Inamine added, [...] "I have come to fully realize anew that a thorough review of the Japan–U.S. Status of Forces Agreement is necessary." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith, Field {{and others}} met in Salisbury on 13 March 1962 {{and agreed to}} unite against Whitehead as the Rhodesian Front (RF). The Front ranged from former UFP men, {{including}} Smith, who advocated gradual transition and a government based on merit and electoral qualifications, to the Dominion Party's more right-wing members, some of whom held segregationist views not dissimilar to those of South Africa's National Party. Amid these differences, the nascent RF coalition was shaky at best. Its members were brought together by their common opposition to Whitehead's promises of fast-track reform, which they agreed {{would lead to a}} Congo-style national crisis, the flight of the white community and ultimately the country's destruction. In the wider Cold War context, the ardently anti-communist RF aspired to represent a pro-Western bulwark in Africa, alongside South Africa and Portugal, {{in the face of what}} they saw as Soviet and Chinese expansionism. Smith asserted that the RF worked to thwart [...] "this mad idea of a <b>hand-over,</b> of a sell-out of the European and his civilisation, indeed of everything he had put into his country". [...] "The white man is the master of Rhodesia," [...] he said; [...] " [...] has built it and intends to keep it".|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the <b>hand-over</b> process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E

The <b>hand-over</b> of the four Chinese to the Japanese sparked much outrage in Britain with MPs being flooded with letter of protests from their constituents, a public relations disaster for the Chamberlain government that the Israeli historian Aron Shai observed would be better remembered today had World War Two not began two weeks later. The Chinese government handed in a note of protest, asking the British to reconsider, saying that the four men were going to be executed by the Japanese, through Chiang was pleased that the British did not give in to the Japanese economic demands.|$|E

2500|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien's use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might [...] But you're {{not going to get the}} chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and I've got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the <b>hand-over</b> of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} morning several of the {{principal}} chiefs came into camp, {{and said that they}} could not fight against our troops, and would therefore surrender. They held, with their people, Fahla and Salamgi, and would <b>hand-over</b> these fortresses to us, on condition that themselves and their families were allowed to depart with their property unharmed. With them came Samuel, a man who has been frequently mentioned in connection with the prisoners, both in their own letters and in Dr. Beke’s work. This man exercised a strongly prejudicial influence at the early period of their captivity, but has since shown them kindness. Having been one of Theodore’s principal advisers, one could hardly have expected to see him deserting his master in his adversity. Samuel is a strongly-built man, with remarkably intelligent features, and rather grizzly iron-gray hair, which he wears in its natural state, and not plaited and grease-bedaubed in the Abyssinian fashion. Sir Robert Napier accepted the surrender, and gave permission for the departure of their families and effects. Captain Speedy was ordered to return with them, with fifty of the 3d Native Cavalry, under Colonel Locke. Orders had been previously given for the whole of the troops to parade on the flat in front of the fortress. In half an hour after the departure of the cavalry, the troops were formed up, and made an imposing show, the first we have had since we landed. Hitherto the brigades have been separated, and so large a portion of them have been scattered along the line of baggage, that we have never had an opportunity of seeing our real force. We could now see that it was a very formidable body. The 33d were drawn up 750 strong; the 4th, 450; the 45th, 400. We had now the whole of the Beloochees, their left wing having arrived during the night, and the whole of the Punjaubees. We had two companies of the 10th Native Infantry, and six companies of Sappers and Miners—altogether a very complete body of infantry. We had Murray’s Armstrong battery, two seven-inch mortars, Penn’s Mountain Train of steel guns, Twiss’s Mountain Train, and the Naval Rocket Brigade—a very respectable corps of artillery. In cavalry alone we were wanting, having only the fifty troopers of the 3d Native Cavalry, who had come as the Commander-in-chief’s escort, and who had now just {{reached the top of the}} crest of Fahla. The rest of the cavalry—namely, the 3d Dragoons, 3d and 12th Native Cavalry and Scinde Horse—had been sent round into the valley to cut off Theodore’s retreat. General Staveley was, of course, in command of the division. We moved forward, headed by the 33d, to whom, as having—of the European regiments—borne the brunt of the advance work throughout, was now assigned the honour of first entering and of placing the British flag upon Magdala. They were followed by the 45th, Murray’s and Twiss’s battery, and the rest of the second brigade, which had not had an opportunity of taking part in the action on Good Friday. Then came the 4th and the rest of the 1st brigade, with the exception of the troops who were left behind to take care of the camp. Major Baigrie, as quartermaster-general of the 1st division, rode in advance.|$|E
