40|$|As {{the number}} of older adults in Australia increases, {{attention}} is being directed toward ensuring their good health.  Research suggests that health outcomes of older adults are impacted by social belonging and loneliness, <b>and</b> that <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationship quality is pivotal to wellbeing.  However, the roles of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships in promoting social belonging {{have yet to be}} determined.     Aims: This study investigated if perceptions of social belonging in late adulthood are differentiated by the quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships. Method:  The study consisted of two phases.  In Phase 1, 260 university staff and students, aged 18 to 75, completed an online survey investigating the quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> their association with social belonging.  In Phase 2, 88 older adults completed a refined print version of the survey.   Results:  Multiple regression was used to analyse the predictive ability of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships on social belonging. In Phase 1, significant associations were found between both <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging, with friendship yielding the strongest relationship.  Interestingly, in Phase 2 the association between quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging was mediated by age. Those aged 65 to 74 reported a significant relationship between <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> social belonging, which contrasted with those aged over 75.  A significant association between social belonging <b>and</b> <b>family</b> relationships was also found for the entire cohort aged over 65, while high quality friend relationships enhanced social belonging when family relationships were not strong. Conclusions: These results are tentative, but suggest that future research should consider the role that both friendships <b>and</b> <b>family</b> play in promoting social belonging in older adults...|$|R
