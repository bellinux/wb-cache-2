2500|$|... "Live Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by T.I. Dan Balan, Justin Smith, and Makeba Riddick whilst being {{produced}} by Just Blaze and Riddick. T.I. explained Rihanna's incorporation progress into the song to Artist Direct, [...] "It was a back and forth studio thing with Rihanna. I picked her. I was just able to 'hear' her voice on this record. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> so I reached out and she said, 'Yes,' thankfully." ...|$|E
6000|$|To die--that {{does not}} disturb me; we {{of the service}} never care for death. But if I could see her once more! if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> bugle sing again and say, [...] "It is I, Soldier--come!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{waited for}} me to go on. She was deeply interested. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breath coming fast, though we were walking at a snail's pace. I longed to confide in her absolutely, but I dared not.|$|E
60|$|Wot {{he could}} ha' seen in 'er I don't know. I asked 'im one evening--in a {{roundabout}} way--and he answered {{in such a}} long, roundabout way that I didn't know wot {{to make of it}} till I see that she was standing just behind me, listening. Arter that I heard 'er asking questions about me, but I didn't 'ave to listen: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>'er</b> twenty yards away, and singing to myself at the same time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Frenchman has gone, father; and so noiselessly that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> If {{we can get}} out {{as quietly}} there is little fear of our being noticed." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt very}} fiery on my aunt's account; but I {{said it would}} {{certainly}} be better, if Miss Murdstone pleased, not to mention <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing my opinion in a decided tone.|$|R
60|$|Christmas was coming, I have said, and Marjorie {{was wild}} with expectation. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> merry treble entreating Mariposilla {{to tell how}} Santa Claus could ever come to California, {{where there was no}} snow, except upon the tops of the mountains.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not play}} any more that night, but sat in the playroom, pretending to read the Times newspaper; but you could see her eye peering over the sheet, and always fixed on the little imp of a Russian. He had very good luck that night, and his winning made her very savage. As he retired, rolling his gold pieces {{into his pocket and}} sucking his barley-sugar, she glared after him with angry eyes; and went home, and scolded everybody, and had no sleep. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> scolding. Our apartments in the Tissisch House {{overlooked}} Lady Kicklebury's suite of rooms: the great windows were open in the autumn. Yes; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> scolding, and see some other people sitting whispering in the embrasure, or looking out on the harvest moon.|$|E
60|$|Henrietta {{would send}} her {{love to you}} if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice nearer than I do actually, as she sings to the guitar downstairs. And her love {{is not the only}} one to be sent. Give mine to dear Mr. Martin, though he can't make up his mind to the bore of writing to me. And {{remember}} us all, both of you, as we do you.|$|E
6000|$|Tears again glittered {{in those}} sweet eyes {{and she turned}} her head away so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> reply. [...] "He's--he's very fond of gentle creatures you know. And he'd--he'd be so sorry! I don't want him to be made sorry." ...|$|R
60|$|Further remonstrance {{would be}} useless; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see it in}} <b>her</b> face; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> it in <b>her</b> voice. I turned round to open the drawing-room door.|$|R
6000|$|DOLABELLA. I said {{at first}} I was not fit to go: [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> sighs, {{and see her}} tears, [...] But pity must prevail: And so, perhaps, [...] It may again with you; for I have promised, [...] That she should take her last farewell: And, see, [...] She comes to claim my word.|$|R
60|$|I waited {{some little}} time, and tapped, for I had much still to ask her; {{but she would}} return no answer, and I thought that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> sobbing. At last I gave it up; and I {{was about to go}} into the house, for it was nearly dark now, when I heard the click of the garden gate. It was de Lapp himself.|$|E
60|$|While Uncle William {{was saying}} all this Mrs. O'Halloran was {{getting more and}} more {{confused}} and angry, and when Uncle finally opened the door for her with cold dignity, she backed out of it and found herself outside the room without seeming to know what she was doing. Presently <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> down in the scullery below, rattling dishes and saying that she was just as good as anybody.|$|E
6000|$|I {{cried the}} whole afternoon, cowering among my pillows. I {{never wanted to}} go out of that room again. I never wanted to see anybody again. I hated the thought of facing Aunt Philippa with her cold eyes and her miserable stories that seemed to strip life of all beauty and love of all reality. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> scornful, [...] "That's the men for you," [...] if she heard what was in Mark's letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not be {{surprised}} to see these dogs; they are your two brothers. I have condemned them to remain for ten years in these shapes." [...] Then having told me where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> news of <b>her,</b> she vanished.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{seem to be}} blind, or {{a sort of a}} fool," [...] said Vincente. [...] "The girl {{loves you}} and is almost mad about your hurt. What's the matter with you? Is she nothing to you? <b>I</b> wish you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> call you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no; {{nor will}} I have aught of them," [...] exclaimed the traveller, {{starting}} from his seat, and pacing rapidly across the room. [...] "My father, I know, is dead, and I have forgiven him. My mother--what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>her</b> but misery? I will hear nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{in front}} of this little house, as I have said, grew trees that at this season of the year were covered with white and cup-like blossoms, and between these trees was a seat built up of sun-dried bricks. On this seat sat a woman whom I knew from her shape to be Merapi. Also she was sad, for {{although}} her head was bowed and her long hair hid her face <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> gentle sighs.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{sighed and}} pretended to swoon, for I {{could think of nothing}} else to do. As I closed my eyes I saw her face that had been red as dawn turn pale as eve, for my words and all which might lie behind them, had gone home. Moreover, she was in doubt, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> {{fingering}} the handle of the dagger. Then she spoke aloud, words for my ears if they still were open.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} pacify her, {{and at last}} succeeded, and she lay quiet. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, {{and a lot of}} broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the {{aperture}} of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt gray wolf.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had been}} moving onward for some little time, when the girl's {{companion}} addressed an observation to her. She heard it imperfectly, {{and lifted her}} veil while it was being repeated. How painfully my heart beat! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> it--as <b>her</b> face was, for the first time, freely and fairly disclosed! ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not write}} to you in your bereavement, because I knew that the girls had written to you, and because I instinctively shrunk from making a form of what was so real. You knew what a loving and {{faithful}} remembrance I always had of your mother {{as a part of}} my youth--no more capable of restoration than my youth itself. All the womanly goodness, grace, and beauty of my drama went out with her. To the last <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice without emotion. I think of her as of a beautiful part of my own youth, and this dream that we are all dreaming seems to darken.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Sir, I {{shall not}} be able to go with you and Clara so soon as you propose. It was my wish to remain in London some time longer." [...] I said this in a low voice, without venturing to look at my sister. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> exclamation as I spoke, and the tone in which she uttered it.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, no, sir,' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> answer. 'He {{went out}} of his way from the first to bother me. I've tried to keep out of his way, always. Besides, my husband's a violent-tempered man, and I did so want him to hold his job here. He's worked nearly a year for you now, and there aren't any complaints, are there? Before that it was {{irregular}} work for a long time, and we had real hard times. It wasn't his fault. He ain't a drinking man. He always--' ...|$|E
60|$|Across {{the hall}} was a region with which I was not yet acquainted, though I knew it {{contained}} the dining-room, the bath-rooms, the cabin proper, which was in truth a spacious living-room, the captain's quarters, and, undoubtedly, Miss West's quarters. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> humming some air as she bustled about with her unpacking. The steward's pantry, separated by crosshalls and by the stairway leading into the chart-room above on the poop, was placed strategically in the centre of all its operations. Thus, on the starboard side of it were the state-rooms of the captain and Miss West, for'ard of it were the dining-room and main cabin; while {{on the port side}} of it was the row of rooms I have described, two of which were mine.|$|E
60|$|I dived--and I {{aimed to}} find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under {{a minute and a}} half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was {{churning}} along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The day of {{his return}} to me will bring with it the darkest days of my life."..... "I shall die young, and die miserably. Have you {{interest}} enough still left in me to wish to hear of it?" .... "You [...] shall hear of it." [...] Those words were in my memory while I rode home in the cloudless moonlight night. They were so vividly present to me that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> again <b>her</b> pretty foreign accent, her quiet clear tones, as she spoke them. For the rest, the emotions of that memorable day had worn me out. The answer from the telegraph office had struck me with a strange and stony despair. My mind was a blank. I had no thoughts. I had no tears.|$|R
60|$|Ray laughed, {{and again}} to me {{there seemed to be}} a note of {{coarseness}} in his strident and unconcealed contempt of the woman. She took no notice of him whatever. She opened the door and passed out so quickly that though I tried to intercept her, and called out after her, I was powerless to prevent her going. She had flitted away into the shadows. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not even <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> retreating footsteps.|$|R
60|$|So she stood, {{or rather}} seemed to stand, quite still; {{and as it}} happened, {{at that moment the}} giant Jana, either because {{something}} had frightened him, or perhaps owing to the shock of my bullet striking on his tusk having jarred the brain, suddenly pulled up, sliding along a little with all his four feet together, till I {{thought he was going to}} sit down like a performing elephant. Then it appeared to me as though Mameena turned round very slowly, bent towards me, whispering something which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> although <b>her</b> lips moved, looked at me sweetly with those wonderful eyes of hers and vanished away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Though {{all these}} things were in my mind, {{they were in the}} background. They seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was {{thinking}} of my lady. An aching distress filled me. For {{the first time she had}} owned herself beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> sobbing, but I would not turn round to her because I knew she had need of weeping, and had held herself so far and so long for me. It was well, I thought, that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again, for I had no inkling of the thing that hung so near. Even now I can see her as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek.|$|E
60|$|The contemptuous {{manner in}} which I had been {{received}} aroused within me a very unusual state of mind. While talking to Mr. Havelot I heard not far away in {{some part of the}} house a voice singing. It was the voice of Agnes, and I believed she sang so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> But as her sweet tones reached my ear there came to me {{at the same time the}} harsh, contemptuous words of her father. I left the house determined to crush that man to the earth beneath a superincumbent mass of ice--or the evidence of the results of the ownership of such a mass--which would make him groan and weep as he apologized to me for his scornful and disrespectful utterances and at the same time offered me the hand of his daughter.|$|E
6000|$|Next day I was {{inclined}} to agree with her. [...] "There's {{a woman and a}} little girl heading straight for the poppies," [...] said May, a maid about the bungalow. I went out on the porch and waited their advent. They plunged through the pine trees and into the fields, and as the roots of the first poppies were pulled I called to them. They were about a hundred feet away. The woman and the little girl turned to the sound of my voice and looked at me. [...] "Please do not pick the poppies," [...] I pleaded. They pondered this for a minute; then the woman said something in an undertone to the little girl, and both backs jack-knifed as the slaughter recommenced. I shouted, but they had become suddenly deaf. I screamed, and so fiercely that the little girl wavered dubiously. And while the woman went on picking <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> in low tones heartening the little girl.|$|E
60|$|It {{is known}} how {{before the end}} the eclipse became total and from moment to moment the record inscribed upon his mind was erased. Some years before he died I sat between him and Mrs. Rose Terry Cooke, at an 'Atlantic Breakfast' where {{it was part of}} my {{editorial}} function to preside. When he was not asking me who she was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him asking <b>her</b> who I was. His great soul worked so independently of memory as we conceive it, and so powerfully and essentially, that one could not help wondering if; after all, our personal continuity, our identity hereafter, was necessarily trammeled up with our enduring knowledge of what happens here. His remembrance absolutely ceased with an event, and yet his character, his personality, his identity fully persisted.|$|R
60|$|While {{the members}} of the group were, in turn, assuring me of this, a small bell on the table was taken up and rung, and the table itself was shoved powerfully toward the circle and away from the psychic. I assure you, my sitters were profoundly {{interested}} now, and some of the women were startled. A sharp, pecking sound came upon the cone. I called {{attention to the fact that}} this took place at least six feet from the psychic, and a moment later, with intent to detect her in any movement, I leaned far forward so that my head came close to her breast. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not discern the slightest motion; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not even <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breathe. All this, while very impressive to me, was referred by the others to trickery on Mrs. Smiley's part.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have still}} sharp {{memories}} of the tortures of that illness, though it befell so long ago. At times, when my mind was gone from me, I cried out I know not what of jargon, of sentiment, of the horrors I had beheld in my life. I lived again the pleasant scenes, warped and burlesqued almost beyond cognizance, and the tragedies were magnified a hundred fold. Thus it would be: on the low, white ceiling five cracks came together, {{and that was a}} device. And the device would take on color, red-bronze like the sumach in the autumn and streaks of vermilion, and two glowing coals that were eyes, and above them eagles' feathers, and the cracks became bramble bushes. I was behind the log, and at times I started and knew that it was a hideous dream, and again Polly Ann was clutching me and praying me to hold back, and I broke from her and splashed over the slippery limestone bed of the creek to fight single-handed. Through all the fearful struggle I heard her calling me piteously to come back to her. When the brute got me under water <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> but her voice came back suddenly (as when a door opens) and it was like the wind singing in the poplars. Was it Polly Ann's voice? ...|$|R
