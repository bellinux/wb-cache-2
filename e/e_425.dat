40|$|Acid-sensing ion {{channels}} are proton-gated Na+ channels expressed predominantly in neurons. How channel structure translates an environmental stimulus into changes in pore permeability remains largely undefined. The pore of ASIC 1 {{is defined by}} residues in the second transmembrane domain (TM 2), although {{a segment of the}} outer vestibule is formed by residues of TM 1. We used the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to define the role of the region preceding TM 2 (pre-TM 2) in activation and desensitization of mouse ASIC 1 a. Oocytes expressing <b>E</b> <b>425</b> C channels labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C 5 -maleimide showed a change in the emission of the fluorescent probe in response to extracellular acidification. The time course of the change in fluorescence correlated with activation but not desensitization of <b>E</b> <b>425</b> C channels. The fluorescence emission did not change following extracellular acidification in oocytes carrying an inactivating mutation (W 287 G/E 425 C), although these channels were labeled and expressed at the plasma membrane. Our data indicate that pore opening occurs in conjunction with a conformational rearrangement of the pre-TM 2. We observed a change in the emission of the fluorescent probe when labeled <b>E</b> <b>425</b> C channels transition from the desensitized to the resting state. The substituted-cysteine-accessibility method was used to determine whether the pre-TM 2 has different conformations in the resting and desensitized states.

40|$|Acid-sensing ion {{channels}} ASIC 1 a and ASIC 1 b are ligand-gated ion {{channels that}} are activated by H+ in the physiological range of pH. The apparent affinity for H+ of ASIC 1 a and 1 b is modulated by extracellular Ca 2 + through a competition between Ca 2 + and H+. Here we show that, {{in addition to}} modulating the apparent H+ affinity, Ca 2 + blocks ASIC 1 a in the open state (IC 50 ∼ 3. 9 mM at pH 5. 5), whereas ASIC 1 b is blocked with reduced affinity (IC 50 > 10 mM at pH 4. 7). Moreover, we report {{the identification of the}} site that mediates this open channel block by Ca 2 +. ASICs have two transmembrane domains. The second transmembrane domain M 2 has been shown to form the ion pore of the related epithelial Na+ channel. Conserved topology and high homology in M 2 suggests that M 2 forms the ion pore also of ASICs. Combined substitution of an aspartate and a glutamate residue at the beginning of M 2 completely abolished block by Ca 2 + of ASIC 1 a, showing that these two amino acids (<b>E</b> <b>425</b> and D 432) are crucial for Ca 2 + block. It has previously been suggested that relief of Ca 2 + block opens ASIC 3 channels. However, substitutions of <b>E</b> <b>425</b> or D 432 individually or in combination did not open channels constitutively and did not abolish gating by H+ and modulation of H+ affinity by Ca 2 +.

To define the characteristics and functions of U 14, we determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HHV- 6 B U 14 (U 14 -NTD) at 1. 85 Å resolution. U 14 -NTD forms an elongated helix-rich fold with a protruding β hairpin. U 14 -NTD exists as a dimer exhibiting broad electrostatic interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds. This is first report of the crystal structure and dimerization of HHV- 6 B U 14. The surface of the U 14 -NTD dimer reveals multiple clusters of negatively- and positively-charged residues that coincide with potential functional sites of U 14. Three successive residues, L 424, <b>E</b> <b>425</b> and V 426, which relate to viral growth, reside on the β hairpin close to the dimer's two-fold axis.

40|$|Background: Orthorexia nervosa is the {{pathological}} obsession for consuming only biologically pure {{food that}} may lead to the development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can be harmful to one’s health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012). Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study was to investigate images tagged with #orthorexia on Instagram over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a network analysis using both a name network (i. e., who mentions whom) and a chain network (i. e., who replies to whom) was performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of images (results pending). Results: Among the 4, 533 records downloaded, there were 48, 780 unique words associated with the posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated with eating disorder recovery (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>425</b> instances of #edrecovery; 340 instances of #recovery; 297 instances of #eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions analysis indicated a large online presence with 1, 503 nodes (i. e., users) and 1, 803 ties (i. e., direct replies between users). The coding of #orthorexia images is pending but will help us further understand the orthorexia online community. Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{accumulation}} of CO 2 in some natural gas fields represents a risk for exploration, {{and calls for}} a way ofintegrating its occurrence in basin modelling. Among several possible sources we investigate mineralreactions able to take place within bottom sediments of particularly deep and hot sedimentary basins, i. e. at conditions of low-grade metamorphism (up to 500 C and 2500 bar). These reactions involve lithologieswhere carbonate and alumino-silicate minerals are combined to form a « mixed composition ». Forappraising decarbonation quantitatively we propose a method founded on thermodynamic calculations,that follows a modelling approach commonly used in metamorphic petrology. At given bulk compositionand temperature-pressure (T-P) conditions, the composition and proportions of solid and fluid phasesthat coexist at equilibrium are computed using a Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) algorithm. On thebasis of R. G. Berman's database we incorporate thermodynamic parameters {{for a variety of}} solid solutionsincluding clay minerals, and for a CH 4 eCO 2 eH 2 O fluid mixture represented by the CPA-Electrolyteequation of state. A large range of decarbonation reactions is explored through a systematics involving 85 model compositions, and a unique T-P path typical of the targeted basins. We confirm that pure carbonatelithologies do not behave as CO 2 source in the conditions explored. In contrast, we demonstratethat mixed compositions are likely to yield CO 2 from successive mineral reactions, in which clay mineralsplay a prominent role. We also show that the temperature of incipient decarbonation, staggered over 325 <b>e</b> <b>425</b> C, depends on the Ca/Mg/Fe composition ratio of the bulk sediment. CO 2 -prone reactionsoccurring from a selection of natural sediments are then presented. The CO 2 -prolific character ofparticular facies associated to the rift phase of a basin evolution is illustrated, notably in the case oflacustrine oil shales. Finally, we indicate a protocol that integrates the decarbonation scheme derivedfrom thermodynamics into a CO 2 -generation formalism compatible with the usual formalism of a basinmodel...|$|E

In this study we analyzed SQSTM 1 mutations in 533 of 608 consecutive PDB patients from several regions, including the high-prevalence area of Campania (also characterized by increased severity of PDB, higher number of familial cases, and peculiar phenotypic characteristics as giant cell tumor). Eleven different mutations (Y 383 X, P 387 L, P 392 L, E 396 X, M 401 V, M 404 V, G 411 S, D 423 X, G <b>425</b> <b>E,</b> G <b>425</b> R, and A 427 D) were observed in 34 of 92 (37 %) and 43 of 441 (10 %) of familial and sporadic PDB patients, respectively. All five patients with giant cell tumor complicating familial PDB were negative for SQSTM 1 mutations. An increased heterogeneity and a different distribution of mutations were observed in southern Italy (showing 9 of the 11 mutations) than in central and northern Italy. Genotype-phenotype analysis showed only a modest reduction in age at diagnosis in patients with truncating versus missense mutations, whereas the number of affected skeletal sites did not differ significantly. Patients from Campania had the highest prevalence of animal contacts (i. e., working or living on a farm or pet ownership) without any difference between patients with or without mutation. However, when familial cases from Campania were considered, animal contacts were observed in 90 % of families without mutations. Interestingly, a progressive age-related decrease in the prevalence of animal contacts, as well as a parallel increase in the prevalence of SQSTM 1 mutations, was observed in most regions except in the subgroup of patients from Campania. Moreover, patients reporting animal contacts showed an increased number of affected sites (2. 54 +/- 2. 0 versus 2. 19 +/- 1. 9, p <. 05) over patients without animal contacts. This difference also was evidenced in the subgroup of patients with SQSTM 1 mutations (3. 84 +/- 2. 5 versus 2. 76 +/- 2. 2, p <. 05). Overall, these data suggest that animal-related factors may be important in the etiology of PDB and may interact with SQSTM 1 mutations in influencing disease severity...|$|R

40|$|Acid-sensing ion {{channels}} (ASICs) are proton gated cation channels, {{which are}} involvedin many neuronal diseases, synaptic transmission, learning, memory and nociception. ASICs {{are members of}} the DEG/ENaC gene family and consist of four genes (ASIC 1 - 4),with two splice variants (ASIC 1 b and 2 b). They are mainly expressed in the central andperipheral nervous system. Their implication in neuronal diseases makes them a potentdrug target. The knowledge of their gating mechanism and the exact composition ofASIC in heteromers are the basis for the development of new therapeutic ligands forthe treatment of disease patterns, where ASICs are involved. This study can be divided into two parts. First, the interaction during the gatingof rASIC 1 a between two conserved histidines and an aspartate was investigated inmolecular detail and second, the exact stoichiometry of the ASIC 1 a/ 2 a heteromer hasbeen identified. For the investigation of the gating mechanism, previous studies gave first insightsinto the functional relevance of specific amino acids. Studies on rASIC 1 a found thatthe double mutation of the fully conserved H 73 and the partially conserved H 72 into asparagine led to non functional channels. Additionally, if D 78 was mutatedinto asparagine together with mutations in the Ca 2 + binding site <b>E</b> <b>425</b> GD 432 C, thechannel function was abolished. These results indicate a relevance of these aminoacids for proper channel gating. Furthermore, the crystal structure of cASIC 1 inthe desensitized state gave first hints for an interaction between H 73 and D 78 of anadjacent subunit by building a salt bridge. By the method of the double-mutant cycle analysis, the formation of a salt bridgebetween H 72 and H 73 to D 78 of an adjacent subunit and its energetical contributionto the different conformations of the channel was explored. Furthermore, H 72, H 73 and D 78 were mutated into cysteines and their spatial proximity was investigated bydisulfide bond trapping. Additionally, the application of MTS reagents and the chargeswap and reversal of the amino acids gave information about the importance of thecharge of the respective side chains and their structural rearrangement during gating. The {{results of this study suggest}} stabilizing contributions of the salt bridge betweenH 73 and D 78 to ligand binding and of the interaction between H 72 and D 78 todesensitization. During gating, the channel experiences a structural rearrangementabove the transmembrane domains, which is supported by the energetical contributionsof the salt bridges. The freely moving side chain of D 78 and the positive chargeseither at position H 72 or at H 73 are essential for proper channel function. In summary,not just the salt bridges but the structural rearrangement above the transmembranedomain around D 78 influence the channel during pore opening. In the second part of the thesis, the stoichiometry of ASIC 1 a/ 2 a heteromers hadbeen explored. ASIC 1 a/ 2 a heteromers had been described for example in hippocampaland dorsal horn neurons, where they show distinct functional properties from theirrelative homomers. Since drugs often bind at subunit interfaces and different agonistsand antagonists of ASICs have been found by crystal analysis to bind at interfaces, theknowledge of the subunit composition in heteromers has a relevance for drug design. For the electrophysiological characterization of the heteromers, the method of thetwo-electrode voltage-clamp was used. Furthermore, the group of Prof. Dr. Ulbrichfrom Freiburg counted the GFP and ttCherry tagged ASIC subunits in the heteromerby bleaching steps with a single molecule imaging method. The results of the second part clearly revealed the coexistence of ASIC 1 a andASIC 2 a homomers, together with ASIC 1 a/ 2 a heteromers in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Heteromeric ASIC 1 a/ 2 a assembles in a random fashion, with either a 1 : 2 or a 2 : 1 stoichiometry.

At {{the beginning and end}} of supplementation period, the animals averaged body weight and age of 189. 51 ± 21. 08 kg and 254 ± 29. 22 days and 242. 38 ± 29. 22 kg and 400 ± 31. 08 days, respectively. The mean daily feed intake was 1. 52 kg/head. The mean daily body weight gain in this period was of 0. 377 kg and in the next rainfall season was of 0. 534 kg. The correlation of body weight from the beginning to the end of supplementation and to the end of rainfall season was of 0. 78 and 0. 65, respectively. The highest correlations found among body weights were: at the end of the dry and rainfall period (r = 0. 86); body weight and gain at the end of rainfall period (r = 0. 62); body weight and gain at the end of rainfall period and total gain (0. 75 and 0. 71, repectively), gain at dry season and total gain (0. 80). After weaning, the calves were classified into three classes: inferior (140 ± 11. 37 kg), medium (187 ± 11. 09 kg) and superior (219 ± 8. 51 kg). The body weights at the end of rainfall season were of 271 ± 9. 56 kg, 362 ± 22. 75 kg and 425 ± 15. 32 kg. At least 54 % of the animals remained as inferior, 60 % as medium and 54 % as superior at the end of rainfall season. At 20 / 21 months old, the steers averaged body weight of 366 ± 39. 04 kg and conditions to be finished in fedlot. However, there are calves weaned at six/seven months old with less than 150 kg of body weight, with lower potential to body weight gain and less conditions to be finished in fedlot even when supplemented previously...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} study trends {{over time in}} {{operation}} rates for inguinal hernia with and without obstruction over five decades. METHODS: Routine hospital statistics were used to analyse trends in National Health Service hospitals in England (1968 - 2011). RESULTS: All-England admission rates for elective repair of unobstructed inguinal hernia in males were 240. 8 episodes per 100, 000 population [95  % confidence interval (CI) 234. 5 - 247. 2] in 1968 and were relatively stable until 2003 after which they declined to 217. 1 (215. 4 - 218. 8) by 2011. However, {{the stability of the}} all ages rates masked a large decline in admission rates in the young (<b>e.</b> g. <b>425</b> per 100, 000 in 1968 - 1970 in males under 1  year of age, down to 155 per 100, 000 in 2007 - 2011) and a large increase in the elderly (e. g. 247 in 1968 - 1970 per 100, 000 males aged 75 - 84, up to 799 per 100, 000 in 2007 - 2011). All-England admission rates for obstructed inguinal hernia in males almost halved, from 19. 3 episodes (17. 4 - 21. 2) in 1968 to 10. 7 episodes (10. 3 - 11. 0) per 100, 000 population in 2011. Admission rates for females gradually declined over time for both unobstructed and obstructed inguinal hernia. CONCLUSION: Hospital admission rates for elective operation on inguinal hernia without obstruction, for all ages combined, have been relatively stable over five decades, but this masked big differences between age groups. Rates of obstructed hernia have declined over time, particularly in the early years covered by the study, and have not shown an increase associated with the recent fall in elective surgery for hernia repair...|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de avaliar a viabilidade da utilização de xilanase e farelo de arroz em rações suplementadas com fitase para frangos de corte na fase de um a 21 dias de idade. No experimento foram utilizados 540 pintos machos de um dia da marca Ross, distribuídos em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em arranjo fatorial 4 x 2 + 1 (xilanase x farelo de arroz + testemunha), com quatro repetições de 15 aves por parcela. A ração testemunha à base de milho e de farelo de soja sem suplementação com enzimas foi formulada para atender às exigências nutricionais das aves. As rações com inclusão de farelo de arroz, também à base de milho e farelo de soja, foram suplementadas com 900 unidades de fitase/kg. Todas a rações foram balanceadas segundo Rostagno et al. (2000), exceto para o fósforo disponível e cálcio nas rações contendo farelo de arroz, cujos níveis foram reduzidos (0, 22 % e 0, 75 %). O farelo de arroz foi incluído em 10 % ou 20 % na ração suplementada com quatro níveis de xilanase (0, 200, 400 ou 600 unidades/kg). A utilização da xilanase não afetou o consumo de ração. As aves que receberam ração com 20 % de farelo de arroz apresentaram consumo 2, 6 % menor e conversão alimentar 2, 2 % melhor do que as aves que receberam ração com 10 % de farelo de arroz na fase de 1 a 21 dias. Em comparação com a testemunha, o consumo para a ração com 20 % de farelo de arroz foi menor com menos de 600 unidades/kg de xilanase, e o ganho de peso foi menor sem xilanase e com 20 % de farelo de arroz com até 200 unidades/kg de xilanase na fase de 1 a 21 dias. O melhor ganho de peso foi estimado para 391 unidades/kg de xilanase para a ração para 10 % de farelo de arroz na fase de 1 a 21 dias; para a ração com 20 % de farelo de arroz, o nível ótimo de xilanase está acima dos níveis utilizados neste experimento. Os melhores resultados de conversão alimentar foram estimados para 350 <b>e</b> <b>425</b> unidades/kg de xilanase de 1 a 21 dias, respectivamente, para 10 e 20 % de farelo de arroz. Dessa forma, pode-se concluir que a elevação do nível de farelo de arroz na ração eleva a quantidade de xilanase necessária para reduzir os efeitos antinutritivos. Sem xilanase, a utilização de farelo de arroz na ração não deve ultrapassar 12 %. Com 400 unidades de xilanase por kg de ração, a utilização de até 20 % de farelo de arroz propicia desempenho semelhante ao da ração-testemunha, sem farelo de arroz e sem xilanase. A maximização de desempenho das aves com ração contendo acima de 20 % de farelo de arroz necessita de suplementação de xilanase acima de 600 unidades/kg. The present {{work was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of xylanase and rice bran in rations supplemented with phytase for broiler chickens. In the experiment were utilized 540 one day old male Ross chicks, allocated into a completely randomized design in a 4 x 2 + 1 factorial arrangement (xylanase x rice bran + control) with four replicates of 15 birds per pen. The control ration was based on corn and soybean meal without enzyme supplementation were formulated to reach the chickens nutrient requirements. The rations with the addition of rice bran also were based on corn and soybean meal were supplemented with 900 units of phytase/kg. All the rations were formulated according to Rostagno et al. (2000), except for available phosphorus and calcium in the rations containing rice bran, in which the levels were reduced (0. 22 % and 0. 75 %). Rice bran was added in 10 % or 20 % in the ration supplemented with four levels of xylanase (0, 200, 400 or 600 units/kg). The use of xylanase did not affect feed intake as well as any treatments tested. The chickens fed ration with 20 % of rice bran shown feed intake 2. 6 % lower and feed conversion 2. 2 % better than the chickens fed ration with 10 % of rice bran from 1 to 21 days. As compared with the control ration, feed intake for ration with 20 % of rice bran shown lower for ration supplemented with less than 600 units/kg of xylanase and weight gain was lower without xylanase and with 20 % of rice bran up to 200 units/kg of xylanase from 1 to 21 days. The best weight gain was estimated for 391 units /kg of xylanase for the ration supplemented with 10 % of rice bran from 1 to 21 days and for the ration with 20 % of rice bran, the optimum level of xylanase should be higher than the levels utilized in this experiment for both phases. The best results of feed conversion were estimated as 350 and 425 units/kg of xylanase from 1 to 21 days, respectively, by using rations with addition of 10 and 20 % of rice bran. Accord to the data the increase of the level of rice bran in the ration also the xylanase should be supplemented {{in order to reduce the}} detrimental effects on chickens performance. Rations without xylanase, the addition of rice bran should not exceed 12 %. Therefore supplementation of 400 units of xylanase per kg of ration, allow to add up to 20 % of rice bran in the ration. The maximization of chickens performance fed ration with higher than 20 % of rice bran should be supplementation of xylanase higher than 600 units/kg of ration...|$|E

40|$|The {{probiotic}} bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri 121 produces two fructosyltransferase enzymes, a levansucrase and an inulosucrase. Although {{these two}} fructosyltransferase enzymes share high sequence similarity, they differ {{significantly in the}} type and size distribution of fructooligosaccharide products synthesized from sucrose, and in their activity levels. In order to examine the contribution of specific amino acids to such differences, 15 single and four multiple inulosucrase mutants were designed that affected residues that are conserved in inulosucrase enzymes, but not in levansucrase enzymes. The effects of the mutations were interpreted using the 3 D structures of Bacillus subtilis levansucrase (SacB) and Lactobacillus johnsonii inulosucrase (InuJ). The wild-type inulosucrase synthesizes mostly fructooligosaccharides up to a degree of polymerization of 15 and relatively low amounts of inulin polymer. In contrast, wild-type levansucrase produces mainly levan polymer and fructooligosaccharides {{with a degree of}} polymerization < 5. Although most of the inulosucrase mutants in this study behaved similarly to the wild-type enzyme, the mutation G 416 E, at the rim of the active site pocket in loop 415 - 423, increased the hydrolytic activity twofold, without significantly changing the transglycosylation activity. The septuple mutant GM 4 (T 413 K, K 415 R, G 416 <b>E,</b> A <b>425</b> P, S 442 N, W 486 L, P 516 L), which included two residues from the above-mentioned loop 415 - 423, synthesized 1 -kestose only, but at low efficiency. Mutation A 538 S, located behind the general acid / base, increased the enzyme activity two to threefold. Mutation N 543 S, located adjacent to the + 1 /+ 2 sub-site residue R 544, resulted in synthesis of not such a wide variety of fructooligosaccharides than the wild-type enzyme. The present study demonstrates that the product specificity of inulosucrase is easily altered by protein engineering, obtaining inulosucrase variants with higher transglycosylation specificity, higher catalytic rates and different fructooligosaccharide size distributions, without changing the β(2 - 1) linkage type in the product. ...|$|R

Microsatellites will be useful for investigating biogeography and landscape genetics across the species distribution range, including current or past gene flow. Methods and Results: Seventeen microsatellite loci were characterized, of which 10 were polymorphic and amplified for a total of 56 alleles in three populations of C. tricoccon. The markers revealed average coefficients of expected heterozygosity (H <b>e</b> = 0. <b>425),</b> observed heterozygosity (H o = 0. 282), and inbreeding coefficient value per population (F IS = 0. 408).

The spikes may {{be divided into}} three distinct populations depending on whether they occur at latitudes below, at, or above the local limit of trapping. These spikes are designated type 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Type 3 spikes occur in a narrow latitude band about 3 ° wide, centered at invariant latitude Λ ≈ 78 ° at 1000 MLT (magnetic local time) and 68 ° at 2000 MLT. Their relative frequency of occurrence, intensity, and hardness do not depend significantly on magnetic local time. Type 3 spikes appear {{to be associated with}} spikes observed near the magnetopause and the neutral sheet. Type 2 spikes also occur in a latitude band about 3 ° wide, centered at about 71 ° at 1000 MLT and 67 ° at 2200 MLT. Their frequency of occurrence is highly dependent on magnetic local time, a large maximum occurring near 2300 and very few events occurring between 0600 and 1200 MLT. Type 2 spikes appear to be related to island fluxes in the neutral sheet, although they occur on closed field lines and may persist for many hours. Type 1 spikes occur in a wider band of latitudes, from about 62 ° to 68 ° near midnight and 66 ° to 68 ° near noon. The local-time dependence of their frequency of occurrence {{is similar to that of}} type 2 spikes but less pronounced. Although they are observed on closed field lines, type 1 spikes do not persist for periods longer than about 1 hour, and we conclude that they are produced by strong pitch-angle scattering from the stably trapped population.

The rate of inactivation was increased by the addition of 0. 005 M phosphate, and was decreased by 0. 005 M MgCl 2 in all but T 7, whose rate was unaffected by this amount of Mg. The influence of Ca was similar to that of Mg. The addition of 0. 005 M MgCl 2 to the broth medium resulted in a first order rate of destruction of T 5 at either normal or increased pressure, and with as well as without urethane. Analysis of data obtained under these conditions indicated that the thermal inactivation proceeds with a volume increase of activation of 113 cc. per mol, and with a heat and entropy of 170, 000 calories and <b>425</b> <b>E.</b> U., respectively, in the rate-limiting reaction. In the presence of 0. 1 M urethane the heat and volume change of activation are apparently slightly greater. The relation between concentration of urethane and the amount of acceleration in rate of destruction at normal pressure and 66 °C. indicated that the total rate involves at least two first order rate processes: the thermal inactivation itself and a urethane-catalyzed reaction, the latter involving the combination of an average of 2. 3 molecules of urethane in the activated state of the bacteriophage molecule whose destruction results in loss of phage activity...|$|R
40|$|Foram comparados a biomassa, a composição química e o valor nutritivo da macrófita aquática emersa S. alterniflora em um rio impactado por descargas de efluentes domésticos (Rio Guaú) e em um rio bem conservado (Rio Itanhaém). Amostras de S. alterniflora, água e sedimento foram coletadas nos dois rios, em novembro de 2001. O rio Guaú apresentou as maiores concentrações de N-Total e P-Total na água (415 e 674 µg. L- 1, respectivamente) e sedimento (0, 25 e 0, 20 % de Massa Seca, respectivamente), em relação a água (NT = 105 µg. L- 1; PT= 20 µg. L- 1) e sedimento (NT = 0, 12 % MS; PT = 0, 05 % MS) do rio Itanhaém. A biomassa aérea (316 g MS. m- 2) <b>e</b> subterrânea (<b>425</b> g MS. m- 2) de S. alterniflora no rio Guaú foram significativamente maiores do que no rio Itanhaém (146 e 115 g MS. m- 2). Além disto, os valores de NT, proteínas, PT, lipídios e carboidratos solúveis foram significativamente maiores na biomassa de S. alterniflora no rio Guaú. Por outro lado, a fração de parede celular e os teores de polifenóis foram maiores na biomassa de S. alterniflora no rio Itanhaém. Concluiu-se que o lançamento de efluentes domésticos em corpos d'água pode aumentar a biomassa e alterar a composição química de S. alterniflora. A maior disponibilidade de N e P no rio Guaú, provavelmente, é a causa dos maiores valores de biomassa, NT, PT, lipídeos e carboidratos solúveis em S. alterniflora neste rio. We {{compared}} {{the values of}} the biomass, chemical composition and nutritive value of the emergent aquatic macrophyte S. alterniflora in a river affected by the discharge of domestic sewage (Guaú River) and in an unpolluted river (Itanhaém River). S. alterniflora, water and sediment samples were obtained in the two rivers in November, 2001. The Guaú River presented the highest levels of Total-N and Total-P in the water (415 and 674 µg. L- 1, respectively) and in the sediment (0. 25 e 0. 20 % of the Dry Mass, respectively), when compared to the water (TN = 105 µg. L- 1; TP = 20 µg. L- 1) and the sediment (NT = 0. 12 % DM; PT = 0. 05 % DM) of the Itanhaém River. Aerial (316 g DM. m- 2) and subterraneous (425 g DM. m- 2) biomass of S. alterniflora were significantly higher in the Guaú River than in the Itanhaém River (146 and 115 g DM. m- 2, respectively). In addition, the values of TN, protein, TP, lipids and soluble carbohydrates were significantly higher in S. alterniflora biomass from the Guaú River. on the other hand, {{the values of the}} polyphenols and the cell wall fraction were significantly higher in the biomass of S. alterniflora from the Itanhaém River. We concluded that domestic sewage discharge in water bodies may increase the biomass and change the chemical composition of S. alterniflora. The high N and P availability in the water of the Guaú River is probably the cause of the higher biomass, TN, TP, protein, lipids and soluble carbohydrates measured in S. alterniflora in this river...|$|R
40|$|Growth carcass Characteristics {{and meat}} quality were {{studied in the}} local cattle breeds Alentejana, Barrosa and Mertolenga and in the Friesian breed (24 entire males/breed), Fed with two {{intensive}} diets, one based in maized silage {{and the other in}} tritical and sunflower meal (12 animals/diet), and slaughtered at three weights (Alentejana and Friesian - 400, 525 e 650 KgLW; Barrosa and Mertolenga - 300, <b>425</b> <b>e</b> 550 kgLW; four animals of each group breed-diet/slaughter weight). The results obtained allow the following considerations about the local cattle breeds studied: (i) The Alentejana breed, with an adult body weight probably lower than that of the Friesian breed, has an higher growth rate. The heaviest Alentejana animals have less fat than Friesian animals of similar weight. The diets utilised do not significant alter the growth rate of the breed. (ii) The Barrosa breed, with an adult body weight probably higher than that of the Mertolenga breed, has a similar growth rate, and a fast fattening pattern in intensive systems. It has an important deposition of intramuscular fat. If this characteristic is not valorized, considering its consequences to meat quality, the Barrosa breed should be used in less intensive production system. (iii) Among the local breeds studies, Mertolenga seems to have the lower adult body weight. The younger animals do not adapt well to diets based in maize silage. It has a moderate growth rate and a fattening pattern characterised by a slow and/or less fat deposition. It has an important deposition of kidney knob and channel fat, that associated to the reproductive characteristics and maternal capacities pointed out to Mertolenga, may explain its main aptitude to be used as mother in beef production systems. This breed has also favourable characteristics to be used as purebred in meat production, namely high values for dressing percentage and muscle/bone ration. Considering that characteristics and the fattening pattern already referred, Mertolenga breed may be used in several types of production systemsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{objectives were}} {{to study the}} effect of breed and slaughter weight (SW) on growth, carcass and meat characteristics of bulls raised on a grazing system. A total of forty-eight bulls of Alentejana (AL), Barrosa(BA), Mertolenga (ME) and Friesian (FR) breeds were slaughtered at three live weights (AL e FR: SW 1 - 400, SW 2 - 525 e SW 3 - 650 Kg; BA e ME: SW 1 - 300, SW 2 - <b>425</b> <b>e</b> SW 3 - 500 Kg) (4 animals/breed/slaughter weight). Meat characteristics were studied on Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus muscles. Mertolenga had a higher average daily weight gain than Barrosa (breeds with the same adult body weight) and {{similar to those of}} Alentejana and Friesian (breeds with higher adult body weight). These results suggest that there are breed differences in the ability to adapt to environmental conditions conditions. The positive relationship between adult body weight and growth rate was observed only at high grass availability and/or compensatory growth conditions. Carcass characteristics were affected by breed and slaughter weight. Mertolenga showed one of the highest percentage and the higest muscle proportion and muscle/bone ratio. Muscle distribution suggest that animals were slaughtered at a similar stage of maturity, and the small differences found between breeds were commercially unimportant. The slaughter weight increase improved almost all carcass characteristics. The results obtained showed that bulls rose in this production system must be finished prior to slaughter in order to obtain a commercially acceptable carcass fat cover. Meat Characteristics were affected by breed, slaugbter weight and muscle. Barrosa breed chad the lowest shear force, as animals from the higher slaughters eight and Semimembranosus muscle. The observed variation on the studied did not allow to be conclusive in terms of meat color, juiciness and flavour. Temperature measured three hours postmortem had the greatest influence on meat characteristics; since it is positively correlated with carcass fat percentage, subcutaneous fat depht and Longissimus dorsi area, it is important to manipulate de degree of finishing and/or live weight at slaughter or to modify the chilling [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
