25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, {{potassium bromide}} {{is a white}} crystalline powder. It is <b>freely</b> <b>soluble</b> in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to {{the properties of the}} potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts).|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is <b>freely</b> <b>soluble</b> in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E

40|$|Para-nitrophenyl {{glycerin}} (PNPG) {{was shown}} {{to be an effective}} agent to abolish the swarming of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris on predried solid culture media. The level required to abolish swarming varied with the strain of Proteus, the components of the medium, and also with the conditions of incubation. Generally 0. 1 to 0. 2 mM PNPG effectively abolished swarming for at least 24 h with aerobic incubation. Levels of PNPG that abolished swarming showed no effect upon the growth of the cells, little or no effect upon the motility characteristics of the organisms, and no effect upon the cellular morphology. PNPG was found to be <b>freely</b> water <b>soluble,</b> stable to autoclaving, and to retain biological activity for at least one month in prepared culture media stored under refrigeration...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene glycol) esters {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a potential oral-controlled drug delivery system for dexamethasone (DXM). The drug was covalently attached to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol amine (mPEG-NH 2) (Mw = 10, 000 Da) using a succinate linker. A new PEG-based prodrug system was designed using ester derivatives. The drug-polymer conjugate (mPEG-DXM) was <b>freely</b> water <b>soluble</b> at room temperature. First of all, the adduct hydrolytic stability was assessed at physiological pH. Then, the bioavailability was evaluated by orally administering the mPEG-DXM conjugate in rabbits and comparing to that obtained by the intravenous route. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of PEGylated drug was {{twice as large as}} that of the parent drug after oral administration. In conclusion, PEGylated DXM was useful for maintaining the DXM concentration in the blood after oral administration...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pharmaceuticals {{in the environment}} is of great concern and only few data are available about the adverse effects of such molecules and their derivatives on non-target aquatic organisms. This {{study was designed to}} assess the toxic potential of Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, Naproxen Na, its <b>freely</b> water <b>soluble</b> sodium salt and their photoproducts in the aquatic environment. Bioassays were performed on algae, rotifers and microcrustaceans to assess acute and chronic toxicity. Furthermore, possible genotoxic effects of photoderivatives were investigated using SOS chromotest and Ames fluctuation test. The results showed that photoproducts were more toxic than the parent compounds both for acute and chronic values, while genotoxic and mutagenic effects were not found. These findings suggested the opportunity to consider derivatives in ecotoxicology assessment of drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{tailoring}} of {{the lower}} critical solution temperature (LCST) polymers of acrylamide and methacrylamide in water is achieved by chemical modification of <b>freely</b> water <b>soluble</b> precursor polymers poly[N- 2 -hydroxypropylmethacrylamide], poly[N,N-bis(hydroxyethyl) acrylamide] and poly[N-(tris(hydroxymethyl) -methyl) acrylamide]. Two principal reactions, namely acetylation and cinnamoylation, are applied. By varying the acylating agent {{as well as the}} extend of acylation, the LCST can be tailored easily. The cloud points observed for the different polymer series do not correlate with the apparent hydrophilicity of the parent polymers according to the content of hydroxyl groups. The results thus exemplify the difficulties to predict the behavior of modified thermosensitive polymers by simply analysing the balance of hydrophilic to hydrophobic molecular fragments. Chemical modification by cinnamoylation provides photoreactive copolymers e. g susceptible to photocrosslinking. When the polymers are prepared by polymerization using a disulfide-functionalized azo-initiator efficient grafting of the modified copolymers on gold surfaces is possible to prepare ultrathin hydrogel films, as demonstrated by Surface Plasmon Resonance...|$|R

Being highly soluble drug there is possibility of burst effect which causes sudden peak levels of drug in blood. It is having many side effects and with a half life around 5 hours. To reduce the adverse effects due to burst effect {{and to have the}} sustain action of the drug we have prepared the ethyl cellulose microspheres of the drug. The microspheres were prepared by the emulsification and solvent evaporation method. The prepared microspheres were evaluated mainly for the sustain release of the drug and then the anti depressant activity in albino mice apart from the other tests like % drug encapsulation, particle size and drug polymer compatibility by the FTIR studies. The method had resulted in good encapsulation efficiency and micron sized ethyl cellulose spheres. The drug release was found to be sustained for 16 hours and was found to follow the Peppas kinetics.

40|$|A natural gum, damar was {{investigated}} as a novel microencapsulating material for sustained drug delivery. Microparticles were prepared by oil-in-oil emulsion solvent evaporation method. Ibuprofen and diltiazem hydrochloride {{were used as}} model drugs. Microparticles were evaluated for particle size, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release kinetics. Images of the microparticles were obtained by bright field microscopy. The effect of different gum:drug ratios and solubility of drug on microparticle properties was principally investigated. Gum damar could produce discrete and spherical microparticles with both drugs. With a <b>freely</b> water <b>soluble</b> drug (diltiazem hydrochloride), gum damar produced bigger (45 - 50 &#x 00 B 5;m) and fast drug releasing microparticles with low encapsulation efficiencies (44 - 57 &#x 0025;). Contrary, with a slightly water soluble drug (ibuprofen), gum damar produced small (24 - 33 &#x 00 B 5;m) microparticles with better drug encapsulation (85 - 91 &#x 0025;) and sustained drug delivery. The increase in gum:drug ratio showed an increase in particle size, encapsulation efficiency and decrease in drug release rate in all cases. Drug release profiles of all microparticles followed zero order kinetics. In conclusion, gum damar can be used successfully to produce discrete and spherical microparticles of ibuprofen and diltiazem hydrochloride...|$|R

40|$|In this study, Monolayer matrix (MLM) tablet {{and triple}} layer matrix (TLM) tablet {{formulation}} of metoprolol succinate were fabricated by using Hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose and Polymethacrylates (Eudragit) as the matrix forming agent {{in both the}} tablet core layer and barrier layers. The prepared tablets were analyzed for their drug content and in-vitro drug release studies. In-vitro evaluation and comparison of the MLM dosage form and TLM dosage form was done. The role of impermeable barrier layer in controlling the drug release from the core was studied. The in-vitro dissolution {{studies were carried out}} and showed a significant difference statistically (P value > 0. 05 by ANOVA tool). Mean dissolution time (MDT) increased, while dissolution efficiency (DE %) decreased, indicating that the release of metoprolol succinate is slower from triple layer matrix tablets. The thermal analysis studies (DSC) performed on the initial TLM formulation and three month old accelerated stability sample of the same showed no variation in the thermograph, indicating TLM as stable formulation. The finding of the study indicated that the MLM tablets may prolonged the drug release, but a non linear drug release profile was observed with an initial burst release. In TLM tablets, layering with Hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose and Polymethacrylates (Eudragit) as impermeable barrier on the matrix core, resulted in linear/zero order drug release kinetics. The initial burst release was not observed in TLM tablets. TLM tablets showed significant and marked controlled release of a <b>freely</b> water <b>soluble</b> drug as compared to MLM tablets...|$|R

40|$|Receptor-mediated {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) hydrolysis of phosphoinositides {{is accompanied}} by the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI). Hydrolysis of phosphoinositides occurs at the plasma membrane, and the resulting diacylglycerol (DG) is converted into phosphatidate (PA). Two enzymes located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function sequentially to convert PA back into PI. We have established an assay whereby the resynthesis of PI could be followed in permeabilized cells. In the presence of [gamma- 32 P]ATP, DG generated by PLC activation accumulates label when converted into PA. The 32 P-labelled PA is subsequently converted into labelled PI. The formation of labelled PI reports the arrival of labelled PA from the plasma membrane to the ER. Cytosol-depleted, permeabilized human neutrophils are capable of PI resynthesis following stimulation of PLCbeta (in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein), provided that CTP and inositol are also present. We also found that wortmannin, an inhibitor of endocytosis, or cooling the cells to 15 degrees C did not stop PI resynthesis. We conclude that PI resynthesis is dependent neither on vesicular transport mechanisms nor on <b>freely</b> diffusible, <b>soluble</b> transport proteins. Phosphatidylcholine-derived PA generated by the ADP-ribosylation-factor-stimulated phospholipase D pathway was found to accumulate label, reflecting the rapid cycling of PA to DG, and back. This labelled PA was not converted into PI. We conclude that PA derived from the PLC pathway is selected for PI resynthesis, and its transfer to the ER could be membrane-protein-mediated at sites of close membrane contact...|$|R
40|$|Spore {{formation}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is driven by}} de novo assembly of new membranes termed prospore membranes. A vesicle-docking complex called the meiosis II outer plaque (MOP) forms on the cytoplasmic faces of the spindle-pole bodies {{at the onset of}} meiosis II and serves as the initiation site for membrane formation. In this study, a fluorescence-recovery assay was used to demonstrate that the dynamics of the MOP proteins change coincident with the coalescence of precursor vesicles into a membrane. Proteins within the MOP exchange <b>freely</b> with a <b>soluble</b> pool prior to membrane assembly, but after membranes are formed they remain stably within the MOP. By contrast, constitutive spindle-pole-body proteins display low exchange in both conditions. The MOP component Ady 4 p plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the MOP complex, but this role differs depending on whether the MOP is associated with docked vesicles or a fully formed membrane. These results suggest an architectural rearrangement of the MOP coincident with vesicle fusion...|$|R

The detergent, 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]- 1 -propane-sulfonate proved to be the most suitable and was used at 10 millimolar concentration, i. e. just above its critical micellar concentration. The presence of additional phospholipid (2 milligrams phosphatidylcholine per milliliter) and ATP (5 millimolar) improved the solubilization and/or reconstitution. The characteristics of the reconstituted system were {{similar to those of the}} {{plasma membrane}}-bound activity, including the apparent Km for Ca 2 + (5. 2 micromolar), inhibition by relatively high levels of vanadate (IC 50 = 500 micromolar) and lacking response to added calmodulin. The reconstituted transport system was very strongly inhibited by erythrosine B (IC 50 = 0. 01 micromolar) and had a low apparent Km for ATP (11. 4 micromolar). As in the plasma membrane vesicles, the protonophore carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone did not affect Ca 2 +-transport detectably in the reconstituted system. However, low levels of the Ca 2 +-ionophore A 23187 instantaneously discharged 90 % of the Ca 2 + associated with the vesicles, proving that it had been accumulated in the intravesicular volume in <b>soluble,</b> <b>freely</b> exchangeable form.

40|$|Abstract Background Mutations in {{superoxide}} dismutase 1 (SOD 1), which are one cause of familial {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (fALS), induce misfolding and aggregation of the protein. Misfolding can be detected by the binding of antibodies raised against peptide epitopes that are normally buried in the native conformation, shifts in solubility in non-ionic detergents, {{and the formation of}} macromolecular inclusions. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between detergent-insoluble and sedimentable forms of mutant SOD 1, forms of mutant SOD 1 with aberrantly accessible epitopes, and mutant protein in inclusions with the goal of defining the spectrum of misfolded states that mutant SOD 1 can adopt. Results Using combined approaches in cultured cell models, we demonstrate that a substantial fraction of mutant SOD 1 adopts a non-native conformation that remains <b>soluble</b> and <b>freely</b> mobile. We also show that mutant SOD 1 can produce multimeric assemblies of which some are insoluble in detergent and large enough to sediment by ultracentrifugation and some are large enough to detect visually. Three conformationally restricted antibodies were found to be useful in discriminating mal-folded forms of mutant SOD 1. An antibody termed C 4 F 6 displays properties consistent with recognition of <b>soluble,</b> <b>freely</b> mobile, mal-folded mutant SOD 1. An antibody termed SEDI, which recognizes C-terminal residues, detects larger inclusion structures as well as soluble misfolded entities. An antibody termed hSOD 1, which recognizes aa 24 - 36, detects an epitope shared by soluble non-natively folded WT and mutant SOD 1. This epitope becomes inaccessible in aggregates of mutant SOD 1. Conclusions Our studies demonstrate how different methods of detecting misfolding and aggregation of mutant SOD 1 reveal different forms of aberrantly folded protein. Immunological and biochemical methods can be used in combination to detect soluble and insoluble misfolded forms of mutant SOD 1. Our findings support the view that mutant SOD 1 can adopt multiple misfolded conformations with the potential that different structural variants mediate different aspects of fALS. </p...|$|R
