The <b>supplemental</b> <b>benefit</b> of angiotensin receptor blocker in hypertensive patients with stable heart failure using olmesartan (SUPPORT) trial investigates whether an additive treatment with an ARB, olmesartan, reduces the mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients with stable chronic heart failure. Methods and resultsThe SUPPORT trial is a prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint study. Between October 2006 and March 2010, 1147 stable CHF patients treated with evidence-based medications were successfully randomized to either olmesartan or control group. In the olmesartan group, the ARB was initiated at the dose of 5. 0 – 10 mg, and was then increased up to 40 mg/day, when possible. No ARBs were allowed in the control group. Primary outcome measure in the SUPPORT trial is the composite of all-cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and hospital admission due to worsening heart failure. The participants will be followed for at least 3 years until March 2013. ConclusionsThe SUPPORT trial will elucidate the <b>supplemental</b> <b>benefits</b> of an ARB, olmesartan, in hypertensive patients with CHF...|$|R
