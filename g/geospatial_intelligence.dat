[...] The school also offers 33 {{undergraduate and graduate}} certificates. With a number of interdisciplinary degree programs, its curriculum is designed to allow study that crosses traditional disciplinary lines and enable {{students to participate in}} collaborative research labs. In 2002 the UTD Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science was the first in the United States to offer an ABET-accredited B.S. degree in telecommunications engineering. UTD's Arts and Technology program is Texas's first comprehensive degree designed to merge computer science and engineering with creative arts and the humanities. In 2004 the School of Arts and Humanities introduced the Arts and Technology (ATEC) program with the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, and in 2008 a complementary major, Emerging Media and Communication (EMAC), was offered. In January 2007 the university offered the first doctoral degree in criminology in Texas. The School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences administers the degree. The Bioengineering department offers MS and PhD degrees in biomedical engineering in conjunction with programs at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and the University of Texas at Arlington. Geospatial Information Sciences is jointly offered with the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and with the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences (EPPS), which administers the degree. The EPPS program was the first from Texas admitted to the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science and offered the first master of science in geospatial information sciences in Texas.

There is an urgent need for an integrated view on the provision and use of these services for better governance and productivity. Developing an integrated view is challenging due to the dispersion of relevant data sets and the underlying complexity of increasingly interconnected infrastructure networks. Using a case study in New South Wales (Australia), we demonstrate how tools and processes in <b>Geospatial</b> Business <b>Intelligence</b> (Geo-BI) can be harnessed using a collective design approach to develop an integrated solution; the SMART Infrastructure Dashboard (SID).

40|$|With the {{requirements}} for high performance results in the today’s mobile, global, highly competitive, and technology-based business world, business professionals have to get supported by convenient mobile decision support systems (DSS). To give an improved support to mobile business professionals, {{it is necessary to}} go further than just allowing a simple remote access to a Business Intelligence platform. In this paper, the need for actual context-aware mobile <b>Geospatial</b> Business <b>Intelligence</b> (GeoBI) systems that can help capture, filter, organize and structure the user mobile context is exposed and justified. Furthermore, since capturing, structuring, and modeling mobile contextual information is still a research issue, a wide inventory of existing research work on context and mobile context is provided. Then, step by step, we methodologically identify relevant contextual information to capture for mobility purposes as well as for BI needs, organize them into context-dimensions, and build a hierarchical mobile GeoBI context model which (1) is geo-spatial-extended, (2) fits with human perception of mobility, (3) takes into account the local context interactions and information-sharing with remote contexts, and (4) matches with the usual hierarchical aggregated structure of BI data...|$|R

40|$|The {{size and}} {{dimensionality}} of available geospatial repositories increases every day, placing additional pressure on existing analysis tools, {{as they are}} expected to extract more knowledge from these databases. Most of these tools were created in a data poor environment and thus rarely address concerns of efficiency, dimensionality and automatic exploration. In addition, traditional statistical techniques present several assumptions that are not realistic in the geospatial data domain. An example of this is the statistical independence between observations required by most classical statistics methods, which conflicts with the well-known spatial dependence that exists in <b>geospatial</b> data. Artificial <b>intelligence</b> and data mining methods constitute an alternative to explore and extract knowledge from geospatial data, which is less assumption dependent. In this thesis, we study the possible adaptation of existing general-purpose data mining tools to geospatial data analysis. The characteristics of geospatial datasets seems to be similar in many ways with other aspatial datasets for which several data mining tools have bee...|$|R
40|$|Roads are of {{important}} elements of urban infrastructure which directly and crucially affect the life of people in cities. The criticality of the roads network in urban areas justifies the efforts made to use remotely sensed data especially High Resolution Satellite Imagery (HRSI) to generate fast and accurate knowledge about road networks and to update road maps. Besides, on the way towards inventing soft computation solutions for <b>geospatial</b> problems, Swarm <b>intelligence</b> approaches such as Ant Colony Optimization {{are known to be}} helpful as they hire the emergence from the collective behaviour of social animals to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper ACO solutions are inspected to propose a hand for road map updating using HRSI. First, image and map are overlaid and road elements in the image are extracted. Then, an engine for evaluation of these roads is invented on the basis of supervised classification. To add newly constructed roads to the map, some random seeds in the area are selected and possible candid connections are generated. These candid new roads are heuristically inspected using ACO algorithm and the proposed engine. The results are generated using GeoEye pansharpen images of a sub urban area located in the city of Tehran. Visual investigations show satisfying results and it is presumed to present more accurate results, enhancing ACO optimization, evaluation and extraction procedures. 1...|$|R
