The study shows persisting mortality <b>differentials</b> after 60 years of age. Over the 1960 - 65 and 1990 - 95 periods mortality <b>differentials</b> remained constant between non-manual upper classes and manual workers, while <b>differentials</b> have increased between the upper classes and the least skilled manual workers. Educational status {{has an impact on}} the mortality risks, independently from occupational status; the magnitude of its impact slightly changed over time.

Among {{both men and women}} they find substantial earnings <b>differentials</b> both between and within the white and visible-minority groupings. <b>Differentials</b> between whites and visible minorities suggest that the visible-minority category is a useful indicator of economic discrimination. <b>Differentials</b> within these groupings, however, suggest that it is only a rough indicator. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{explanations}} are given for why nominal or real returns differ across currencies: {{foreign exchange risk}} premia and systematic (rational) forecast errors. This study reexamines three parity conditions in international finance, uncovered interest parity, purchasing power parity, and real interest parity, to determine {{the relative importance of}} these two factors. The study develops joint tests of the three parity conditions by relating nominal and real interest <b>differentials</b> and inflation <b>differentials</b> to the same set of variables currently known to investors. The study tests parameter restrictions based on knowing that risk premiums only affect nominal and real interest <b>differentials,</b> but not inflation <b>differentials,</b> while systematic errors in forecasting exchange rates only affect nominal interest <b>differentials</b> and inflation <b>differentials,</b> but not real interest <b>differentials.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a <b>differential</b> analyzer, an analog computer that could solve <b>differential</b> equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order <b>differential</b> equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order <b>differential</b> equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the <b>differential</b> analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the <b>differential</b> analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the <b>differential</b> analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the <b>differential</b> analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E

The empirical studies cover four aspects: Big Four premium; price <b>differentials</b> among accounting firms with different sizes; audit fee <b>differentials</b> within Big Four; audit fee <b>differentials</b> between different industries.

25|$|The triple <b>differential</b> is a {{modification}} to the double <b>differential,</b> replacing the steering clutches {{with a single}} braked <b>differential</b> similar to controlled <b>differential.</b> This third <b>differential</b> produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double <b>differential</b> where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double <b>differential,</b> producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double <b>differential,</b> with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third <b>differential</b> dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|E

The role of a large set of fundamental macroeconomic variables that may have affected these devaluation expectations is investigated within a vector autoregressive (VAR) setting, by means of Granger-causality tests, impulse-response functions and variance decompositions. We find no evidence that fundamentals are more relevant to drift-adjusted devaluation risk than for unadjusted interest rate <b>differentials.</b> A significant impact of inflation, budget deficits, and unemployment becomes evident for almost all ERM-participants. ...|$|R
