In this problem, requests for some service to be performed appear at various locations over time, {{and we have a}} collection of k mobile servers which are capable of servicing these requests. When servicing a request, we incur a cost equal to the distance traveled by the dispatched server. The goal is to find a strategy for choosing which server to dispatch to each incoming request which keeps the average service cost as small as possible. In the model considered in this paper, the locations of service requests are drawn according to an IID random process. We show that, given a statistical description of this process, we can compute a simple decentralized state-feedback policy which achieves an average cost within a factor of two of the cost achieved by an optimal statefeedback policy.

Areas of concern have included traumatic stress, resources for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations and co-ordination of various intervention systems (Zakour, 1996). Disaster practice is arguably a reflection of the mission of social work itself (Zakour, 1996). A core and often neglected element of disaster recovery has been the rebuilding and community development phase. A review of the literature showed that social work has been less involved in this phase than in traumatic stress intervention and the coordination of relief efforts. Research shows that low-income and marginalized communities are likely to suffer a downward spiral of deterioration after a disaster (Morrow and Peacock, 1997). Sundet and Mermelstein (1996) analyzed the association between community characteristics before a disaster and the survival or failure after disaster of eight com-munities that experienced the Midwestern flood of 1993 in the USA.
