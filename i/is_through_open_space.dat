5000|$|Saksenaea vasiformis is an {{infectious}} fungus associated with cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions following trauma. It causes opportunistic infections as {{the entry of}} the fungus <b>is</b> <b>through</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> of cutaneous barrier ranging in severity from mild to severe or fatal. It is found in soils worldwide, but is considered as a rare human pathogen since only 38 cases were reported as of 2012. Saksenaea vasiformis usually fails to sporulate on the routine culture media, creating a challenge for early diagnosis, which is essential for a good prognosis. Infections are usually treated {{using a combination of}} amphotericin B and surgery. Saksenaea vasiformis {{is one of the few}} fungi known to cause necrotizing fasciitis or [...] "flesh-eating disease".|$|R

5000|$|Tuxen [...] "enjoyed {{success with}} {{conventional}} forms of design {{but he was}} also open to persuasion" [...] and new ideas. [...] His differing approaches to design and planning are evident in his 1914 [...] "right-angled subdivision design in Bittern, Victoria". The Bittern design was based on a grid system plan. In contrast, his design for the ‘Hill Top’ development in Mont Albert, a suburb of Melbourne, incorporated [...] "unusual size and shape, with an irregular streetscape". This example demonstrated Tuxen's movement away from the grid system, to the contemporary design approach of the early twentieth century. This new design embraced curved, radial and diagonal streets; the environment <b>was</b> celebrated <b>through</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> and parks, and civic buildings were placed in the centre of town.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} goshawk, a raptor, {{which used}} to winter on Palace grounds, gradually stayed for all seasons. Nosuri (Buteo japonicus) also stayed in the Palace. As a result, ducks and Oriental turtle doves decreased. The goshawk preyed mainly on jungle crows. In the 1950s, heron was hunted away because they damaged {{the trees in the}} Palace. Around 1975, the common kingfisher, the Japanese pygmy woodpecker, the Hakusekirei (Motacilla alba lugens) which is a kind of white wagtail, and the brown-eared bulbul have become sedentary birds on the Palace grounds. It is not unusual for birds to become urbanized, especially the common kingfisher. The route of common kingfisher to the Palace is being investigated, and was thought to <b>be</b> <b>through</b> green <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> in neighboring Tokyo areas. In the 1950s, the colonies of herons and great cormorant disappeared in the Palace, as a result of deteriorating living conditions.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are minimal}} {{restrictions}} of {{the depiction of}} non-sexual nudity, which is allowed in even U and PG certificate films (for example, The Simpsons Movie—which was given a PG-13 rating in the US - was given a PG certificate in the UK, leaving the sequence where Bart skateboards naked through town and his genitals <b>are</b> shown <b>through</b> an <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in a hedge unedited), but scenes of (simulated) sexual activity are limited to more restricted certificates.

[...] However, for some years depictions of real sex have been allowed in 18 certificate videos intended as educational, and in recent years a number of works such as Patrice Chéreau's Intimacy and Michael Winterbottom's 9 Songs, which feature apparently unsimulated sex have been passed uncut for theatrical release.|$|R
5000|$|The {{orthogonal}} geometry serves two purposes: a) {{to enhance}} the navigability of the network structure particularly at the district and regional scale. This is important at car speeds where decisions about destinations and turns {{have to be made}} promptly. b) to maintain a good level of safety at road intersections, as recommended by traffic engineering manuals. The grid's second essential characteristic, connectivity, <b>is</b> recaptured <b>through</b> a third element that completes the [...] "system" [...] - pedestrian-only connectors between regular streets that are intended for all movement modes. These connectors (paths) <b>are</b> typically routed <b>through</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> that occupy central points in a neighbourhood cell. Thus the neighbourhood street network comprises a mixture of streets; some pedestrian dominant and others car dominant. A fourth element is the nested hierarchy of streets that distinguishes between connectivity and permeability at the neighbourhood level. This idea reflects the fact the longer the linked destinations the higher the level of mobility must be. A dendrite configuration, such as a river, takes progressively wider expanses of land to accommodate the flow. A nested hierarchy on the other hand distributes the flow at each volume level to alternative paths. The complete system, though it may appear unfamiliar, is composed of entirely familiar and extensively used elements in contemporary development.|$|R
50|$|The Federation Bells on {{the middle}} terrace, {{commissioned}} in 2001, are a collection of inverted bells comprising nine different design types of various sizes from half a kilogram to 1.2 tonnes mounted on steel poles. The result is not unlike a collection of church bells, however they <b>are</b> spread <b>through</b> an <b>open</b> <b>space</b> rather than being confined to a tower, allowing people to walk between them. There are thirty-nine bells in total, spanning 3 octaves. Tuned in the just intonation system, the bells are controlled by computer, and play an ever increasing range of compositions, some commissioned, some submitted by the public. This sound sculpture plays three times a day. The bells were designed by Neil McLachlan and Anton Hassel. In 2010, Spring Innovations were asked to design a new dynamic playing system that was publicly launched on 1 April 2012. Since then the bells have played over 11 million times annually with near complete reliability. They now monitor themselves and report on their playing status daily. Members of the public can down load a player from www.federationbells.com.au and compose and submit their own works online. Circus Oz has incorporated a live event with the Bells for their 2013 season.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to show the}} emergence of a new ideological trend within the global field of resistance against the corporate-led globalization. This ideological trend, coined here the alter-globalization trend, is ideal-typically constructed in terms of its associated mode of social thought. The newly developed perspectives and cognitive transformations inside the global field of resistance convey a new mode of in-praxis thought, named here accommodative cognition. This heralds the formation of alternative principles for creating emancipatory knowledges and flexible solidarities. The paper draws on certain discursive evidence from the alter-globalization trend to show that the complexity of globalizing society and contemporary collective action <b>is</b> realized <b>through</b> the <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> of dialogue and dispute introduced by the movement. This has resulted in the emergence of intellectual demands for transcending contradictions that are rooted in the post- 1970 s disputes between modernist and post-modernist, and materialist and post-materialist thoughts. Two other features of this new mode of cognition are: (1) a growing inclination to cut across incompatible conceptions of social polarities (i. e. around issues like class, gender, race, cultural identity, ethnicity, nationality and sexual orientation) in establishing a flexible solidarity based on accommodating the Other’s interest and identity into the process of affirming the Self; and (2) understanding the complexities of globalization in terms of its structural unevenness, contradictions and multidimensionality...|$|R
40|$|Urban environments can {{satisfy the}} habitat {{requirements}} {{of a variety of}} wildlife species. It has been shown that urban residents enjoy wildlife near their homes. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine if urban wildlife distributions could be predicted by metropolitan planning variables, so that opportunities for urban residents to enjoy wildlife near their homes could be enhanced. Three hundred one random points, stratified into seven zones, based on intensity of urbanization and vegetation type, were chosen in the Tucson metropolitan study area. Birds were censused with the variable circular plot method. Sign of selected mammal species were searched for at a subset of these points. Native bird species diversity declined steadily as housing density increased. The study area still supports a high diversity of native species because of the high levels of natural <b>open</b> <b>space</b> still found intermixed with residential development. The amount of land covered in residential development and the amount of paloverde-saguaro vegetation types with associated riparian areas were the best predictors of native bird species diversity. The data also suggest that plant cover created by man-maintained vegetation is not as attractive to native bird species as naturally occurring vegetation. Ground nesters and insectivores tended to drop out at higher housing densities while seed-eaters were retained. Three patterns of avian response to variables describing the intensity of urbanization and the amount of natural vegetation emerged: urban, suburban, and exurban. Native Sonoran desert birds appear to be highly sensitive to urbanization, as minor increases in residential housing densities lead to declines in diversity. Mammal species appear to be most sensitive to the size of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> areas and fragmentation and isolation of natural lands. Metropolitan planning processes may be limited in their ability to retain high species diversities. The impacts of urbanization on wildlife diversities may <b>be</b> mitigated <b>through</b> sensitive <b>open</b> <b>space</b> planning...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} housing complex uses a {{slightly}} rising terrain. In {{the areas where}} the terrain rises almost steeply is not design any building, because {{there would be a}} problem with the traffic transportation. Urban solution is a bit simple. Communication passes through the center of area and serves as a residential street with a visual axis on the steeply rising terrain. The proposed development is offset from existing homes on the street pasture. The urban solution designs terraced houses which is similar as in street Hlouskova and they are oriented north-south side. Two types of terraced houses, various widths and lengths, together form an interesting complex that does not look monotonously and endlessly. On the other site there are apartment buildings. Their ground plan is almost square and location is influenced by the shape of the area with the rising terrain along the alley. Apartment buildings include a parking garage accessible from the road. The concept of a terraced house is based on the intermediate atrium that provides contact between street, house and garden and is becoming the center of the house. Entry <b>is</b> <b>through</b> an <b>open</b> parking <b>space</b> on the street. The visual axis continues atrium to the garden. Apartment building uses an east-west orientation. The house is divided into eastern and western part. The eastern part is about half floor lower which uses a gradually rising terrain. On each landing is its own entry into the apartment thanks to this spatial arrangement. The house has 6 apartments, each apartment has a loggia that provides contact with the outside. The staircase is located {{in the middle of the}} house, the last flight of stairs leads to the walkable part of the roof, where there is a terrace with vegetation. Terrace is oriented to the west and it serves to entire apartment building...|$|R

A possible alternative {{is to create a}} subgraph within the <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> This paper assesses this approach and investigates its implications for routing engines. A number of algorithms (Grid, Spider-Grid, Visibility, Delaunay, Voronoi, Skeleton) have been evaluated by four different criteria: (i) Number of additional created graph edges, (ii) additional graph creation time, (iii) route computation time, (iv) routing quality. We show that each algorithm has advantages and disadvantages depending on the use case. We identify the algorithms Visibility with a reduced number of edges in the subgraph and Spider-Grid with a large grid size to be a good compromise in many scenarios...|$|R
