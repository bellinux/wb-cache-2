40|$|The {{electronic}} {{band structure}} of many compounds, e. g., carbon-based structures, can exhibit essentially no dispersion. Models of electrons in flat-band lattices define nonperturbative strongly correlated problems by default. We construct {{a set of}} Jastrow-correlated ansatz wavefunctions to capture the low energy physics of interacting particles in flat bands. We test the ansatz in a simple Coulomb model of spinless electrons in a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>ribbon.</b> We find that the wavefunction accurately captures the ground state in a transition from a crystal to a uniform quantum liquid. © 2011 American Physical Society. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{theoretically}} address spin chain analogs of the Kitaev quantum spin {{model on}} the honeycomb lattice. The emergent quantum spin-liquid phases or Anderson resonating valence-bond (RVB) states can be understood, {{as an effective}} model, in terms of p-wave superconductivity and Majorana fermions. We derive a generalized phase diagram for the two-leg ladder system with tunable interaction strengths between chains allowing us to vary {{the shape of the}} lattice (from square to <b>honeycomb</b> <b>ribbon</b> or brickwall ladder). We evaluate the winding number associated with possible emergent (topological) gapless modes at the edges. In the Az phase, {{as a result of the}} emergent Z 2 gauge fields and π-flux ground state, one may build spin- 1 / 2 (loop) qubit operators by analogy to the toric code. In addition, we show how the intermediate gapless B phase evolves in the generalized ladder model. For the brick-wall ladder, the B phase is reduced to one line, which is analyzed through perturbation theory in a rung tensor product states representation and bosonization. Finally, we show that doping with a few holes can result in the formation of hole pairs and leads to a mapping with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in polyacetylene; a superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition for these hole pairs is accessible, as well as related topological properties...|$|E

40|$|Using cluster {{perturbation}} theory we calculate Greenʼs functions, quasi-particle energies and topological invariants for interacting electrons on a 2 Dhoneycomb lattice, with intrinsic spin–orbit coupling and on-site e–e interaction.

40|$|We explore {{electron}} transport {{properties in}} <b>honeycomb</b> lattice <b>ribbons</b> with zigzag edges coupled to two semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes. The calculations {{are based on}} the tight-binding model and the Green's function method, which numerically compute the conductance-energy and current-voltage characteristics as functions of the lengths and widths of the ribbons. Our numerical results predict that for such a ribbon an energy gap always appears in the conductance spectrum across the energy E= 0. With the increase {{of the size of the}} ribbon, the gap gradually decreases but it never vanishes.

40|$|This {{study will}} present the Experimental, {{numerical}} and analytical characterizations of composite sandwich structures needed to optimize structure design. In this study, the effects of varying <b>honeycomb</b> core <b>ribbon</b> orientation and varying face sheet thickness’s have on the flexural behavior of honeycomb sandwich structures was investigated. Honeycomb sandwich panels were constructed using Hexcel 6367 A 250 - 5 H carbon fiber face sheets and Hexcel Nomex HRH- 10 - 1 / 8 - 5 honeycomb cores. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials were discovered experimentally using ASTM standards and theoretical models using honeycomb mechanics and classical beam and plate theory are described. A failure mode map for loading under three point bending is developed from previous works by Triantafillou and Gibson 26, showing the dependence of failure mode on face sheet to core thickness and <b>honeycomb</b> core <b>ribbon</b> orientation. Beam specimens are tested {{with the effects of}} <b>Honeycomb</b> core <b>ribbon</b> orientation and unequal face sheet thickness’s examined. Experimental data sufficiently agrees with theoretical predictions. A finite element model was developed in ABAQUS/CAE to validate experimental and analytical analysis and produced agreeable results. Optimal bending stiffness and strength with respect to minimum weight was analyzed. The results reveal an important role core ribbon orientation has in a sandwich beam’s bending behavior, and design of unequal ply count face sheets can produce higher stiffness to weight ratios than conventional symmetric sandwich structures of similar weight when subjected to a single static load...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with an {{additional}} inversion-symmetry-breaking term. Using the topological Hamiltonian approach, we calculate the Z_ 2 invariant of the system as function of spin-orbit coupling, Hubbard interaction U, and inversion-symmetry-breaking on-site potential. The phase diagram calculated in that way shows that, on the one hand, a large term of the latter kind destroys the topological non-trivial state. On the other hand, however, this inversion-symmetry-breaking field can enhance the topological state, since for moderate values {{the transition from the}} non-trivial topological to the trivial Mott insulator is pushed to larger values of interaction U. This feature of an enhanced topological state is also found on <b>honeycomb</b> <b>ribbons.</b> With inversion symmetry, the edge of the zigzag ribbon is magnetic for any value of U. This magnetic moment destroys the gapless edge mode. Lifting inversion symmetry allows for a finite region in interaction strength U below which gapless edge modes exist.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dependence of}} band dispersion of the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) edge states in the Kane-Mele model on crystallographic orientation of the edges. Band structures of the one-dimensional <b>honeycomb</b> lattice <b>ribbons</b> show {{the presence of the}} QSHE edge states at all orientations of the edges given sufficiently strong spin-orbit interactions. We find that the Fermi velocities of the QSHE edge-state bands increase monotonically when the edge orientation changes from zigzag (chirality angle θ = 0 ^∘) to armchair (θ = 30 ^∘). We propose a simple analytical model to explain the numerical results. Comment: to appear in Phys. Status Solidi RRL, Focus Issue on Topological Insulator...|$|R
40|$|We address {{electron}} transport in <b>honeycomb</b> lattice <b>ribbons</b> with armchair edges {{attached to}} two semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes within the tight-binding framework. Here we present numerically the conductance-energy and current-voltage characteristics as {{functions of the}} length and width of the ribbons. Our theoretical results predict that for a ribbon with much smaller length and width, so-called a nanoribbon, {{a gap in the}} conductance spectrum appears across the energy E= 0. While, this gap decreases gradually with the increase {{of the size of the}} ribbon, and eventually it almost vanishes. This reveals a transformation from the semiconducting to the conducting material, and it becomes much more clearly visible from our presented current-voltage characteristics.

40|$|We study quantum {{transport}} in <b>honeycomb</b> lattice <b>ribbons</b> {{with either}} armchair or zigzag edges. The ribbons are coupled to semi-infinite linear chains {{serving as the}} input and output leads and we use a tight-binding Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor hops. For narrow ribbons we find transmission gaps for both types of edges. The center of the gap is at {{the middle of the}} band in ribbons with armchair edges. This symmetry is due to a property satisfied by the matrices in the resulting linear problem. In ribbons with zigzag edges the gap center is displaced {{to the right of the}} middle of the band. We also find transmission oscillations and resonances within the transmitting region of the band for both types of edges. Extending the length of a ribbon does not affect the width of the transmission gap, as long as the ribbon's length is longer than a critical value when the gap can form. Increasing the width of the ribbon, however, changes the width of the gap. In armchair edges the gap is not well-defined because of the appearance of transmission resonances while in zigzag edges the gap width systematically shrinks as the width of the ribbon is increased. We also find only evanescent waves within the gap and both evanescent and propagating waves in the transmitting regions. Comment: 7 pages, added data on longer ribbon...|$|R
40|$|Polymerization of {{a series}} of novel acetylenic {{monomers}} bearing different hydrophilic entities such as ethylene glycols (1), amino acids (2), saccharides (3), and nucleosides (4) has been studied. The monomers can be successfully polymerized by Rh-based complexes, but not by metathesis catalysts such as WCl 6 and MoCl 5. 1 H NMR spectroscopy revealed strong signals characteristic of cis olefinic protons of the polymers, indicative of their high stereoregularities. Such signals, however, became unclear (broader) for the amino acid-containing polyacetylenes when less polar solvents like chloroform, dichloromethane, were used, demonstrating that their polymer chains were folded and their molecular motions were hence restricted by internal hydrogen bonding. Polyacetylene is a symmetric chain of conjugated macromolecule, whose chain symmetry can, however, be broken by external and internal perturbations, generating spirally rotating molecular wires. The external approach involves the use of asymmetric force field and interactive complexing agents, while the internal one involves the covalent attachment of stereogenic pendants to the conjugated backbone at the molecular level. Incorporation of above naturally occurring building blocks (2 - 4) into the polyacetylene structure therefore results in the formation of not only amphiphilic but also optically active polymers, whose chain helicity can be continuously and reversibly tuned by simple external stimuli such as solvent, pH, temperature, and additive. Such tuned behaviors have been fully imaged in their corresponding circular dichroism activities and optical rotations, illustrating that stabilization of their single-handed helical conformations relies on intra- and inter-chain hydrogen bonds and is affected by bulkiness of the pendant groups of the macromolecular chains. The amphiphilic polyacetylenes, in response to the changes in their environments, self-associate into robust organizational morphologies reminiscent of natural hierarchical structures such as helix, sphere, twisted cable, twisted ribbon, vesicle, tubule, twisted tubule, hairpin loop, extended fibril, coiling <b>ribbon,</b> <b>honeycomb</b> pattern, and mollusk shape. Some of the structures have been rarely reported in scientific literature. AFM and TEM observations revealed co-existence of the vesicular and nanotubular structures, strongly supporting that formation of the tubules resembles the biological architectural process, as resulted from coalescence of the vesicles. Further variation of the tubular structure promoted the formation of multi-stranded helical tubes by winding up the single-stranded nanotubules. The ethylene glycol-containing amphiphiles are capable of forming micellar structures, driving crystal growth of carbazole molecules to form unique intriguing morphologies depending on the structure of the pendant groups. Biological studies revealed that the amino acid-containing polyacetylenes are generally biocompatible with HeLa cells without serious cytotoxicity effects up to a dosage of 22. 24 μg/cm 2. Growth of the HeLa cells can be stimulated by the addition of a small amount of a monosaccharide-containing polyacetylene...|$|R
