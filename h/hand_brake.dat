5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
25|$|Locomotives and {{carriages}} {{each have}} a <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> which operates brake blocks that clasp drums {{on either side of}} the pinions. On the steam locomotives the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is applied manually; two identical <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> levers are fitted, one for the driver and one for the fireman. On the diesel locomotives, the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is applied by a powerful spring and held off by a hydraulic system.|$|E
25|$|No brakes, {{other than}} a <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> {{actuated}} by a large hand-wheel, were fitted to No.42. This, the fireman was expected to work under the driver's commands.|$|E
25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} <b>hand</b> <b>brakes.</b> Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> alone would hold the train.|$|R

25|$|The cab {{controls}} {{were similar to}} those on No.42 except that a steam brake was provided in addition to the <b>hand</b> <b>brake.</b> The regulator handle was of the normal vertical type but later a long horizontal piece was secured to it, enabling it to be operated from either side.|$|E

2500|$|Section 112 of the Canadian Rail Operating Rules states [...] "when {{equipment}} is left {{at any point}} {{a sufficient number of}} <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> must be applied to prevent it from moving" [...] and [...] "the effectiveness of the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> must be tested” before relying on their retarding force. The engineer tests the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> by seeing if the train budges when trying to push and pull the train with locomotive power. If a train is left on an incline, the number of handbrakes needed to hold the train increases. It takes 2–3 minutes per car to set the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes.</b> The track from Nantes to Lac-Mégantic is downhill on a 1.2% grade. Nantes is [...] above sea level, Lac Mégantic is [...] lower at [...] The MMA claimed that its braking policy required the activation of <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> on the five locomotives and 11 freight cars, or 20.5% of the total train. However, the TSB confirmed evidence in the criminal charges citing MMA procedures requiring nine brakes to hold a 70–79 car train. The TSB concluded that a minimum of 17 and possibly as many as 26 <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> would have been needed to secure the train, depending on the amount of force with which they had been applied. Transport Canada does not validate the special instructions of a railway company or give any specific guidance on how many brakes must be applied for parked freight trains. While Transport Canada had repeatedly reprimanded MMA from 2004 to 2009 and in 2011 and 2012 for violations of CROR Section 112 handbrake requirements on parked trains in Nantes, no fines had been issued for the infractions.|$|R
50|$|The trucks without <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> had {{a length}} oover buffers of 6,600 mm and, until 1917, a {{wheelbase}} of 3,000 mm and unladen weight of 9.5 tonnes. The wagons with <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> had an enclosed brakeman's cab, Kunze-Knorr brakes, a {{length over buffers}} of 7,300 mm, unladen weight of 10.3 tonnes and, until 1917, a wheelbase of 3,300 mm. From 1918 the wheelbase for both variants was specified to 3,500 mm.|$|R
25|$|For the 1983 model year, the Volkswagen {{received}} new {{front seats}} with adjustable headrests, already seen in cars such the Caribe and the Atlantic. A newly added item was the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> {{light on the}} dashboard. 1983 also introduced a limited edition Aubergine Metallic paint scheme. This also featured its wheels painted to match the body color and seats upholstered in tweed Grey and Aubergine.|$|E
25|$|For {{increased}} safety, each {{vehicle is}} also fitted {{with an automatic}} brake that is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a specific speed, such as a carriage running away or a locomotive engine failure. This system slows the train down using the same brake blocks and drums as the <b>hand</b> <b>brake.</b> The running speed at which the automatic brake comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|E
25|$|New {{cars were}} {{purchased}} from Milnes Voss for these extensions, numbered 106 to 115, and they entered service on 28 March. These vehicles were a new departure for Nottingham, having normal staircases and top-covered bodies. The trucks were Mountain and Gibson 2IEM type, having M equipment and controllers. In {{addition to the}} usual slipper brake, <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> and rheostatic brake, they had a magnetic runback brake. All had with wooden block slipper brakes, as were several of the earlier cars, and a fitter had {{to be kept in}} the Market Place fitting new blocks every two or three journeys for they quickly wore out, particularly on the Mapperley service.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one <b>hand</b> <b>brake.</b> This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Which if {{there would have been a}} two-man crew the crew would have been able to perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the hand brakes will hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.|$|E
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, <b>hand</b> <b>brake,</b> shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E
500|$|Launched in 2006 after GM's 2003 {{abandonment}} {{of their last}} European rear-drive sedan, the Opel Omega, the VE is the first Commodore model designed entirely in Australia, {{as opposed to being}} based on an adapted Opel-sourced platform. Given this and high public expectations of quality, the budget in developing the car reportedly exceeded [...] Underpinned by the new Holden developed GM Zeta platform, the VE features more sophisticated independent suspension all round and near-even 50:50 weight distribution, leading to improved handling. Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model. However, a new six-speed GM 6L80-E automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants, replacing the old four-speed automatic now relegated to base models. The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs, such as a symmetrical centre console that houses a flush-fitting <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> lever to facilitate its conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega, along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 (discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand).|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> location or add an extra hydraulic <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually all {{railroad}} {{rolling stock}} {{is equipped with}} manually operated mechanical <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> devices that set and release the brakes. [...] Most of these involve a chain linked to the brake rigging, most often at the brake cylinder, that when tightened pull the piston out against the releasing springs, thus applying the brakes on the car (if {{there is only one}} brake cylinder per car) or bogie (if there is more than once cylinder per car). [...] Newer locomotives have electric systems that simply place an electric motor in place of the chain winding mechanism. [...] This brake acts independent of the action of the automatic air brakes, which function collectively when coupled in a train and are {{under the control of the}} locomotive driver / engineer.|$|E
2500|$|In road vehicles, {{the parking}} brake, also called <b>hand</b> <b>brake,</b> {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. Parking brakes on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|E
50|$|The car {{sat on a}} U-profile pressed-steel chassis with rigid axles and semi-elliptical leaf springing. In 1922 it {{was offered}} only as an open-topped four-seater. The {{mechanically}} linked foot and <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> both operated directly against the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{models of}} the Strika were fitted with a back pedal brake in {{addition}} to <b>hand</b> <b>brakes.</b> This feature was omitted from later models manufactured after approximately 1978. Known production colours are flame red, lime green, black, and silver.|$|R
25|$|Manual <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> {{serve to}} keep a piece of rolling stock {{stationary}} {{after it has been}} spotted in a rail yard or at a customer for unloading or loading. They are also used to secure a parked train from inadvertent movement, especially while unmanned.|$|R
2500|$|The car {{was fitted}} with a purpose built 18.3-litre V12 engine based on a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and Sunbeam Arab aero engines. [...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by {{a complex set of}} 16 gears {{from the front of the}} crankshaft - a very similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per bank of cylinders. A 4-speed transmission initially drove a back axle with differential with a shaft drive rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple crown wheel and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a foot brake acting on the transmission and a <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> on the rear drums. Suspension was also typical, with half-elliptic springs all round damped by Andre Hartford friction shock absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955 the Oldsmobile 98 again had {{a longer}} {{wheelbase}} than the 88. Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel molfings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, {{front and rear}} floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam rubber seat cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring, and windshield washer. Upholstery choices were covert and pattern cloth, leather and pattern cloth, leather and nylon, and leather and dimple leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The optional air conditioning unit {{was moved to the}} engine bay instead of the trunk. The turning diameter was 43ft. The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E

50|$|In {{comparison}} with the existing state railway wagons, the cradle wagon (Drehschemelwagen), Class A5, had a longer wheelbase of 4,500 mm and was a new design. These wagons, used for the transport of timber, had eight stanchions and a rotating cradle that pivoted on a flat steel ring in {{the floor of the}} flat bed. All wagons built between 1913 and 1925 had a loading length of 8,000 mm, a loading width of 2,500 mm, a payload of 15 tonnes and a pointed underframe. The wagons without <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> had a length over buffers of 9,300 mm, and their unladen weight was 9.5 tonnes. Wagons with <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> had a length over buffers of 10,030 mm and an unladen weight of 10 tonnes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engineer}} {{left the}} lead locomotive, #5017, running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} manual <b>hand</b> <b>brakes.</b> [...] The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on during the test; this gave the false impression that the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> alone could hold the train. [...] The engineer then contacted the rail traffic controller in Farnham, Quebec, to advise that the train was secure. Next, the engineer contacted the rail traffic controller in Bangor, Maine to report that the lead locomotive had experienced mechanical difficulties throughout the trip and that excessive black and white smoke was coming from its smoke stack. Expecting the smoke to settle, they agreed {{to deal with the}} situation the following morning.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{the line}} {{suffered}} a severe reduction in its passenger service owing to the bus competition and also the difficulty in running sufficient coal trains to clear the collieries as, the hoppers all being non-air, much time was occupied in applying and releasing <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> en route.|$|R
