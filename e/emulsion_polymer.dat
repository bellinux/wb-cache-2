The emulsions are usually opaque, milky fluids. However, there are also microemulsions, where the droplets of the hydrophobic phase are substantially smaller. Microemulsions provide the advantage of increased ability of smaller particles to penetrate into the fibers. Manufactures often use a mixture of cationic and non-ionic surfactants as an emulsifier.

Both show great advantages, especially in repair and rehabilitation. The work reported here, however, deals with polymer modified fiber reinforced cement based composites (PM-FRC) that is, combined used of fibers and polymers in the same system. This paper reports the quantitative study of all the three additives each taken with three settings, namely, steel fiber (1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 %), acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> (1. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 4. 0 %) and silica fume (5. 0 %, 6. 0 % and 8. 0 %). The other two control variables were chosen as water-cement ratio (0. 42, 0. 50 and 0. 60) and aging (3, 7 and 28 days). In this study, steel fiber reinforced polymer modified concrete (SFRPMC) was produced {{with the addition of}} acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> (< 4 %) into steel fiber reinforced concrete which enhance the workability, strength and thermal properties. The unique properties of steel fiber qualify it to be the best option as reinforcement in acrylic polymer cement composite. However, uniform dispersion is the biggest challenge in generating a composite with an optimum performance. Hence, acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> and silica fume with different percentages was used {{to improve the quality of}} steel fiber reinforced concrete. In this study, we have used a comprehensive approach known as Design of Experimental (DoE) which had been applied efficiently from the material formulation and processing stage until the material characterization. Through verification experiment, the compressive strength had increased by as much as 59 % compared to control concrete specimen. To optimize other mechanical properties such as flexural strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, the L 9 array method was used. Variant analysis and average analysis were then used to get the optimum formulation and through the X-ray diffraction analysis, the dispersion of acrylic polymer is slightly improved when combined with steel fiber reinforced concrete. From morphology observation, the dispersion of steel fiber with acrylic polymer addition showed a better uniformed dispersion in SFRPMC. Through thermal analysis, optimum specimen was proven to own good thermal stability than the other specimens. Steel fiber reinforced acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> modified concrete (SFRPMC) were produced based on the significant parameters suggested by Taguchi Analysis that was performed earlier. SFRPMC had improved the dispersion of steel fiber and acrylic polymer in matrix composite due to the presence of a few functional groups of elements from different materials, as observed through the morphology examination through SEMEDX analysis. Synergistic effect between the fibers and the polymer were observed in most of the composites as long as suitable polymer dosages were used. It is concluded that a high performance composites with 2. 5 % acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer,</b> 8 % silica fume, 1. 5 % steel fiber and water-cement ratio 0. 50 at 28 days curing could be a promising material for both structural and repair purpose...|$|E
40|$|Acetylation of wood imparts {{moisture}} durability, decay resistance, and {{dimensional stability}} to wood; however, making durable adhesive bonds with acetylated wood {{can be more}} difficult than with unmodified wood. The usual {{explanation is that the}} acetylated surface has fewer hydroxyl groups, resulting in a harder-to-wet surface and in fewer hydrogen bonds between wood and adhesive. This concept was evaluated using four different adhesives (resorcinol–formaldehyde, <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> isocyanate, epoxy, and melamine–formaldehyde) with unmodified wood, acetylated wood, and acetylated wood that had been planed. Strikingly, acetylation did not hinder adhesive bonds with a waterborne resorcinol–formaldehyde adhesive that bonded equally well to both unmodified and acetylated yellow poplar. An epoxy adhesive bonded better to the acetylated wood than to the unmodified wood, in contrast to an <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> isocyanate, which gave less durable bonds to acetylated than to unmodified wood. Planing of the acetylated wood surface prior to bonding reduced bond durability for the epoxy adhesive and increased the amount of surface hydroxyl groups, as measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of the trifluoroacetic anhydride-treated wood. These experiments showed that wood modification is useful in understanding wood-adhesive interactions, in addition to determining how to develop adhesives for acetylated woods...|$|E

40|$|Water-borne and emulsifier-free {{coatings}} {{have attracted}} academic and industrial interests {{because they are}} environmentally-friendly. The water barrier properties are being developed, but it is hypothesized that removal of surfactant will improve the barrier properties. In this work, water transport and sorption in acrylate copolymer coatings deposited from colloidal dispersions (emulsion polymers and secondary emulsion polymers) and from solution in an organic solvent were investigated in order to compare the water transport and sorption for the different materials and to identify the important factors, including the presence of boundaries between particles {{and the presence of}} surfactants. Solution polymer films were found to have no particle boundaries and to be more homogenous in structure compared to the other types of films. They sorbed the least amount of water from both vapour and liquid. Secondary <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> films sorbed less amount of water than the <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> films of similar chemical composition. It was found that the increase of sorbed water content in the emulsion films can be ascribed to the hydrophilic nature of the surfactants that stay at the particle boundaries, enabling the water transport. Hence, after being dialyzed, the <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> films were found to adsorb more water, probably due to poor film formation (particle coalescence). It was concluded that dissolving the particle boundaries in <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> films (by casting from organic solvent) reduced the uptake of water. We used the technique of NMR relaxometry to find that there were three 1 H peaks in the different regions of the T 2 spectra for films after soaking in water. These three peaks correspond to different environments: molecularly dissolved water (and mobile polymer); interfacial water; and water in voids or channels. It was found that the water environment and the extent of confinement correlate with the optical transmission through the film. A greater volume fraction of scatterers (mobile water in voids or pockets) and larger scatterers led to a loss of the optical transparency that is usually not desired in coatings applications. The water vapour diffusion through all of the films was Fickian, as indicated by a sufficient regression to the experimental data over a series of water activities ranging from 0 to 0. 9. In all cases, the diffusion coefficients (D) decreased with increasing water activities. The D seemed to have marginal differences between the various samples, indicating the removal of boundaries has limited effects. D is more strongly dependent on the water activities, and hence also on the sorbed water content. Without surfactants, a smaller diffusion coefficient was found for the secondary emulsion film. This result means that the presence of surfactant speeds the diffusion of water vapour molecules. Comparing the water uptake results, the equilibrium sorption of water vapour (100...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis comprises three studies dealing with water-based flexography on polymer-coated boards, {{which have been}} presented in the five papers included {{at the end of}} the thesis. The first study (covered in three papers) presents results from characterisation of a matrix of water-based inks with respect to their rheology, surface tension, wetting, and fulltone printing performance on PE-coated board. The commercial water-based inks used vary in type of pigment and acrylic vehicle, and in pigment/vehicle mixing proportions. For all mixing proportions, the inks were shear thinning, with viscosity increasing strongly with content of solution (versus <b>emulsion)</b> <b>polymer</b> in the vehicle. Increasing amount of solution polymer also gave the indirect consequence of lower surface tension values. The wet ink amount transferred to the board and the resulting print uniformity responded sensitively to ink formulation and could be correlated to the corresponding changes in these two ink properties. Transferred amount correlated well with ink plastic viscosity and static surface tension, exhibiting a maximum at intermediate values of both. Print mottle decreased with increasing content of solution polymer, principally due to the associated increase in low-shear viscosity and decreased surface tension, both serving to reduce substrate dewetting. In the second study, the effect of corona discharge treatment of PE-coated board on its surface chemistry and print resistance properties was evaluated. The increase in total surface energy, due to its polar component, with increasing corona level was strongly correlated to surface oxidation fraction from XPS. AFM revealed oxidised material nano-mounds, which increased in size and substrate coverage with corona level. Wet rub resistance (with water) first increased for lower corona dosages before decreasing at higher dosages. This worsened water resistance at higher dosages is presumably due to the oxidised material dissolved and dispersed in the ink film. The third study presents results from another set of water-based acrylic inks printed on boards coated with PE, OPP and PP. Print quality and resistance properties, though dependent on the polymer type, were strongly influenced by the choice of <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> and presence of silicone additive in the vehicle, with corona treatment level playing a lesser role. The <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymer</b> giving best resistance performance was generally found to give poorest press performance and visual appearance. Again the trends could be understood in terms of wet ink surface tension (versus substrate surface energy), dictating print uniformity, and dry print surface energy (and swellability), dictating resistance properties.
