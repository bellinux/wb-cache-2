50|$|The brass boiler {{is fired}} by a brass {{cylindrical}} three wick meths burner. It has a safety valve {{and a separate}} <b>filler</b> <b>plug</b> and overflow plug and a dummy chimney. Unlike the 13/1, it has no whistle. This is strange as all the other Cyldon models do have whistles. The copper steam pipe exits {{from the bottom of}} the boiler inside the firebox, thus getting a very small degree of superheat.|$|E

50|$|The mine has a {{slightly}} domed pressure plate made from flexible plastic with a raised 6 spoke wagon wheel pattern on top. Type 72 has a telescopic carrying handle molded {{into the bottom of}} the mine and a large diameter <b>filler</b> <b>plug</b> on the side just above the handle position. The mine has a crimp around the top edge where the mine body meets the pressure plate. The mine contains 5.4 kg of 50:50 RDX/TNT and is actuated when pressure of 300 kg deforms the flexible plastic pressure plate long enough to release the cocked striker fuze. When the pressure plate is moved approximately 9 mm downwards it exerts pressure on the fuze. If fuzed with the T-72 clear plastic-cased blast resistant fuze, pressure on the top of the fuze will depress the casing which will revolve due to the depression of the spring which is attached to the casing. The revolution is controlled by lugs on the inner fuze assembly which fit in grooves in the fuze casing. When the fuze casing is revolved and depressed sufficiently, the two retaining balls to will fall away in groove in the outer casing, which releases the striker. The striker is driven down by the spring, initiating the detonator, which in turn initiates the booster and the main charge. The mine is blast resistant since rapid depression of the fuze will push the fuze casing straight down without any revolution. The lugs on the inner fuze assembly will then slide into vertical groves instead of the diagonal ones. The striker retaining balls will then be prevented from coming in line with the groves in the outer casing and the striker will not be released. Instead the pressure plate will bounce back into its original position.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} model year (2004), only the coupe was offered (with no trim levels), {{equipped}} quite similarly to the next year's Limited model. In model year 2005, there were two models available; Coupe and Roadster, each with three trim levels: Base (with fewer amenities), Limited, and SRT-6 (supercharged). There was an SE Roadster model (essentially a base model) in 2006-2007 available only in Blaze Red Crystal Pearl and with black accented 15-spoke SRT-6 style wheels. Base Crossfire models, both Coupe and Roadster, have black painted windshield frames, black <b>filler</b> <b>plugs</b> (in place of fog-lights) in the front fascia, and fabric seats with separate, movable headrests. Limited and SRT-6 models, both Coupe and Roadster, all have silver painted windshield frames and are equipped with fog lights. The Limited has leather upholstery. The SRT-6 model has unique Leather/Alcantara upholstery.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of Ford {{automobile}} lubrication instructions, Southern California, 1930. "Lubricating the Transmission, About {{once every}} five thousand miles the gear lubricant should be drained from the transmission {{by removing the}} drain plug {{at the bottom of}} transmission case. The interior of the trans-mission case should then be thoroughlt flished with kerosene and refilled with fresh gear lubricant. The new lubricant is poured into the transmission through the filler hole, located at the right hand side of the transmission tcase. Pour sufficient lubricant in unti lit reaches the level of the filler hole.; Lubricating the Differential, Every 5000 miles the lubricant in the differential should be drained and the housing flushed with kerosene. New lubricant should then be added until it reaches the level of the oil filler hole in the housing. In the truck the lubricant in the differential must be kept up {{to the level of the}} <b>filler</b> <b>plug</b> oppening at all times.; Engine Lubrication, All parts of the engine are lubricated from the oil reservoir in the oil pan by the Ford Pump, Splash and Gravity Feed. Only high grade engine oil should be used in the engine. Oil of this kind reaches the bearing surfaces with greater east and cuts down frictional heat. It should have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two bearing surfaces will not force out the oil and allow the metal to come in actual contact. Inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also "gu m up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light grade of oil having a low cold test is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication of the car. In general an oil having the body S. A. E. viscosity No. 40 will prove satisfactory for summer use. While for winter use oil having specifica-tions of S. A. E. No. 20 should be used. It is essential, however, that this winter oil have a low cold test.; Draining the Oil Pan, It is advisable to clean out the oil pan by draining off the old oil when the new car has been driven five hundred miles, and thereafter to repeat this operation every 500 miles. The oil should be warm before draining.; Lubricating Shock Absorber Connections, The ball joints are made in unit with the instrument arm and spring perches. They are hardened and ground. The ball joint seats are enclosed in the shock absorber connecting links, which should be lubricated every 500 miles with the compressor gun. In order to secure maximum riding comfort, it is important that the spring hangers be free in the bushings and kept well greased. " [...] on instructions...|$|E
50|$|The Jumper Pak (Terminator Pack) is a <b>filler</b> that <b>plugged</b> {{into the}} console's memory {{expansion}} port. It serves no functional purpose {{other than to}} terminate the RAMBUS bus {{in the absence of}} the Expansion Pak. This is functionally equivalent to a continuity RIMM in a RAMBUS motherboard filling the unused RIMM sockets until the user upgrades. Early Nintendo 64 consoles (prior to the Expansion Pak's release) came with the Jumper Pak included and already installed. Jumper Paks were not sold individually in stores and could only be ordered individually through Nintendo's online store. The system requires the Jumper Pak when the Expansion Pak is not present or else there will be no picture on the TV screen.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental {{analysis was performed}} on Kevlar/epoxy cloth "mini-sandwich" panels with cellular foam core. Three undamaged panels and twenty-three other panels with damage and repairs were subjected to static shear loading. Four parameters were varied {{in the types of}} repairs; hole size, hole <b>plug</b> <b>filler</b> material, patch material, and patch overlap distance. All twenty-six panels were tested to failure. A repair technique employing a cellular foam plug and fiberglass patches overlapping the original hole by 0. 50 inches, symmetrically applied with structural adhesive, was found to be suitable for repair cf up to three inch diameter circular holes at field repair level. Additionally, postbuckling energy absorption was Qualitatively examined for undamaged panels and for hole sizes ranging from 1. 00 to 5. 00 inches diameter. [URL] United States Arm...|$|R
