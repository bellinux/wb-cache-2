40|$|The potencies of four calcium antagonists (nifedipine, <b>gallopamil,</b> {{verapamil}} and diltiazem) at inhibiting uterine contractions in vivo {{have been}} assessed in the conscious ovariectomized, post-partum rat. Their selectivities for this action, {{relative to their}} effects on blood pressure and heart rate, have been compared with salbutamol.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} effects of three {{different}} antianginal drugs on heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rate variability. DESIGN [...] Randomised, single blind, placebo controlled, cross over study. SETTING [...] University hospital. PARTICIPANTS [...] Nine healthy male volunteers. INTERVENTIONS [...] Oral administration of either 50 mg <b>gallopamil,</b> 20 mg nifedipine, 100 mg metoprolol, or placebo according to a random crossover plan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Time intervals between consecutive R waves in electrocardiograms measured with an accuracy of 5 ms from digital Holter recordings. Blood pressure monitored continuously by finger plethysmography. RESULTS [...] Metoprolol lowered heart rate from 62 (6) to 51 (5) beats/min (p = 0. 003) after 78 (23) minutes. Nifedipine provoked reflex tachycardia from 56 (5) to 94 (18) beats/min (p < 0. 001) at 10 (3) minutes after treatment followed by an exponential decline in heart rate to baseline values with a time constant of 34 (7) min in seven subjects but 83 minutes in one volunteer. One subject showed no exponential decline in heart rate. Nifedipine significantly lowered the supine mean arterial pressure from 86 (6) to 67 (6) mm Hg (p = 0. 004) after 11 (2) minutes, indicating an acute reduction in arterial resistance. <b>Gallopamil</b> did not significantly change mean heart rate or blood pressure.

The binding sites discriminate between the diastereoisomers 1 - and d-cis-diltiazem, recognize verapamil, <b>gallopamil</b> and tiapamil, and {{are sensitive to}} La 3 +-inhibition. At 30 °C the KD is 37 nM and the Bmax is 2. 9 pmol/mg protein.

40|$|Radioisotopic and {{electrophysiological}} {{techniques were}} used to assess the effects of verapamil, a phenylalkylamine Ca 2 + channel blocker, on K+ permeability of insulin-secreting cells. Verapamil provoked a concentration-dependent inhibition of 86 Rb (42 K substitute) outflow from prelabelled and perifused rat pancreatic islets. This property appears to be inherent to the phenylalkylamine Ca 2 + channel blockers since <b>gallopamil,</b> a methoxyderivative of verapamil, but not nifedipine, a 1, 4 -dihydropyridine Ca 2 + channel blocker, inhibited 86 Rb outflow. The experimental data further revealed that verapamil interacted with a Ca 2 +-independent, glucose- and glibenclamide-sensitive modality of 86 Rb extrusion. Moreover, verapamil prevented the increase in 86 Rb outflow brought about by BPDZ 44; a potent activator of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. Single-channel current recordings by the patch clamp technique confirmed that verapamil elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of the ATP-dependent K+ channel. Lastly, under experimental conditions in which verapamil clearly inhibited the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, the drug did not affect 45 Ca outflow, the cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration or insulin release. It is concluded that the Ca 2 + entry blocker verapamil inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic beta cells. This effect was not associated with stimulation of insulin release.

Structurally different calcium antagonists such as <b>gallopamil</b> (D- 600), on the other hand, displayed much lower affinities, further substantiating the specificity of the receptor for DHP structures. Furthermore, the displacement potency {{of a series of}} DHP derivatives correlated well with that determined for inhibition of mechanical response in the intact smooth muscle over 5 orders of magnitude. [3 H]Nimodipine binding thus may provide a molecular probe to elucidate the nature of the interaction of calcium entry blockers with specific membrane-located receptor sites that may be associated with the putative calcium channel. These receptor sites might well represent the loci of signaling events where the potent DHPs exert their pharmacological action...|$|E
40|$|A new molecularly {{imprinted}} polymer (MIP) {{material was}} synthesized selective for verapamil and utilized for on-line metabolic screening of this common calcium antagonist in biological samples. Since some metabolites of verapamil have also shown pharmacological properties, a selective and sensitive sample preparation approach {{that provides a}} metabolic profile in biologically relevant samples is important. The MIP material was coupled on-line to a restricted access material (RAM) precolumn. The multidimensional nature of this set-up removed large matrix interferents such as proteins from the sample, while the selectivity of the MIP enabled further cleanup of the smaller analytes. The selectivity and extraction efficiency of the MIP for verapamil and its metabolites was evaluated in various biological matrices, such as cell cultures and urine. The experimental set-up with the developed method enabled the direct injection of biological samples for the selective isolation, preconcentration, identification and analysis of verapamil and its phase I metabolites by LC-MSn. This multidimensional approach provided much qualitative information about the metabolic profile of verapamil in various biological matrices. An analytical method was developed for the quantification of verapamil and <b>gallopamil</b> in urine, plasma and cell culture. Acceptable linearity (R 2 = 0. 9996, 0. 9982 and 0. 9762) with an average injection repeatability (n= 3) of 10, 25 and 15 % R. S. D. was determined for urine, plasma and cell culture, respectively. This is the first application of the procedure for the selective metabolic screening of verapamil in biological samples...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the inhibitory effects of 1 mM of the inorganic cations, La 3 +, Cd 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ni 2 + and Co 2 + on contractions induced by K+ (100 mM) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT, 10 (- 5) M) in the isolated rat jugular vein and on contractions induced by K+ (100 mM), 5 -HT (10 (- 5] and noradrenaline (NA, 10 (- 5) M) in the rat aorta. In the venous preparation, both K(+) - and 5 -HT-induced Ca 2 + influx could be suppressed completely by all cations studied. In the aorta, the K(+) -induced Ca 2 + influx was antagonized completely only by Cd 2 +. The other cations were less effective and Mn 2 + was completely ineffective. Similarly {{to that in}} the venous preparation, the 5 -HT-induced Ca 2 + influx in the aorta was abolished by all the cations. A similar picture was found for the NA-induced Ca 2 + influx with the exception of Mn 2 +, which antagonized the NA-induced contractions only slightly. Although organic calcium entry blockers (CEBs) (nifedipine, diltiazem, flunarizine and <b>gallopamil)</b> inhibited NA-induced contractions to the same extent as did Mn 2 +, a combination of organic CEBs and Mn 2 + abolished the NA-induced Ca 2 + influx completely. Apparently, organic CEBs and Mn 2 + block different components of the NA-induced Ca 2 + influx pathwa...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{bioanalysis}} {{by direct}} nanoelectrospray infusion coupled to tandem mass spectrometry {{has been achieved}} using an automated liquid sampler integrated {{with an array of}} microfabricated electrospray nozzles allowing rapid, serial sample introduction (1 min/ sample). Standard curves prepared in human plasma for verapamil (r(2) = 0. 999) and its metabolite norverapamil (r(2) = 0. 998) were linear over a range of 2. 5 - 500 ng/ mL. Based on the observed precision and accuracy, a lower limit of quantitation of 5 ng/mL was assigned for both analytes. Sample preparation consisted of protein precipitation with an organic solvent containing the structural analogue <b>gallopamil</b> as an internal standard. Protein precipitation was selected both to maximize throughput and to test the robustness of direct nanoelectrospray infusion. Aliquots of supernatant (10 muL) were transferred to the back plane of the chip using disposable, conductive pipet tips for direct infusion at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Electrospray ionization occurred from the etched nozzles (30 -mum o. d.) {{on the front of the}} chip, initiated by a voltage applied to the liquid through the pipet tip. The chip was positioned near the API sampling orifice of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, which was operated in selected reaction monitoring mode. Results are presented that document the complete elimination of system carry-over, attributed to lack of a redundant fluid path. This technology offers potential advantages for MS-based screening applications in drug discovery by reducing the time for methods development and sample analysis...|$|E
40|$|Phenylalkylamines (PAAs), a major {{class of}} L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers, have two {{aromatic}} rings {{connected by a}} flexible chain with a nitrile substituent. Structural aspects of ligand-channel interactions remain unclear. We have built a KvAP-based model of LTCC and used Monte Carlo energy minimizations to dock devapamil, verapamil, <b>gallopamil,</b> and other PAAs. The PAA-LTCC models have the following common features: (i) the meta-methoxy group in ring A, which is proximal to the nitrile group, accepts an H-bond from a PAA-sensing Tyr_IIIS 6; (ii) the meta-methoxy group in ring B accepts an H-bond from a PAA-sensing Tyr_IVS 6; (iii) the ammonium group is stabilized at the focus of P-helices; and (iv) the nitrile group binds to a Ca 2 + ion coordinated by the selectivity filter glutamates in repeats III and IV. The latter feature can explain Ca 2 + potentiation of PAA action {{and the presence of}} an electronegative atom at a similar position of potent PAA analogs. Tyr substitution of a Thr in IIIS 5 is known to enhance action of devapamil and verapamil. Our models predict that the para-methoxy group in ring A of devapamil and verapamil accepts an H-bond from this engineered Tyr. The model explains structure-activity relationships of PAAs, effects of LTCC mutations on PAA potency, data on PAA access to LTCC, and Ca 2 + potentiation of PAA action. Common and class-specific aspects of action of PAAs, dihydropyridines, and benzothiazepines are discussed in view of the repeat interface concept...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 +-channel {{blockers}} of the verapamil type {{have been}} reported to exert a beneficial effect on clinical symptoms and survival rates in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The effects of verapamil have been attributed predominantly to an improved diastolic filling. It is unknown whether an effect on diastolic filling persists in these patients after long-term treatment. Fourteen patients (12 men, 2 women, median age fifty-one [thirty-two to fifty-five] years) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were included in the study. Patients had been treated with verapamil 240 - 480 mg/d or <b>gallopamil</b> 150 - 200 mg/d for fourteen (seven to seventeen) years. The effect of a withdrawal of Ca 2 +-channel blockers on parameters of left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated at rest and during exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy after long-term therapy. Investigations were performed at rest and during supine ergo-metric exercise during ongoing Ca 2 +-channel blocking therapy and after five (four to (continued on next page) at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 17, 2016 ang. sagepub. comDownloaded from 766 (Abstract continued) nine) days ’ withdrawal (control). Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was used to record diastolic mitral flow profiles from an apical four-chamber view. Withdrawal of Ca 2 +-channel blockers of the phenylalkylamine type after long-term treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resulted in a significant reduction of early diastolic inflow velocity at rest and during exercise. In conclusion, these results indicate a persistent improvement of early diastolic filling by Ca 2 +-channel blockers even after long-term treatment...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculated}} {{the contribution of}} the intracellular releasable calcium pool to the contractile responses induced by 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and noradrenaline (NA) by constructing time-response curves to the agonists in Ca 2 +-deficient medium in the isolated rat jugular vein and aorta. Biexponential curves were obtained compatible with a two compartment model. In the aorta the intracellular calcium pools are likely to be different for both 5 -HT and NA. Moreover, we investigated the effect of maximally effective concentrations of calcium entry blocking agents (CEB's) on K+, 5 -HT- and NA-induced contractions in Ca 2 +-containing medium. Only a moderate inhibiting effect of nifedipine, diltiazem, flunarizine and <b>gallopamil</b> on 5 -HT- and NA-induced Ca 2 + influx could be observed; in contrast, K+-induced Ca 2 + influx could be antagonized completely. The calculated contribution of intracellular Ca 2 + to 5 -HT- and NA-induced contractions, obtained from the experiments in Ca 2 +-"free" medium was much lower than that obtained after pretreatment with CEB's, leading to the conclusion that after CEB-pretreatment a Ca 2 + influx component persists. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that contractions in Ca 2 +-"free" medium consist of a monophasic, fast response only, whereas after CEB-pretreatment a response similar to the control, including a slow, sustained component, was obtained. The Ca 2 + influx component not affected by maximally effective concentrations of CEB's seems to represent an inflow of extracellular Ca 2 + directly into the cytosol and not into an intracellular calcium stor...|$|E
40|$|Various Ca 2 + antagonists used {{in animal}} research, {{many of them}} known to be Ca 2 + channel blockers, {{inhibited}} Escherichia coli chemotaxis (measured as entry of cells into a capillary containing attractant). The most effective of these, acting in the nanomolar range, was ω-conotoxin GVIA. The next most effective were <b>gallopamil</b> and verapamil. At concentrations around 100 -fold higher than that needed for inhibition of chemotaxis, each of these antagonists inhibited motility (measured as entry of cells into a capillary lacking attractant). Various other Ca 2 + antagonists were less effective, though chemotaxis was almost always more sensitive to inhibition than was motility. Cells treated with each of these Ca 2 + antagonists swam with a running bias, i. e., tumbling was inhibited. Similarly, some Na+ antagonists used in animal research inhibited bacterial chemotaxis. E. coli chemotaxis was inhibited by saxitoxin at concentrations above 10 − 7 M, while more than 10 − 4 M was needed to inhibit motility. Cells treated with saxitoxin swam with a tumbling bias. In the case of other Na+ antagonists in animals, aconitine inhibited bacterial chemotaxis 10 times more effectively than it inhibited motility, and two others inhibited chemotaxis and motility {{at about the same}} concentration. In the case of K+ antagonists used in animal research, 4 -aminopyridine blocked E. coli chemotaxis between 10 − 3 M and, totally, 10 − 2 M, while motility was not affected at 10 − 2 M; on the other hand, tetraethylammonium chloride failed to inhibit either chemotaxis or motility at 10 − 2 M...|$|E
