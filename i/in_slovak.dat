5|$|The LT vz. 34, {{formally}} {{designated as}} Lehký Tank vzor 34 ("Light Tank Model 34") was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Slovakia during World War II. Its suspension {{was based on}} that of the Carden-Loyd tankette, of which the Czechs had purchased three, plus a manufacturing license, in 1930. Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tančík vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided {{that it would be}} easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette's chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936, of which the Germans captured 22 - including the prototype, when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939, but they promptly scrapped them. The Slovaks seized the remaining 27 (18 + 9 nine LT vz. 34 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Prešov.) when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. <b>In</b> <b>Slovak</b> service it only saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising.|$|E
