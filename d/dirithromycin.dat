50|$|<b>Dirithromycin</b> (Dynabac) {{is a more}} lipid-soluble prodrug {{derivative}} of 9S-erythromycyclamine prepared by condensation of the latter with 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde. The 9N, 11O-oxazine ring thus formed is a hemi-aminal that is unstable under both acidic and alkaline aqueous conditions and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to form erythromycyclamine. Erythromycyclamine is a semisynthetic {{derivative of}} erythromycin in which the 9-ketogroup of the erythronolide ring has been converted to an amino group. Erythromycyclamine retains the antibacterial properties of erythromycin oral administration. The prodrug, <b>dirithromycin,</b> is provided as enteric coated tablets {{to protect it from}} acid catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach.Orally administered <b>dirithromycin</b> is absorbed rapidly into the plasma, largely from the small intestine. Spontaneous hydrolysis to erythromycyclamine occurs in the plasma. Oral bioavailability is estimated to be about 10%, but food does not affect absorption of the prodrug.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dirithromycin</b> is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic {{derived from}} erythromycin A. <b>Dirithromycin</b> is synthesized by the condensation of 9 (S) -erythromycylamine with 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) -acetaldehyde.

40|$|<b>Dirithromycin,</b> a new {{macrolide}} antibiotic, achieves prolonged, {{high levels}} in tissue. We previously demonstrated that certain macrolides are highly concentrated within phagocytic cells. This background information prompted us {{to evaluate the}} interactions of <b>dirithromycin</b> and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). After incubation with radiolabeled <b>dirithromycin,</b> antibiotic uptake by PMNs was determined by a velocity-gradient centrifugation technique and was expressed as {{the ratio of the}} cellular to the extracellular drug concentration (C/E). <b>Dirithromycin</b> was avidly accumulated by PMNs (C/E, 5 at 15 min, 10 at 30 min, 19 at 1 h, and 35 at 2 h). Uptake was dependent on cell viability, physiologic environmental temperature, and pH (optimum 8. 6), but was not influenced by potential competitive inhibitors of membrane transport. Incubation with sodium cyanide caused an increase in <b>dirithromycin</b> accumulation by PMNs. Ingestion of microbial particles (mimicking in vivo infection) modestly inhibited the entry of <b>dirithromycin</b> into PMNs. After removal of extracellular drug, the efflux (release) of <b>dirithromycin</b> from PMNs was slow; only 10 % was released within the first 30 min. This prolonged retention of <b>dirithromycin</b> within phagocytic cells might allow delivery and release of accumulated drug at sites of infection. The impact of intraphagocytic <b>dirithromycin</b> on cellular function was also evaluated. In a manner similar to that of other highly concentrated, weakly basic antibiotics, <b>dirithromycin</b> inhibited the respiratory burst response (superoxide production) in stimulated PMNs. The presence of <b>dirithromycin</b> slightly increased the intraphagocytic killing of Staphylococcus aureus in human PMNs. These interactions of <b>dirithromycin</b> with phagocytic cells may promote the extraphagocytic, and possibly the intraphagocytic, killing of infecting organisms...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dirithromycin</b> is a 9 -N- 11 -O-oxazine {{derivative}} {{which is}} formed by condensation of 9 (S) -erythromycylamine with 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) acetaldehyde. <b>Dirithromycin</b> is hydrolyzed, either under acidic conditions or in vivo, to its major active metabolite, 9 (S) -erythromycylamine. The antimicrobial spectrum of <b>dirithromycin</b> {{is similar to}} that of erythromycin; both antibiotics are active against gram-positive bacteria, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Comparable results were obtained for each antibiotic in MIC and MBC determinations and in the potential development of resistance in vitro.

40|$|Macrolides have {{properties}} {{other than}} their antibiotic action which may benefit patients with airway infections. We have investigated the effect of <b>dirithromycin</b> (0. 125 to 8. 0 μg/ml) on the interaction of Haemophilus influenzae with respiratory mucosa in vitro using human nasal epithelium, adenoid tissue, and bovine trachea. <b>Dirithromycin</b> {{did not affect the}} ciliary beat frequency of the nasal epithelium or the transport of mucus on bovine trachea, but <b>dirithromycin</b> (1 μg/ml) did reduce the slowing of the ciliary beat frequency and the damage to the nasal epithelium caused by H. influenzae broth culture filtrate. Amoxicillin (2 μg/ml) did not reduce the effects of the H. influenzae broth culture filtrate. H. influenzae infection of the organ cultures for 24 h caused mucosal damage and the loss of ciliated cells. Bacteria adhered to damaged epithelium {{and to a lesser extent}} to mucus and unciliated cells. Incubation of H. influenzae with <b>dirithromycin</b> at sub-MICs (0. 125 and 0. 5 μg/ml) prior to infection of the organ cultures did not reduce the mucosal damage caused by bacterial infection. By contrast, incubation of adenoid tissue with <b>dirithromycin</b> (0. 125 to 1. 0 μg/ml) for 4 h prior to assembling the organ culture reduced the mucosal damage caused by subsequent H. influenzae infection by as much as 50 %. The number of bacteria adherent to the mucosa was reduced, although the tissue that had been incubated with <b>dirithromycin</b> (0. 125 and 0. 5 μg/ml) did not inhibit bacterial growth. This was achieved by a reduction in the amount of damaged epithelium to which H. influenzae adhered and a reduction in the density of bacteria adhering to mucus.

40|$|With a {{recently}} developed liquid chromatographic (LC) method, using a phosphate buffer, several unknown impurities present in <b>dirithromycin</b> samples were separated. In this paper, a reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method is described {{for the investigation}} of <b>dirithromycin</b> and related substances. The method employed uses a Zorbax Extend C 18 column (250 mm x 4. 6 mm I. D.), 5 microm, and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, 2 -propanol, water and ammonium acetate solution pH 8. 5. Mass spectral data are acquired on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion (ESI) source operated in the positive ion mode. The LCQ is ideally suited for the identification of related substances because it provides on-line LC/MS(n) capability, which allows efficient identification without time-consuming isolation and purification procedures. Using this method, the fragmentation behavior of <b>dirithromycin</b> and its related substances was studied and the unknown impurities occurring in commercial samples were investigated.

In air, the respective MICs at which 50 % (MIC 50 s) and 90 % (MIC 90 s) of penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant strains are inhibited were as follows: erythromycin, 0. 016 and 0. 5, 0. 03 and > 64, and 2 and > 64 microg/ml; <b>dirithromycin,</b> 0. 03 and 0. 5, 0. 06 and > 64, and 8 and > 64 microg/ml; azithromycin, 0. 03 and 0. 5, 0. 06 and > 64, and 2 and > 64 microg/ml; clarithromycin, 0. 016 and 0. 06, 0. 03 and > 64, and 2 and > 64 microg/ml; roxithromycin, 0. 06 and 2, 0. 06 and > 64, and 2 and > 64 microg/ml; and clindamycin, 0. 03 and 0. 06, 0. 06 and > 64, and 0. 06 and > 64 microg/ml. The MICs of erythromycin, azithromycin, and <b>dirithromycin</b> were very similar; however, clarithromycin MICs were generally 1 to 2 dilutions lower and roxithromycin MICs were 1 to 2 dilutions higher than those of the other compounds tested. Strains resistant to one macrolide were resistant to all macrolides; however, not all macrolide-resistant strains were resistant to clindamycin, and 32 macrolide-resistant (MICs, > or = 28 microg/ml), clindamycin-susceptible (MICs, < or = 0. 25 microg/ml) strains were encountered. Time-kill testing of six strains showed similar killing kinetics for all compounds, with 99. 9 % killing of all strains observed with the compounds only at or above the MIC after 24 h...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>dirithromycin</b> {{were determined}} over a 72 -h period following oral administration {{of a single}} 500 -mg dose to 8 healthy volunteers and to 16 cirrhotic patients (8 patients with class A cirrhosis and 8 patients with class B cirrhosis according to Pugh’s & Child’s classification). Drug levels in plasma and urine were determined by microbiological assay. The mean maximum concentrations of drug in serum obtained 3 to 4 h after administration were 0. 29 ± 0. 22 mg/liter in volunteers and 0. 48 ± 0. 21 and 0. 52 ± 0. 38 mg/liter in patients with class A and class B cirrhosis, respectively. The elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 β) was 23. 3 ± 7. 6 h in healthy subjects and 35. 2 ± 11. 8 h and 39. 5 ± 11. 0 h in patients with class A and class B cirrhosis, respectively. The mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and t 1 / 2 β were significantly higher in patients with class A and B cirrhosis than in healthy controls, while total and renal clearances were markedly reduced (P < 0. 01). The time to the maximum concentration of drug in serum and the volume of distribution values appeared to be similar in all groups, and the mean recovery in urine at 72 h ranged from 3. 7 to 5. 7 %, without significant differences among groups. These results demonstrate that some <b>dirithromycin</b> kinetic parameters are significantly different in cirrhotic patients in comparison to those in healthy volunteers. However, {{an increase in the}} t 1 / 2 β or AUC, which is also observed with other semisynthetic macrolides (e. g., azithromycin), does seem to be not clinically relevant if one takes into account both the high therapeutic indices of these antibiotics and the usually short duration of therapy. Therefore, on the limited basis of single-dose administration, no modifications of <b>dirithromycin</b> dosage seem to be required even for patients with class B liver cirrhosis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTStock {{solutions}} of telithromycin, ABT- 773, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin and <b>dirithromycin</b> {{were each}} prepared with eight {{different combinations of}} solvents and diluents. Broth microdilution trays were then prepared and frozen at − 60 ≥C. Standard quality control strains were evaluated periodically during a 12 -week storage time. There were no significant changes in MICs with different solvents and diluents. It was concluded that the easiest approach was to dissolve each compound in water with a small volume (< 2. 5 μL/mL) of glacial acetic acid added in a dropwise fashion, followed by further dilutions in deionised water...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the uptakes and intracellular locations of four 14 -membered-ring macrolides (roxithromycin, <b>dirithromycin,</b> erythromycin, and erythromycylamine) in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in vitro. Intracellular location {{was assessed by}} cell fractionation and uptake kinetics in cytoplasts (granule-poor PMNs). Trapping of <b>dirithromycin</b> within PMN granules (up to 80 % at 30 min) was significantly more marked than the intracellular trapping of the other drugs (erythromycylamine, 45 % +/- 5. 1 %; erythromycin, 42 % +/- 3. 7 %; roxithromycin, 35 % +/- 3. 0 %). A new finding was that, {{in the absence of}} extracellular calcium, the uptakes of all of the macrolides by PMNs and cytoplasts were significantly impaired, by about 50 % (PMN) and 90 % (cytoplasts). Furthermore, inorganic Ca 2 + channel blockers inhibited macrolide uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 1. 6 to 2. 0 mM and 29 to 35 microM, respectively, for Ni 2 + and La 3 +. The intracellular distributions of the drugs were unchanged in the presence of Ni 2 + and La 3 + and in Ca(2 +) -free medium supplemented with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The organic Ca 2 + channel blocker nifedipine had no effect on macrolide uptake, whereas verapamil inhibited it in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These data show the importance of extracellular Ca 2 + in macrolide uptake by phagocytes and suggest a link with Ca 2 + channels or a Ca 2 + channel-operated mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{macrolide}} {{class of}} antimicrobials {{is characterized by}} a multi-membered lactone ring with one or more amino sugars attached. 1 Macrolides are grouped according to the number of atoms comprising the lactone ring, i. e. 12 -, 14 -, 15 - or 16 -membered-rings (Table I), each of which may have further differentiating characteristics, both chemical and biological. 2 The 14 -membered-ring group is composed of compounds of natural origin (e. g. erythro-mycin, oleandomycin) and semi-synthetic derivatives (e. g. roxithromycin, <b>dirithromycin,</b> clarithromycin). The 16 -membered-ring group also contains both compounds of natural origin (e. g. josamycin, spiramycin, kitasamycin, tylosin, midecamycin) and semi-synthetic derivatives (e. g. rokitamycin, miocamycin, tilmicosin). The only 15 -membered-ring is azithromycin. Erythromycin has bee...|$|E
40|$|Broth microdilution {{tests were}} carried out with 2, 671 {{respiratory}} tract isolates from 19 medical centers throughout the continental United States. The tests compared a streptogramin (RP 59500) to erythromycin, <b>dirithromycin,</b> clarithromycin, and azithromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Against macrolide-susceptible strains, the potency of RP 59500 {{was similar to that}} of the macrolides: the azalide, azithromycin, was two to four times more potent against H. influenzae. The azalide and three macrolides showed nearly complete cross-resistance. At 2. 0 micrograms/ml or less, the streptogramin, RP 59500, was active against both macrolide-resistant and -susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae (MIC for 50 % of the strains tested, 0. 25 microgram/ml; MIC for 90 % of the strains tested, 0. 5 microgram/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic surrogates from concentrations in serum {{has been shown}} to yield important information for the evaluation of antibiotic regimens. Calculations based on concentrations in serum, however, may not necessarily be appropriate for peripheral-compartment infections. The aim {{of the present study was}} to apply the microdialysis technique for the study of the peripheral-compartment pharmacokinetics of select antibiotics in humans. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of healthy volunteers and into inflamed and noninflamed dermis of patients with cellulitis. Thereafter, volunteers received either cefodizime (2, 000 mg as an intravenous bolus; n = 6), cefpirome (2, 000 mg as an intravenous bolus; n = 6), fleroxacin (400 mg orally n = 6), or <b>dirithromycin</b> (250 mg orally; n = 4); the patients received phenoxymethylpenicillin (4. 5 x 10 (6) U orally; n = 3). Complete concentration-versus-time profiles for serum and tissues could be obtained for all compounds. Major pharmacokinetic parameters (elimination half-life, peak concentration in serum, time to peak concentration, area under the concentration-time curve [AUC], and AUC/MIC ratio) were calculated for tissues. For cefodizime and cefpirome, the AUCtissue/AUCserum ratios were 0. 12 to 0. 35 and 1. 20 to 1. 79, respectively. The AUCtissue/AUCserum ratios were 0. 34 to 0. 38 for fleroxacin and 0. 42 to 0. 49 for <b>dirithromycin.</b> There was no visible difference in the time course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in inflamed and noninflamed dermis. We demonstrated, by means of microdialysis, that the concept of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic surrogate markers for evaluation of antibiotic regimens originally developed for serum pharmacokinetics can be extended to peripheral-tissue pharmacokinetics. This novel information may be useful for the rational development of dosage schedules and may improve predictions regarding therapeutic outcome...|$|E

40|$|The {{macrolide}} {{group of}} antibiotics includes natural members, pro-drugs and semi-synthetic derivatives, thus named {{because they are}} composed of a large aglycone ring (from 14 to 16 carbon atoms), to which are attached several sugars. Some of them are aminosugars, containing a diethylamino, tertiary amine function. A number of antibiotics, including erythromycin, oleandomycin, triacetyl-oleandomycin (troleandomycin), carbomycin, spiramycin, tylosin, rosamicin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, <b>dirithromycin</b> and others, are members of this group. On a comparative basis, erythromycin and oleandomycin are similar, with the same basic 14 -carbon lactone ring and side chain sugars. The remaining compounds contain a basic 15 - or 16 -carbon lactone ring {{and one or two}} side-chain sugars. Most of the macrolides are produced by Streptomyces spp bacteria. An exception is rosamicin, which is produced by Micromonospora. Clarithromycin and azithromycin are new semi-synthetic derivatives of erythromycin...|$|E
