50|$|The medal was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} civilian award, in parallel with the Australian Service Medal and the Police Overseas Service Medal, and until 2005 the Australian Defence Force had never been declared an <b>eligible</b> <b>organisation.</b> This is because, in most cases, the Australian Service Medal is already available to military personnel serving alongside humanitarian relief operations. However, defence personnel on leave of absence and serving an <b>eligible</b> <b>organisation</b> could qualify for the medal. The declaration of eligible organisations for the Indian Ocean clasp {{was the first time}} the Australian Defence Force was declared an <b>eligible</b> <b>organisation,</b> as Operation Sumatra Assist was purely a disaster relief operation and did not attract any military operational service award. The Australian Defence Force was again declared an <b>eligible</b> <b>organisation</b> for the participation of its personnel in Operation Pakistan Assist, part of the Australian humanitarian response to the 8 October 2005 Pakistan earthquake.|$|E
5000|$|To qualify {{a person}} must have served an <b>eligible</b> <b>{{organisation}}</b> {{for at least}} 15 years in the primary function, and the chief officer of the organisation must assess their service as [...] "diligent". From 1999 service {{did not have to}} be continuous, and the only restriction on counting service with several eligible organisations is that simultaneous service with more than one organisation is only counted once (i.e. no double-counting). Service must include at least one day on or after 14 February 1975 (the day the award was established) and at least one day on or after the [...] "approval date" [...] for at least one organisation served. For the original organisations (police, fire, ambulance, defence) the [...] "approval date" [...] is 14 February 1975. Other organisations have approval dates as determined by the Governor-General, which ensures that a person whose service entirely pre-dates approval as an <b>eligible</b> <b>organisation</b> can't claim the award.|$|E

50|$|The National Medal is an Australian award {{given for}} long service by {{operational}} members of specified <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations.</b> It {{was introduced in}} 1975, as an original component of the new Australian honours system, and replaced a range of medals available to military and civilian uniformed services for long service and good conduct. The eligible groups have in common that their members serve or protect the community {{at the risk of}} death, injury or trauma, hence it is only available to members of the <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations</b> who are operationally deployed. In the case of corrective services, eligibility is restricted to officers with custodial duties.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Officer of each <b>eligible</b> <b>organisation</b> is {{authorised}} {{to recommend}} to the Governor-General that an award {{be made to}} a member of his or her organisation. Where a person's eligible service spans several organisations, it is the current, or most recent Chief Officer who makes the recommendation. Organisations periodically submit schedules of multiple awards to Government House rather than sending them one at a time. The process is the same for awards of clasps indicating a further 10 years of service.|$|E
50|$|Declared <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations</b> {{must be part}} of an Australian {{humanitarian}} response, or an Australian contingent to {{an international}} response. Accordingly, it is possible for non-Australians participating in such a group to be eligible for the medal.|$|R

This first wave of data collection was carried out from 9 January through 5 April 2013. The aims of the survey were to gain {{an overview of the}} field of asylum support and to address the following research questions: What effects has the recession had on the field? To what extent do asylum seekers participate in the field? What types of organisations tend to work together? To those ends, the survey included questions about the attributes of participating organisations as well as questions about their working relationships with other organisations.

40|$|Background: The {{transparency}} criteria {{adopted by}} the European Medicines Agency require eligible patient and consumer organisations to disclose the names and contributions of their public and private revenue sources. Despite various transparency initiatives, the exact funding sources of, and amounts received by, <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations</b> remain unclear. This article examines how many patient and consumer <b>organisations</b> <b>eligible</b> {{to work with the}} Agency (n= 23) received corporate sponsorship between 2006 and 2008 and how much. The article also reports how many organisations met the Agency‟s criteria on financial disclosure. Methods: Financial data were retrieved from organisations‟ and pharmaceutical companies‟ websites in January and February 2010, as well as through direct requests for the information placed in March 2010. A method for estimating sponsorship in the absence of reported contributions was developed and applied uniformly. Results: Fifteen of the twenty-three <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations</b> received financial sponsorship from corporate sources whilst seven received funding entirely from other sources. We failed to retrieve any financial data or revenue sources for one of the 23 organisations. The annual average corporate contribution per sponsored organisation rose from € 185, 500 in 2006, to € 282, 090 in 2007, to € 321, 230 in 2008. These amounts correspond to 47 %, 51 % and 57 % of organisational average annual revenue, respectively. Fewer than half of the 23 organisations met the Agency‟s financial reporting guidelines. Conclusions: This study indicates low compliance with the guidelines which EMA introduced in 2005 to ensure the financial transparency of the organisations working with it. Levels of corporate sponsorship differ greatly between those organisations that receive no financial support and others who rely upon it heavily. The lack of a uniform and detailed reporting system hinders complete public disclosure of the nature, and extent of, corporate sponsorship of these organisations. This study focuses on the issue of corporate sponsorship of patient and consumer organisations active at the EMA. However, these organisations represent only a selection of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other stakeholders active in the area of health and pharmaceutical policy in Europe. Thus, further research is called for on financial transparency, and the nature of corporate sponsorship and conflicts of interests of civil society representatives in European health policy making...|$|R
40|$|Background: Smoking {{prevalence}} {{remains high}} in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Indigenous peoples in countries colonised by Western nations prefer culturally-targeted anti-tobacco messages, yet {{only recently have}} messages been tailored for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. We conducted a national survey to determine how messages are being developed for Indigenous tobacco control. Method: Forty-seven telephone {{interviews were conducted with}} 44 of 53 <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations.</b> Twenty-two Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs), 13 Government Organisations (GOs), four Universities and eight non-government organisations (NGOs) participated. Questions included targeting and theoretical approaches, community consultation, messages types and design, campaign types, cultural challenges, recommended actions, resources developed, pre-tests and evaluation. Findings: Responses were scored according to core components, and message features. Total scores (mean 10. 9 ±SD 2. 7) were not associated with organisation type.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our aim in {{this study}} was to examine the {{competing}} interest policies and procedures of organisations who develop and maintain patient decision aids. DESIGN: Descriptive and thematic analysis of data collected from a cross-sectional survey of patient decision aid developer's competing interest policies and disclosure forms. RESULTS: We contacted 25 organisations likely to meet the inclusion criteria. 12 <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations</b> provided data. 11 organisations did not reply and 2 declined to participate. Most patient decision aid developers recognise the need to consider the issue of competing interests. Assessment processes vary widely and, for the most part, are insufficiently robust to minimise the risk of competing interests. Only half of the 12 organisations had competing interest policies. Some considered disclosure to be sufficient, while others imposed differing levels of exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Patient decision aid developers do not have a consistent approach to managing competing interests. Some have developed policies and procedures, while others pay no attention to the issue. As is the case for clinical practice guidelines, increasing attention will need to be given to how the competing interests of contributors of evidence-based publications may influence materials, especially if they are designed for patient use...|$|R

40|$|The Consumers Health Forum of Australia (CHF) is the {{national}} peak body representing the interests of Australian healthcare consumers. CHF works to achieve safe, quality, timely healthcare for all Australians, supported by accessible health information and systems. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore mechanisms to support consumer participation in health and medical research. This paper also provides a snapshot of the current literature, research and policy debate surrounding these issues. Our analysis draws on extensive work in this area, including consumer consultations and literature scoping undertaken by CHF throughout 2012. CHF’s research and consultations suggest that more must be done to support active consumer engagement in health research to deliver more relevant and more responsive outcomes. This paper calls for consumer participation to play a key role in any future plans and strategies on health and medical research in the coming years. CHF also calls for the inclusion of comparative effectiveness research as a central component of future health and medical research planning in Australia, and stronger incentives to encourage the publication of research in non‐peer reviewed formats that can be more accessible to policymakers, practitioners and consumers. To enable more collaborative research practices, CHF considers that the rules for Administering Institutions and <b>Eligible</b> <b>Organisations</b> should be reviewed and amended to support research funding for a broader range of organisations. Other grant funding rules and requirements should also be reviewed to enable greater community engagement in research design, investigation and data collection. To support all of these activities, and to build on existing models of active consumer engagement, CHF calls for the establishment of a Consumer Health Research Centre...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Public health {{workforce}} {{planning and}} policy development require adequate {{data on the}} public health workforce and the services provided. If existing data sources do not contain the necessary information, or apply to part of the workforce only, primary data collection is required. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a strategy to enumerate and characterize the public health workforce and the provision of essential public health operations (EPHOs), and apply this to the environmental public health workforce in the Netherlands as an example. Methods: We specified WHO's EPHOs for environmental public health and developed an online questionnaire to assess individual involvement in these. Recruitment was a two-layered process. Through organisations with potential involvement in environmental public health, we invited environmental public health workers (n = 472) to participate in a national survey. Existing benchmark data and a group of national environmental public health experts provided opportunities for partial validity checks. Results: The questionnaire was well accepted and available benchmark data on physicians supported the results of this study regarding the medical part of the workforce. Experts on environmental public health recognized the present results on the provision of EPHOs as a reasonable reflection of the actual situation in practice. All EPHOs were provided by an experienced, highly educated and multidisciplinary workforce. 27 % of the total full-time equivalents (FTEs) was spent on EPHO 'assuring governance for health'. Only 4 % was spent on 'health protection'. The total FTEs were estimated as 0. 66 / 100, 000 inhabitants. Conclusions: Characterisation of the public health workforce is feasible by identification of relevant organisations and individual workers on the basis of EPHOs, and obtaining information from those individuals by questionnaire. Critical factors include the operationalization of the EPHOS into the field of study, the selection and recruitment of <b>eligible</b> <b>organisations</b> and the response rate within organisations. When existing professional registries are incomplete or do not exist, this strategy may provide a start to enumerate the quantity and quality of the public health within or across countries...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Committee inquired {{into the}} administration, {{transparency}} {{and effectiveness of}} the Register of Environmental Organisations under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. In seeking to improve the natural environment, many not-for-profit environmental organisations work hand-in-hand with communities across Australia. Much of this work relies on the generous financial contributions of members and supporters. Often these donations are tax-deductible, which recognises the public good that comes from environmental work. As such, public trust and confidence in the tax-concessional arrangements for environmental organisations is essential. The public should be assured that tax concessions are granted appropriately. Similarly, donors should be assured that their donations are distributed and used in line with their expectations. This inquiry considered the administration and transparency of the Register of Environmental Organisations, which is the Commonwealth scheme to enable <b>eligible</b> environmental <b>organisations</b> to receive tax-deductible donations. Consistent with the terms of reference, {{the focus of the}} inquiry was on the effectiveness of the Register in supporting communities to undertake practical action to improve the environment. In preparing the report of the inquiry, the Committee has identified measures to strengthen the integrity of tax-concessional arrangements for environmental organisations. The Committee has also identified scope to streamline the administration of the system. The recommendations outlined in the report are intended to make the system clearer for donors, environmental organisations, and the wider community...|$|R
40|$|Given their multidimensional missions, {{combining}} economic, {{social and}} sometimes political dimensions, FTOs {{have been proposed}} quite early as examples of “social enterprise” (SE). Such link {{has been made in}} a particularly explicit way in the United Kingdom, by both academics (e. g. Martin and Osberg, 2007; Nicholls, 2006) and practitioners. Following Dart (2004), the trend for FTOs to depict themselves (and to be depicted) as SEs probably stems from a research of legitimacy towards an environment that promotes values of entrepreneurship and innovation. However, if FTOs are considered as obvious examples of SE, there still needs to be explained carefully why this is the case, and to what extent. Is it the involvement in FT that makes the enterprises “social”, or is it a set of particular organisational characteristics shared by most FTOs, or is it a combination of both? If the fact of “doing Fair Trade” is not a sufficient criterion to generate a SE dynamics – as we believe it –, then what is it in FTOs that makes these <b>organisations</b> <b>eligible</b> as SEs? The answers to these questions are closely linked to the framework used to define SE. While we try to consider different conceptualisations of SE in our analysis (part 1), we pay a special attention to the “multiple goal” and “multiple stakeholders” features put forward by the authors of the “EMES network”. In part 2, we recall the basics of the FT concept and the historical evolution of the movement. We then present our empirical data on FTOs in four European regions. Finally, we confront these data to some of the SE features identified in the literature (part 3). In this analysis, we particularly try to examine to what extent FTOs pursue multiple goals and involve multiple stakeholders, and how such organisational characteristics could be linked {{to each other and to}} other features such as resources, age and size.
