5|$|Due to the {{prolonged}} development {{period of the}} film, in 2010, DC Entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation. Film director James Mangold pitched a series concept to cable channel HBO, whilst consulting with Gaiman himself on an unofficial basis, but this proved to be unsuccessful. It was reported in September 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was licensing the rights to produce a TV series, and that Supernatural creator Eric Kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt the saga. In March 2011, it was announced via Neil Gaiman's web blog that while he and DC liked Eric Kripke and his approach, it didn't <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> right. The author hoped to launch the series in another form but plans for a television adaptation are on hold as production moves forward on the film. As the film adaptation of Morpheus' story was being planned, DC and Fox discussed in September about a possible TV series based on the Sandman character Lucifer.|$|E

Although the Island of Maui is small, it can <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> different in each district {{resulting in a}} unique selection of micro-climates that are typical to each of its distinctive locations: Central Maui; leeward South Maui and West Maui; windward North Shore and East Maui; and Upcountry Maui.|$|E

Average maximum {{temperatures}} range between [...] Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing.

500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

[...] At the 51st Grammy Awards, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] garnered Madonna, Timberlake and Timbaland a nomination in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category.

500|$|In December 2011, then Prime Minister John Key {{revealed}} that he had asked McCaw {{about the possibility of}} a knighthood in the 2012 New Year Honours, but that McCaw had turned it down. According to Key, [...] "He made the call that he's still in his playing career and it didn't <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> right for him, that day where he's no longer on the pitch may be the right time for him." [...] No formal offer was ultimately made. McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the 2016 New Year Honours. The honour surpassed the knighthood he had previously turned down prior to his retirement because only 20 living New Zealanders can gain membership at any one time.|$|E

500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You have to lie on your belly and look through the trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. It makes me <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
500|$|The open world {{includes}} vast {{tracts of}} countryside {{around the city}} proper. Research took the team to California's rural regions; Garbut recalled a visit he took with Houser to Bombay Beach that inspired them to set Trevor's initial story against the Salton Sea. The team wanted a large world without open, empty spaces, and condensed Southern California's countryside into a diverse and detailed playing space. The game world covers about an eightieth of Los Angeles County. Its scale is greater than Rockstar's previous open world games; Garbut estimated it {{is large enough to}} fit San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemptions worlds combined inside. To accommodate the world's size, the team overhauled the RAGE to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The large, open space permitted the re-introduction of fixed-wing aircraft, omitted from Grand Theft Auto IV because of its relatively smaller scale. [...] "We wanted somewhere big [...] fly properly", Houser explained. The team populated the world with wildlife; lead producer Leslie Benzies felt that [...] "because of the scale of the map and the different kinds of areas involved, a countryside without animals would <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> hollow".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} later, {{he becomes a}} surfer, that he has always dreamed to be since long before the surgery. He <b>feels</b> <b>quite</b> stable in his new life. But after coincidentally encountering the other person and his girlfriend, he realizes that he still loves her.|$|R
60|$|SURGE. Quite true. That {{was because}} she was piously brought up, and {{regarded}} herself as an instrument.

2500|$|The {{appearance}} of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown got considerable {{attention from the}} press, contrasting the comic's heroic portrayal with the PM's current poor standing with the voting public.

He rather attempts to persuade them by appealing to the care they should have for other believers who might not feel so free.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of {{adultery}} laws regard them as painfully archaic, believing they represent sanctions reminiscent of nineteenth-century novels.

2500|$|To {{coincide}} the storyline it {{was announced}} Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton {{would return to the}} serial with the possibility of causing trouble for Darren's wedding plans.

She said Margaret would be [...] "quite vindictive" [...] while doing this and she would [...] "try to make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren. It's underhand and cruel, because she plays on Nancy's insecurities and self-doubt.

2500|$|Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef {{compared}} the animatronic {{animals in the}} game to Weeping Angels — predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who — due {{to their ability to}} only move when they are not being observed. Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it [...] "drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles", but that the [...] "inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you <b>feel</b> <b>quite</b> helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their 'love' with you". Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation hailed the game as extremely effective, but expressed doubts about using jumpscares as a central game mechanic.|$|E

2500|$|When news of Japan's {{surrender}} in August 1945 {{reached the}} internment camps, thousands {{balked at the}} idea of resettling in the war-torn country and attempted to revoke their applications for repatriation.
