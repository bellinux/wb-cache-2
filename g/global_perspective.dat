5|$|From a <b>global</b> <b>perspective,</b> {{there have}} been {{political}} debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting. The history of broadcasting discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting. The onset of World War II brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda. Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda. Patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s. In 1936, the BBC broadcast propaganda to the Arab World to partly counter similar broadcasts from Italy, which also had colonial interests in North Africa.|$|E

Countries with economic advantages generate and own most knowledge and that knowledge tends to define <b>global</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Building research capacities of the developing world could enhance and complement <b>global</b> <b>perspectives.</b> A north/west and south/east dialogue would expand the notion of <b>global</b> <b>perspectives</b> and be more inclusive of the standpoint of others, particularly those in developing countries [...] Being critically realistic to changes in education and engaging in constant dialogues, negotiations and reflections can help to democratise education. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more <b>global</b> <b>perspective</b> on the double burden.|$|E

25|$|Iqbal's Bang-e-Dara (The Call of the Marching Bell), {{his first}} {{collection}} of Urdu poetry, {{was published in}} 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life. The poems he wrote up to 1905—the year he left for England—reflect patriotism and imagery of nature, including the Tarana-e-Hind (The song of India), and Tarana-e-Milli (The song of the Community). The second set of poems date from 1905–1908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of European society, which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a <b>global</b> <b>perspective.</b> Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the Ummah, to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{research}} of the Lake Baikal region’s Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers began {{during the second half}} of the 19th century and was followed by a long period of intensive research conducted during the Soviet period by researchers such as Alexei Pavlovich Okladnikov. The Baikal Archaeology Project was formed in the mid-1990s during the time of profound political, social, and economic changes in Russia. Since then, the Baikal Archaeology Project launched an extensive multidisciplinary investigation of Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers of the Baikal region. The research model involves both original fieldwork and the application of modern laboratory techniques to previously as well as recently excavated collections of archaeological materials. Much of this work is facilitated by the presence of prehistoric cemeteries with well-preserved human remains – an unusual hunter-gatherer characteristic from a <b>global</b> <b>perspective.</b> Employing many advanced research methods and the integration of diverse lines of evidence generated by mortuary archaeology, zooarchaeology, radiocarbon dating, human osteology, isotope geochemistry, ancient and modern DNA research, ethnoarchaeology, and paleoclimatic and environmental studies, the project aims to achieve an improved understanding of the cultural complexity, variability, and dynamics of the long-term culture change among past boreal foragers in the Baikal region.|$|E

The data obtained as a result of two semi-structured interviews with 11 pre-service social studies teachers and participants’ journals were analyzed by using NVivo 10 package program. The data were analyzed with inductive analysis. The data were collected in the spring semester of the 2009 - 2010 academic year. Findings indicated that the participants’ definitions or thoughts about <b>global</b> <b>perspectives</b> were shaped by their belief about globalization. The participants also stated that teaching social studies by employing <b>global</b> <b>perspectives</b> would help students to understand their own prejudice and stereotypes about different cultures, ethnic and religious groups and teacher education programs are incompetent to provide such training...|$|R
