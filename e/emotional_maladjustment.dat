40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that aversive social experiences generate <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> because they prompt {{the development of}} a hypersensitivity to perceiving and overreacting to rejection. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} test hypothesized direct and indirect (via rejection sensitivity) links of overt/relational victimization and friendship conflict with early adolescents' loneliness and depressive symptoms. Participants were 366 Australian early adolescents age 10 - 14 years (50. 5 % girls). Using both a self-report and peer-report measure of rejection sensitivity, no difference was found when comparing the significant correlations of each measure with loneliness and depressive symptoms. Tests of direct and indirect associations with structural equation modeling showed that adolescents higher in relational victimization reported more loneliness and depressive symptoms and part of this association was by way of their greater self-reports of rejection sensitivity and their peers' identification that they were higher in rejection sensitivity. Additionally, relational victimization was the only unique correlate of <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment,</b> and adolescents who reported more overt victimization were identified by their peers as higher in rejection sensitivity. Finally, gender and rejection sensitivity were tested as moderators. No gender moderation was found, but friendship conflict was associated more strongly with <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> for adolescents low, rather than high, in rejection sensitivity. These findings identify relational victimization as particularly salient for <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> both directly and indirectly via links with elevated rejection sensitivity. They show how rejection sensitivity and aversive experiences may contribute independently and jointly to <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> for both boys and girls.

40|$|We {{assessed}} a {{total of}} 93 diabetic patients attending the diabetic clinic at Queen Mary Hospital in late 1991 and followed them up in early 1994. The subjects studied were aged from 14 to 45 years, comprising 39 males and 54 females. Measures of psychological adjustment together with subjective complaints of somatic malaise were administered. Subjects' diabetic control was assessed through their HbA 1 c levels and presence of any diabetic-related complications. Our findings indicate that in the Hong Kong Chinese population, high risk factors leading to poor diabetic control should be identified through <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustments</b> {{as well as physical}} complaints/malaise. Measures of compliance, psychological maladjustment (e. g. low self-esteem, pervasive depressive symptoms, increased physical complaints), and glucose control are highly correlated with each other. Baseline glucose control, early signs of psychological maladjustment and demographic moderator variables are predictive of metabolic control over time.

40|$|Chronic child neglect is a {{seemingly}} intractable problem involving {{a combination of}} human and environmental factors. Its direct impact on children and indirect costs to society are often overlooked despite increasing research data that links chronic child neglect to long-term negative outcomes – physical, social, and <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustments</b> and trauma symptoms that impact children {{and their ability to}} be productive well into adulthood. While there is no universal definition for child neglect or chronic neglect in research and policy, child neglect generally refers to a parent or caretaker’s failure or omissions in meeting a child’s basic needs for healthy growth and development. It is chronic when it occurs in a repeating pattern or enduring cycle rather than as an isolated incident or episode. Most Child Maltreatment Victims Experience Neglect Much of the focus related to child maltreatment has been on child abuse – the form of child maltreatment with the most immediately visible consequences. Yet child neglect is the most prevalent form of maltreatment, and national statistics have shown this to be true for well over a decade. In 2008 (the most recent year for which statistics are available), public child protective services (CPS) agencies received a total of 3. 3 million referrals alleging maltreatment of approximately 6 million children. Nearly two-thirds of those referrals met criteria to be accepted for further action (investigation or assessment), and 71. 1 % of the maltreated children were found to have experienced neglect.

40|$|Background: Many couples do {{not comply}} with {{fertility}} treatment because of its psychological burden. The SCREENIVF {{can be used to}} screen patients at risk for <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> during treatment by assessing risk factors for maladjustment (distress, infertility cognitions and social support). The psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the SCREENIVF were examined. This study also investigated if patients at risk for <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> during fertility treatment reported lower intentions to comply with treatment than patients not at risk and which risk factors were associated with lower compliance intentions. Methods: Sample was composed of 383 infertile women and men undergoing any stage of fertility treatment in Portugal. They completed the Portuguese version of the SCREENIVF and other self-report questionnaires assessing wellbeing, partner support, child wish and intentions to comply with treatment. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit of the SCREENIVF structural model. SCREENIVF presented good reliability and was significantly associated with other measures of distress, partner support and child wish. Patients at risk and not at risk for maladjustment reported similar compliance intentions. Negative associations found between distress and compliance intentions were moderated by patients’ cognitions regarding control perceived over fertility and its treatment and capacity to accept a future without biological children. Conclusion: The Portuguese version of the SCREENIVF is valid and reliable. Patients are overconfident about their ability to comply with treatment. Patients need to have information and feel control over treatment in order to make informed and satisfactory decisions about treatment uptake.

40|$|Perceiving {{that one}} is {{rejected}} is an important correlate of <b>emotional</b> <b>maladjustment.</b> Yet, self-perceptions can substantially differ from classmate-reports of who is rejected. In this study, discrepancies between self- and classmate-reports of rejection were identified in 359 Australian adolescents (age 10 - 12 years). As expected, adolescents who overestimated rejection reported more rejection sensitivity and felt more victimized by their peers, but were not seen by peers as more victimized. Adolescents who underestimated rejection identified themselves as high in overt aggression, and their peers identified them as high in overt and relational aggression and low in prosocial behavior. Yet, underestimators' feelings of friendship satisfaction {{did not seem to}} suffer and they reported low rejection sensitivity.

Methods: CHQ and BASC were administered to 103 parents of children with Type 1 diabetes, aged 7 - 12 years. Sub-scales of the two measures were compared using Pearson's bivariate correlations. CHQ sensitivity and specificity cut-points were optimized against the BASC borderline category using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The BASC Externalizing Problems scale correlated strongly with CHQ Behaviour, Global Behaviour, Mental Health, Family Activities and Family Cohesion scales (r-values - 0. 68, - 0. 54, - 0. 51, - 0. 59, and - 0. 42, respectively). BASC Internalizing Problems scale correlated strongly with CHQ Behaviour, Mental Health and Family Cohesion scales (r-values - 0. 40, - 0. 43 and - 0. 45, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the CHQ Mental Health scale most effectively identified children classified as borderline on the BASC Internalizing Problems scale (sensitivity 87 %, specificity 78 %), while the CHQ Global Behaviour scale most effectively identified children classified as borderline on the BASC Externalizing Problems scale (sensitivity 73 %, specificity 82 %). Conclusions: Significant correlations were seen between the CHQ Global Behaviour and Mental Health scales and the BASC Externalizing and Internalizing scales, respectively. Sequential use of the CHQ, as a screening tool, followed by an established mental health measure such as the BASC, may help identify children with diabetes 'at risk' for chronic maladjustment and poor health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Forty one {{children}} (20 boys, 21 girls) aged 6 - 10. 8 years (mean age 8. 6 years) {{who were}} affected with idiopathic epilepsy underwent neuropsychological (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Bender test) and behavioural assessment (Personality Inventory for Children; {{this was also}} used in a matched control group). Further information was obtained by teachers' reports. School underachievement occurred in 25 children (61 %). Statistical analysis showed no influence of sex, social background, age of onset, seizure type, duration of illness, features seen on electroencephalography, and treatment. School failure was due to poor performance in almost all academic fields, and was associated with higher visuomotor impairment; children showing good school performance had a higher mean IQ and less visuomotor impairment. The behaviour of children with epilepsy who had a good academic performance {{did not differ from}} that of their healthy peers. <b>Emotional</b> <b>maladjustment</b> (social skill impairment, depression, poor motivation, and low self esteem) was associated with poor school performance. Such problems, that may complicate the course of idiopathic epilepsy and require an appropriate educational programme, should be carefully considered by the clinician...|$|E
