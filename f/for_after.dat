Oleksandr Hrechko earned the spot <b>for</b> Ukraine <b>after</b> finishing seventh in the men's KL1 event, but as each NPC gets only one spot and another country had two ahead of him, he qualified.

5|$|Book One, Awake to Emptiness, {{begins with}} Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, {{discovering}} a Magyar village {{where all the}} inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe (encountering only one lone native). Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares <b>for</b> <b>after</b> the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor.

40|$|Anastomotic leakage (AL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating {{complications}} after rectal cancer surgery. The double stapling technique has greatly facilitated intestinal reconstruction especially <b>for</b> anastomosis <b>after</b> low anterior resection (LAR). Risk factor analyses <b>for</b> AL <b>after</b> open LAR have been widely reported. However, a few studies have analyzed the risk factors <b>for</b> AL <b>after</b> laparoscopic LAR. Laparoscopic rectal surgery provides an excellent operative field in a narrow pelvic space, and enables total mesorectal excision surgery and preservation of the autonomic nervous system with greater precision. However, rectal transection using a laparoscopic linear stapler is relatively difficult compared with open surgery because of the width and limited performance of the linear stapler. Moreover, laparoscopic LAR exhibits a different postoperative course compared with open LAR, which suggests that the risk factors <b>for</b> AL <b>after</b> laparoscopic LAR may also differ from those after open LAR. In this review, we will discuss the risk factors <b>for</b> AL <b>after</b> laparoscopic LAR...|$|R

5|$|During {{the third}} inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four {{consecutive}} home runs off Yankee pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from a three-run deficit and completing a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park {{for the first time}} since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play <b>for</b> <b>after</b> retirement, Roger Clemens chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox (where he started his career) or the Houston Astros (his hometown and last team he played for). Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14-game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins and a loss by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine-year reign in the division.|$|E
5|$|George Wilkes (1817– September 23, 1885) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper editor. A native of New York, Wilkes became a {{journalist and}} after losing a libel case was imprisoned in New York City's jail; his imprisonment led him to write a pamphlet on the jail's conditions in 1844. The next year, Wilkes and a friend started publishing National Police Gazette, a newspaper dealing with crime reporting and other sensationalistic topics. In 1856 Wilkes bought a sporting newspaper called The Spirit of the Times, which he had previously worked <b>for.</b> <b>After</b> selling the Gazette, Wilkes continued to publish and edit the Spirit {{until his death in}} 1885. Wilkes also wrote a couple of books on non-sporting topics as well as introducing pari-mutuel betting into the United States.|$|E
5|$|He quickly formed another {{band called}} Sahara Dust, which later {{developed}} into the symphonic metal band Epica. His place {{was taken by}} Bas Maas, {{who had been the}} guitar technician <b>for</b> <b>After</b> Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press. Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen's collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002. Jansen's activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band's live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003. It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped <b>for.</b> <b>After</b> scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{gave his}} {{mistress}} vast {{sums of money}} by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit. He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided <b>for</b> <b>after</b> his death. Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless {{of the contents of}} his will. However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or in the shape of paintings, bric-a-brac, and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash. Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune in Congo securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her. Princess Louise soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them.|$|E

He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E

5|$|There were {{tactical}} deficiencies as well, {{particularly the}} predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians {{to take full}} toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained. Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, <b>for</b> <b>after</b> the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After {{the failure of the}} final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians {{might have been able to}} bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.|$|E
5|$|Varlyn Stroud is a convict. His {{original}} biography gives {{insight into}} his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara {{as his first}} murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a Ferris wheel car so Clara fell to her death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still {{spent most of his}} life in prison on a variety of charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a subliminal message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the route of the carnival. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking <b>for.</b> <b>After</b> delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his security manager, which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.|$|E

However, Baby Wario's lust for treasure leads him to abandon his duties while Baby Bowser was captured by Kamek (who is actually the future Kamek that appears throughout the forts and castles), and later kicked out by the Adult Bowser, who came from the future, for his baby counterpart insults him. Baby Bowser then joined the group until he noticed Kamek and after him, leaving Yoshi and the other babies to continue their journey. Much later in the game, Kamek's sinister plan for kidnapping the babies around the world has been revealed. He and Bowser travels back in time in search of the star children—seven babies whose hearts possess unimaginable power necessary for him to conquer the universe.
