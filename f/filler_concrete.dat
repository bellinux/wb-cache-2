40|$|Most high <b>filler</b> <b>concrete</b> {{studies are}} based on {{relatively}} high contents of powder (cement + filler) (> 400 kg m- 3). This paper aims to increase the total fly ash content relative to the clinker content, while simultaneously minimizing the total powder content in the concrete to values lower than 300 kg m- 3. The motivation for decreasing the total powder content using fly ash as a cement replacement {{is based on the}} fact that concrete structures often have an ‘overstrength’ related to excess cement. Consequently, there is potential for using lower amounts of clinker and replacing it by filler, which can reduce the amount of primary raw materials used and CO 2 related to clinker production. However, the question arises if sufficient durability of this ‘high filler’ concrete is achieved. In this paper chloride penetration resistance is measured by rapid chloride migration and diffusion tests on both laboratory mixes and samples from pilot projects. Also, electrical resistivity and polarization-and-fluorescence microscopy (PFM) are used to evaluate the development of the microstructure in time.

The bond between concrete and steel elements {{is one of}} the most important properties contributing to the successful functioning of a composite panel (Kayali 2004). The main contribution to bond strength comes from the chemical adhesion and the friction resistance occurring between the steel and the concrete as a result of the surface effects. Composite structures made of various materials can fail in several ways depending on material properties of components, design methods, and loading cases, but the most important is the cooperation of all elements (Alterman et al. 2011). The lack of compatibility between elements leads to bond failure, sliding of reinforcement bars and/or steel strips, local deformations, and finally cracking.
