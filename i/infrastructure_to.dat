5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing <b>infrastructure</b> <b>to</b> fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>to</b> the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E

The introduction of this paper describes the importance of IT <b>infrastructures</b> <b>to</b> organizations. The top challenges {{according to a recent}} survey are also introduced in the state-of-the-art section. Then, to improve our understanding and face challenges, we propose an approach based upon a research method and we describe several research techniques that we plan to use (e. g. laddering technique) and the use of empirical research in IT infrastructures. Finally, we present the expected contributions, work already performed and some preliminary results...|$|R

5|$|On March 2009 the Colombian {{government}} {{enacted a}} mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide <b>infrastructure</b> <b>to</b> guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, car dealers, gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained the industry {{is not ready to}} supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.|$|E
5|$|The City {{government}} has an <b>infrastructure</b> <b>to</b> create close working relationships with its citizens.

Such services include preserving area histories, home rehabilitation centers, outreach programs, and a university that trains citizens in neighborhood clean-up, event planning, neighborhood leadership, and financial planning. Norfolk's police department also provides support for neighborhood watch programs including a citizens' training academy, security design, a police athletic program for youth, and business watch programs.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its <b>infrastructure</b> <b>to</b> current standards.|$|E

Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony, where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared that the people of Riau had been treated like stepchildren. He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma. Though Yamin objected to Soeman's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma, he did arrange for a state senior high school to be opened in Riau.|$|E
