40|$|International audienceAbstractAgriculture {{must now}} feed the planet {{with the lowest}} {{environmental}} impact. Landscape management is a means to protect natural resources from the adverse impacts. In particular, the adequate management of ditches could improve crop quality. Here, we review <b>ditch</b> design and <b>maintenance.</b> We found the following major points: (1) ditch networks have been primarily designed for waterlogging control and erosion prevention. Nonetheless, when properly managed, farm ditches provide other important ecosystem services, namely groundwater recharge, flood attenuation, water purification, or biodiversity conservation. (2) All ditch ecosystem services depend on many geochemical, geophysical, and biological processes, whose occurrence and intensity vary largely with ditch characteristics. (3) The major ruling characteristics are vegetative cover; ditch morphology; slope orientation; reach connections such as piped sections and weirs, soil, sediment and litter properties, biota, and biofilms; and network topology. (4) <b>Ditch</b> <b>maintenance</b> is an efficient engineering tool to optimize ecosystem services because several ditch characteristics change widely with <b>ditch</b> <b>maintenance.</b> For instance, maintenance operations, dredging, chemical weeding, and burning improve waterlogging and soil erosion control, but they are negative for biodiversity conservation. Mowing has low adverse effects on biodiversity conservation and water purification when mowing is performed at an adequate season. The effects of burning have been poorly investigated...|$|R

And in colloquial language both, tractor-mounted hedge trimmers and reach flail mowers, are imprecisely called hedge cutters, or brush cutters. In contrast to tractor-mounted hedge trimmers, reach flail mowers have a different cutting mechanism, and are not only used for trimming hedges, but also in several other fields of application (mowing taller grass, road verge cutting, <b>ditch</b> <b>maintenance,</b> etc.).|$|R
40|$|Large {{areas have}} been ditched in Sweden during the past 100 years to improve the forest production. <b>Ditching</b> and also <b>maintenance</b> of old <b>ditches</b> are {{operations}} having mainly negative effects on water quality, flora and fauna and changing characteristics of soil. The {{purpose of this study}} was to suggest a method for inventory of the need for <b>ditching</b> <b>maintenance</b> in old forest ditches that takes biodiversity, water protection and forest production into consideration. Inventory methods from five Swedish and Finnish forest companies, agencies and organisations were compared. Their employees were interviewed about their handling with ditches, forest production and nature conservation. The results show that there are four major questions that have to be answered in order to decide whether old ditches should be left as they are, maintained or if there are other operations that could be needed. First, it is important to know whether the original ditches has had an improving effect on forest production and second, what effect a cleaning of the ditch would have on the growth at present. The third and fourth theme that has to be valued is what the effects could be on biodiversity and the environment and all this has to be weighted together. <b>Maintenance</b> of old <b>ditches</b> is a complex subject. It is of major concern to have a comprehensive view and to look outside the specific object for eventual causes and effects.
