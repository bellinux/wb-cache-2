This mechanism stimulates cytokine expression and release in antigen presenting cells as well as inducing the production of costimulatory molecules that allow the cell to bind to and activate T cells more effectively.|$|E

50|$|At {{the atomic}} level, the atomic binding {{energy of the}} atom derives from {{electromagnetic}} <b>interaction,</b> <b>mediated</b> by photons. It is the energy required to disassemble an atom into free electrons and a nucleus. Electron binding energy {{is a measure of}} the energy required to free electrons from their atomic orbits. This is more commonly known as ionization energy. Among the chemical elements, the range of ionization energies is from 3.8939 eV for the first electron in an atom of caesium to 11.567617 keV for the 29th electron in an atom of copper.|$|E
50|$|Another {{peculiar}} case of host-viral <b>interaction</b> <b>mediated</b> by a microRNA {{occurs with}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV, which causes acute {{infection of the}} liver, often going undetected and progressing to chronic, uses the human miRNA miR-122 to recruit Argonaute2 proteins to the uncapped 5' end of its RNA genome, thereby masking it from the cellular antiviral response and stabilizing it. This interaction {{has led to the}} development of AMOs that target miR-122 in an effort to clear the virus from the hepatic cells. The most advanced of these compounds is miravirsen, a locked nucleic acid-DNA mixmer, currently undergoing clinical trials.|$|E

5000|$|This {{seemingly}} simple interaction is, in fact, a {{weak force}} <b>interaction</b> <b>mediated</b> {{by either the}} neutral [...] or the charged , [...] weak interaction bosons. [...] In the latter interaction, theelectron is converted to a neutrino (and vice versa) by the virtual particle exchange. Measurement of the elastic scattering was therefore a means to determine properties of the bosons, first detected at the particle physics laboratory CERN in 1983. Measurements of this cross section, final results published in 1993, were in excellent agreement with Standard Model predictions. By verifying the quantum mechanical interference effects of the two modes of interaction, LAMPF experiment E-225 was an important test of Standard Model theory.|$|E
50|$|Because 3FTx {{proteins}} {{of similar}} structure bind a {{diverse range of}} cellular protein targets, the relationships between 3FTx protein sequence and their biological activity have been studied extensively, especially among the alpha-neurotoxins. Known functional sites conferring binding affinity and specificity are concentrated in the loops of 3FTx proteins. For example, the crystal structure of alpha-bungarotoxin in complex with the extracellular domain of the alpha-9 nAChR subunit indicates a protein-protein <b>interaction</b> <b>mediated</b> through loops I and II, with no contacts formed by loop III. Interaction surfaces have been mapped {{for a number of}} toxins and vary in which loops participate in binding; erabutoxin A uses all three loops to bind nAChRs, while the dendroaspin interaction with adhesion proteins is mediated by three residues in loop III. In some 3FTx proteins with a C-terminal extension, these residues also participate in forming key binding interactions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dynamics}} of magnetic monopole solutions is especially simple when {{the theory is}} at BPS limit---when it can be extended to include fermionic sectors to form a supersymmetric theory. In these cases, the multi-monopole solutions can be explicitly obtained, the monopoles in a system are basically free because the <b>interaction</b> <b>mediated</b> by Higgs field is cancelled by the gauge interaction. {{in the case of}} a maximally broken gauge group into , the multi-monopole solution can be viewed as weakly interacting particles, each carrying a [...] phase factor, therefore when considering the low energy processes the total number of degrees of freedom for n monopoles is 4n, in 4-dimensional spacetime---3 for spatial position and one for the phase factor. The dynamics can be reduced to the motion inside a 4n dimensional space with a nontrivial metric from the interactions among the monopoles, so called [...] "moduli space approximation".|$|E

These results are compared to previously studied cases of indirect interactions mediated by excitons and/or polaritons in bulk semiconductor and two-dimensional cavities. I find that photons mediate an Ising-like interaction between donors {{in the same}} manner polaritons do, in contrast to the Heisenberg-like <b>interaction</b> <b>mediated</b> by exciton. For the particular case of a two-dimensional cavity, the model shows that the dependence on distance of the donor-donor coupling constant is the same for photons and polaritons when the donor-donor distance is large. Then, it becomes clear that photons are responsible for the long range behavior of the polariton indirect interaction...|$|E

40|$|Chromatin <b>interactions</b> <b>mediated</b> by {{a protein}} of {{interest}} are of great scientific interest. Recent {{studies show that}} protein-mediated chromatin interactions can have different intensities in different types of cells or in different developmental stages of a cell. Such differences {{can be associated with}} a disease or with the development of a cell. Thus, it is of great importance to detect protein-mediated chromatin interactions with different intensities in different cells. A recent molecular technique, Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET), which uses formaldehyde cross-linking and paired-end sequencing, is able to detect genome-wide chromatin <b>interactions</b> <b>mediated</b> by a protein of interest. Here we proposed two models (One-Step Model and Two-Step Model) for two sample ChIA-PET count data (one biological replicate in each sample) to identify differential chromatin <b>interactions</b> <b>mediated</b> by a protein of interest.

The One-Step Model makes use of the data more efficiently but is more computationally intensive. An extensive simulation study showed that the models can detect those differentially interacted chromatins and there is a good agreement between each classification result and the truth. Application of the method to a two-sample ChIA-PET data set illustrates its utility. The two models are implemented as an R package MDM (available at [URL]...|$|R
