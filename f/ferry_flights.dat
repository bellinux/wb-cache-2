Owner Peter Jewson bought the replica in a campaign to build the first ever national memorial to honour the 166 women from the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) who flew Spitfires and other aircraft from factories to their operational airbases; 14 died during these <b>ferry</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale by auction in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 car <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward.|$|E
25|$|The {{partnership}} was renewed in 2005, with Be-200ES (Reg. RF-21512) {{based at}} Sardinia between July and September. The aircraft flew 150 hours covering 63 missions, including <b>ferry</b> <b>flights,</b> and 435 scoops and drops of water, the total mass of which exceeded 3,175tonnes (3,500tons).|$|E

At that time, the RJAF planned to acquire as much as 60-70 F-16s (if possible C/D models), enough to equip 3 squadrons.|$|R

25|$|The RAAF Washington Flying Unit was a {{temporary}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) unit formed to ferry Australia's first twelve General Dynamics F-111C aircraft from the United States to Australia. It {{was formed in}} March 1973 and disbanded in July of that year after the <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> were completed.|$|E
25|$|That year also {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the first decade of Silver City's air ferry services. During that period, the airline completed 125,000 <b>ferry</b> <b>flights.</b> These carried 215,000 vehicles and 750,000 passengers. At its peak, Silver City operated 222 daily <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> across the English Channel, as well as between Scotland and Ireland and to/from the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Cross-Channel flights to France operated between 7.30 am and 11.00 pm. The average fare was £25 per car and £4 per passenger. This was furthermore the time the Air Kruise cross-Channel services, as well as all Dragon Airways, Lancashire Aircraft Corporation and Manx Airlines operations from Newcastle upon Tyne, Blackpool and the Isle of Man were transferred to Silver City's new Northern Division to streamline BAS's fragmented airline operations. It was hoped that these measures would improve BAS's financial performance.|$|E
25|$|Since 1945, over 300 A-26s {{have been}} on the FAA U.S. Civil Aircraft Register.

25|$|No. 40 Squadron {{was formed}} at Townsville, Queensland on 31 March 1944. It was {{initially}} equipped with six Short Sunderland flying boats {{which had been}} ferried from the United Kingdom to Australia between January and March of that year. These <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> were made by experienced crews drawn from the RAAF's two Sunderland squadrons in the United Kingdom, No. 10 and No. 461 squadrons.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the European war, the RAF {{sought to}} retain No. 462 Squadron for a period so that it could be used to test radio {{countermeasure}} equipment and techniques. As a result, the squadron continued to fly training and <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> and also conducted armed patrols over Germany. These duties continued until the squadron was disbanded at Foulsham on 24 September 1945.|$|E
25|$|British United Air Ferries (BUAF) was {{a wholly}} private, British {{independent}} car and passenger ferry airline {{based in the}} United Kingdom during the 1960s. It specialised in cross-Channel <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> carrying cars and their owners between its numerous bases in Southern England, the Channel Islands and Continental Europe. All-passenger and all-cargo flights were operated as well. Following several identity and ownership changes, it {{went out of business}} in 2001.|$|E

25|$|In February 1949, Silver City {{established}} a French sister airline headquartered in Paris to operate vehicle <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> from Le Touquet Airport. The new company was registered {{under the name}} Société Commerciale Aérienne du Littoral (SCAL). A number of Silver City aircraft were registered to this company. These were transferred onto the French aircraft register. In addition, an agreement was reached to appoint the Automobile Club de France as Silver City's and SCAL's official representative in France. These steps were necessary to secure French approval to turn the seasonal charter flights Silver City had operated on this route into a full-fledged scheduled operation.|$|E
25|$|The Space Shuttle was {{originally}} designed to utilize on-board turbofan engines for propulsion within the atmosphere, both upon re-entry and for <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> between landing sites, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range, or contingency landing sites such as Easter Island, to the launch site at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. When the air-breathing engines were deleted from the Shuttle design due to cost and weight concerns, a requirement arose for a transport aircraft capable of carrying the Shuttle from landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center. One early design for a shuttle carrier aircraft was proposed by John M. Conroy, developer of the Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy oversized cargo aircraft, {{in cooperation with the}} NASA Langley Research Center; named Virtus, a contract was issued for design and development work in 1974.|$|E
25|$|In January 1942, a {{month after}} the United States {{declared}} war, Kelsey was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. In the spring of 1942 Kelsey was attached to the VIII Fighter Command at Dow Field near Bangor, Maine to assist in preparing for trans-Atlantic <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> in support of Operation Bolero. As an acting colonel, Kelsey was assigned to the 14th Fighter Group for the purpose of flying one of the group's fighters and for making sure preparations were sufficient. In July, with the call sign Shoe Black 7, he flew a P-38F in the first ferry flight of fighters across the North Atlantic to England. Returning to the States in September 1942, he resumed his former position as chief of the Pursuit Branch, and the following July he was named chief of the Flight Research Branch, Flight Test Division.|$|E

[...] The KC-10s served with SAC until 1992, when they were reassigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command. In the aerial refueling role, the KC-10s have been operated largely in the strategic refueling of large number of tactical aircraft on <b>ferry</b> <b>flights</b> and the refueling of other strategic transport aircraft. Conversely, the KC-135 fleet has operated largely in the in-theater tactical role. There are 59 KC-10 Extenders in service with the USAF as of 2010. The USAF's KC-10s are stationed primarily at Travis AFB, California, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst formerly known as McGuire AFB, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Very {{early in}} the Pacific War, a scheme was {{proposed}} to fit Lightnings with floats {{to allow them to}} make long-range <b>ferry</b> <b>flights.</b> The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E 41-1986 was modified with a tailplane raised some , booms lengthened by two feet and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length but the tail raised [...] All three tail modifications were designed by George H. [...] "Bert" [...] Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough sealift capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.|$|E
