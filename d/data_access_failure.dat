30|$|Reliability in {{scalable}} data analysis. As {{the number}} of processing elements increases, reliability of systems and applications decreases, therefore mechanisms for detecting and handling hardware and software faults are needed. Although in [7] has been proved that no reliable communication protocol can tolerate crashes of processors on which the protocol runs, {{as stated in the}} same paper some ways in which systems cope with the impossibility result can be found. Among them, at programming level it is necessary to design constructs for handling communication, <b>data</b> <b>access,</b> and computing <b>failures</b> and for recovering from them. Programming models, languages and APIs must provide general and data-oriented mechanisms for failure detection and isolation, avoiding that an entire application can fail and assuring its completion. Reliability is an issue much more important in the Exascale domain where {{the number of}} processing elements is massive and fault occurrence increases making detection and recovering vital.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> and various inflammatory markers including the genetic polymorphisms of IL- 10 and TNF-. Seventy-five patients on hemodialysis with an arteriovenous fistula in place or an artificial graft (18 with vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> and 82 without failure) and 98 healthy individuals were genotyped for IL- 10 and TNF- single nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical and laboratory data including serum IL- 10 and TNF- levels were compared. Stimulated IL- 10 levels, from in vitro incubation of blood with lipopolysaccharide, were also obtained and compared. Female gender, hypoproteinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were associated with vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> The basal TNF- level was significantly higher in patients with <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> The distribution of IL- 10 and TNF- genotype did not differ among patients with or without <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> This study could not demonstrate a relationship between genetic polymorphisms and vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> However, an altered immune response and inflammation might contribute to vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of Exascale systems urges to address and solve {{issues and challenges}} both at hardware and software level. Indeed it requires to design and implement novel software tools and runtime systems able to manage a very high degree of parallelism, reliability and data locality in extreme scale computers [14]. New programming constructs and runtime mechanisms able {{to adapt to the}} most appropriate parallelism degree and communication decomposition for making scalable and reliable data analysis tasks are needed. Their dependence from parallelism grain size and data analysis task decomposition must be deeply studied. This is needed because parallelism exploitation depends on several features like parallel operations, communication overhead, input data size, I/O speed, problem size, and hardware configuration. Moreover, reliability and reproducibility are two additional key challenges to be addressed. Indeed at programming level, constructs for handling and recovering communication, <b>data</b> <b>access,</b> and computing <b>failures</b> must be designed. At the same time, reproducibility in scalable data analysis asks for rich information useful to assure similar results on environments that dynamically may change. All these factors {{must be taken into account}} in designing data analysis applications and tools that will be scalable on exascale systems.|$|R

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β 1 {{genotype}} polymorphisms determine AV fistula patency in hemodialysis patients. BackgroundIn hemodialysis patients with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> is {{primarily due to}} fistula stenosis, which predisposes to thrombosis and subsequent access loss. The risk for <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> differs interindividually, an observation that is independent from vascular anatomy in {{a significant number of}} patients. Fistula stenosis is histologically characterized by intimal hyperplasia, which is induced by growth factors, among which transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) is of major importance. The quantitative production of TGF-β 1 interindividually differs due to polymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of the cytokine. We hypothesized that the TGF-β 1 genotype, by influencing the development of arteriovenous fistula stenosis, determines the risk for vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> MethodsOne hundred twenty patients who had undergone placement of an AV fistula for initiation of hemodialysis treatment were genotyped for the polymorphic bases at position + 869 and + 915 of the TGF-β 1 gene. The primary end-point was time from fistula placement to <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> ResultsAV fistula patency was significantly associated with the TGF-β 1 genotype (P = 0. 0046); patency was 62. 4 % and 81. 2 % after 12 months for TGF-β 1 high and intermediate producers, respectively. In contrast, AV fistula patency neither differed between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, nor between patients with and without manifest cardiovascular disease. ConclusionPolymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of TGF-β 1 influence the risk for hemodialysis <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> By inducing synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, overproduction of TGF-β 1 may accelerate the development of intimal hyperplasia, resulting in fistula stenosis and subsequent <b>access</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{probability}} of <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> in SRAMs due to process variability affecting the core cells and the sense amplifiers has been evaluated. Conventionally, the <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> in SRAMs are treated at core cell level by means of differential bit line voltage analysis. In this work, it is shown that under the assumption of random process variability, the conventional approach no longer suffices. It still holds that the differential bit line voltage is degraded by the variability in core cell transistors, but the way this voltage difference is interpreted by the sense amplifier to complete the read operation is influenced by random variability affecting its transistors. Case studies show how variability affecting the sense amplifier can degrade or improve its ability to read the data stored by the core cell, which is itself affected by variability. Using principal component analysis and the SB-SI method, we performed a parametric analysis of the sense amplifier/core cell system and we evaluated the joint probability of <b>access</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract In process-driven, service-oriented {{architectures}} (SOAs), process {{activities can}} perform service operations, data transformations, or human tasks. Unfortunately, the process activities are usually tightly coupled. Thus, {{when the number}} of activities in the process grows, focusing on particular activities of the flow such as the service operations reading or writing persistent data is a time-consuming task. In particular, in order to solve structural problems concerning persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> such as deadlocks in data-intensive business processes, stakeholders need to understand the underlying persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> details of the activities i. e. physical storage schemes, and database connections.
