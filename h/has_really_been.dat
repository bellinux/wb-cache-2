25|$|Without Kendall, Reese and Bianca {{exchange}} wedding vows on February 12, 2009. Ryan, however, {{has called}} off his wedding with Greenlee after seeing Zach and Reese kiss. He tells Greenlee {{that he knows}} Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and {{that he does not}} want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she wants to know if he <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Reese, Bianca and others soon find out about Greenlee being missing. Ryan tells Bianca that Zach and Reese have been engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. Bianca goes to Reese to tell her that their relationship and marriage is over. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle.|$|E

The story arc of the cracks in the universe was inspired by a crack in the wall of Moffat's son's bedroom. Moffat wanted to make sure the show appealed to even young children; if they could not follow the plot, there would be [...] "big pictures" [...] to entertain them. Moffat believed that Doctor Who was fundamentally for children but it was something everybody loved, comparing it to Star Wars and Toy Story. He considered the [...] "most popular form of entertainment" [...] to be a children's story. Of the series, he said they [...] "pushed the fairytale side of it" [...] as Doctor Who [...] "now has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows" [...] to be more vibrant and [...] "bonkers" [...] than any other fantastical show.|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{defensive}} about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives {{to put her}} in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E

Yes. But it was." [...] In February 2013 in the Wall Street Journal, Boal responded to the Senate critics, being quoted as saying [...] "oes that mean they can use the movie as a political platform to talk about what they've been wanting to talk about {{for years and years and}} years? Do I think that Feinstein used the movie as a publicity tool to get a conversation going about her report? I believe it, ..." [...] referring to the intelligence committee's report on enhanced interrogations. He also said the senators' letter showed they were still concerned about public opinion supporting the effectiveness of torture and didn't want the movie reinforcing that. Boal said, though, [...] "I don't think that [...] issue <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> resolved" [...] if there is a suspect with possible knowledge of imminent attack who will not talk.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Koons rose to {{prominence}} in the mid-1980s {{as part of a}} generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a media-saturated era. He gained recognition in the 1980s and subsequently set up a factory-like studio in a SoHo loft on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway in New York. It was staffed with over 30 assistants, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his workin a similar mode as Andy Warhol's Factory (notable because all of his work is produced using a method known as art fabrication). Today, he has a [...] factory near the old Hudson rail yards in Chelsea, working with 90 to 120 regular assistants. Koons developed a color-by-numbers system, so that each of his assistants could execute his canvases and sculptures {{as if they had been}} done [...] "by a single hand". [...] "I think art takes you outside yourself, takes you past yourself. I believe that my journey <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> to remove my own anxiety. That's the key. The more anxiety you can remove, the more free you are to make that gesture, whatever the gesture is. The dialogue is first with the artist, but then it goes outward, and is shared with other people. And if the anxiety is removed everything is so close, everything is available, and it's just this little bit of confidence, or trust, that people have to delve into." ...|$|E
2500|$|A more {{positive}} review came from Wolverhampton Express and Star: [...] "Slade haven't {{had a big}} hit for some time now, {{but it would be}} silly to write them off just yet, to judge by their new album Return to Base. There is definitely a Sixties feel to some of the songs, though others are vintage Slade. Most striking thing about the album is its variety, for Slade have loosened up a bit for this one and included much more variety of mood. It certainly pays off. Another striking factor is the guitar playing of Dave Hill, who <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> allowed to branch out on this disc. In all, it's an album which will please Slade's still huge army of fans, both for its fidelity to the Slade sound and for its inventiveness and freshness." [...] In May 1980, Jon Young of New York magazine Trouser Press reviewed the album and stated: [...] "On Return to Base, seven of the eleven cuts connect in every possible way, for a batting average of [...]636. If it had been released in 1973, the classic [...] "Nuts, Bolts and Screws" [...] would've easily topped the UK charts. Okay, there's nothing here quite as wonderful as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize". But whose fault is that? This kind of music isn't meant for a vacuum! It's meant to be enjoyed! Give Slade some encouragement! You will be glad that you did!!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost <b>has</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that.
