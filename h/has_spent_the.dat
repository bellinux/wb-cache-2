25|$|November 2: The Braves {{announced}} several internal roster {{moves that}} allowed for additional {{space on the}} forty-man roster. After spending the month of September 2011 with the Major League club, the team outrighted catcher J. C.

In addition, the Braves filled one roster spot with starting pitcher Todd Redmond, who <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> previous three seasons pitching for Gwinnett. Accumulating a record of 10–8 with a 2.92 ERA in 2011, Redmond is unlikely to have playing time with the Major League club due to existing pitching depth.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} method {{follows the}} first steps of the traditional method in that after primary fermentation the cuvée is transferred to bottles to complete secondary fermentation, which allows for additional complexity. When the secondary fermentation is complete and the wine <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> desired {{amount of time in}} bottle on yeast lees (six months is the requirement to label a wine 'bottle fermented') then the individual bottles are transferred (hence the name) into a larger tank. The wine is then filtered, liqueur de dosage added, and then filled back into new bottles for sale. This method allows for complexity to be built into the wine, but also gives scope for blending options after the wine has gone into bottle and reduces the bottle-to-bottle variations that can be hard to control in the traditional method.|$|E
