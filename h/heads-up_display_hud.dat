The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and teamwork, removing most of the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} Cole {{to use his}} powers, he must have stored {{electrical}} power, represented by an energy meter on the player's <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD).</b> The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources, recharging also restores Cole's health, though Cole's health can regenerate over time without recharging. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game. The player can use experience points to increase powers' effectiveness or unlock new powers. Experience points are awarded for actions including defeating enemies, healing citizens and completing missions. The player can use such powers to destroy environmental scenery such as towers and stone columns. Depending on the player's choices, the player can gain ice or fire powers from the game's female protagonists, Kuo and Nix. Additionally, passive abilities based on Karma level called Karmic Boosts can be unlocked.|$|E

5|$|Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Wei Shen, a Chinese-American police officer who goes undercover and infiltrates the Sun On Yee Triad organization. The first missions of the game are a linear tutorial for controlling the character. After these missions, the player is allowed to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, swimming, and driving cars, boats and motorcycles. The <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> interface features a mini-map that indicates targets, key locations (safe houses and contact points) and Shen's current position. The mini-map incorporates two meters: one shows Shen's health and the other his face. When the face meter fills, upgrades are unlocked such as health regeneration, improved combat abilities and reduced equipment costs. The HUD also displays the weapon carried and its ammunition count.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) {{that takes place}} from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, multi-level dungeon, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD).</b> Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An automatically filling map, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include looking up and down, jumping, and swimming.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD),</b> {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game.

When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD),</b> denoting {{that they have}} taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, then their health will recover. The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns {{at the beginning of}} each level, but may switch them out with another gun they find. Most guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat. In some levels, the player will be given special equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser designator.|$|E

The protagonist wears powered battle armor (PBA) that features lock-on targeting, jumpjets for limited flight, infrared and zoomed vision, and a rechargeable energy shield that protects against attacks. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons and manipulate the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> interface.

As in , the player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons, to interact with objects and to manipulate the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> interface. View and posture controls on the HUD allow the player to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, and crawl. Practical uses for these actions include taking cover, retrieving items from beneath the player character and navigating small passages, respectively. The HUD also features three [...] "Multi-Function Displays", which may be configured to display information such as weapon readouts, an automap and an inventory.|$|E

500|$|Versus XIII used an action-based {{combat system}} based {{primarily}} on the Kingdom Hearts battle system. Gameplay elements from third-person shooters were also to have been incorporated. Character movement {{was designed to be}} fast-paced. During earlier gameplay trailers, the pace of gameplay was deliberately slowed down so viewers could have a better view of events. In addition to Noctis, his companions were also controllable, each harnessing unique weapons and all being able to enter and control mechs and airships. Noctis was the only character with access to all weapon types within the game (including swords, axes, guns, lances and others), with the current selection of weapons leading to different combos. Group attacks could not be manually triggered, but party members would team up automatically for a [...] "super attack". In addition, attacks could be chained together by players switching between characters during battle. Magic was available to all characters, but only when Noctis {{was a part of the}} party, a consideration that was closely tied to the story. A job system was in place, but it was exclusive to enemy units, with those present including dragoons and summoners. Environments outside cities also featured a day-night cycle and roaming enemies, with different enemy monsters appearing at different times of day. Several initial concepts for the game had to be abandoned; a planned first-person view and the lack of a <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> were scrapped because these ideas were deemed incompatible with the style of the Final Fantasy series. An overhead camera view was also considered for the open field areas, but it was decided against so the player would remain immersed. When the final Versus XIII trailer was released, the HUD was a mixture of finalized and temporary elements. There were even plans for the game to have a [...] "unique" [...] support setup for the Sixaxis controller. Although after the game's transition there were technological and mechanical changes, the basic elements established in trailers such as Noctis' warping and weapon abilities were carried over.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon wears {{a special}} {{full-body}} hazmat suit, {{known as the}} Hazardous Environment Suit (or HEV Suit), during combat. The suit is {{designed to protect the}} user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials.

A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an RPG. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in flashlight, a radio, various tracking devices, a compass, and a Geiger counter. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HUD)</b> which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.|$|E
