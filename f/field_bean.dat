40|$|The {{effect of}} {{toasting}} <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> and of grass-clover: maize silage ratio on milk production, milk composition and sensory {{quality of the}} milk was investigated in a 2 * 2 factorial experiment. Toasting of <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> resulted in lower contents in milk of both fat (44. 2 versus 46. 1 g/kg, P = 0. 02) and protein (33. 5 versus 34. 2 g/kg, P = 0. 008), whereas milk production and urea and somatic cell contents were unaffected compared with untreated <b>field</b> <b>beans.</b> Increasing the proportion of maize silage (from 2 to 5 kg DM/cow/day) in the ration decreased the content of urea in milk (P= 0. 002), whereas milk production and fat and protein contents were unaffected. Milk from cows fed the high proportion of maize silage had a lower (P= 0. 04) content of the long chain fatty acids (³ C 18). Furthermore, milk from cows fed the high proportion of maize silage had a lower (13 - 26 %) content of luteine (P= 0. 03), 13 -cis-β-carotene (P= 0. 04) and β-carotene (P= 0. 05). Toasting of <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> compared with untreated <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> did not affect milk content of carotenoids and had only small effects on fatty acids composition. The sensory profiles of the four milk samples were quite similar characterized by a fatty mouthfeel and creamy flavour, though for the attributes sour feed odour and maize odour {{there was a significant}} difference between treatments. In conclusion, toasting <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> did not improve milk production, and toasted <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> in combination with a high proportion of maize in the feed resulted in milk with negative sensory characteristics. Increasing the proportion of maize silage at the expense of grass-clover silage did not affect milk production, but decreased the milk content of long-chain fatty acids, as well as the content of carotenes...|$|R
40|$|Peas and <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> as feeds for {{monogastric}} {{animals in}} organic farming {{have a high}} feeding quality particularly in consideration of protein content and amino acid profile. Beside this the native contents of crude protein and amino acids cystine, methionine and lysine in organic peas and <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> vary considerably related to genetic and environmental factors. 20 peas and 12 <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> cultivars from different locations in Germany were selected to analyse the variance of the factor variety on contents of protein and amino acids. Significant effects of variety in peas were noticed on crude protein and methionine while cysteine and lysine were not or only marginally influenced. In <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> only crude protein was affected by variety. In both crops a weak positive correlation between crude protein and amino acids were observed.

40|$|In Organic Farming, {{grain legumes}} are {{important}} protein feedstuffs. There are hints {{indicating that the}} amino acid (AA) profile is affected by factors associated with varying crude protein (CP) contents of crops. The knowledge on this relationship between CP and AA profile needs to be extended to optimize feeding strategies for monogastrics {{as well as the}} selection of cultivars and varieties in fodder crop cultivation. Therefore, samples of 67 <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> (Vicia faba L.) and 86 field peas (Pisum sativum L.) were collected from field trials of various organically managed experimental locations in Germany in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 and analyzed for their contents of CP and AA. Compared to tabular values derived from conventional samples organically produced <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> contained similar amounts of CP, whereas the CP content of field peas was lower. The protein of field peas contained significantly (p < 0. 05) larger amounts of the essential and semi-essential AAs except threonine, histidine and arginine. Thus, the relations between CP and AA differed between <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> and <b>field</b> peas. In <b>field</b> <b>beans,</b> the limiting AAs (for swine and poultry) lysine, methionine, and cysteine were negatively correlated with the CP content. However, the field pea sample revealed negative correlations between the amount of CP and the contents of methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine. The content of arginine increased with decreasing amounts of CP in both grain legume cultivars. Furthermore, the contents of proline and glycine were negatively correlated with the CP content of field peas (p < 0. 01). No notable correlations between the non-essential AAs and CP were found in <b>field</b> <b>beans.</b> The results demonstrate that high CP contents in grain legumes are not the only factor to be considered, when protein feedstuffs for monogastrics in Organic Farming are needed. Although significant negative correlations between essential AA and CP contents are repeatedly found, it is not observed that non-essential AAs mainly account for these changes. Nevertheless, a decline of the amounts of lysine and sulfur-containing AAs negatively affects the quality of crude protein. Further studies with large samples are needed to detect the influence of environmental and genetic factors...|$|R
