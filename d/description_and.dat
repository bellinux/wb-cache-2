40|$|Description grammars {{represent}} a formalism for generating verbal descriptions of designs, {{used in conjunction}} with shape grammars. A description grammar constitutes a set of description rules that define a language of descriptions. A description grammar interpreter implements the mechanisms to interpret <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> rules, apply description rules to descriptions to derive new <b>descriptions,</b> <b>and</b> generate the members of the corresponding language of descriptions. In this paper, we argue the need {{for the development of a}} (general) description grammar interpreter, offer a formal notation for <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> rules, describe the representation <b>and</b> implementation of <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> rules, <b>and</b> provide an example implemented using the description grammar interpreter.

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in <b>description</b> <b>and</b> had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998.

This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, <b>description,</b> <b>and</b> classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Siletzia began in 1906 with Arnold's <b>description</b> <b>and</b> naming {{of a small}} exposure {{on the north side}} of the Olympic Peninsula near Port Crescent. Though this exposure is small, he recognized as very likely that much more of it was buried under younger deposits. With recognition that similar rock exposed at other outcrops is part of the same formation, the name Crescent Formation is now generally applied to all early and middle Eocene basalts on the Olympic Peninsula and Puget Lowland.|$|E
