These include loading effects and interactions with the solid Earth as the ocean mass is redistributed by the tides, and self-gravitation effects of the ocean on itself. However the most important is the dynamical response of the ocean to the tidal forcing, conveniently expressed in terms of Laplace's tidal equations. Because of their long periods surface gravity waves cannot be easily excited and so the long period tides were long assumed to be nearly in equilibrium with the forcing in which case the tide heights should be proportional to the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> and the induced currents should be very weak. Thus it came as a surprise when in 1967 Carl Wunsch published the tide heights for two constituents in the tropical Pacific with distinctly nonequilibrium tides.

Several Sun-frozen families of orbits are identified us-ing the singly-averaged potential, including two new families of orbits and a previously-discovered equatorial heliotropic orbit family. Families of both stable and unstable Sun-frozen orbits are mapped and characterized in the singly-averaged case. In addition, a heliotropic constraint is im-plemented to locate heliotropic orbits out of the equatorial plane using a constrained, doubly-averaged potential. Dynamic bounds for these 3 D he-liotropic orbits are shown to have an inclination limit of approximately 46 degrees for oblate bodies, and this limit is independent {{of the value of}} J 2 and radiation parameters. The resulting heliotropic and related periodic families of orbits are good candidates to consider for low-altitude science orbits around small oblate bodies with low or near- 180 degree obliquity like Bennu, the target for the OSIRIS-REx mission. ...|$|R

40|$|According to Stokes’ approach, {{given the}} gravity anomaly on the geoid as the boundary, a <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> {{function}} satisfying some boundary conditions should be solved. The basic requirement {{is that the}} <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> function should be harmonic in the region outside the geoid. However, since the normal gravity potential is not defined inside the reference ellipsoid (taking the WGS 84 ellipsoid as an example), when the geoid is below the ellipsoidal surface, the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> function is not harmonic in the whole region outside the geoid, and is not defined on the whole geoid itself. These are theoretical difficulties in Stokes’ approach. To remove these difficulties from Stokes’ approach, this study provides a new formulation of Stokes’ approach. An inner ellipsoid with four fundamental parameters is chosen, two of which, the geocentric gravitational constant and the rotational angular velocity, coincide with the corresponding parameters of the WGS 84 ellipsoid. The other two parameters, the semi-major axis and flattening, {{are different from the}} corresponding ones of the ellipsoid. Then, the normal gravity potential generated by the inner ellipsoid is determined, by requiring that it holds a constant {{on the surface of the}} inner ellipsoid or on the surface of the ellipsoid. With this new formulation, the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> function is harmonic in the whole region outside the geoid, and the difficulties in Stokes’ approach disappear. The new formulation proposed in this study is also adequate for analogous geodetic boundary-value problems. </p...|$|E

40|$|As a first {{approximation}} the Earth is a sphere; as {{a second}} approximation it may be considered an ellipsoid of revolution. The deviations of the actual Earth's gravity field from the ellipsoidal 'normal' field are so small {{that they can be}} understood to be linear. The splitting of the Earth's gravity field into a 'normal' and a remaining small 'disturbing' field considerably simplifies the problem of its determination. Under the assumption of an ellipsoidal Earth model high observational accuracy is achievable only if the deviation (deflection of the vertical) of the physical plumb line, to which measurements refer, from the ellipsoidal normal is not ignored. Hence, the determination of the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> from known deflections of the vertical is a central problem of physical geodesy. In this paper we propose a new, well-promising method for modelling the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> locally from the deflections of the vertical.

The determination of the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> from deflections of the vertical is formulated as a multiscale procedure involving scale-dependent regularized versions of the surface gradient of the Green function.

To test the validity of the proposed methodology, a numerical experiment was carried out related to a test region in Southern Brazil.

The root mean square error (RMSE) value for metric offset of BHS derived from geopotential numbers and the <b>disturbing</b> <b>potential</b> modeling in the test area was estimated to be near 0. 224 meters in the absolute view. Therefore, since these spheropotential numbers are referred to a local datum, these results of comparisons may be an indicator of the mean bias of local network due to the effect of local Sea Surface Topography (SSTop) and possible offset between the unknown reference for the BHS and the quasigeoid model in the region...|$|E
