40|$|Kratzer (1991) {{discusses}} syntactic {{restrictions on}} the construction of focus alternatives in the sense of Rooth 1992. She presents an example with a focus in the antecedent of a deleted VP. (d 0) Peter: What a copy cat you are! You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because I did. You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Elk Lake Lodge because I did. And you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because I did. Jane: I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you did. By reconstructing the deleted VP, Jane´s objection becomes I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD. For this sentence standard alternative semantics al-lows for the construction of an alternative set A 0 which comprises predicates like <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood, i. e. predicates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> y. Jane´s objection therefore excludes that she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island. Kratzer claims that this is not intended. The alternative set (A 1) may only comprise predi-cates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x. This restriction is due to syntactic, and not contextual reasons. In constructing an alternative set the focus in a formerly deleted VP must always be replaced by the same value as the corresponding focus in the antecedent VP. Kratzer´s view is widely accepted. We did an experiment to test whether listeners always interpret utterances like Jane´s ac-cording to Kratzer´s hypothesis. We integrated a German analogue of Jane´s objection into two different German dialogues (d 1,d 2). As there is no VP-deletion in German, the German and English examples differ in their anaphoric means. The English example employs VP-deletion, the German ones pronominal anaphora. We placed the dialogues into a context where Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Berlin (resp. Tanglewood), which inspired Jane, who then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Dort-mund (Block Island), Kiel (Elk Lake Lodge) and Berlin. After she came back, Peter went t...|$|R

Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
