In terms of section 96 (1 Ob) of the Rural District Councils Act, Chapter 29 : 13, RDCs may charge levies to owners of mining locations situated on rural land in their areas. The levy is based on either the number of employees or output in tonnes in the case of precious metals. The levy is in the form of unit tax. Section 188 of the Mines and Minerals Act entitles RDCs to receive landowners' fees from mining activities in their areas. This is because, although RDCs are not the legal owners of the communal land under their jurisdiction (the land belongs to the state represented by the president in terms of section 4 of the Communal Land Act, Chapter 20 : 04), sub-section (7) of section 188 specifically provides that they are regarded as the landowners for the purpose of receiving landowners' fees.

40|$|The {{increased}} globalization in {{all fields}} {{of law is}} largely noticeable in today’s society and the environmental legislation is no exception to this rule. Here, the use of different principles on international level is common. One such principle is the ‘Polluter Pays’ Principle (PPP). PPP stems from economic theory and aims to internalize the costs for negative environmental externalities and has been transposed into both international and national law. With basis on the expanding minerals industry in the Nordic countries {{as well as on}} Greenland during the last decade, the aim of the thesis has been to identify what liability an operator has for taking remedying actions for land <b>damages</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>mining</b> activities. I have chosen to examine selected Nordic countries and Greenland by applying a legal dogmatic method, a comparative method and analytical jurisprudence. The results of the thesis show that there are numerous similarities and differences between the examined countries, but that the liability for remediation has been solved in a similar fashion in all countries. This is partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the EU environmental liability directive, {{but it is also a}} result of the similar type of legal techniques found in the examined countries; domestic (national) law is hardly domestic anymore.

5000|$|South African expeditionary forces {{clashed with}} FAPLA T-54/55 tanks during Operation Askari in late 1983 and early 1984; however, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the {{enormous}} logistical commitment {{needed to keep}} the Olifants operational so far from conventional repair facilities, they were not deployed. At length the South African mechanised infantry, bolstered by Eland and Ratel-90 armoured car squadrons, succeeded in destroying the tanks on their own, although severe delays were encountered <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their lack of adequate anti-tank weaponry. Morale also suffered when inexperienced armoured car crews were ordered to take on the Angolan T-54/55s in their vulnerable vehicles. Criticism in this regard led to the deployment of a single squadron of thirteen Olifant Mk1As to the Angolan border, where they were attached to the 61 Mechanised Battalion Group. Following the Lusaka Accords, which effectively ensured a ceasefire between South Africa and Angola, these Olifants were placed into storage and the tank crews rotated out.The collapse of the Lusaka Accords and the subsequent launch of Operation Moduler in late 1987 led to the Olifant squadron being reactivated on the direct orders of South African State President P.W. Botha. On 9 November 1987 the Olifants destroyed two Angolan T-55s during a heated nine-minute skirmish. This marked the first occasion South African tanks had been sent into battle since World War II. Throughout Operation Moduler, South African forces typically dispersed into an [...] "arrowhead" [...] formation, with Olifants in the lead, Ratel-90 armoured cars on the flanks, and the remainder of the mechanised infantry to the rear and centre. Three Olifants were abandoned in a minefield during Operation Packer and subsequently captured by FAPLA, while another two were damaged beyond immediate repair by mines but successfully recovered.

With apparent dangers evaporating, the ship's disguised paint scheme was also dropped and she was returned to civilian colours. Her name was picked out in gilt, her funnels were repainted in their traditional Cunard livery, and her superstructure was painted white again. One alteration was the addition of a bronze/gold coloured band around the base of the superstructure just above the black paint.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Managing {{the risks}} to life and limb and <b>to</b> the {{environment}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> potential accidents and structural failures during the lifecycle phases of a TD is a complex, intricate and dynamic process, because of {{the sheer number of}} hazards that are involved. Fault and event trees enable one to systematically identify these hazards within the context of their intricate relationships. An internationally accepted qualitative scale enables one to assign probabilities in terms of engineering judgement to the sub-causes in the fault trees and the probabilities of the top faults <b>to</b> be calculated. <b>Mine</b> and industry accident statistics enable one to assign relevant frequencies to the subtended event trees and to determine the resulting probabilities of fatal injury or environmental damage. An internationally accepted relationship between lifetime probability of failure causing death and the potential number of fatalities enables one to determine whether the resulting probability of fatal injury is acceptable. If such resulting probability of fatal injury is not acceptable, the biggest contributing subcauses in the underlying fault tree can be identified and mitigating measures considered on an optimal cost benefit basis. The fault trees for the different life cycle phases of the TD also enable one to take cognisance of the dynamic changes in the frequencies of the sub-causes in the various phases and how the risk management focus may change over the life of a TD although the overall threat may not necessarily vary very much. During investigation of the causative modes for personal injury <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>mine</b> accidents/hazards at or on the TD {{it was found that the}} probabilities associated with fatal injury during the life cycle phases considered were acceptable. The sensitivity of the factors was however investigated further to provide confidence, and event and consequence trees were developed for TD road accidents which were identified as having the highest probabilities of occurrence. The most efficient risk management intervention measure evaluated was found to be increasing compliance with the mine’s road traffic safety regulations. Investigation of the causative modes for personal injury <b>due</b> <b>to</b> structural failure of the TD determined that the probabilities associated with fatal injury were acceptable and no risk mitigation measures were thus required. The causative modes for environmental <b>damage</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>mine</b> accidents/hazards were examined next and the probabilities associated with environmental damage were found to be unacceptably high for the life cycle phases considered. Risk management intervention 57 measures were thus required to lower the associated risks to acceptable levels based on relevant and realistic environmental protection guidelines. No mitigation measures were developed as part of the study. Causative modes for environmental <b>damage</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> structural failure of the TD were investigated last. The probabilities associated with environmental damage during the life cycle phases considered were also found to be unacceptably high. Risk mitigation measures were thus required but none were developed as part of the study. Fault and event tree methodology as employed in this study can thus be used as valuable supporting instruments for investigating the causative failure modes of a complex system, the identification of potential risk mitigation measures, and for evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed risk management measures...|$|R
30|$|The Yellow River {{is one of}} {{the rivers}} with largest {{sediment}} concentration in the world (Zhang et al. 2004). The key governance technology of the Yellow River lies in sand control. To ensure the safety of the lower Yellow River, the government has invested huge amounts of money for dredging every year and thousands of hectares of land are occupied by the dredging sediment. It will be a good thing to satisfy both sides if not only the dredging sediment of Yellow River could be properly disposed, but also the shortage of filling materials of mining subsidence land could be solved. Considering the situation that some coal mines are near the Yellow River, reclamation of subsided land with river sediment may be a good way <b>to</b> reclaim <b>damaged</b> land <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>mining</b> subsidence. According <b>to</b> the conclusions of our research team (Wang et al. 2014), the texture type of Yellow River sediment is sand; the pH value of Yellow River sediment is slightly alkaline, electrical conductivity is very low while the contents of organic matter, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total potassium, available potassium, total phosphorus and available phosphorus of Yellow River sediment are considered middle, low or very low. Contaminants such as Cd and Hg are not detected in the Yellow River sediment, and the contents of the heavy metals Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, and As are no more than the primary and secondary standard values of soil environmental quality standard of China (GB 15618 - 1995). Consequently, it seems feasible for Yellow River sediment to be used as reclamation material for mining subsidence land. However, the fertility and retention of both water and nutrients need to be improved. Improved methods of dredging sediment, sediment transportation, filling and drainage technology, and soil profile reconstruction are all needed in order to restore subsided land to productive farmland.|$|R
40|$|The Austrian Geological Survey and Czech {{geological}} {{organizations have}} in their archives source materials {{that can be used}} for the landscape restoration. At many places in the Czech Republic, considerable changes of the environment took place <b>due</b> <b>to</b> building and other industrial activities, especially the mining of mineral raw materials. Changes of relief, river networks and hydrogeological conditions are conspicuous. The largest changes and <b>damages</b> are <b>due</b> <b>to</b> open-cast <b>mining</b> in the North Bohemian and Sokolov brown-coal basins. Other damage was caused by underground black coal-mining, exploitation of uranium and building materials. During huge floods in northern and central Moravia in July 1997, the morphology of the landscape underwent conspicuous changes. Maps and other historical materials are priceless for specialists to solve problems of landscape reclamation and rehabilitation. They document the original morphology, geography and geology of the areas. Not only topographical, but also geological, maps are important enabling estimation of the original situation. In 1989 the Austrian and Czech Geological Surveys proposed a project to use the historical map resources of the Austrian Institute in Vienna and other organisations for rehabilitation and reclamation of the landscape, as part of the long-standing Czech-Austrian co-operation „The history of geology – common work on the condition of geological mapping of the Czech countries up till the years 1918 “. Historical sources will be further analysed for reconstruction mapping in the area of the Becva and Morava rivers in central Moravia. On basis of the agreement for cooperation with Austrian Geological Survey, the Czech Geological survey has obtained colour copies of historical topographic map material from the so-called Joseph (1763 - 1768) and Francis (1810 - 1866) mapping periods from the area of the river beds of Morava and Becva, between Litovle and Uherske Hradiste, that have been most intensively damaged by huge floods. These will enable comparison of changes in the landscape after more than 200 years...|$|R
