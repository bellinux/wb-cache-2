500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} nightdress, 75 {{feet down}} at the bottom of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.|$|E
2500|$|Delta Dawn was {{a healthy}} toddler {{between the ages}} of one and two years old, most likely {{eighteen}} months. Twelve of her teeth had erupted {{at the time of her}} death, which influenced the age estimation. The girl was Caucasian with curly strawberry-blond hair. Because of the amount of time she was in the water, approximately thirty-six to forty-eight hours, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> clouded to the point where estimating the exact color was very difficult, but it was believed that they were either blue or brown. Despite the elemental damage to the eyes, her face was described as in a [...] "recognizable" [...] condition. She was around two feet six inches and weighed around twenty-five pounds. The girl wore a pink and white checkered dress or shirt, decorated with three flowers on its front, along with a diaper.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{determined that}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been removed [...] "not {{less than five}} days and not {{more than three weeks}} before her death". She had been starved, having lost around 20kg in weight, and had not received water for several days before her death. Peter Openshaw, the prosecutor in Smith's trial, said: [...] "It was as if he deliberately disfigured her, causing her the utmost pain, distress and degradation... The injuries were not the result of one sudden eruption of violence, they must have been caused over a long period [...] were so extensive and so terrible that the defendant must have deliberately and systematically tortured the girl." [...] The cause of death was drowning, immediately prior to which she had been beaten about the head with a shower head. Openshaw said that [...] "Her death must have been a merciful end to her torment".|$|E
60|$|Affecting to laugh, she got an {{opportunity}} of putting {{her hand to}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>Having</b> availed herself of it, she resumed her toast and her discourse together.|$|R
60|$|LADY TEAZLE. No {{more she}} does--yet one is always disapointed when one hears [her] speak--For though <b>her</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>have</b> {{no kind of}} meaning in them--she very seldom talks Nonsense.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{shot from}} the music video where Rihanna is seen imprisoned. She is wearing lenses that make her look as if <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>have</b> rolled {{into the back of}} her head.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been {{swelling}} {{with tears}} again, and she {{ended with a}} sob.|$|E
60|$|She seemed calmer, also, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> lost {{something}} of their tension of appeal.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed his}} arm around her. A wild flash in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> {{suddenly}} revealed her thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is that person?" [...] {{asked the}} queen, steadily, but not severely, <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>having</b> turned {{again to the}} face of the girl, with an {{interest}} that continued to increase as she gazed.|$|R
60|$|Miss Jane {{pointed to}} the letter, still {{remaining}} transfixed {{to the spot where}} <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> first met it, as if it were some dangerous animal which would bite if she touched it.|$|R
60|$|ALEEL. The {{trouble that}} has come on Countess Cathleen, The sorrow that is in her wasted face, The burden in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>have</b> broke my wits, And yet I know I'd have you take my soul.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{gave him}} a quick glance and he thought <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> softened, but she got up.|$|E
60|$|We sat for {{a moment}} in {{helpless}} silence, gazing at one another. Slowly <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> filled.|$|E
60|$|Through her narrative, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> held his, but now {{she glanced}} about, noted Olive, and seemed uneasy.|$|E
6000|$|... "But not the prettiest, I trust. She is too {{like her}} father, with those dark brows, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>have</b> a look {{deep enough to}} frighten one. They will frighten away the men, if she do not grow out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet there needed {{not these}} letters {{to guide the}} {{agitated}} spirit of Venetia, for, before <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> reached them, the word was spoken; and falling on her knees before the portrait, the daughter of Lady Annabel had exclaimed, 'My father!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Shortman raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which <b>had</b> such a {{peculiar}} spiritual glow.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} exultant, for <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> already confessed the secret which her lips still shrank from uttering.|$|E
60|$|An {{expression}} of irresolution passed {{for an instant}} over her face, but <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> hardened again when she answered me.|$|E
60|$|Frona embraced {{them all}} with a comrade smile, and each man felt that for an instant <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> looked {{straight}} into his.|$|E
6000|$|Mademoiselle shuddered. [...] "Let us go," [...] she {{repeated}} in a faint whisper; <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> also fallen on that thing, {{and her voice}} was full of awe. She laid her hand upon my sleeve and 'neath the suasion of her touch I moved away.|$|R
6000|$|The flap of {{the bureau}} chanced to be open, and in placing her muff upon it <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> caught a {{document}} which lay there. [...] "Oh--only a--funny surprise!" [...] she said, trying to laugh away her cry as {{she came back to}} the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did ever anybody see the like?" [...] screamed Mrs. Poyser, running {{towards the}} table when <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> fallen on the blue stream. [...] "The child's allays i' {{mischief}} if your back's turned a minute. What shall I do to you, you naughty, naughty gell?" ...|$|R
60|$|Having heard, {{she said}} nothing; but Lady Valleys noticed with alarm that over <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> come {{suddenly}} the peculiar filminess of age.|$|E
60|$|The Queen {{she walked}} in Falkland yaird, Beside the Hollans green, And there she saw the bonniest man That ever <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> seen.|$|E
60|$|For {{several seconds}} she was silent. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> {{contracted}} a little. She {{seemed to be}} seeking for some double meaning in his words.|$|E
60|$|But Margery {{had hardly}} given herself time to heed these things. <b>Her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> been caught by objects of quite another quality. A large white oblong paper box lay against {{the inside of}} the tree; over it, on a splinter, hung a small oval looking-glass.|$|R
60|$|Even Mrs. Willoughby and Beulah {{laughed at}} this, {{though not a}} smile had crossed Maud's face, since <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> lost Robert Willoughby from view. The captain's ideas seemed {{to take a new}} direction, and he was silent some little time before he spoke.|$|R
60|$|Lucille opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She <b>had</b> been {{leaning back}} amongst the railway cushions.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard her}} give a gulp, and I saw that <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> become moistish. Drenched irises, {{if you care}} to put it that way.|$|E
60|$|I {{seemed to}} have been unfortunate in my choice of a conversation. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> grown larger. The quivering of her lips was almost pitiful.|$|E
60|$|She did not reply. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> narrowed a little, as the Colonel's were {{sometimes}} prone to do, {{and her lips}} were pressed firmly together.|$|E
6000|$|Max. 'Tis just: This Christian sorceress shall die. [...] Would I {{had never}} proved her sorcery!

6000|$|... "So you've gone an' done it," [...] Mary commented, {{one morning}} in the laundry. They had not been at work ten minutes ere <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> glimpsed the topaz ring on the third finger of Saxon's left hand. [...] "Who's the lucky one?

6000|$|Her {{skin was}} of Egyptian brown: [...] Haughty, as if <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>had</b> seen [...] Its own light to a {{distance}} thrown, [...] She towered, fit {{person for a}} Queen [2] [...] 10 [...] To lead [3] those ancient Amazonian files; [...] Or ruling Bandit's wife among the Grecian isles.|$|R
