5|$|Also at {{the dawn}} of the new century, however, rising demand for coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E
5|$|As Connecticut {{was only}} 55% {{complete}} {{when she was}} launched, missing most of her upper works, protection, machinery and armament, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years before Connecticut was commissioned on 29 September 1906. Captain William Swift was the first captain of the new battleship. Connecticut sailed out of New York {{for the first time}} on 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the US Navy to ever go to sea without a sea trial. She first journeyed south to the Virginia Capes, where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by a shakedown cruise and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico. During the cruise, she participated in a search for the missing steamer Ponce.|$|E

5|$|Authors of the 12th and 13th centuries such as Joseph of Exeter and Albert of Stade {{continued}} {{to tell the}} legend of the Trojan War in Latin in a form that follows Dares' tale with Troilus remaining {{one of the most important}} warriors on the Trojan side. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> of their contemporaries, Benoît de Sainte-Maure in his French verse romance and Guido delle Colonne in his Latin prose history, both also admirers of Dares, who were to define the tale of Troy for the remainder of the medieval period. The details of their narrative of the war were copied, for example, in the Troy Books of Laud and Lydgate and also Raoul Lefevre's Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. Lefevre, through Caxton's 1474 printed translation, was in turn to become the best known retelling of the Troy story in Renaissance England and influenced Shakespeare among others. The story of Troilus as a lover, invented by Benoît and retold by Guido, generated a second line of influence. It was taken up as a tale that could be told in its own right by Boccaccio and then by Chaucer who established a tradition of retelling and elaborating the story in English-language literature, which was to be followed by Henryson and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 2014, Harris {{was named}} to the Futures All-Star roster for the 2014 NBA D-League All-Star Game. At the time of the announcement, Harris was one of at five players on an NBA roster that were selected, but who had played over half of their D-League team's games through January 26. On February 4, the eve of the end of Harris' second 10-day contract, the Lakers {{appeared}} to be returning to good health, with the return of Nash, Blake and Farmar to the lineup imminent. That night, although Nash and Blake returned to the starting lineup against Minnesota, Jodie Meeks and Jordan Hill were injured in the first quarter and Harris contributed 19 points and 8 rebounds even though he had been told before the game he would not be re-signed. On February 7, 2014, he was re-acquired by the D-Fenders. On February 8, 2014, Harris again set a new D-Fenders franchise scoring record, this time with 56 points, while adding 15 rebounds against the Santa Cruz Warriors. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> points shy of the league record set by Jackson four days earlier. He was a nominee for D-League Player of the Week, but Jackson won. Harris played 12 minutes in the February 15 D-League All-Star game. Afterwards, he missed some games due to an ankle injury. He was a finalist for player of the week on March 3 and 10. After playing a total of 22 games in the NBA D-League for the D-Fenders and averaging 31.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists, Harris signed with Türk Telekom B.K. of the Turkish Basketball League on March 13.|$|E

5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which {{was at the center of}} the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E

It was decided to leave the decision to join an Indian federation up to Bhutan when the time came. When British rule over India ended in 1947, so too did Britain's association with Bhutan. India succeeded Britain as the de facto protector of the Himalayan kingdom, and Bhutan retained control over its internal government. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years, however, before a formal agreement recognized Bhutan's independence.|$|E

Under Coryell, the Chargers were known as Air Coryell for the deep passing game and the involvement of the tight end as a key receiver.

25|$|The {{defeat at}} Rignano enabled the Norman conquest of Naples, since Sergius died without heir and the Neapolitan nobility {{could not reach}} a {{succession}} agreement. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years between Sergius' death and Naples' incorporation by Sicily. The nobility apparently ruled during the interim, {{which may have been}} the final period of Neapolitan independence from Norman rule. During this period Norman landowners first appear in Naples, although the Pisans (enemies of Roger II) retained their alliance with the duchy and Pisa may have sustained its independence until 1139. That year, Roger absorbed Naples into his kingdom; Pope Innocent II and the Neapolitan nobility acknowledged Roger's young son, Alfonso of Hauteville, as duke.|$|E
25|$|The {{geography}} of the Soviet Union includes the geographic features of {{the countries of the}} former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

It covered most of the northern half of Asia and a large part of Eastern Europe, extending even into the Middle East. About one quarter of its territory was in Europe, and the rest in Asia. The territory of the USSR was dominated by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic—having the same borders as contemporary Russia—which covered roughly three quarters of the surface area of the union.|$|E

A month later, in Turlock, California, the body of Cynthia Lyn Rose was discovered. He claims she was a prostitute who entered his truck at a truck stop while he slept. His fourth victim was another prostitute, Laurie Ann Pentland of Salem, Oregon. Her body was found in November of that year. According to Jesperson, she attempted to double the fee she charged for the sex he had been engaged in with her. She threatened to call the police, and he strangled her.|$|E

The next race at Bristol, Speed was running a strong race before contact late with Rick Mast ruined his chances at a top ten finish. After Bristol, Speed was replaced by Ernie Irvan. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> races later at Dover where Speed found another ride, this time replacing Geoff Bodine who had departed from Bud Moore's Ford to drive his own team which he purchased following Alan Kulwicki's death.

In his first year coaching at Roscoe, Wood took his team through an undefeated season and won the district championship only to lose the first game in the state playoffs.
