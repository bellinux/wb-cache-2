40|$|Despite much effort, {{identification}} of modular structures and study of their organizing and functional roles remain a formidable challenge in molecular systems biology, which, however, {{is essential in}} reaching a systematic understanding of large-scale cell regulation networks and hence gaining capacity of exerting effective interference to cell activity. Combining graph theoretic methods with available dynamics information, we successfully retrieved multiple feedback modules of three important signaling networks. These feedbacks are structurally arranged in a hierarchical way and dynamically produce layered temporal profiles of output signals. We found that global and local feedbacks act {{in very different ways}} and on distinct features of the information flow conveyed by signal transduction but work highly coordinately to implement specific biological functions. The redundancy embodied with multiple signal-relaying channels and feedback controls bestow great robustness and the reaction <b>hubs</b> <b>seated</b> at junctions of different paths announce their paramount importance through exquisite parameter management. The current investigation reveals intriguing general features of the organization of cell signaling networks and their relevance to biological function, which may find interesting applications in analysis, design and control of bio-networks...|$|R

5000|$|The {{historic}} Town Hall of Kraków, {{known as}} Ratusz in Polish, was demolished in 1820. It was constructed of brick and mortar {{for the first}} time in 1316 as one of its subsequent several versions built over the following centuries. It was the city's administrative <b>hub</b> and <b>seat</b> of the great council, magistrate, and mayor from the 14th until the early 19th century. It was located in the centre of Main Square in the Kraków Old Town. It used to be one of Poland's oldest seats of civic government. Of the building, only the Town Hall Tower remains, serving as prominent example of the Polish Gothic architecture in the city.|$|R
50|$|In 1869, {{due to its}} {{importance}} as a major transportation <b>hub,</b> the county <b>seat</b> was moved to Clinton; it has resided there ever since. The Clinton County Court House, located at 612 North 2nd Street, was designed by G. Stanley Mansfield, Architect, of Freeport, Illinois, and Josiah L. Rice, Supervising Architect, of Clinton. It was constructed between 1892 and 1897.|$|R
50|$|Probably one {{the rarest}} models ever {{produced}} by IH was the 1980 RS: the Special Limited Edition RS Scout. This package was only {{available on the}} Traveler in Tahitian Red (metallic). It had special extras inside and out, including polycast wheels with Tahitian Red (metallic) accent, luxurious plush all-velour russet interior including headliner and visors, special pin striping, wood grain trim instrument panel and shift console, chrome bumpers, tinted glass, and more. Two other special packages offered in 1980 were the 844 and 434 Gold Star Models. The 844 offered standard equipment plus a 345 V-8, HD clutch, T428 4-speed manual transmission, 2.72 rear axle ratio, AM radio, rear <b>seat,</b> <b>hub</b> caps, special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet while the 434 offered standard equipment plus 4-196 engine, T332 3-speed transmission, 3:73 rear axle ratio, black vinyl interior, AM radio, rear <b>seat,</b> <b>hub</b> caps, special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet.|$|R
40|$|Reality and Fiction collide, opposites {{interact}} {{and the local}} film culture is enhanced with {{the design of a}} home for the Puerto Rico International Film Festival. PRIFF is an opportunity to create a formal destination for individuals passionate about film and to establish the basis for a Puerto Rican film culture in a setting where users will {{interact and}} exchange ideas while they experience the shift between reality and fiction expressed in the architecture. The project is a hybrid idea that combines Cinemas, Cultural Center and Production Studios.

2500|$|Elm wood {{is valued}} for its {{interlocking}} grain, and consequent resistance to splitting, with significant uses in wagon wheel <b>hubs,</b> chair <b>seats</b> and coffins. The bodies of Japanese Taiko drums are often {{cut from the}} wood of old elm trees, as the wood's resistance to splitting is highly desired for nailing the skins to them, {{and a set of}} three or more is often cut from the same tree. The elm's wood bends well and distorts easily making it quite pliant. [...] The often long, straight, trunks were favoured as a source of timber for keels in ship construction. Elm is also prized by bowyers; of the ancient bows found in Europe, a large portion of them are elm. During the Middle Ages elm was also used to make longbows if yew was unavailable.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of Minneapolis, the {{neighborhood}} was called [...] "Bridge Square", because it lay at the southern foot of the Hennepin Avenue Bridge and it was the commercial <b>hub</b> and government <b>seat</b> of the growing city. An early courthouse and city hall were located in a triangle-shaped building in between Washington, Hennepin and, Nicollet from 1873 to 1912. Some of the early permanent structures on the West side of Minneapolis were built directly across from that building.|$|R
5000|$|All models {{may have}} the wheels on {{the corners of the}} rack {{replaced}} with larger eazy wheels, to aid pushing when folded and to give greater heel clearance than the stock rollers. All models can choose to have no lights, lighting powered from battery, or two variants of front wheel <b>hub</b> dynamo. <b>Seat</b> posts can be swapped between standard length, extended or telescopic for tall riders (titanium and, later, aluminium equivalents previously fitted to the lightweight models are no longer available). Bicycles are offered in four colours at no additional charge: Black, White, Orange and Cobalt Blue. [...] Other colours, raw lacquer, and titanium are available at extra cost. Titanium areas are left unpainted, in their natural titanium colour. The standard Brompton saddle can be substituted by a Brooks B17 Special leather saddle ladies' or men's versions. Non-titanium models have braze-on fittings for holding the supplied Zefal HP compact high-pressure bicycle pump.|$|R

The area, {{in contrast to}} Hayes and inner western suburbs, is without brutalist tower blocks, and is instead beside the Colne Valley regional park. The highest density of buildings is found close to historic Uxbridge town centre, a London <b>hub</b> in a <b>seat</b> that is ethnically diverse and prosperous, including on its outskirts Brunel University, with most electoral wards voting Conservative {{with the exception of}} Uxbridge South, which returns Labour councillors.

5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical <b>hub,</b> being the <b>seat</b> of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{integrated}} capacitated hub location problem and seat inventory control considering concept and techniques of revenue management. We consider an airline company maximizes its revenue by utilizing the best network topology and providing proper booking limits for all itineraries and fare classes. The transportation system arises {{in the form of}} a star/star network and includes both hub-stop and non-stop flights. This problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic integer program with mixed-integer recourse. We solve various instances carried out from the Turkish network data set. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose a hybrid optimization method, consisting of an evolutionary algorithm based on genetic algorithm and exact solution. The quality of the solutions found by the proposed meta-heuristic is compared with the original version of GA and the mathematical programming model. The results obtained by the proposed model imply that integrating <b>hub</b> location and <b>seat</b> inventory control problem would help to increase the total revenue of airline companies. Also, in the case of serving non-stop flights, the model can provide more profit by employing less number of hubs...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-three human cadaver {{tests are}} used in the {{development}} of thoracic injury risk functions with consideration of age and restraint condition. Linear logistic regression models are developed with the set of potential predictors including the maximum chest deflection, the age of the cadaver at death, gender, and the loading condition on the anterior thorax: blunt <b>hub</b> (41 tests), <b>seat</b> belt (26 tests), air bag (12 tests), and combined belt-and-bag (14 tests). Predicted outcomes were the probability of any rib fractures (onset of injury) and the probability of greater than six rib fractures (severe injury). The analysis shows that the injury risk function was not dependent on the loading condition, but was strongly dependent on age. A significant injury risk model with good ability to discriminate injury from non-injury tests (P < 0. 0001, chi-square 21. 49, area under receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) 0. 867, Kruskal’s Gamma 0. 732) is presented using only maximum chest deflection and cadaver age as predictors of injury risk. The 50 % risk of any rib fractures is found to occur at 35 % chest deflection for a 30 -year-old, but at 13 % deflection for a 70 -year-old. The 50 % risk of severe injury is shown to occur at 33 % chest deflection for a 70 -year-old, but at 43 % for a 30 -year-old...|$|R
40|$|Jerusalem The Bookshop This {{semester}} we {{were set}} out to design a building for our given city. Each week we were given exercises {{to come to a}} final design for a particular building function within the city. I designed a bookshop for the city of Jerusalem. The bookshop consists of three levels, and a roof garden that will be used for book launches. From wanting to design an interesting set of stairs, I set the goal of my building to have an extravagant form of circulation. With stairs that split at the first landing, I wanted people to make a decision of weather they wanted {{to go up to the}} first floor or the second floor. From there, the circulation on each level was formed by the walls in which the books are to be shelved. To get to the roof top, one has to enter a small doorway on the second floor. The set of stairs within the doorway are enclosed by the walls, trying to give off a medieval, castle-like feeling, like walking through a tunnel. The building is made of Jerusalem stone, and contains thick interior curved walls. Within the walls, there are small <b>seating</b> <b>hubs</b> for people to sit and read in. The ground floor contains two adjoining outdoor courtyards, and a small café. Even though it is a bookstore, I wanted people to still be able to sit inside or out and read without having to purchase a book. The register desk on the ground floor connects with the interior curved walls, and is also made out of Jerusalem stone, making the register look as though it is part of the wall.
