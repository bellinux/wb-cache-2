40|$|This method {{applies to}} the {{measurement}} of total nickel emissions from stationary sources. 1. 2 Principle Particulate and gaseous emissions are extracted isokinetically from the stack and passed through a filter-impinger train where the nickel is collected on a glass-fiber filter and in a solution of nitric acid. The combined filter extract and <b>impinger</b> <b>solution</b> are analyzed for nickel by atomic absorption spectrometry using the direct aspiration flame method (flame AA). (Ref. 10. 1.) Unless otherwise specified, all discussion in this test method is based on these principles. 2 DETECTION LIMIT AND WORKING RANGE The typical detection limit for the recommended analytical technique, flame AA, is 40 ug/L of solution analyzed. The typical working range is 300 to 5, 000 ug/L of solution analyzed. 2. 1 Coordination of Sampling and Analysis At a minimum, the following calculations shall be performed before conducting a test.

Small-scale combustion experiments {{were conducted in}} the cone calorimeter, where generally well-ventilated combustion conditions are attained. Measurements were further made in two different full-scale experiments. Isocyanates and amino-compounds were sampled using an impinger-filter sampling system with a reagent solution of di-n-butylamine in toluene. Filter and <b>impinger</b> <b>solution</b> were analysed separately using LC-MS technique. Further the particulate distribution in the smoke gases was determined by impactor technique, and selected gaseous compounds quantified by FTIR. It {{was found in the}} small-scale that isocyanates were produced from the majority of the materials tested. The highest concentration was found for glass wool insulation, and further high concentrations were found for PUR products, particleboard, nitrile rubber and melamine. Lower concentrations were found for wood and cable-products. Amino-isocyanates and amines were generally found from PUR products only. The distribution of isocyanates between the particulate- and fluid phases varied for the different materials and a tendency to enrichment of particles was seen for some of the materials. Further, when comparing the potential health hazard between isocyanates and other major fire gases (based on NIOSH IDLH-values) it was found that isocyanates in several cases represented the greatest hazard...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{assessment}} {{data collected}} in two prior occupational hygiene studies of swine barns and sawmills allowed {{the comparison of}} concurrent, triplicate, side-by-side endotoxin measurements using air sampling filters and bioaerosol impingers. Endotoxin concentrations in <b>impinger</b> <b>solutions</b> and filter eluates were assayed using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. In sawmills, impinger sampling yielded significantly higher endotoxin concentration measurements and lower variances than filter sampling with IOM inhalable dust samplers. Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed that this association remained after controlling for other factors such as replicate, sawmill, sawmill operation, wood type, and interaction terms. Endotoxin concentrations in the swine barns were 10 -fold higher on average than in sawmills. These samples demonstrated comparable endotoxin concentration estimates for impinger and filter methods although the variability was lower using the impinger method. In both occupational settings, side-by-side replicates were more uniform for the impinger samples than for the filter samples. This study demonstrates that impinger sampling is an acceptable method for quantitation of area endotoxin concentrations. Further, when sampling is performed with impingers for airborne microorganism quantitation, these same <b>impinger</b> <b>solutions</b> can yield valid endotoxin exposure estimates, negating {{the need for additional}} filter sampling...|$|R

40|$|EN] Mercury {{displays}} a different reactivity and behaviour depending on its speciation. Determination of the mercury species present in combustion flue gases {{is important for}} proposing effective control technologies. The Ontario Hydro (OH) method is accepted as the only wet-chemical method suitable for measuring total and speciated mercury in flue gases. However, the continuous development of combustion technologies {{has the effect of}} modifying the operational variables and the composition of the resulting flue gases, leading to measurement biases in mercury determination. In this work, an alternative method based on the use of an ionic exchanger resin is proposed for the determination of gaseous oxidised mercury. The results show that for sampling flue gases containing reactive gases over long periods of time, the use of this resin is a suitable method for determining gaseous elemental and oxidised mercury, even in the presence of large amounts SO 2 or NO 2. Application of the OH method when elevated amounts of SO 2 or NO 2 are present in the gas composition leads to an overestimation of the amount of oxidised mercury due to the oxidation of the mercury in the KCl <b>impinger</b> <b>solution.</b> The financial support for this work was provided by the project CTM 2011 – 22921.

40|$|Collection of {{atmospheric}} H 2 O 2 {{was performed by}} a cold trap method using dry ice-acetone as the refrigerant. The air was drawn by a pump into a glass gas trap immersed in the dry ice-acetone slush in a dewar flask at a flow rate of 2. 5 l min- 1 for approximately 2 h. Collection efficiency was > 99 % and negligible interferences by O 3, SO 2 or organic matter with the collected H 2 O 2 in the trap were observed. This method was compared with the air impinger bubbling method which has been previously described (Kok et al., 1978 a, b, Envir. Sci. Technol. 12, 1072 - 1080). The measured total peroxide (H 2 O 2 + organic peroxide) values {{in a series of}} aim samples collected by the impinger bubbling method (0. 06 - 3. 7 ppb) were always higher than those obtained by the cold trap method (0. 02 - 1. 2 ppb). Laboratory experiments suggest that the difference in values between the two methods probably results from the aqueous phase generation of H 2 O 2 and organic peroxide in the <b>impinger</b> <b>solution</b> by a reaction {{of atmospheric}} O 3 with olefinic and aromatic compounds. If these O 3 -organic compound reactions which occur in the impinger also occur in aqueous droplets in the atmosphere, the process could be very important for aqueous phase generation of H 2 O 2 in clouds and rainwater...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this paper was the identification and quantification of various chemical forms of mercury in coal flue gas. To this end, bench-scale evaluations were carried out on the Ontario-Hydro Method to determine its capability to selectively isolate and retain various mercury species captured from flue gas streams containing moderate to high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }). Loss of mercury from the oxidized mercury capture solutions through chemical reduction by sulfur dioxide has been documented previously from both bench- and pilot- scale studies. Results from recent studies, giving further verification of this phenomenon with emphasis on optimization of sampling conditions to minimize this impediment to effective mercury speciation, are presented. All speciation methods utilizing impinger trains were configured in a similar manner. The impingers immediately down-stream of the heated sampling probe and filter box contained solutions intended to capture oxidized (ionic) mercury while impingers further down-stream of these contained acidic potassium pennanganate (KMnO{sub 4 }). These latter solutions, having been shown by the EPA in their Method 101 A validation studies to capture all forms of mercury, were utilized here to capture the remaining elemental mercury. The challenge was to develop, test and validate an oxidized mercury capture solution that would effectively capture and retain all of the oxidized mercury species while allowing 100 % of the elemental mercury to pass through it and be captured down- stream in the KMnO{sub 4 } impinger solutions. A schematic of the impinger train utilized in the Ontario-Hydro Method is shown in Figure 1. For oxidized mercury capture, this method utilizes a 1. 0 molar potassium chloride (KCI) <b>impinger</b> <b>solution,</b> which we have shown to be effective in its ability to retain mercuric chloride solution spikes given the appropriate sampling conditions...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{papers have}} {{addressed}} the significant positive biases {{associated with the use}} of EPA Method 202 for the measurement of condensable particulate matter (“CPM”) emissions. These biases are due, in part, to the oxidation of soluble gases inadvertently captured in the cold <b>impinger</b> <b>solutions</b> used in Method 202 sampling trains. In some cases, the artifact CPM formed from gases in the impingers can be up to ten times the concentration of filterable particulate matter in the sample gas stream. The CPM emissions measured by Method 202 can significantly over-state the actual emissions of CPM to the atmosphere. In response to the bias problems, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (“U. S. EPA”) has been actively developing an air dilution sampling train that can be used to measure CPM without the use of water-filled impingers. This air dilution method is available as EPA Conditional Test Method 039 (“CTM 039 ”). Unfortunately, this method requires extremely large bulky sampling equipment, is expensive to operate, cannot distinguish between filterable and condensable PM 2. 5 emissions, and is vulnerable to significant wall losses of CPM. The authors are not aware of any uses of CTM 039 outside of limited EPA research test programs...|$|R

40|$|Oxidized mercury {{species may}} be formed in {{combustion}} systems through gas-phase reactions between elemental mercury and halogens, such as chorine or bromine. This study examines how bromine species affect mercury oxidation {{in the gas}} phase and examines the effects of mixtures of bromine and chlorine on extents of oxidation. Experiments were conducted in a bench-scale, laminar flow, methane-fired (300 W), quartz-lined reactor in which gas composition (HCl, HBr, NO{sub x}, SO{sub 2 }) and temperature profile were varied. In the experiments, the post-combustion gases were quenched from flame temperatures to about 350 C, and then speciated mercury was measured using a wet conditioning system and continuous emissions monitor (CEM). Supporting kinetic calculations were performed and compared with measured levels of oxidation. A significant portion of this report is devoted to sample conditioning {{as part of the}} mercury analysis system. In combustion systems with significant amounts of Br{sub 2 } in the flue gas, the <b>impinger</b> <b>solutions</b> used to speciate mercury may be biased and care must be taken in interpreting mercury oxidation results. The stannous chloride solution used in the CEM conditioning system to convert all mercury to total mercury did not provide complete conversion of oxidized mercury to elemental, when bromine was added to the combustion system, resulting in a low bias for the total mercury measurement. The use of a hydroxylamine hydrochloride and sodium hydroxide solution instead of stannous chloride showed a significant improvement in the measurement of total mercury. Bromine was shown to be much more effective in the post-flame, homogeneous oxidation of mercury than chlorine, on an equivalent molar basis. Addition of NO to the flame (up to 400 ppmv) had no impact on mercury oxidation by chlorine or bromine. Addition of SO{sub 2 } had no effect on mercury oxidation by chlorine at SO{sub 2 } concentrations below about 400 ppmv; some increase in mercury oxidation was observed at SO{sub 2 } concentrations of 400 ppmv and higher. In contrast, SO{sub 2 } concentrations as low as 50 ppmv significantly reduced mercury oxidation by bromine, this reduction could be due to both gas and liquid phase interactions between SO{sub 2 } and oxidized mercury species. The simultaneous presence of chlorine and bromine in the flue gas resulted in a slight increase in mercury oxidation above that obtained with bromine alone, the extent of the observed increase is proportional to the chlorine concentration. The results of this study can be used to understand the relative importance of gas-phase mercury oxidation by bromine and chlorine in combustion systems. Two temperature profiles were tested: a low quench (210 K/s) and a high quench (440 K/s). For chlorine the effects of quench rate were slight and hard to characterize with confidence. Oxidation with bromine proved sensitive to quench rate with significantly more oxidation at the lower rate. The data generated in this program are the first homogeneous laboratory-scale data on bromine-induced oxidation of mercury in a combustion system. Five Hg-Cl and three Hg-Br mechanisms, some published and others under development, were evaluated and compared to the new data. The Hg-halogen mechanisms were combined with submechanisms from Reaction Engineering International for NO{sub x}, SO{sub x}, and hydrocarbons. The homogeneous kinetics under-predicted the levels of mercury oxidation observed in full-scale systems. This shortcoming can be corrected by including heterogeneous kinetics in the model calculations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diisocyanates {{are widely}} used in surface coatings, {{polyurethane}} (PUR) foams, adhesives, resins, elastomers, binders, and sealants. Isocyanate exposure is irritative to the skin, mucous membranes, eyes, and respiratory tract.

Objective: The goal {{of this study is}} to find statistical predictive model to determine the relationship between airborne hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and selective psychrometric variables.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{potential}} toxicological impact of particles produced during biomass combustion by an automatic pellet boiler and a traditional logwood stove under various combustion conditions using a novel profluorescent nitroxide probe BPEAnit. This probe is weakly fluorescent, but yields strong fluorescence emission upon radical trapping or redox activity. Samples {{were collected by}} bubbling aerosol through an <b>impinger</b> containing BPEAnit <b>solution,</b> followed by fluorescence measurement. The fluorescence of BPEAnit was measured for particles produced during various combustion phases, {{at the beginning of}} burning (cold start), stable combustion after refilling with the fuel (warm start) and poor burning conditions. For particles produced by the logwood stove under cold-start conditions significantly higher amounts of reactive species per unit of particulate mass were observed compared to emissions produced during a warm start. In addition, sampling of logwood burning emissions after passing through a thermodenuder at 250 oC resulted in an 80 - 100 % reduction of the fluorescence signal of BPEAnit probe, indicating that the majority of reactive species were semivolatile. Moreover, the amount of reactive species showed a strong correlation with the amount of particulate organic material. This indicates the importance of semivolatile organics in particle-related toxicity. Particle emissions from the pellet boiler, although of similar mass concentration, were not observed to lead to an increase in fluorescence signal during any of the combustion phases...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia is {{generated}} in mainstream smoke (MSS) from multiple precursors in tobacco such as amino acids, proteins, nitrates and ammonium salts. Ammonia derived {{from both the}} particulate and vapor phases is measured with the particulate phase contributing greater than 80 % of the total ammonia. The general approach of the analytical methods involved the collection of MSS by either electrostatic precipitation (EP) or <b>impingers</b> with acidic <b>solution</b> combined with Cambridge filters (CF, 44 or 92 mm) and the analysis of ammonium cations by ion chromatography (IC) with a conductivity detector. The available results from both internal testing and external literature for 1 R 4 F Kentucky reference cigarettes, smoked under Federal Trade Commission (FTC) puffing conditions, showed {{a wide range of}} yields from approximately 5 to 18 µg/cig of ammonia. To investigate possible causes for this wide range and to optimize the analytical method, several parameters deemed critical to the results were studied using 1 R 4 F. They include the type of acids (hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and malic acid), acid strength (0. 005 M to 0. 1 M), trapping efficiency and sample stability. The study showed that the type and concentration of acids was not significantly related to the total ammonia content in MSS.
