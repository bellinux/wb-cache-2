40|$|Abstract-The {{properties}} of a neutral lunar atmosphere are investigated theoretically. A non-uniformity {{is shown to}} result from the temperature variations and non-uniform gas source dis-tribution {{on the surface of}} the Moon. An integral equation governing the distribution <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>fluxes,</b> in the steady state, is formulated. This equation is solved by computer and analytical methods. Solutions are obtained and discussed for mass numbers ranging from hydrogen to the heavy gases. Characteristic relaxation times for approach to the steady state are estimated and found generally to be a small fraction of the synodic period. It is concluded that in all cases a marked anisotropy <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>fluxes</b> can be expected. By measuring these fluxes conclusions can be drawn about the distribution of gas sources, the physical {{properties of}} the surface and the composition of the lunar atmosphere. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} circumnuclear molecular gaseous contents and {{their relation to}} the nuclear activity, researchers made a search for circumnuclear (12) CO (J= 1 - 0) emission from 28 starburst-nucleus galaxies (SBNs) and 12 Seyfert galaxies with the recession velocities less than 5000 km/s, using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 -m telescope. The full half-power beam width of 17 arcsec covers a region of less than about 5 kpc in diameter for the sample galaxies. The circumnuclear CO emission was detected from twelve SBNs (one is marginal) and four Seyfert galaxies. The main results and conclusions are summarized. Researchers derived the circumnuclear surface <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> gas which is corrected for inclination of the galaxies. This analysis shows that the surface density spans a wide range over two orders of magnitude. Further, {{there is no significant}} difference in the surface densities between types 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies. Thus, we may conclude that the circumnuclear molecular content is not a key parameter producing the dichotomy of the Seyfert galaxies. It is also shown that there is {{no significant difference in the}} circumnuclear surface <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> gas among the Seyfert, starburst, and normal galaxies. This implies that the circumnuclear gaseous content is not a key parameter determining which activity occurs in nuclei. We may conclude that more centrally condensed (i. e., less than 10 - 100 pc in diameter) gas components play an essential role on the occurrence of nuclear activities. Comparing results with the previous ones, researchers deduced radial distribution <b>of</b> surface <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> gases.

These new data provide a lower opacity tracer <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> clouds and improved angular and spectral resolution compared to previous surveys <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> line emission along the Galactic Plane. We calculate GMC masses within the SRBY cloud boundaries assuming LTE conditions throughout the cloud and a constant H 2 to 13 CO abundance, while {{accounting for the}} variation of the 12 C / 13 C with Galacto-centric radius. The LTE derived masses are typically five times smaller than the SRBY virial masses. The corresponding median mass surface <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> hydrogen for this sample is 42 M⊙pc − 2, which is {{significantly lower than the}} value derived by SRBY (median 206 M⊙pc − 2) that has been widely adopted by most models of cloud evolution and star formation. This discrepancy arises from both the extrapolation by SRBY of velocity dispersion, size, and CO luminosity to the 1 K antenna temperature isophote that likely overestimates the GMC masses and our assumption of constant 13 CO abundance over the projected area of each cloud. Owing to the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> abundances in the envelopes of clouds, the mass surface <b>density</b> <b>of</b> giant <b>molecular</b> clouds could be larger than the valued derived from our 13 CO measurements.

In this work, we study the gaseous environment of a large sample of bubbles, aiming to explore the possible evidence of triggered gas accumulation and star formation in a statistical sense. By cross-matching 6124 Spitzer bubbles from the Milky Way Project (MWP) and more than 2500 Galactic HII regions, we obtain the velocity information for 818 MWP bubbles. To study the gaseous environment of the interstellar bubbles and get rid of the projection effect as much as possible, we constrain the velocity difference between the bubbles and the 13 CO(1 - 0) emission extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS). Three methods: the mean azimuthally averaged radial profile of 13 CO emission, the surface number <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> clumps, and the angular cross-correlation function of MWP bubbles and the GRS molecular clumps are adopted. Significant over <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> gas is found to be close to the bubble rims. 60 percent of the studied bubbles were found to have associated molecular clumps. By comparing the clump-associated and the clump-unassociated MWP bubbles, we reveal that the bubbles in associations tend to be larger and thicker in physical sizes. We speculate that some of the bubble-associated clumps result from the {{expansion of}} bubbles. The fraction <b>of</b> the <b>molecular</b> clumps associated with the MWP bubbles is estimated to be about 20 percent after considering the projection effect.

Also a new method to obtain qualitative information on the analysed organic compound has been developed. The new detection method allows to get information about the atomic composition. In some cases the detector signals can be correlated with {{the constitution of the}} analysed substance. The detection method is based on the simultaneous detection <b>of</b> the spectral <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>molecular</b> bands <b>of</b> different diatomics as CC, CH, CN, NH, OH and an atomic hydrogen line. The resulting peak areas and the offset of the OH band are correlated with the analysed compounds by multivariate linear regression...|$|R
