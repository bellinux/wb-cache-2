Later that year, Manson and Brody Dalle contributed backing vocals to a Queens of the Stone Age track. In 2006, Manson planned to record a John Lennon cover version for the Amnesty International [...] charity compilation with bassist Eric Avery, however a scheduling misunderstanding left them short of time and unable to record the song.

2500|$|John Ian Scott {{was born}} on April 28, 1978—four minutes before his {{identical}} twin brother Drew—in Vancouver, Canada. [...] He has an older brother, J.D., and is the second son of James and Joanne Scott. [...] James, having emigrated from Scotland as a teenager, had fostered dreams of being a cowboy as he had seen on television, {{and worked in the}} film industry as an actor, stuntman, and assistant director until the late 1970s. [...] It was around that time when he decided to focus on raising his family, and they moved to a horse farm in the nearby town of Maple Ridge, British Columbia. James worked as a youth counselor and Joanne continued her career as a paralegal in downtown Vancouver. On their seventh birthday, their father encouraged the twins to get a job. They looked through the <b>help</b> <b>wanted</b> ads, but ultimately began a business with their mother called JAM (for Jon, Andrew, and Mom) making nylon-wrapped clothes hangers. [...] In interviews, they have related how they would sell them door to door, eventually selling thousands to a woman who sold American paraphernalia in Japan.|$|E

60|$|For {{eighteen}} months {{he and the}} baby lived there. He left the child at a nursery every morning, fetching it away each evening on his return from work, and for that he paid fourpence a day, which included a limited supply of milk. How he managed to keep himself {{and more than half}} keep the child on the remaining two shillings I cannot say. I only know that he did it, and that not a soul ever helped him or knew that there was <b>help</b> <b>wanted.</b> He nursed the child, often pacing the room with it for hours, washed it, occasionally, and took it out for an airing every Sunday.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{saw little}} {{of his fellow}} roomers. A strange, drab lot he thought them from the {{occasional}} glimpses he had had in passings upon the dark stairway and in the gloomy halls.
