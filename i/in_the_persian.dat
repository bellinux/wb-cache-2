5|$|In 1987, Missouri was {{outfitted}} with 40mm grenade launchers and 25mm chain guns {{and sent to}} take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment– a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile launchers.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} nine {{different}} bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters {{concluded that the}} mussel, Trichomya hirsuta, most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, and Ag) in its environment. In this species there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf, the Atlantic pearl-oyster (Pinctada radiata) {{is considered to be}} a useful bioindicator of heavy metals.|$|E
