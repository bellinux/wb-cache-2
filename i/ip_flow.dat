40|$|International audienceHybrid {{networks}} take data forwarding decisions {{at multiple}} network levels. In {{order to make}} an efficient use of hybrid networks, traffic engineering solutions (e. g., routing and data grooming techniques) are commonly employed. Within the specific context of a self-managed hybrid optical and packet switching network, one important aspect to be considered is how to efficiently and autonomically move <b>IP</b> <b>flows</b> from the <b>IP</b> level over lightpaths at the optical level. The more IP traffic is moved (offloaded), leaving {{the least amount of}} traffic on the IP level, the better. Based on that, we investigate in this paper different strategies to move <b>IP</b> <b>flows</b> onto lightpaths while observing the percentage of offloaded IP traffic per strategy...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{networks}} are fast and reliable networks that enable, amongst others, dedicated light paths {{to be established}} for elephant <b>IP</b> <b>flows.</b> Elephant <b>IP</b> <b>flows</b> are characterized by being small in number, but long in time and high in traffic volume. Moving these flows from the general IP network to dedicated light paths can be beneficial for both the elephant flows {{as well as the}} general <b>IP</b> network. Elephant <b>flows</b> over light paths would benefit from receiving better Quality of Service (at the optical level there is no jitter and far more bandwidth) and, at the same time, IP networks would be off-loaded and therefore offer better Quality of Service to the remaining, smaller <b>IP</b> <b>flows.</b> Identifying elephant flows in large scale IP networks is therefore an important task in order to effectively manage the network. In practice such flows are generally characterized using 5 -tuple flow definition (source/destination address/port and protocol), which may be too restrictive for the purpose of establishing optical light paths. In this paper we evaluate different flow definitions at different levels of granularity. Using measurements at a large national research network, we compare our alternative flow definitions to the traditional 5 -tuple definition. We show that the discovery of elephant flows eligible to be transferred over light paths can better be reached using less restrictive flow definitions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hybrid {{networks}} are networks capable of switching data at multiple levels (optical and IP packet level) {{by means of}} multi-service optical switches. As a result of that, huge flows at the IP-level may be moved to the optical-level, which is faster than the packet-level. Such move could be beneficial since congested IP networks could be off-loaded, leaving more resources for other <b>IP</b> <b>flows.</b> At the same time, the flows switched at the optical-level would get better Quality of Service (QoS). In order to achieve this beneficial move, huge <b>IP</b> <b>flows</b> have to be properly detected at the packet-level and lambda-connections are to be established for them at the optical-level. Two approaches are currently used for that purpose: the first is based on conventional management techniques {{and the second is}} based on GMPLS signaling. Both approaches mostly depend on human intervention, which can be error prone and slow. The idea proposed in this paper to overcome this problem consists of adding self-management capabilities to the multi-service optical switches. The optical switches would then be responsible for automatically identifying <b>IP</b> <b>flows,</b> and establishing and releasing lambdaconnections for such flows. The main goal of this paper is therefore to propose an architecture for the self-management of lambda-connections in hybrid networks. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Mobile {{data traffic}} in {{cellular}} networks has increased tremendously {{in the last}} few years. Due to the costs associated with licensed spectrum, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are battling to manage these increased traffic growths. Offloading mobile data traffic to alternative low cost access networks like Wi-Fi has been proposed as a candidate solution to enable MNOs to alleviate congestion from the cellular networks. This dissertation investigates an offloading technique called <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility within the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) all-IP mobile core network, the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility would enable offloading a subset of the mobile user‟s traffic to an alternative access network while allowing the rest of the end-user‟s traffic to be kept in the cellular access; this way, traffic with stringent quality of service requirements like Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) would not experience service disruption or interruption when offloaded. This technique is different from previous offloading techniques where all the end-user‟s traffic is offloaded. <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility functionality can be realised with either host- or network-based mobility protocols. The recommended <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility standard of 3 GPP is based on the host-based mobility solution, Dual-Stack Mobile IPv 6. However, host-based mobility solutions have drawbacks like long handover latencies and produce signaling overhead in the radio access networks, which could be less appealing to MNOs. Network-based mobility solutions, compared to the host-based mobility solutions, have reduced handover latencies with no signaling overhead occurring in the radio access network. Proxy Mobile IPv 6 is a networkbased mobility protocol adapted by 3 GPP for mobility in the EPC. However, the standardisation of the Proxy Mobile IPv 6 -based <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility functionality is still ongoing within 3 GPP. A review of related literature and standardisation efforts reveals shortcomings with the Proxy Mobile IPv 6 mobility protocol in supporting <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility. Proxy Mobile IPv 6 does not have a mechanism that would ensure session continuity during <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> handoffs or a mechanism enabling controlling of the forwarding path of a particular <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> i. e., specifying the access network for the <b>IP</b> <b>flow.</b> The latter mechanism is referred to as <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> information management and flow-based routing. These mechanisms represent the basis for enabling the <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility functionality. To address the shortcomings of Proxy Mobile IPv 6, this dissertation proposes vi enhancements to the protocol procedures to enable the two mechanisms for <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility functionality. The proposed enhancements for the session continuity mechanism draw on work in related literature and the proposed enhancements for the <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> information management and flow-based routing mechanism are based on the concepts used in the Dual- Stack Mobile IPv 6 <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> mobility functionality. Together the two mechanisms allow the end-user to issue requests on what access network a particular <b>IP</b> <b>flow</b> should be routed, and ensure that the IP flows are moved to the particular access network without session discontinuity...|$|E
