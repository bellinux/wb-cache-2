Our previous work has established the benefits of variable TDMA scheduling in this setting, where the order of communication with nodes in each TDMA round is determined on the fly by the hub, based on the actual outcomes (success or failure) of their recent transmissions. This technique takes into account the very slow fading nature of wireless channels in BANs, and can minimize the expected rate of transmission losses merely by ordering nodes according to their most recent channel state information, without any additional energy overhead. In this paper, we focus on an <b>extended</b> <b>TDMA</b> setting where the length of each TDMA round is greater than the number of nodes, i. e. a number of ‘spare ’ slots are reserved for retransmissions of lost packets. We consider delay-constrained data transmissions based on a Markov model of the wireless channels. We evaluate several variable scheduling strategies in terms of the trade-off between the energy consumption due to the additional retransmissions and the reduction of the loss rate. We show how the best strategy depends on the energy budget of the sensor nodes, and demonstrate the considerable reduction in the loss rate (up to 18 %) that can be achieved over a naı̈ve approach where static TDMA scheduling is combined with retransmission slots {{at the end of the}} round.

40|$|Designing {{control and}} robotic systems as {{autonomous}} decentralized systems introduces a new {{degree of flexibility}} in the manufacturing and {{in the application of}} such systems. This flexibility is required for the systems to work in environments that are not totally predictable and that can change dynamically. In this paper, we present a new concept for real-time communication that supports this flexibility while still preserving real-time guarantees for hard real-time communication. The concept is designed to work on multiple-access busses. In particular, we consider its application on wireless local area networks and field-busses. The concept addresses requirements of hard-real time, soft real-time and non real-time communication. For this, we <b>extend</b> the <b>TDMA</b> (time-division multiple-access) approach for time-triggered hard-real time communication by the concept of shared channels that support event-triggered communication and coexist with hard real-time channels. A first implementation [...] ...|$|R

[18] {{propose the}} C-State-based CRC [18] method that can detect state {{inconsistencies}} using certain {{information such as}} TDMA slot information, current mode, global time, and membership information. The authors use the C-State-based CRC for static TDMA which can be <b>extended</b> to state-based <b>TDMA</b> for detecting state inconsistencies. Schemes like two-phase commit (2 PC) scheme or the three-phase commit (3 PC) scheme {{can also be used}} for detecting state inconsistencies; however, these schemes have more communication overhead than the C-State-based method due to a significant number of message transmissions.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that biology-inspired self-maintaining {{algorithms}} in wireless sensor nodes achieve near optimum time division multiple access (TDMA) characteristics in a decentralized manner and with very low complexity. We <b>extend</b> such distributed <b>TDMA</b> approaches to multiple channels (frequencies). This is achieved by extending the concept of collaborative reactive listening in order to balance the number of nodes in all available channels. We prove the stability of the new protocol and estimate the delay until the balanced system state is reached. Our approach is benchmarked against single-channel distributed TDMA and channel hopping approaches using TinyOS imote 2 wireless sensors.

40|$|Part 5 : ARAMIS Special SessionInternational audienceThe timing {{predictability}} of {{embedded systems}} with hard real-time requirements is fundamental for guaranteeing their safe usage. With {{the emergence of}} multicore platforms this task becomes even more challenging, because of shared processing, communication and memory resources. Model-checking techniques are capable of verifying the performance properties of applications running on these platforms. Unfortunately, these techniques are not scalable when analyzing systems with large number of tasks and processing units. In this paper, a model-checking based approach that allows to guarantee timing bounds of multiple Synchronous Data Flow Applications (SDFA) running on shared-bus multicore architectures will be <b>extended</b> for a <b>TDMA</b> hypervisor architecture. We will improve the the number of SDFAs being analyzable by our model-checking approach by exploiting the temporal and spatial segregation properties of the TDMA architecture and demonstrate how this method can be applied...|$|R
