For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics.

Anion channels have several major functions in controlling stomatal closing: (a) They allow release of anions, such as chloride and malate from guard cells, which is needed for stomatal closing. (b) Anion channels are activated by signals that cause stomatal closing, for example by intracellular calcium and ABA. The resulting release of negatively charged anions from guard cells results in an electrical shift of the membrane to more positive voltages (depolarization) at the intracellular surface of the <b>guard</b> <b>cell</b> plasma membrane. This electrical depolarization of guard cells leads to activation of the outward potassium channels {{and the release of}} potassium through these channels.

2500|$|Guard {{cells are}} {{specialized}} {{cells in the}} epidermis of leaves, stems and other organs {{that are used to}} control gas exchange. They are produced in pairs with a gap between them that forms a stomatal pore. The stomatal pores are largest when water is freely available and the guard cells turgid, and closed when water availability is critically low and the guard cells become flaccid. Photosynthesis depends on the diffusion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air through the stomata into the mesophyll tissues. Oxygen (O2), produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, exits the plant via the stomata. [...] When the stomata are open, water is lost by evaporation and must be replaced via the transpiration stream, with water taken up by the roots. Plants must balance the amount of CO2 absorbed from the air with the water loss through the stomatal pores, and this is achieved by both active and passive control of <b>guard</b> <b>cell</b> turgor and stomatal pore size.|$|E

40|$|When {{plant is}} {{subjected}} to drought stress (low water potential caused by drying soil and/or low humidity), stomata are closed mainly {{by the action of}} a phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) which is synthesized in the mesophyll cells or root cells and transported to the stomata. This stomatal closure causes a delay of wilting. Under drought stress,stomatal <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> are possible to be exposed to low water potential in the substomatal cavity. However, the protective mechanism of <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> from drought stress is unknown yet. To clarify this mechanism,I examined the effect of low water potential around <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> on the metabolism in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> In the present experiments, epidermal strips were peeled from Vicia faba L. leaflets and sonicated. The strips were incubated in either the light or dark in 0. 4 M mannitol solution(osmotic stress) to subject <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> to low water potential. In the first chapter, I examined the effect of osmotic stress on the levels of malate, sucrose, and K^+, which are known to act as osmotica in <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> during stomatal movement. The levels of both malate and sucrose were increased to 1. 2 - 1. 3 times by osmotic stress. This malate increase was light-dependent, whereas the sucrose increase was light-independent. The level of K^+ in <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> increased slightly under osmotic stress in the light. On the other hand,ABA treatment decreased all these solute levels in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> These results suggest that osmotic stress affects carbon metabolism in <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> and this metabolic change is different from that caused by ABA. Radioactivity incorporated from ^ 14 C-glucose into low molecular weight compounds which include malate and sucrose were increased by osmotic stress, while that into high molecular weight compounds such as starch and carbohydrates in cell walls were decreased. This result indicates that accumulation of malate and sucrose by osmotic stress might result from changes in the whole carbon metabolism in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> Osmotic stress resulted in decrease of respiratory activity in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> Since accumulation of sucrose by osmotic stress was lighy-independent,decreased respiratory activity might cause sucrose accumulation under osmotic stress. On the other hand, the accumulation of malate by osmotic stress was light-dependent. Therefore, malate accumulation by osmotic stress might not be caused by decreased respiratory catabolism alone. In the second chapter, I examined whether malate synthesis was activated by osmotic stress or not, which step is affected by osmotic stress, and {{what is the role of}} malate accumulation under osmotic stress. Malate synthesis is catalyzed by NADP- or NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). This pathway is known to be activated by light in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> When epidermal strips were treated with 3, 3 -dichloro- 2 dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl- 2 propenoate (DCDP),a specific inhibitor of PEPC, malate level was decreased in the light. The extent of the decrease was larger under osmotic-stressed condition than under non-stressed condition. Moreover, the amount of ^ 14 CO_ 2 incorporated into malate in <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> 60 s in the light under stressed condition was twice as large as that under non-stress condition. In the dark, little CO_ 2 was incorporated into malate under both conditions. These results suggest that osmotic stress may enhance the activity of this pathway of malate synthesis which is induced by light. Western blot analysis showed that the level of PEPC proteins in <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> subjected to osmotic stress in the light was twice as large as the non-stressed control level. From these results, enhanced malate accumulation by osmotic stress might result from increased level of PEPC proteins. Furthermore,inhibition of malate synthesis by treatment with DCDP decreased stomatal aperutre under both stressed and non-stressed conditions, suggesting that malate synthesis plays a role in increasing osmotic pressure in <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> and preventing excessive water loss from <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> caused by osmotic stress. In conclusion, light-dependent malate accumulation and light-independent sucrose accumulation were induced by osmotic stress in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> The malate accumulation might be caused by increased level of PEPC proteins by osmotic stress. These metabolic changes may contribute to protection of <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> from drought stress. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Stomatal opening, which {{controls}} gas exchanges between {{plants and the}} atmosphere, results from an increase in turgor of the two <b>guard</b> <b>cells</b> that surround the pore of the stoma. KAT 1 was the only inward K+ channel shown to be expressed in Arabidopsis <b>guard</b> <b>cells,</b> where it was proposed to mediate a K+ influx that enables stomatal opening. We report that another Arabidopsis K+channel, KAT 2, is expressed in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> More than KAT 1, KAT 2 displays functional features resembling those of native inward K+ channels in <b>guard</b> <b>cells.</b> Coexpression inXenopus oocytes and two-hybrid experiments indicated that KAT 1 and KAT 2 can form heteromultimeric channels.

By using this calibration, the quantity of potassium that had accumulated in the <b>guard</b> <b>cells,</b> as stomata of leaves of Vicia open in the light, was estimated.
