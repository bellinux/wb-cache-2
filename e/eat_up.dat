5|$|The Hokies {{took over}} at their 39-yard line, and {{immediately}} found success. Randall connected on two 10-yard passes {{to take the}} Hokies into Air Force territory. The two passes were followed by a 16-yard run by Tech fullback Doug Easlick for another first down at the Air Force 24-yard line. From there, the Tech ground game continued to <b>eat</b> <b>up</b> yards and result in first downs. Kevin Jones ran the ball twice for 11yards, then Lee Suggs ran the ball three times for 13yards, the last carry also resulting in a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its first lead of the game, 17–10, with 4:45 remaining.|$|E

He believed that unless this occurred, the huge Soviet military would continue to <b>eat</b> <b>up</b> resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve. In 1955, Khrushchev abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack. In January 1960, Khrushchev took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third {{in the size of}} Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops. While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.|$|E

500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of sea-grass.

The prey usually is killed by strangulation, which can cause {{cerebral}} ischemia or asphyxia (which results in hypoxemic, or [...] "general", hypoxia). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia). Prey is typically eaten {{at the location of}} the hunt, although large prey is sometimes dragged into cover. Lions tend to squabble over a kill, particularly the males. When food is scarce, cubs tend to suffer the most but otherwise all pride members can eat their fill, including old and crippled ones which can live on leftovers. There is more sharing of larger kills. An adult lioness requires an average of about [...] of meat per day, a male about [...] A lion may gorge itself and <b>eat</b> <b>up</b> to [...] in one sitting; if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more.

500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the West Indian manatee, are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as shoalweed, water lettuce, muskgrass, manatee grass, and turtle grass. Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly <b>eat</b> <b>up</b> to 10%-15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day. However, 10% of the diet of the African manatee is fish and mollusks. Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets. As opposed to bulk feeding, dugongs target high-nitrogen grasses to maximize nutrient intake, and, although almost completely herbivorous, dugongs will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Some populations of dugongs, such as the one in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when their supply of seagrasses decrease. In other dugong populations in western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. Populations of Amazonian manatees become restricted to lakes during the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, and are thought to fast during this period. Their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allow them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.|$|E
