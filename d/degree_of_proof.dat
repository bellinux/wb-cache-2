6000|$|The {{principle}} of the departure from those rules is clearly fixed by Lord Hardwicke; he lays it down as follows:--"The first ground judges have gone upon, in departing from strict rules, is absolute strict necessity; 2dly, a presumed necessity." [...] Of the first he gives these instances:--"In the case of writings subscribed by witnesses, if all are dead, the proof {{of one of their}} hands is sufficient to establish the deed. Where an original is lost, a copy may be admitted; if no copy, then a proof by witnesses who have heard the deed: and yet it is a thing the law abhors, to admit the memory of man for evidence." [...] This enlargement through two stages of proof, both of them contrary to the rule of law, and both abhorrent from its principles, are by this great judge accumulated upon one another, and are admitted from necessity, to accommodate human affairs, and to prevent that which courts are by every possible means instituted to prevent,--A FAILURE OF JUSTICE. And this necessity is not confined within the strict limits of physical causes, but is more lax, and takes in moral and even presumed and argumentative necessity, a necessity which is in fact nothing more than a great degree of expediency. The law creates a fictitious necessity against the rules of evidence in favor of the convenience of trade: an exception which on a similar principle had before been admitted in the Civil Law, as to mercantile causes, in which the books of the party were received to give full effect to an insufficient <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> called, in the nicety of their distinctions, a semiplena probatio.[52] ...|$|E

Like higherorder abstract syntax (HOAS), PHOAS uses the meta language’s binding constructs to represent the object language’s binding constructs. Unlike HOAS, PHOAS types are definable in generalpurpose type theories that support traditional functional programming, like Coq’s Calculus of Inductive Constructions. We walk through how Coq can be used to develop certified, executable program transformations over several statically-typed functional programming languages formalized with PHOAS; that is, each transformation has a machine-checked proof of type preservation and semantic preservation. Our examples include CPS translation and closure conversion for simply-typed lambda calculus, CPS translation for System F, and translation from a language with ML-style pattern matching to a simpler language with no variable-arity binding constructs. By avoiding the syntactic hassle associated with first-order representation techniques, we achieve a very high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> automation...|$|E

Part III of this article sets forth recommendations for future clarification and increased consistency on these issues.

First, “actual injury” should be found where there is injury to either an individual or a population of protected species. Second, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> required to establish an “injury” where essential behaviors are impaired should be bifurcated into two tests, depending on which behavioral pattern is being adversely affected. Together, these rules can bring resolution not only to scenarios like fish stocking, but also to other future fact patterns scrutinized under the habitat modification analysis. Part IV of this article demonstrates how application of these rules to states can further the goals of the ESA, both through voluntary reevaluation of fish stocking programs, and through application for an Incidental Take Permit and corresponding Habitat Conservation Plan. These rules can provide two different paths to the same goal: to minimize adverse impacts to endangered and threatened species...|$|E

We hypothesized {{that there would be a}} significant difference in the rates reported according to the definition. Methods: Prospective surveillance of CA-BSI (defined as bacteremia with no extravascular source identified) is performed in all intensive care units (ICUs) at our institution and reported as the rate per 1, 000 catheter-days. In January 2006, we initiated cultures of all catheter tips to evaluate for CR-BSI (defined as a catheter tip culture with > 15 colony-forming units of the same microorganism(s) found in the blood culture) in the surgical, trauma-burn, and medical ICUs. Results: The CA-BSI rate across all ICUs for the 24 -mo study period was 1. 4 / 1, 000 catheter-days. The CR-BSI rate was 0. 4 / 1, 000 catheter days, for a rate difference of 1. 0 infections/ 1, 000 catheter-days (p?<? 0. 001 vs. CA-BSI). The pathogens identified in CA-BSI included many organisms that are not associated with catheter-related BSIs. Conclusions: The CR-BSI rate is significantly lower than the CA-BSI rate. The organisms identified in CA-BSI surveillance often are not common in catheter-related infections. Reporting CR-BSI thus is a more accurate measure of complications of central venous catheter use, and this rate may be more sensitive to catheter-specific interventions designed to reduce rates of BSI in the ICU...|$|E

40|$|HOLCF is an {{interactive}} theorem proving system {{that uses the}} mathematics of domain theory to reason about programs written in functional programming languages. This thesis introduces HOLCF ’ 11, a thoroughly revised and extended version of HOLCF that advances {{the state of the}} art in program verification: HOLCF ’ 11 can reason about many program definitions that are beyond the scope of other formal proof tools, while providing a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> automation. The soundness of the system is ensured by adhering to a definitional approach: New constants and types are defined in terms of previous concepts, without introducing new axioms. Major features of HOLCF ’ 11 include two high-level definition packages: the Fixrec package for defining recursive functions, and the Domain package for defining recursive datatypes. Each of these uses the domain-theoretic concept of least fixed points to translate user-supplied recursive specifications into safe lowlevel definitions. Together, these tools make it easy for users to translate a wide variety of functional programs into the formalism of HOLCF. Theorems generated by the tools also make it easy for users to reason about their programs, with a very high level of confidence in the soundness of the results. As a case study, we present a fully mechanized verification of a model of concurrency based on powerdomains. The formalization depends on many features unique to HOLCF ’ 11, and is the first verification of such a model in a formal proof tool. ii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank my advisor, John Matthews, for having continued to devote so much time to working with me, even as a part-time professor; and for motivating me to keep studying domain theory (and enjoying it!) these past years. ii...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of correct programs is a core problem in computer science. Although formal verification methods for establishing correctness with mathematical rigor are available, programmers often find these {{difficult to put}} into practice. One hurdle is deriving the loop invariants and proving that the code maintains them. So called correct-by-construction methods aim to alleviate this issue by integrating verification into the programming workflow. Invariant-based programming is a practical correct-by-construction method in which the programmer first establishes the invariant structure, and then incrementally extends the program in steps of adding code and proving after each addition that the code {{is consistent with the}} invariants. In this way, the program is kept internally consistent throughout its development, and the construction of the correctness arguments (proofs) becomes {{an integral part of the}} programming workflow. A characteristic of the approach is that programs are described as invariant diagrams, a graphical notation similar to the state charts familiar to programmers. Invariant-based programming is a new method that has not been evaluated in large scale studies yet. The most important prerequisite for feasibility on a larger scale is a high degree of automation. The goal of the Socos project has been to build tools to assist the construction and verification of programs using the method. This thesis describes the implementation and evaluation of a prototype tool in the context of the Socos project. The tool supports the drawing of the diagrams, automatic derivation and discharging of verification conditions, and interactive proofs. It is used to develop programs that are correct by construction. The tool consists of a diagrammatic environment connected to a verification condition generator and an existing state-of-the-art theorem prover. Its core is a semantics for translating diagrams into verification conditions, which are sent to the underlying theorem prover. We describe a concrete method for 1) deriving sufficient conditions for total correctness of an invariant diagram; 2) sending the conditions to the theorem prover for simplification; and 3) reporting the results of the simplification to the programmer in a way that is consistent with the invariantbased programming workflow and that allows errors in the program specification to be efficiently detected. The tool uses an efficient automatic proof strategy to prove as many conditions as possible automatically and lets the remaining conditions be proved interactively. The tool is based on the verification system PVS and i uses the SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver Yices as a catch-all decision procedure. Conditions that were not discharged automatically may be proved interactively using the PVS proof assistant. The programming workflow is very similar to the process by which a mathematical theory is developed inside a computer supported theorem prover environment such as PVS. The programmer reduces a large verification problem with the aid of the tool into a set of smaller problems (lemmas), and he can substantially improve the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> automation by developing specialized background theories and proof strategies to support the specification and verification of a specific class of programs. We demonstrate this workflow by describing in detail the construction of a verified sorting algorithm. Tool-supported verification often has little to no presence in computer science (CS) curricula. Furthermore, program verification is frequently introduced as an advanced and purely theoretical topic that is not connected to the workflow taught in the early and practically oriented programming courses. Our hypothesis is that verification could be introduced early in the CS education, and that verification tools could be used in the classroom to support the teaching of formal methods. A prototype of Socos has been used in a course at Åbo Akademi University targeted at first and second year undergraduate students. We evaluate the use of Socos in the course as part of a case study carried out in 2007...|$|E
