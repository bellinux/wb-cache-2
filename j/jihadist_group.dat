2500|$|Another mass {{execution}} {{was discovered}} near the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor. The unidentified corpses of 13 {{men had been}} discovered shot to death execution-style. This incident raised awareness that the violence in Syria was heading towards an inexorable vicious cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the different parties involved. According to the opposition, the 13 people who were shot at point blank range and later found in a field were employees at the electricity company in Deir Ezzor, who went on strike in protest of the massacres committed by the Syrian regime. They all had their hands tied behind their backs and were {{shot in the head}} according to a UN report. The head of a UN observer mission in Syria was ‚Äúdeeply disturbed‚Äù by the killings in Deir Ezzor, calling it an ‚Äúappalling and inexcusable act.‚Äù Several days later, the dead were identified to be military and the opposition than claimed they were army defectors killed by government forces. However, on 5 June, the <b>jihadist</b> <b>group</b> the Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant claimed responsibility for the killings, stating that they had captured and interrogated the soldiers in Deir al-Zor and [...] "justly" [...] punished them with death, after they confessed to crimes.|$|E

Cristina Kirchner visited Pope Francis for a third time. The scandal over Amado Boudou grew when he was summoned for inquiry by Federal Judge Ariel Lijo. The country paid the debt with the Paris Club. US judge Thomas P. Griesa rules that Argentina must pay as well to the hedge funds that did not enter into the Argentine debt restructuring, which Argentina failed to do.

The government promoted several new laws and law amendments, such as an overhauled civil code, hydrocarbon law and telecommunications law. Cristina Kirchner was denounced in the Hotesur scandal over a firm headed by her and her sons to manage the hotels in Calafate. She is suspected of using the hotels for money laundering.
