40|$|The {{alpine region}} is of crucial {{importance}} for the European Union; as a result, the Carpathian Convention aims at its sustainable development. Since sustainability implies also conservation through natural protected areas, aimed at including regions representative for the national biogeographical space, this article aims at assessing the efficiency of conservation. The methodology consisted of using spatial metrics applied to Romanian and European data on the natural protected areas, land cover and use and their transitional dynamics. The findings show a very good coverage of the Alpine biogeographical region (98 % included in the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 43 % of it protected within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area)</b> and of the ecological region of Carpathian montane coniferous forests (88 % included in the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 42 % of it protected within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area).</b> The dominant land cover is represented by forests (63 % within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 70 % of the total protected area). The main transitional dynamics are deforestation (covering 50 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 46 % from the changed area within its protected area) and forestations – including afforestation, reforestation and colonization of abandoned agricultural areas by forest vegetation (covering 44 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 51 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000 and deforestation (covering 97 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 99 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000.

The Republic of Korea later acceded to the Convention on 27 May 2003. As indicated in the Convention, the main objective of the NPAFC is to promote the conservation of anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. The NPAFC provides a framework for international cooperation on the scientific research of anadromous species and enforcement of fisheries regulations in the <b>Convention</b> <b>Area.</b> The <b>Convention</b> prohibits directed catch of anadromous fish in the <b>Convention</b> <b>Area,</b> but allows for some fishing of these species for scientific purposes under national and joint research programs with prior approval of the NPAFC.

50|$|The WCPF Convention {{was built}} on the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and set out to address the {{specific}} characteristics of the western and central Pacific Ocean.

Cooperation with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission is of particular importance because of the overlap in respective <b>Convention</b> <b>Areas</b> and the wide range of some of the stocks (such as Bigeye tuna, and the two Albacore Tuna stocks) jointly managed by WCPFC and IATTC. The High Seas of the WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> also overlap significantly with the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation and the new North Pacific Fisheries Commission <b>Convention</b> <b>Area.</b> However the fish stocks managed by these RFMOs are different from those managed by WCPFC, and interactions are likely to be restricted to those involving bycatch and multipurpose vessels.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the seasonal distribution of albatrosses and petrels within the WCPFC area, using remote tracking data from the Global Procellariiform Tracking Database. The WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> overlaps with the distribution of 18 of the 22 species of albatross, and the Global Procellariiform Tracking Database holds relevant remote tracking data for 14 of these. This analysis highlights the high importance of WCPFC for global albatross distribution, with at 11 of these species having over 50 % of their distribution in the WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> in one or more seasons of the year, and 9 of these having over 40 % of their distribution in one or more seasons in areas in which WCPFC longline fishing effort occurs. Fewer data are available for petrel and shearwater species, but at least Sooty Shearwater and Westland Petrel also have high overlap with WCPFC longline effort. Seasonally, the three North Pacific albatross species (Laysan, Black-foot and Short-tailed) have a high overlap with the WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> throughout the year. In the South Pacific, the distribution of some species varies markedly by season. However, species vary in the timing of these migrations, such that overlap between albatross distribution and WCPFC longline fishin...|$|R
