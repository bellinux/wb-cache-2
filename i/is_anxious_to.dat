The song samples elements of [...] "Pony" [...] (1996), as performed by Ginuwine and written by Elgin [...] "Ginuwine" [...] Lumpkin, Stephen Garrett and Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley. In an interview with MTV News Ginuwine stated: [...] "You know what? My management told me she wanted to use it, and Rihanna, I'm a fan of hers and I love what she's doing. You got to embrace it!

500|$|The {{novel is}} written in the third-person with flashbacks to {{specific}} events {{in the life of}} Simón Bolívar, [...] "the General". It begins on May 8, 1830 in Santa Fe de Bogotá. The General is preparing for his journey towards the port of Cartagena de Indias, intending to leave Colombia for Europe. Following his resignation as President of Gran Colombia, the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him, scrawling anti-Bolívar graffiti and throwing waste at him. The General <b>is</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> move on, but has to remind the Vice-President-elect, General Domingo Caycedo, that he has yet to receive a valid passport to leave the country. The General leaves Bogotá with the few officials still faithful to him, including his confidante and aide-de-camp, José Palacios. At {{the end of the first}} chapter, the General is referred to by his full title, General Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios, for the only time in the novel.|$|E

He leaves the family a box of old silver dollars that they decide to spend at the mall right away. At the mall, Lisa sees the new talking Malibu Stacy doll in a toy store.

She and Grampa sit at the kitchen table, bemoaning how they are treated because of their age while both of them decide to change, Grampa to get a job, and Lisa to find Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell.|$|E
500|$|Billy's defiant spirit ("The Highest Judge of All") {{is taken}} Up There {{to see the}} Starkeeper, a heavenly official. [...] The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life {{was not enough to}} get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself. [...] He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and {{suggests}} that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. [...] He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: [...] "Billy Makes a Journey"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. [...] The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. [...] In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young.

500|$|In February 1914, Sporting Life {{reported}} that Hogan was considering {{a return to}} the Tri-State League. [...] "In a letter to a friend in Lancaster [...] the former Lancaster manager stated that the Trenton [...] Club was after him and that there was [...] good prospects of both sides coming to terms", the paper stated. [...] "Marty <b>is</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> get back in the Tri-State, where he won fame as a manager". [...] The paper added that Hogan, at that point, was working as a [...] "successful businessman" [...] in Youngstown, Ohio. [...] The same edition of Sporting Life, however, carried a wire report noting that the Trenton club's new owner, W. J. Morris, had signed Zeke Wrigley as team manager. [...] The report observed, [...] "Manager Wrigley was strongly recommended to the club by Connie Mack". [...] (Wrigley, a former major league infielder, had earlier pursued a position on the Tri-State League's umpire staff, and he was not initially in the running for the position of Trenton club manager.) [...] Further research will be required to determine whether Hogan's career as a minor league manager continued after this point.|$|E

500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at {{the time}} of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme of The Pie is the very proper social {{relations}} between neighbours in a small town. She points to the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street without a word to one another because [...] "they were going to have a party". Though Duchess probably does not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby probably does not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. [...] At the hour of the party, Duchess <b>is</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most [...] "genteel little tap-tappity" [...] and asking [...] "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" [...] MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. [...] For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the cat and dog remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.|$|E
500|$|In February 1896, Hogan {{received}} {{an offer to}} manage the Youngstown (Ohio) Puddlers, a minor league team associated with the Interstate League. [...] The Vindicator reported that the outfielder refused the offer. [...] "Hogan expects to play again with the St. Louis team in the National League", the Vindicator stated. [...] The paper went on to quote an article that supposedly appeared in the Cincinnati-based Commercial Gazette: [...] "St. Louis fans {{are opposed to the}} idea of selling Marty Hogan, the fast out-fielder, who played with the Indianapolis team last season, having been loaned by the Browns". [...] In the spring of 1896, however, Hogan attempted to extricate himself from remaining contractual obligations to the St. Louis Browns. [...] Sporting Life reported, in May 1896, that Hogan was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain a final release from the Browns, who retained him as an [...] "extra" [...] right fielder. [...] "Marty has not been given any kind of trial by the manager of the Browns, although he stood high in batting and base running in the Western League last year", the article stated. [...] "He is in fine condition, and <b>is</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> play, but does not prepare to be shifted about at the will of alleged managers". [...] The paper added that Hogan had returned to St. Louis in March 1896, prepared to [...] "purchase" [...] his release, [...] "but he has been held onto until now, when he could have secured $1550 for his services in the Western League". [...] Hogan appeared especially confident of his baserunning abilities. [...] The article noted that the outfielder had [...] "offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League". [...] Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve. On May 24, 1896, an article in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Globe indicated Hogan performed exceptionally well at the bat during a contest between the Hoosiers and the St. Paul Saints. [...] "Marty Hogan...through an inadvertent mix-up of pugilism and baseball...tried to hammer the face off the ball, which had tantalized the other Hoosiers", the article stated, [...] "and when Marty's work was done, the ball was out of the lot and he was on second base".|$|E
