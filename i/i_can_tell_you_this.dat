It's not different for me, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> — it fits everything {{going on with the}} vampire theme. It fits everything with Twilight".

If his second marriage made him happy, what business had we with {{the disparity of}} years between husband and wife? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Sextus {{was the first of}} us to regret what he had done.
