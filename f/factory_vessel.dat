In 1928, a large-scale fishery and cannery for the spiny lobster using lobster pots was set up on St Paul, but the company went bankrupt three years later, stranding seven people on the island and leading to a tragedy known as [...] "Les Oubliés de Saint-Paul" [...] (the forgotten ones of Saint-Paul). In the next two decades, there were several, largely unsuccessful, attempts to harvest the lobsters using factory ships. In the period 1950 to 1956, the spiny lobsters were harvested by the French company Sapmer with about 260 tonnes of lobster tails being processed annually (equivalent to about 800 tonnes of whole lobster).

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} in trawl catches {{and its influence}} on energy efficiency of trawler operations are discussed in this paper, based on data on landings of a Japanese factory trawler which operated in the Indian waters during 1992 - 93. The <b>factory</b> <b>vessel</b> equipped for stern trawling had a length overall of 110 m, GT of 5460 and installed engine power of 5700 hp. Operations were conducted off west coast of India between 31 and 278 m depth contours, using a 80. 4 m high opening bottom trawl with an adjusted vertical opening of 7. 6  0. 9 m. The catch data was grouped according to the median towing hour, {{by the time of}} the day. CPUE obtained was 3713. 4 kg. h- 1 for day time operations and 1536. 6 kg. h- 1 for night-time operations. Mean daily catches were 31367 kg. day- 1 (SE: 2743) for day time operations and 9430 kg. day- 1 (SE: 966) for night-time operations. Fuel consumption were 0. 399 and 0. 982 kg fuel. kg fish- 1, respectively for day and night-time operations. Total catch and catch components such as threadfin bream, bulls eye, hairtails, trevelly, lizard fish showed significant improvement during day-time operations while swarming crabs showed a significant improvement in the night-time operations. The difference in catch rates between day and night could be attributed to diurnal {{variation in}} the spatial distribution and schooling behaviour of the catch categories, their differential behaviour in the vicinity of trawl systems under varying light levels of day and night and consequent effect on catching efficiency and size selectivity at different stages in the capture process. The results obtained in addition to its importance in the operational planning of trawling in order to realise objectives of maximising catch per unit effort and minimising fuel consumption per unit volume of fish caught, has added significance in the use of bottom trawl surveys in stock abundance estimates...|$|E
5000|$|The whale <b>factory</b> <b>vessels</b> were {{actually}} tankers with the whale processing equipment added, {{so it was}} natural for Næss and his partners to venture into tankers. The first small step was in 1930 with two motor tankers, Nore, a [...] vessel and Norvinn , both considered large by then current standards. The vessels were to have traded in the spot market, but as the rates were low both were laid up. Næss was not discouraged by this and on 20 February 1936 established the company Viking Tanker Company Limited with capital raised in London. The administration was in Paris and the vessels were to sail under the Panama flag. It bought the two previous mentioned tankers from Rasmussen & Moe's Rederi A/S, and as the tanker market was good it ordered and bought several vessels. By 1938 the company had 5 vessels, Nore, Norvinn, Norvik, Norlys and Norbris, totalling [...] - a large tanker fleet for that period.

50|$|The film {{primarily}} {{takes place}} aboard the Japanese <b>factory</b> whaling <b>vessel,</b> the Nisshin Maru, in the Sea of Japan, {{as it makes}} its annual journey to Antarctica. Two storylines occur simultaneously on the vessel: one on deck and one beneath. The narrative on deck involves the process of casting a 25-ton petroleum jelly sculpture (one of Barney’s signature materials), which rivals the scale of a whale. Below deck, the two main characters participate as guests in a tea ceremony, where they are formally engaged after arriving on the ship as strangers. As the film progresses, the guests go through an emotional and physical transformation slowly transfiguring from land mammals into sea mammals, as they fall in love. The petroleum jelly sculpture simultaneously passes through changing states, from warm to cool, and from the architectural back to the primordial. The dual narratives, the sculptural and the romantic, come to reflect one another until the climactic point at which they become completely mutual.|$|R
40|$|Japan's distant seafishing {{industry}} provides {{opportunities for}} supergains, y et it still remains {{dependent on the}} internal market. Its activities which are directed by the State, and implemented by the large industrial and commercial enterprises, {{are part of the}} whole evolution of the traditional corporations of the Kumiai. A study of the political, technical, and economical conjuncture and balance of power at the international level show three important periods. 1904 - 1941  : The imperialistic policy of the military-industrial complex supports the operations of the large enterprises. Between 1933 and 1940, Japan has several hundreds of fishing plants along the coasts of the Russian Far East; <b>factory</b> <b>vessels</b> are used for the canning of salmon and crabs in the Sea of Okhostk and the Behring Sea, and for whaling in the Antarctic and North Pacific; industrial trawling is carried on along the coasts of the Asian continent while numerous enterprises are set up in Indo-Malaysia for coastal tuna fishing. 1948 - 1973  : Within the framework of the reconstruction of its economy, Japan at first resumes the same campaigns as those of the pre-War period; to these are added drifting long line fishing of tuna in the intertropical grounds and a powerful industrial trawling in North Pacific. By 1960, these activities are curtailed due to regulations imposed by USSR, USA, and the International Whaling Commission for stock protection. And then there are new competitors (Taiwan, South Korea). A general fail off after 1965 is partly compensated by the industrial trawling in the Behring Sea. 1974 - 1986 : Significant geopolitical and economic changes force Japan to define and to redeploy its foreign fisheries. Pressured by waterside States, Japan gradually withdraws from traditional fishing grounds and endeavours to find new resources in waters which have remained international so as to maintain a balance with its internal market (tuna drifting long lines and seiners, squid fishery). New technology and profits from the internal market allow the industrial armaments to keep their competitive edge.

40|$|Factory {{trawlers}} are {{the most}} controversial vessel group in Norwegian fisheries. At the time the fleet emerged, stern trawling in combination with on-board processing of cod fillets {{was regarded as a}} major innovation. However, the deep-sea fleet was intended to be a stable supplier of fish to the land-based industry. Factory trawlers were {{not a part of the}} political project. On the contrary, the vessels represented a serious departure from the traditional employment system for the fisheries' dependent districts. Factory trawlers have, since the seventies, been regarded as the main enemy to the coastal vessels and the land-based industry. The vessels have been subject to a profound debate about several built-in contradictory goals for the fisheries policy, such as the ideal of employment for all and the need for a profitable sector without state subsidies. Despite a series of policy-driven initiatives to remove the factory trawlers, the fleet has been one of the most profitable vessel groups in the Norwegian fisheries. Nonetheless, the fleet is now marginalised in the number of vessels and transformed into an obedient supplier of round fish to the land-based industry. In this article, we outline the history of the Norwegian factory trawlers and how the fleet was subject to a series of critical changes reflecting the complexity of the <b>vessels.</b> <b>Factory</b> trawling Cod trawling Fisheries politics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{objectives}} {{pursued by}} governments managing fisheries may include harvesting the fish stocks to maximize profits, {{to minimize the}} impact of harvesting on the marine ecosystem, or to secure jobs in the fishing industry. These objectives all depend on {{the composition of the}} fishing fleet as the various vessel types differ with respect to their operating costs, their environmental impacts, or how these boats provide employment opportunities on board or on shore. The Norwegian cod fishery consists of a fleet comprising coastal vessels, large longliners, and the fleet of trawlers and <b>factory</b> trawlers. These <b>vessels</b> score differently when it comes to meeting and reconciling these different objectives, and have therefore received mixed political support. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that shows the optimal TAC, biomass level, and long-run profits taking specifically into account fleet composition. This allows a regulator to adapt optimal management to the current fleet structure, but also analyze the bioeconomic consequences of a change in fleet structure (e. g. a ban on factory trawlers). We specifically take into account the occurrence of a fleet lock in, which means that the fishing fleet cannot be adjusted instantaneously, as several vessels cannot leave the fleet because of economic or political constraints. We apply the model to the case of Northeast Arctic cod, and econometrically estimate not only the cost and harvesting functions of the various vessel types, but also the parameters of the biological model {{as well as those of}} the demand function for cod...|$|R

His plans for their future {{prosperity}} centred upon the application of modern science and his own business skills in establishing a large and thriving fishing industry. Although Stornaway had a good harbour, there were many disadvantages to Leverhulme’s plans for the port. Its remoteness led to additional transport costs for ice, fuel, packaging, {{and anything else that}} had to be imported, {{as well as for the}} fish products, almost all of which was sold on the mainland. The place itself was, for various reasons, unpopular with sailors, and the local population’s strict observance of the Sabbath had a negative affect on fishing operations, while catches of varieties of fish other than herring were unfeasibly small.Leverhulme intended that the port should be improved and enlarged to attract landings of fish from visiting vessels to supplement catches made by local boats and his own fleet of modern drifters and trawlers.

5000|$|Spearfishing with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2&thinsp;500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.As of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About [...] were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild. This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy, whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle. The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest. The results are sometimes dramatic—the lull in fishing {{over the course of the}} First World War saw the North Sea's 1919 catch double 1913's—and sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10% of their peak. At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels.Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line <b>factory</b> <b>vessels,</b> and large <b>factory</b> ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.As well as the wild stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|R
