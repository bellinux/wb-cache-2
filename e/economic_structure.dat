5|$|International trade, {{facilitated}} by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors. Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, although Malaysia's <b>economic</b> <b>structure</b> has been moving away from it.

Further, our theory explains why some countries are more likely to transition into liberal democracies and the implication this has for technical change, an important proximate cause of <b>economic</b> growth. <b>Economic</b> <b>structures</b> matter.|$|R

The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.|$|E
5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the <b>economic</b> <b>structure</b> and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the Armia Krajowa's Operation Tempest in 1944, control over Polish territories passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to the Polish communists, formally led by their Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego; PKWN), an early government, from late July 1944 in existence in Lublin. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland, despite having minuscule popular support. PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the March Constitution of Poland, as opposed to the April Constitution. On September 6, PKWN issued its momentous land reform decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and <b>economic</b> <b>structure</b> of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from the parceling of the larger estates.|$|E

30|$|The {{contention}} that “inclusive” institutions are the deep determinants {{of economic growth}} remains unsatisfactory. This paper develops an alternative theoretical and empirical case that <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> are the fundamental cause of <b>economic</b> performance. <b>Economic</b> <b>structures</b> determine the rate of structural learning, affect institutional performance, influence the distribution of income and establish the direction of political transitions, thereby, economic performance. The paper highlights the feedback loops among institutions, political power and <b>economic</b> <b>structures,</b> thus, markets on their own will not ensure growth-enhancing transformations. The workings of this framework are illustrated using a USA case study, and it exposes the structural origins of the financial crisis.|$|R
5|$|Upon his {{election}} to the presidency, Bolivia was South America's poorest nation. Morales' government did not initiate any fundamental change in Bolivia's <b>economic</b> <b>structure,</b> and in their National Development Plan (PDN) for 2006–10, they adhered largely to the country's previous liberal economic model. Bolivia's economy was based largely on the extraction of natural resources, with the nation having South America's second largest reserves of natural gas. As per {{his election}} pledge, Morales took increasing state control of this hydrocarbon industry with Supreme Decree 2870; previously, corporations paid 18% of their profits to the state, but Morales symbolically reversed this, so that 82% of profits went {{to the state and}} 18% to the companies. The oil companies threatened to take the case to the international courts or cease operating in Bolivia, but ultimately relented. Thus, where Bolivia had received $173 million from hydrocarbon extraction in 2002, by 2006 they received $1.3 billion. Although not technically a form of nationalization, Morales and his government referred to it as such, resulting in criticism from sectors of the Bolivian left. In June 2006, Morales announced his desire to nationalize mining, electricity, telephones, and railroads, and in February 2007 nationalized the Vinto metallurgy plant, refusing to compensate Glencore, which the government asserted had obtained the contract illegally. Although the FSTMB miners' federation called for the government to nationalise the mines, the government did not do so, instead stating that any transnational corporations operating in Bolivia legally would not be expropriated.|$|E

30|$|While the {{literature}} on industrial and technology policy are occupied with documenting cases of success and failure, the theory of <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> and structural change remain underdeveloped. The forceful implementation of austerity in Europe {{and other parts of}} the world, even after evidence points to less austere policies, illustrates the power theory has over public policy. This paper must be understood as a call to enhance our theoretical understanding of structural change. We argue that <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> must be placed at the centre of the analysis to better understand economic change, disparities in income and differences in political economy dynamics across time and space. Future work needs to integrate theories of financial crises with the theory of structural change, and in-depth research is needed for a complete understanding of how <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> affect the distribution of income. Finally, we need to return to the days of high development theory with <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> in the driving seat.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} about the degree of business cycle synchronization between the euro area countries and eight new European Union member states. We analyze the direct and indirect effects of similarity of <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> and trade intensity on the co-movement of fluctuations of economic activity across these countries and find that bilateral similarity of <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> and trade intensity were positively and significantly associated with business cycle correlations. This result is robust to different estimation techniques. Similarity of <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> had an additional indirect positive effect on business cycle synchronization via its positive effect on trade intensity. The bilateral business cycle correlations {{are found to be}} endogenous with respect to bilateral similarity of <b>economic</b> <b>structures</b> and bilateral trade intensity suggesting that the new European Union countries will better satisfy the Optimum Currency Area criteria after the adoption of the euro.
