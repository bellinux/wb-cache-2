40|$|This study {{explored}} {{group and}} relational differences in personality, health, and coping across 189 Australian students and 243 Singaporean students. Life Orientation Test—Revised showed a one-factor structure for Australians but a two-factor structure for Singaporeans. Australians {{tended to be}} more agreeable, more conscientious, more optimistic, more satisfied with their lives, while Singaporeans {{tended to be more}} neurotic and more pessimistic. Singaporeans tended to utilize less frequent adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. Neuroticism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> predictor for state-trait anxiety and stress, while unipolar optimism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> predictor for life satisfaction and unipolar pessimism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> predictor for trait anxiety for both samples. Bipolar optimism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> predictor for trait anxiety and life satisfaction for both samples whereas it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> predictor for state anxiety for the Singaporean sample. Optimists, pessimists, and neurotics in both samples tended to use different coping strategies. Limitations and implications are discussed...|$|R

This study also aims {{to analyze the}} levels of school bullying and self-concept clarity in adolescents according to some variables. The study group consists of 313 {{high school students in}} 9 th, 10 th, 11 th and 12 th grades at Ataturk High School, Kurtulus High School and Omer Seyfettin High School of Ankara during 2008 - 2009 academic year. In this study, Student Relationships Attitude Scale (SRAS) developed by Koc (2006) and Self-Concept Clarity Scale developed by Campbell, Trapnell, Heine, Kartz, Lavallee ve Lehman (1996) and adapted to high school students by Gungor (2000) were used. T-test and one way anova were used to analyze the data. It was found that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference in subscale points of avoidance from bullying and bullying personality of SRAS according to gender; however there <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference in the subscale points of self confidence subscale. It was determined that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference in the subscale points of bullying personality and self confidence of SRAS according to the mother's attitude; however there <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference in the subscale points of avoidance from bullying.
