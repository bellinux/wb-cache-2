25|$|Symptoms of an <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail</b> include pain {{along the}} margins of the nail (caused by hypergranulation that occurs around the {{aforementioned}} margins), worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear, and sensitivity to pressure of any kind, even the weight of bedsheets. Bumping of an affected toe can produce sharp and even excruciating pain as the tissue is punctured further by the nail. By {{the very nature of the}} condition, ingrown nails become easily infected unless special care is taken early to treat the condition by keeping the area clean. Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail, drainage of pus and watery discharge tinged with blood. The main symptom is swelling at the base of the nail on the ingrowing side (though it may be both sides).|$|E

50|$|Following {{injection}} {{of a local}} anaesthetic {{at the base of}} the toenail and perhaps application of a tourniquet, the surgeon will remove (ablate) the edge of the nail growing into the flesh and destroy the matrix area with phenol to permanently and selectively ablate the matrix that is manufacturing the ingrown portion of the nail (i.e., the nail margin). This is known as a partial matrixectomy, phenolisation, phenol avulsion or partial nail avulsion with matrix phenolisation. Also, any infection is surgically drained. After this procedure, other suggestions on aftercare will be made, such as salt water bathing of toe. The point of the procedure is that the nail does not grow back where the matrix has been cauterized and so the chances of further ingrowths are very low. The nail is slightly (usually one millimetre or so) narrower than prior to the procedure and is barely noticeable one year later. The surgery is advantageous because it can be performed in the doctor's office under local anaesthesia with minimal pain following the intervention. Also, there is no visible scar on the surgery site and a nominal chance of recurrence. Although the chances of recurrence of ingrown nails in an area that has undergone phenolisation are lower than nails who have just had the <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail</b> removed, if the application of the phenol was improperly performed or an insufficient quantity of phenol was applied to the afflicted area; the nail matrix can regenerate from its partial cauterization and grow new nail. This will result in a recurrence of the <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail</b> in approximately 4-6 months as the skin that the original <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail</b> grew under would also recover from the procedure (but the recovery of the skin either side of the nail is standard in this type of procedure) as well as the nail. Many patients who suffer from a minor recurrence of the <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail</b> often have the procedure performed again. However, some patients who suffer a more severe recurrence see a podiatrist who will perform the procedure again or resort to a more drastic and permanent solution (such as removal of the entire nail or the Vandenbos Procedure) if there are multiple recurrences of the <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} place for <b>ingrown</b> <b>nails</b> {{is in the}} big toe, but {{ingrowth}} can occur on any <b>nail.</b> <b>Ingrown</b> <b>nails</b> can be avoided by cutting nails straight across; not along a curve, not too short, and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow of a 'toe box', will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp square corners may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves {{the leading edge of}} the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable. Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh, this is often done as a partial wedge resection at a podiatrist's office. <b>Ingrown</b> toe <b>nails</b> can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma where the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Also, injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal or even bulged or crooked.|$|R
25|$|The {{common opinion}} is that the nail enters inside the paronychium, but an ingrown toenail can simply be {{overgrown}} toe skin. The condition starts from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium, then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma.

40|$|Although {{surgical}} treatment of nail conditions {{can be traced}} back centuries to the writings of Paul Aegineta (625 – 690 AC), {{little is known about the}} physical laws governing nail growth. Such a poor understanding together with the increasing number of nail salons in the high street should raise legitimate concerns regarding the different procedures applied to nails. An understanding of the physics of nail growth is therefore essential to engage with human medicine and to understand the aetiology of nail conditions. In this context, a theory of nail plate adhesion, including a physical description of nail growth can be used to determine the transverse and longitudinal curvatures of the nail plate that are so important in the physical diagnosis of some nail conditions. As a result physics sheds light on: (a) why/how nails/hooves adhere strongly, yet grow smoothly; (b) why hoof/claw/nail growth rates are similar across species; (c) potential nail damage incurred by poor trimming; (d) the connection between three previously unrelated nail conditions, i. e. spoon-shaped, pincer and <b>ingrown</b> <b>nails</b> and; last but not least, (e) why <b>ingrown</b> <b>nails</b> occur preferentially in the big toes...|$|R

5000|$|Acute {{paronychia}} is {{an infection}} of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a finger or, less commonly, a toe, lasting less than six weeks. The infection generally starts in the paronychium {{at the side of}} the nail, with local redness, swelling, and pain. Acute paronychia is usually caused by direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold, and may be from relatively minor events, such as dishwashing, an injury from a splinter or thorn, nail biting, biting or picking at a hangnail, finger sucking, an <b>ingrown</b> <b>nail,</b> or manicure procedures. When no pus is present, warm soaks for acute paronychia is reasonable, even though there is a lack of evidence to support its use. Antibiotics such as clindamycin or cephalexin are also often used, the first being more effective in areas where MRSA is common. If there are signs of an abscess (the presence of pus) drainage is recommended.|$|E

50|$|In case of {{recurrence}} {{in spite of}} complete removal, and if the patient never feels any pain before inflammation occurs, the condition {{is more likely to}} be onychia which is often confused for an <b>ingrown</b> or ingrowing <b>nail</b> (onychocryptosis). Complete removal of the whole nail is a simple procedure. Anaesthetic is injected and the nail is removed quickly by pulling it outward from the toe. The patient can function normally immediately after the procedure and most discomfort fades after a few days. The entire procedure can be performed in approximately 20 minutes and is less complex than the wedge resection above. The nail will grow back. However, in most cases it will cause further problems as it can become ingrown very easily as the nail grows outward. It can be easily injured by concussion and in some cases grows back too thickly, too wide or deformed. This procedure can thus result in chronic <b>ingrown</b> <b>nails</b> and is therefore considered a generally unsuccessful solution, especially considering the pain involved. Accordingly, in some cases as determined by a doctor, the nail matrix is coated with a chemical (usually phenol) so none of the nail will ever grow back. This is known as a permanent or full nail avulsion, or full matrixectomy, phenolisation, or full phenol avulsion. As can be seen in the images below, the nail-less toe does not look like a normal toe. Fake nails or nail varnish can still be applied to the area to provide a temporary normal appearance. In a small number of cases phenolisation is not successful and must be repeated, and podiatrists routinely warn patients of this possibility of regrowth.|$|R

40|$|Onychocryptosis (<b>ingrown</b> <b>nails)</b> is {{the most}} common of pedal foot {{maladies}} seen by podiatrists (Armstrong et al., 2000) and makes up 3 - 5 % of all foot problems. This condition is characterized by the nail plate growing into and cutting the lateral nail fold. Symptoms include erythema (redness) of the lateral nail fold, oedema (swelling) of the lateral nail fold and tenderness to pressure (Zuber, 2002). Within the Materia Medica, the homoeopathic remedy Magnetis Polus Australis is indicated for the treatment of the symptom of “ingrowing toenail” (Vermeulen, 1997). Although used for nearly 200 years, no research has been conducted to verify this claim. The study aimed at determining whether Magnetis Polus Australis in the 7 th and 30 th centesimal potencies is effective in treating the symptoms of onychocryptosis of the hallux such as pain, tenderness to pressure, oedema and erythema. The study, a double-blind placebo study, involved thirty participants. The placebo group included ten participants and the experimental group included twenty participants, ten of which received the 7 CH and the other ten received the 30 CH. Each group took the homoeopathic or placebo medication orally twice daily for a period of three weeks. The participants were followed-up with an assessment questionnaire every two weeks for a one month period. At the end of the research period these questionnaires with the data were collected and statistically analyzed using chi-squared tests. The study indicated that Magnetis Polus Australis has a positive effect in the treatment of onychocryptosis of the hallux and has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing inflammation associated with it. Overall the 30 th centesimal potency shows the highest percentage of improvement in the symptoms of onychocryptosis, though the percentages between the two experimental groups were very close.
