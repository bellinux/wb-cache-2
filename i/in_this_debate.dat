5|$|After this rejection, the {{painting}} was sold to a Swedish art collector who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if {{the painting}} belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that {{the painting was}} both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality.

5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E

5|$|At {{that time}} Wiśniowiecki also {{engaged in a}} {{political}} conflict over nobility titles, in particular, the title of prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); the gist of the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate {{as to the}} star's actual distance from Earth. The debate revolves around the different methodologies to measure distanceparallax being the most central, but photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding valuable insights as well. Before the Hipparcos mission, the estimated distance for the Pleiades star cluster was around 135 parsecs or 440 light years. However, when the Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997, the new parallax measurement indicated a much closer distance of about 119 ± 1.0 pc (388 ± 3.2 ly), triggering substantial controversy among astronomers. If the Hipparcos estimate were accurate, some astronomers contend, then stars in the cluster {{would have to be}} fainter than Sun-like starsa notion that would challenge some of the fundamental precepts of stellar structure. Interferometric measurements taken in 2004 by the Hubble Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors and corroborated by studies from Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory showed the original estimate of 135 pc or 440 ly to be the correct figure. However a recent study published in 2009 has argued otherwise, publishing a new parallax measurement of 8.32 mas with a very tight error factor of 0.13 mas yielding a distance of 120.2 ± 1.9 pc or 392.0 ± 6.0 ly. Which distance estimate future astrometric calculations will corroborate remains to be seen, although the upcoming Gaia mission with its expected launch in late 2012 could well prove to be the ultimate arbiter <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate.</b>|$|E

25|$|What was {{at stake}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> which pitted the {{administration}} against the grantees {{at the end of}} the 1820s and the beginning of the next decade, was whether there remained land to be distributed.

25|$|Part of {{the problem}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> {{revolved}} around {{the high level of}} abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic model-building on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied predictions about the real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to say anything about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E
25|$|While {{some might}} say that Nakamichi {{violated}} the tape recording standards to achieve the highest dynamics possible, producing non-compatible cassettes for playback on other machines, {{the reasons for this}} are more complex than they appear on the surface. Different interpretations of the cassette standard resulted in a 4dB ambiguity at 16kHz. Technically, both camps <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> were still within the original cassette specification as no tolerance for frequency response was provided above 12.5kHz and all calibration tones above 12.5kHz are considered optional. But also Nakamichi is not error-prone. Decreasing noise at 16kHz also decreases the maximum signal level at 16kHz, the HighFrequency-Dynamics stay almost constant.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, {{there was}} {{considerable}} and intense public debate {{on the use of}} dental amalgam.
