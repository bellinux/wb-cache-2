25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing <b>extraneous</b> <b>noise</b> to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure.

This paper presents a model, dynamic in structure, sufficiently suitable for removing the ECG artefacts caused by embedded objects in the body using independent component analysis technique. By simulation, the model is able to detect and remove <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> in the conductive paths and discern essential nodes of ECG that are useful to clinicians. Our study, also demonstrates that convolutive ICA can be regarded as a useful tool for accurately estimating the effects of embedded object in the patients on ECG signals...|$|R

Here we present an active noise suppression scheme and its experimental implementation. The main {{challenge is to}} selectively sense and suppress <b>extraneous</b> thermal <b>noise</b> without affecting motion of the oscillator. Our solution is to monitor two modes of the optical cavity, each with different sensitivity to the oscillator’s motion but similar sensitivity to the extraneous thermal motion. This information is used to imprint “anti-noise” onto {{the frequency of the}} incident laser field. In our system, based on a nano-mechanical membrane coupled to a Fabry-Pérot cavity, simulation and experiment demonstrate that <b>extraneous</b> thermal <b>noise</b> can be selectively suppressed and that the associated limit on optical cooling can be reduced...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{responsibilities}} of a sound engineer is to control {{the quality of the}} sound during the recording process. An important qualitative aspect of a recording, besides the musicality of the performance, is its timbral content. Proper level and spectral balance between the mixed elements of the recording and the absence of <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> and distortion are key elements. Therefore, timbre perception acuity is an essential skill for sound engineers. This thesis proposes a computer-assisted system as a training tool for developing and maintaining aural skills related to timbre perception. A set of criteria for the design of such a system based on current knowledge in timbre perception is presented and an exploratory implementation is described. Limits of the current system are discussed and areas that need further investigation are identified...|$|R
50|$|One {{benefit of}} the wOOx bass {{radiator}} (and passive radiators in general) {{when compared to the}} more common bass-reflex vents {{is that there is no}} possibility of air turbulence noise if the resonant system is greatly excited. As a result, additional equalization applied near the enclosure's tuning frequency can increase system output without generating <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> or greatly increasing cone excursion of the active driver. Many wOOx-equipped mini-stereo systems produced by Philips feature a three-level equalization control which applies additional bass equalization at frequencies which excite the wOOx bass radiator, improving the visceral 'impact' of the bass through the wOOx radiator's extreme air displacement capability. This use of active equalization to increase overall system output is the primary characteristic that differentiates wOOx technology from typical loudspeaker systems equipped with passive radiators.|$|R
5000|$|King of Jazz was {{the first}} feature-length film to use a mostly {{pre-recorded}} soundtrack made independently of the actual filming. Whiteman insisted that musical numbers featuring his orchestra should be pre-recorded {{in order to obtain}} the best sound, avoiding the poor recording conditions and <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> typical of a movie studio sound stage. Universal opposed the idea, but Whiteman prevailed over the reluctant studio executives. After the sound was recorded, it was played back through a loudspeaker while the scene was being filmed and the performers matched their actions to the recording.

Plate specimens of 6 A 1 - 4 V titanium, 2219 -T 87 aluminum, and 18 -Ni maraging steel were tested with and without crack starter notches. It was found that significant acoustic emission signals could be detected in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 400 kHz. Cracks emanating from starter notches were monitored by the ultrasonic pulse-echo technique and periodically measured by micro-optical examination. Methods used to reduce the effects of <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> (i. e., machine noises, fretting) are described.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} employing {{two groups}} of bilinguals, Korean-English and Spanish-English, and two modalities of presentation, visual and auditory, were performed.

Another group was {{asked to respond to}} sentences in which the language change occurred within one of the constituents. Longer response times resulted from the sentences in which the language change occurred within a constituent. Ladefoged and Broadbent (1960) presented evidence that the unit of speech per-ception must be longer than a single speech sound.

40|$|As {{carbon fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer composites (CFRPs) are multifunctional materials {{in which the}} damage is coupled with the change in material electrical resistance, the use of electrical conductivity monitoring can provide real-time information concerning the damage state through examining the change in resistance/electric potential. It has been shown that, in some recent work, resistance measurement allows the monitoring of the in-situ evolution of various internal damage nucleation and growth phenomena such as fiber fractures, interply matrix cracks and interply delamination. However, {{one of the common}} difficulties in measuring the small changes of electrical signals due to failures in the CFRPs is the contamination of <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> during the detection process. In this paper, signal analysis procedures are applied to minimize or eliminate the contaminated noise during the damage detection process, as to maximize the accuracy of the damage detection process. In addition to the traditional time signal averaging technique, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to filter at the narrow band near the input frequency as to eliminate the unwanted noises. However, based on laboratory experiments, the authors have found that the frequency filtering techniques will retain significant inaccuracy when <b>extraneous</b> <b>noises</b> are in the neighborhood of the input frequency, and, in some cases, accurate measurement of the electrical signals can be susceptable when noise components are significantly higher than the original input signal. To overcome this drawback, the use of a joint time-frequency technique with wavelet transforms has been introduced. As a joint time-frequency signal analysis tool, the wavelet transforms offer simultaneous interpretation of the signal in both time and frequency domains which results in signal filtering effects in both time and frequency domains. Experimental results by the authors have shown significant improvement in accuracy when using the wavelets than those of the FFT and the time averaging techniques. This paper demonstrates the wavelet transform applications in electrical signal noise reduction of CFRPs as well as the use of both continuous wavelet (CWT) and discrete wavelet (DWT) transforms. It has been found that when noise is small, the DWT is more appropriate as the original signal can be reconstructed to offer better comparative information. The use of CWT will provide better results when random noises are significantly higher. Although the use of CWT does not have the ability revert back to the original signal, the comparison of the CWT coefficients can offer more valuable information concerning the damage occurrences while the repeated applications of DWT will result in accumulated errors such that the original shapes of the wavelet cannot be correctly reconstructed...|$|R

Despite the contrast between elementary cal-culation and "real mathematics, " it is still true, from a psychologist's point of view, that adding is complex problem solving.
