The <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> using moisture content gradient as a driving force was applied successfully by Wu (1989) and Doe et al. (1994). Though the agreement between the moisture-content profiles predicted by the <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> based on moisture-content gradients is better at lower moisture contents than at higher ones, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that there are significantly different moisture-transport mechanisms operating at higher moisture contents for this timber.

The <b>diffusion</b> <b>model</b> is used for this thesis based on this empirical evidence that the moisture-content gradient is a driving force for drying this type of impermeable timber.|$|E

Using <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> {{it is possible to}} formulate compact descriptions for the dynamics of real-world processes in terms of stochastic differential equations. Despite the exibility of these models, they can often be extremely difficult to work with. This is especially true for non-linear and/or time-inhomogeneous <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> where even basic statistical properties of the process can be elusive. As such, we explore various techniques for analysing non-linear <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> in contexts ranging from conducting inference under discrete observation and solving first passage time problems, to the analysis of jump diffusion processes and highly non-linear diffusion processes. We apply the methodology to a number of real-world ecological and financial problems of interest and demonstrate how non-linear <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> can be used to better understand such phenomena. In conjunction with the methodology, we develop a series of software packages {{that can be used to}} accurately and efficiently analyse various classes of non-linear <b>diffusion</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

In addition to these neuroscience applications, <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> (or their discrete time, random walk, analogues) have been used by cognitive scientists to model performance in a variety of tasks ranging from sensory detection, and perceptual discrimination, to memory recognition, and categorization.

40|$|Over {{the last}} fifty years, {{diffusion}} {{researchers have sought to}} explain why the rate of adoption of an innovation varies over time. Some innovations are adopted quickly as compared to others, which take decades for adoption. However, the rate of adoption of an innovation is observed to follow the 'S-curve'. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>modeling</b> is an approach to analyse the process of diffusion of innovation. Several <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> have been developed to predict the penetration curves while many other models are developed to explain the complexities of the underlying diffusion process. From the commercial perspective, <b>diffusion</b> <b>modeling</b> is of interest to managers because of its ability to predict sales of a product. Moreover, managers use <b>diffusion</b> <b>models</b> to chalk out strategies for successful product management. This thesis classifies the two <b>diffusion</b> <b>modeling</b> approaches: aggregate and individual. In aggregate modeling approach, the target market is aggregated and analyzed as a whole. Models are developed to forecast sales, analyze the effects of marketing efforts, examine the effects technology interactions, and study cross country <b>diffusion.</b> In individual <b>modeling</b> approach, <b>diffusion</b> is investigated at the consumer-level. The Models incorporate individual preferences in adoption decisions and study various effects of social structure and communication patterns. We analyze these models and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. Beyond this, we identify some of the unconquered problems of multi-product interactions and show the importance of <b>diffusion</b> <b>modeling</b> in this new frontier. by Naveen Chandra Ranganath.
