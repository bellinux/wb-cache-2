Karlovitz numbers generally {{were less than}} 0. 3 so that the flames were remote from quenching conditions. Within this range, {{the ratio of the}} unstretched (<b>plane</b> <b>flames)</b> to stretched laminar burning velocities varied linearly with Karlovitz numbers, yielding Markstein numbers that were independent of Karlovitz numbers for a particular reactant mixture. In addition, Markstein numbers varied in a roughly linear manner with fuel-equivalence ratios over the range of the measurements, which were somewhat removed from flammability limits where behavior might differ. Effects of stretch were substantial: Markstein numbers varied from - 2. 5 to 7. 2 yielding corresponding laminar burning velocity variations of 0. 4 - 2. 7 times the value for an unstretched (<b>plane)</b> <b>flame</b> over the test range. The ranges of fuel-equivalence ratios for unstable preferential-diffusion conditions (negative Markstein numbers) were as follows: propane, greater than 1. 44; methane, less than 0. 74; ethane, greater than 1. 68; and ethylene, greater than 1. 95.

50|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. C-741 {{on the night}} of March 2, 1931, on a flight from Seattle, Wash.

40|$|The local burning velocity, {{which is}} based on the {{consumption}} rate of the unburned mixture, is one of the dominant parameters in turbulent premixed flames. In this study, the evaluating method of the local burning velocity was investigated using DNS data of turbulent premixed flames with different Lewis numbers. The local burning velocity was evaluated by integrating the chemical reaction rates along normal to the flame surface within three kinds of integration ranges that were defined as follows: the range which is defined by the half length of normal to the flame surface between its certain point and the other point crossing the flame surface (Range 1); the range which is defined by the reaction progress variable that the chemical reaction rate along normal to a <b>planer</b> <b>flame</b> surface takes a half of the maximum value (Range 2); the range which is defined by the length of normal to the flame surface between its certain point and the point which has the extreme value of the reaction progress variable (Range 3).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} mono-dimensional traveling wave of a coupled thermo-diffusive–kinetic model describing the propagation of a <b>plane</b> <b>flame</b> in a polydisperse spray. We first present the model which bridges {{the gap between the}} models used for realistic numerical simulations and the ones used for mathematical studies; it couples a thermo-diffusive model for the gaseous phase with a one-step finite rate chemistry with a kinetic equation describing the vaporization of a polydisperse spray, the vaporization rate of which depends on the local gas temperature and fuel mass fraction. Such a mixed hyperbolic-parabolic system of equations offers two difficulties as compared to previous works: first there is no spatial diffusion on the spray variables and second, if we look for a traveling wave solution, the resulting system of equation is not a system of ODE’s but a system of ODE’s coupled to a partial differential equation. In order to tackle these difficulties, we introduce some spatial diffusion, which can be interpreted as the gas turbulent agitation, and discretize the PDE in the size phase space using a multi-fluid model. We can then use the topological degree for elliptic systems in unbounded domains, and deduce the existence of the wave for the modified and discretized system. We finally pass to the limit in zero spatial mass diffusion, subsequently, in the droplet size discretization step, and conclude with the existence of a traveling wave for the initial system. It is a first step {{in the study of the}} qualitative properties of polydispersped spray flames. ha l-...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{analytical model}} is presented for calculating the longitudinal acoustic modes of idealized "dump-type" ramjet engines. The geometry considered is the coaxial flow type with {{the inlet flow}} opening to the combustor at a simple dump plane. Since the frequencies are very low, the dominant modes are the one-dimensional longitudinal modes and allow the predictions to be extended to more complicated geometries (such as side dump combustors) with good success. A <b>plane</b> <b>flame</b> has been studied and incorporated into the combustor model where the flame is allowed to move or oscillate in the combustor. This provides three mechanisms of interaction at the flame sheet: change in mean temperature in the combustor, energy conversion at the sheet due to upstream fluctuations, and fluctuating heat release. A supersonic inlet upstream contains a shock wave in its diffuser section while the downstream exit is terminated by a choked nozzle. The linear coupling of the acoustic and entropy waves at the inlet shock, flame sheet, and exit nozzle along with acoustic admittances at the inlet and exit are combined to determine {{the stability of the}} system as well as the acoustic modes. Since the acoustic and entropy waves travel at different velocities, the geometry is a critical factor in determining stability. Typical values of the admittances will produce damped solutions when the entropy is neglected, but, as the ratio of the entropy to acoustic fluctuations is increased, the coupling can either feed acoustic energy into or out of different modes independently. This transfer of energy has a destabilizing or stabilizing effect on the acoustic modes of the system depending on the relative phases between the acoustic and entropy waves. In the linear case, the entropy and acoustics are decoupled in the flow field. All linear coupling occurs at the boundary conditions. For cases where the entropy fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the pressure oscillations and the coupling is of comparable order, the linear stability of the acoustic field is strongly dependent upon the entropy fluctuations. The linear acoustics are predominantly governed by the boundary conditions; thus it is imperative that the entire system of inlet, combustor, and exit be considered together to determine the characteristic eigenvalues (resonant frequencies) and eigenfunctions (mode shapes). In addition, there are two modes of acoustic pressure oscillations: the classical acoustic mode and the entropy-induced mode of pressure oscillation. The nonlinear case treats the quadratic nonlinear fluid mechanic interactions in the coupling of two acoustic modes. The result is that the nonlinear acoustic-entropy interactions are much smaller than the acoustic-acoustic interactions for this case. Hence, the nonlinear acoustic field is influenced by the nonuniform entropy only by its dependence upon the linear solution which can be strongly dependent upon the entropy. The energy in the acoustics of this model is controlled by the energy loss (gain) at the boundaries balanced with the energy gain (loss) at the flame front. Acoustic energy is typically lost at both the inlet and exit, but fluctuating entropy waves convecting with the mean flow velocity that impinge upon a choked nozzle generate acoustic waves that can, under the proper conditions, feed acoustic energy into the system. In addition, the Rayleigh condition for driving the system with a fluctuating heat release can also contribute to the stability of the system. The <b>plane</b> <b>flame</b> mechanism also contributes to the acoustic energy from the interaction of entropy and acoustic waves at a flame sheet. This allows a systematic study of the influence of entropy-acoustic wave interactions on the linear stability and modes of this combustor system...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} and numerical examination of laminar lean premixed combustion of methane air mixtures at high pressures under normal and microgravity is {{the aim of}} this thesis. The elimination of buoyancy under microgravity is essential for the exact determination of the flammability limit and the burning velocity and furthermore allows the analysis of flame instabilities. First the lean flammability limit for upward combustion of methane was determined by the pressure increase inside the combustion chamber for pressures up to 70 bar under normal gravity. The chamber was equipped with an optical access which was used for filming the combustion in the microgravity experiments. These experiments were conducted at the Bremen drop tower which allows 4, 7 sec microgravity. In the experiments the combustion chamber was first filled with a predefined methane air mixture which was then ignited by a spark. The combustion was then filmed by a high speed camera with schlieren optics. These films were used to determine the flame speeds and the burning velocity. The burning velocity for mixtures close to the flammability limit were ca. 1 mm/s. The flammability limit under microgravity is leaner than under normal conditions. Furthermore flame front instabilities were observed. The development of the amplitudes of the cellular instabilities were different to each other and a small change in the initial conditions had a large influence on the behavior of the flame front. The numerical simulations of one-dimensional <b>plane</b> <b>flames</b> in an idealized combustion chamber were conducted with the program FlameMaster.

40|$|The {{current work}} {{examines}} regimes of the hydrogen-oxygen flame propagation and ignition of mixtures heated by radiation emitted from the flame. The gaseous phase {{is assumed to}} be transparent for the radiation, while the suspended particles of the dust cloud ahead of the flame absorb and reemit the radiation. The radiant heat absorbed by the particles is then lost by conduction to the surrounding unreacted gaseous phase so that the gas phase temperature lags that of the particles. The direct numerical simulations solve the full system of two phase gas dynamic time-dependent equations with a detailed chemical kinetics for a <b>plane</b> <b>flames</b> propagating through a dust cloud. It is shown that depending on the spatial distribution of the dispersed particles and on the value of radiation absorption length the consequence of the radiative preheating of the mixture ahead of the flame can be either the increase of the flame velocity for uniformly dispersed particles or ignition either new deflagration or detonation ahead of the original flame via the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism {{in the case of a}} layered particle-gas cloud deposits. In the latter case the ignited combustion regime depends on the radiation absorption length and correspondingly on the steepness of the formed temperature gradient in the preignition zone that can be treated independently of the primary flame. The impact of radiation heat transfer in a particle-laden flames is of paramount importance for better risk assessment and represents a route for understanding of dust explosion origin.

40|$|The {{properties}} of methane are of considerable significance {{at the present}} time in the United Kingdom following the discovery of large quantities of natural gas under the North Sea. One property of particular interest, mainly because of its importance in connection with flame stability is burning velocity. The concept of burning velocity as a physicochemical constant for a particular reactant mixture was first suggested by Mallard and Le Chatelier (l) nearly a century ago when they referred to "la vitesse normale", a characteristic of "deflagration" as distinct from detonation. Over thirty years ago, Coward and Payman (2) considered that "the fundamental speed of flame is the most difficult of all the factors to analyze [...] and when physicochemical hypotheses are formulated, they must be tested by measurements of the fundamental speed. What measurements are available?" The derivation of burning velocities for hydrocarbon-air flames from fundamental data is now a not-too-distant prospect (3) following the development of a satisfactory predictive method for hydrogen flames. However, until this becomes fact, and afterwards for comparative purposes, we must reiterate Coward and Payman's question. "What measurements are available?" There are in fact many measurements available; the burning velocity of methane-air flames {{has been the subject of}} many experimental investigations over the years. However, there exist considerable differences in the results of various workers (b) and no agreement on a standardized method exists. Furthermore the range of mixture composition over which burning velocity data are available is somewhat limited. As Andrews and Bradley (It) have recently stated, although the theoretical definition of burning velocity is simple, unfortunately the same cannot be said of its practical measurement. The theoretical definition of burning velocity relates to the unidimensional flame model and is the velocity with which a <b>plane</b> <b>flame</b> front moves normal to its surface through the adjacent unburned gas. It is an invariant property of the reactant mixture depending only on the composition and state of the initial mixture...|$|R
