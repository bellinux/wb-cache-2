40|$|Abstract–Dynamic {{resource}} management {{by the various}} cognitive nodes fundamentally changes the passive way that wireless nodes are currently adapting their transmission strategies to match available wireless resources, by enabling them to consciously influence the wireless system dynamics based on the gathered information about other network nodes. In this paper, we discuss the main challenges of performing such dynamic {{resource management}} by emphasizing the distributed information in the dynamic multi-agent system. Specifically, the decisions on how to adapt the aforementioned resource management at sources and relays need to be performed in an informationally-decentralized manner, as the tolerable delay does not allow propagating information back and forth throughout the multi-hop infrastructure to a centralized decision maker. The term “cognitive ” refers in our paper to both the capability of the network nodes to achieving large spectral efficiencies through exploitation and mitigation of channel and interference variability by dynamically using different frequency bands {{as well as their}} ability to learn the “environment” (channel conditions and source characteristic) and the actions of competing nodes through the designed information exchange. We propose our dynamic resource management algorithms performed at each network nodes integrated with multi-agent learning that explicitly consider the timeliness and the cost of such information exchange.

These systems are deployed wherever it is not possible to maintain a wired network infrastructure and to recharge/replace batteries and the goal is then to prolong as much as possible the lifetime of the system. In our work, we aim to modify the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling algorithm to minimize the energy consumption using the <b>Dynamic</b> Voltage and <b>Frequency</b> <b>Selection.</b> To this end, we propose an Energy Saving EDF (ES-EDF) algorithm that is capable of stretching the worst case execution time of tasks as much as possible without violating deadlines. We prove that ES-EDF is optimal in minimizing processor energy consumption and maximum lateness for which an upper bound on the processor energy saving is derived. In order to demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm, we evaluate it by means of simulation. Experimental results show that ES-EDF outperforms EDF and Enhanced EDF (E-EDF) algorithms in terms of both percentage of feasible task sets and energy savings. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} multi-user resource management in multi-hop cognitive radio networks for delay-sensitive applications. Since the tolerable delay does not allow propagating global information back and forth throughout the multi-hop network to a centralized decision maker, the source nodes and relays need to adapt their actions (transmission frequency channel and route selections) in a distributed manner, based on local network information. We propose a distributed resource management algorithm that allows network nodes to exchange information and that explicitly considers the delays and cost of exchanging the network information over the multi-hop cognitive radio networks. The term “cognitive ” refers in our paper to both the capability of the network nodes to achieve large spectral efficiencies by dynamically exploiting available frequency channels {{as well as their}} ability to learn the “environment ” (the actions of interfering nodes) based on the designed information exchange. Note that the node competition is due to the mutual interference of neighboring nodes using the same frequency channel. Based on this, we adopt a multi-agent learning approach, adaptive fictitious play, which uses the available interference information. We also discuss the tradeoff between the cost of the required information exchange and the learning efficiency. The results show that our distributed resource management approach improves the PSNR of multiple video streams by more than 3 dB as opposed to the state-of-the-art <b>dynamic</b> <b>frequency</b> channel/route <b>selection</b> approaches without learning capability, when the network resources are limited.

40|$|An all-digital self-adaptive clock {{generation}} system capable of adapt the clock frequency {{to compensate the}} effects of PVTA variations on the IC propaga-tion delay and satisfy an externally set propagation length condition is presented. The design uses time-to-digital converters (TDCs) to measure the prop-agation length and a variable length ring oscillator (VLRO) to synthesize the clock signal. The VLRO naturally adapts its frequency to the PVTA varia-tions suffered by its logic gates while the TDCs are used to track these variations across the chip and modify the VLRO length in order to adapt the clock frequency to them. The system measurements, for a 45 nm FPGA, show that it adapts the VLRO length, and therefore the clock frequency, to satisfy the prop-agation length condition.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} deci-sion making in dynamic spectrum allocation radios by using energy detection while being close to the coverage area of a primary transmitter. Currently, the signal model used for <b>dynamic</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>selection</b> assumes that the primary signal is either absent or present with a fixed level. However, this model fails to capture the power distribution close to the cell border and thus the prediction capability of the related analytical approaches is rather limited.

On one hand, the proposed approximation allows to estimate the decision performance in a closed-form.
