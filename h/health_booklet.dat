40|$|The {{percentage}} of newborns with a neonatal whole blood thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) greater than 5 mIU/L {{has been used}} as an indicator of iodine deficiency at the population level. However, TSH levels in newborns may be influenced by many factors other than iodine status. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify neonatal, maternal, and pregnancy-related determinants of neonatal TSH levels in a retrospective cohort study. The study sample included 313 Belgian mothers and their 4 -to 5 -year-old children. The children had a neonatal TSH concentration between 0 and 15 mIU/L at neonatal screening, and blood samples were collected 3 to 5 days after birth. Children with suspected congenital hypothyroidism (neonatal TSH level > 15 mIU/L), prematurely born (ie, < 37 weeks), or with a low birth weight (ie, < 2500 g) were excluded. Information about maternal and birth-related determinants was collected from the neonatal screening center via a self-administered questionnaire filled in by the mother together with the child's <b>health</b> <b>booklet.</b> Higher TSH levels were found in spring and winter compared to summer and autumn (P =. 011). Higher TSH levels were associated with lifetime smoking behavior (up to child birth) in the mother (P =. 005), lower weight gain during pregnancy (P =. 014), and longer pregnancies (P =. 003).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} goitre, urinary iodine status, coverage of supplementation of iodized oil capsules, and current use of iodized salt in children in Lesotho. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of children from 50 primary schools in Lesotho. Thyroid glands of children aged 8 - 12 years were measured by palpation and graded according to the WHO, UNICEF, and the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency's (ICCIDD) joint criteria. The use of iodized oil capsules was determined by a structured questionnaire and verified with the children's <b>health</b> <b>booklets.</b> Iodine content of household salt samples was analysed. Casual urine samples were analysed for urinary iodine. FINDINGS: Median urinary iodine concentrations of 26. 3 µg/l (range 22. 3 - 47. 9 µg/l) indicated moderate iodine deficiency. More children in the mountains than in the lowlands were severely iodine deficient (17. 7 % vs 1. 9 %). Adjusted prevalence of goitre (4. 9 %) increased with age, was higher in girls than boys, and ranged from 2. 2 % to 8. 8 % in the different districts; this indicated no public health problem. Overall, 94. 4 % of salt samples were iodized, and coverage of supplementation with iodized oil capsules was 55. 1 %. CONCLUSION: Mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency exists in Lesotho. Iodine deficiency was more severe in the mountains than the lowlands and is still a concern for public health. Use of iodized salt coupled with iodized oil supplementation effectively controls iodine deficiency disorders. Effective monitoring programmes would ensure the use of adequately iodized salt throughout Lesotho and serve to evaluate progress towards optimal iodine nutrition.

METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 124 nuclear families (Fleurbaix-Laventie Ville Sant?tudy (FLVS) I and II), various anthropometric parameters were measured in both parents and their children, first when the children were prepubescent and again {{at the end of}} puberty. Troncular adiposity repartition was estimated by calculating troncular to peripheral skinfolds ratio and waist-to-hip circumferences ratio. Birth and infancy heights and weights were also obtained from the children's <b>health</b> <b>booklets.</b> Parent-child correlations were estimated in infancy, before {{and at the end of}} the child's puberty. A prospective analysis was performed to predict the changes in the children's measurements over puberty according to their parents' corresponding baseline values. RESULTS: BMI and weight correlations at birth were high (> 0. 30) with the mother and low (< 0. 10) with the father, then they converged to an intermediate level at 2 y and remained between 0. 2 and 0. 3 thereafter. Correlations for waist circumference were already present at the prepubertal period and persisted on the same level at the postpubertal period, whereas correlations for subcutaneous adiposity - measured by four skinfolds - and for adiposity distribution - measured by ratios - were higher at the postpubertal period. Moreover, the prospective approach showed that mother's BMI predicted the evolution of her children's BMI over puberty, whereas this relationship was observed more specifically with the father concerning adiposity distribution parameters. CONCLUSION: Maternal adiposity may act early in life on the adiposity of the child. Maternal and paternal adiposities seem to have quite distinct effects at two key periods of the child's adiposity development such as the prenatal and pubertal periods...|$|R
40|$|Biliary atresia, {{the most}} common cause of liver {{transplantation}} in children, remains a challenge for clinicians and investigators. The development of new therapeutic options, besides the typical hepatoportoenterostomy, depends on a greater understanding of its pathogenesis and how it relates to the clinical phenotypes at diagnosis and the rate of disease progression. In this review, we present a perspective of how recent research has advanced the understanding of the disease and has improved clinical care protocols. Molecular and morphological analyses at diagnosis point to the potential contributions of polymorphism in the CFC 1 and VEGF genes to the pathogenesis of the disease, and to an association between the degree of bile duct proliferation and long-term outcome. In experimental models, cholangiocytes do not appear to have antigen-presenting properties despite a substantial innate and adaptive immune response that targets the biliary epithelium and produces duct obstruction. Initial clinical trials assessing the efficacy of corticosteroids in decreasing the inflammation and improving outcome do not show a superior effect of corticosteroids as an adjuvant treatment following hepatoportoenterostomy. The best outcome still remains linked to an early diagnosis and surgical treatment. In this regard, the Yellow Alert campaign by the Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria and the inclusion of the Stool Color Card in the <b>health</b> <b>booklet</b> given to every neonate in Brazil have the potential to decrease the age of diagnosis, shorten the time between diagnosis and surgical treatment, and improve the long-term outcome of children with this devastating disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite the {{widespread}} use of written health education materials as interventions, relatively few studies have adequately evaluated the effectiveness of such materials on changing healthcare behaviors in the general population. Setting/ Participants: The study consisted of ten matched pairs of small rural towns in New South Wales, Australia, with a total combined population of approximately 25, 000 in both the intervention and control group towns. A randomized controlled trial was used. Intervention: Personal Health Record Booklets (PHRBs) that include the latest evidence-based recommendations for reducing risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease were developed using leading behavioral change theories to maximize effectiveness. The booklets included an explanatory letter, a gender-specific Better <b>Health</b> <b>Booklet,</b> and a gender-specific Better Health Diary. Following a media campaign, the PHRBs were mailed to all residents aged 20 to 60 years (about 12, 600 people) in the ten intervention towns. Family practitioners in the intervention towns were recruited to support and encourage people to use the PHRBs. Main Outcome Measures: Health Insurance Commission data for Papanicolaou (Pap) tests, mammograms, and skin operations were obtained for 5 years before the intervention, and 3 months and 1 year after the intervention. Results: No significant increases in the rates of Pap tests, mammograms, and skin operations were detected in either short- or long-term follow-ups. Conclusions: While PHRBs may represent an inexpensive, easy-to-produce, and time-efficient method of communicating information to the general population, it appears unlikely that any significant behavioral change will result unless such materials are targeted toward high-risk groups or constitute the first intervention for a particular risk factor...|$|E

Introduction: The ageing population {{is a global}} reality, even in developing countries people {{have never had a}} chance to live so long. This new demographic situation caused the necessity to develop legal provisions to guide social and health actions. Among them, the National Health Policy for the Elderly, marked by the paradigm of the functional capacity and along with it comes the Health Handbook of the Elderly, which represents a delimitation instrument of the profile of the elderly, identifying frail elderly people or in the process of embrittlement, collaborating with the formulation of health actions focused on aging well. Objective: The objective of this study is to know the social representations of elderly about the <b>health</b> <b>booklet</b> of the elderly and to understand its membership in the context of primary care. Methodology: This is an exploratory-descriptive study with a qualitative approach performed with 103 elderly people with age above sixty years at the units of the Sanitary District V. The study was conducted between July and September 2014, respecting the ethical criteria of the Resolution 466 / 12. The data collection was performed by a semi-structured interview contemplating questions related to the booklet. The socio-demographic data were analyzed twice once using Categorical Thematic Content Analysis Technique, which showed six classes or categories: 1) Support for the service; 2) Guidance tool for the elderly; 3) Modality of health information; 4) Descriptions of complications in health; 5) Types of monitoring the health of the elderly; 6) security instrument; referring to two dimensions of social representations: information and knowledge about the book and the position or attitude of the elderly. The second analysis was carried out using Iramuteq 0. 7 software was responsible for the social representations: images and representation field of the booklet. Results: Among the interviewed elderly, 40. 8 % said that they use the booklet, 48. 5 % affirm that they do not have knowledge about the book and 10. 7 % have the book but do not use it. In addition, 83. 5 % of the elderly are female and 78. 6 % with age between 60 - 70 years. The results show representations of positive content related the use of the book showing a good acceptance of this, besides recognizing it as a facilitator instrument for the care of the elderly defined in six categories. The elderly utilize the booklet as security and protection. The elderly people who do not use the book justify not using it due to lack of information. Conclusion Having the opportunity of knowing the elderly social representations about the <b>health</b> <b>booklet</b> for elderly was important to get to know and understand the thinking of the elderly in relation to the booklet and the significance of these representations. It is expected that this study will stimulate further research in the social representations in the ambit concerning the <b>health</b> <b>booklet</b> for elderly, in compliance with the National Health Policy for the Elderly...|$|E

This was a 2  ×  2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial, in which 846 schools in England were randomly allocated to receive/not receive: (1) booklets for students containing information on mental health self-management and help seeking, and (2) funding for mental health support as part of a national mental health initiative. 14, 690 students (8139 primary, 6551 secondary) provided self-report on mental health, quality of life (baseline and 1  year follow-up) and help seeking (follow-up). (a) Approximately, 40  % primary school students and 20  % secondary school students reported seeing the booklets. (b) Of these, 87  % of primary school students reported that the booklet was 'very helpful' or 'quite helpful', compared with 73  % in secondary school.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Background Cape Verde has produced migrants over the centuries. Its history and geography have compelled males and females to leave their homeland in search of resources to invest in their family s survival and development. Literature on parental investment has evidenced the association between investment in embodied capital during infancy and early childhood and its outcomes at later stages. However, these studies seldom address migrant population. Aim This study aims {{to gain a better}} understanding of the relationship in a migratory context between parental investment in infancy and its outcomes in prepuberty embodied capital, among Cape Verdean children living in Cova da Moura, a deprived neighbourhood in Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal. Methods A mixed method s approach combining quantitative with qualitative studies - is used. The prepubertal capital of the 221 schoolchildren attending the basic school located in Cova da Moura is assessed through Anthropometry and educational records analysis. The parental investment in infancy of 75 is analysed through interviews with parents and combined documentation (e. g. <b>health</b> <b>booklets,</b> reports, legislation). Results The key findings are: 1) Children are born and raised between 1997 and 2002, a time characterized by a favourable socioeconomic development in Portugal in general and Cova da Moura in particular. 2) In spite of living in a so called deprived neighbourhood, the school children linear growth falls into the healthy range of the III NHANES growth reference, and it is slightly better than the linear growth of other groups of children measured in Portugal in late 1980 s and early 2000. School-oriented cognitive development is not adequate, however. A third of the students have not a regular school performance. 3) Parental investment in infancy is significantly associated to prepubertal physical growth and school-oriented cognitive development.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2003 a focus group {{study was conducted in}} schools in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan to discuss the perceived sexual health needs of teenagers. Four single sex groups (two male and two female) were convened comprising 14 - 15 year olds and each group met for two one hour sessions. Sex education was reported to vary considerably in quality and content both between and within schools. Participants felt that this was largely due to some teachers being embarrassed, which resulted in didactic delivery and lack of discussion. Most participants had been given very little information about sexually transmitted infections, including how they could be avoided or what to do if infection was suspected. The general message was that teenagers needed practical information delivered by an expert in the subject. Many felt that {{it would be useful to}} have an organised visit to a sexual health/contraceptive clinic as part of their PSE curriculum and that it would also be helpful if clinic staff contributed to their sex education. The focus groups also carried out a critique of some currently available sexual health literature. Teenagers had very constructive views on what graphic style was most likely to convey the ‘healthy choices ’ message effectively to their age group. There was a general consensus that two of the leaflets would be acceptable, but that neither was exactly what was needed. Participants felt strongly that people of their age throughout Wales should have a comprehensive sexual <b>health</b> <b>booklet</b> designed for teenagers and with their input. This should include local inserts giving details of sexual health services that they could access. The outcome of this study was very similar to that of previous research conducted locally in 1996 / 7. Teenagers need more comprehensive sex education at an earlier age, delivered by individuals who are expert in the subject and comfortable in its delivery. Information alone is not enough but should be linked to accessible user-friendly services for contraception and general sexual health. ...|$|E

Parent interviews to obtain background information, the PEDS tools, the RTHB developmental checklist and Rossetti Infant Toddler Language Scales (RITLS) were used to collect data from caregivers of 201 infants, aged six to 12 months, selected through convenience sampling, at PHC facilities in the Tshwane district, South Africa. Sensitivity of the RTHB developmental checklist was determined to be low (25 %), but specificity values were high (86 %- 91 %). The RTHB developmental checklist failed to identify more than half the infants at risk of delays or disorders. Hence, {{based on the results of}} this study, the nationally implemented developmental checklist was found to be ineffective in identifying at-risk infants. It is strongly recommended that the tool be adapted and validated or replaced in order to improve identification of at-risk infants. Associations between communication delays and risks were determined using Chi-square and Fisher s exact non-parametric test statistics and a log linear model was built to model the simultaneous effect of significant risks on the probability of having communication delays. Communication delays were present in 13 % of infants. Association between three risk factors (i. e. housing status, age of mother and number of siblings) and language delays was established. Infants with two or more siblings, born from mothers aged 18 - 29 years who own their house have for example a 39 % chance of presenting with communication delays. The impact of combined risk factors on language development revealed that an infant was at greatest risk (27 % probability) of developing a language delay when 1) mothers were between the ages of 19 to 34 years; 2) when parents owned their own home and; 3) when there were three or more children in the household. The prevalence of communication delays in the sample population was high possibly due to the majority of infants being exposed to risks. The implementation of preventative measures, such as awareness campaigns and developmental screening and surveillance should be considered in the South African PHC context. This is especially relevant since a clear relationship has been established between three risks and communication delays in infants. The PEDS tools had low to very low expressive- and receptive language sensitivity scores across all three screens (ranging between 14 %- 44 %). However, high sensitivity (71 %) and specificity (73 %) ratings for the receptive and expressive language and social emotional domain in combination were calculated. The results of this study may indicate that the PEDS tools may be an appropriate developmental screening tool for the detection of communications delays in infants in the South African PHC context. Future research determining accuracy of the PEDS, PEDS: DM and PEDS tools for children aged two to five years in detecting communication delays should be prioritised.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDNama is a Khoekhoe-language variety {{spoken in}} more than three {{countries}} namely Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Angola. The language was previously called the Nama language, however, for pragmatic reasons, to cater for a Damara/Nama union, it is called Khoekhoegowab in Namibia. As far as I know there has been no comprehensive study on Nama/Damara/Khoekhoegowab. A preliminary study was done by Haacke, Eiseb and Namaseb (1997). However, as {{can be seen from the}} title of this study, it was ‘preliminary’ which means the authors are the first to admit that their study was not complete. The aim of this thesis was to undertake an extensive linguistic analysis of Khoekhoegowab as a way to come up with a comprehensive dialectal inventory. The established dialectal inventory will not only help in the linguistic development of Khoekhoegowab, but also in the determination of a standard linguistic code, leading to development of materials. This is important in grammatical descriptions needed for literacy material development and language policy implementation. Following Haacke, Eiseb and Namaseb (1997) and Guldenmann (2000, 2003, 2008), the study employed a dialectal difference or comparative approach. Considering the nature of the study, a mixed research design was used to collect the data. The data was drawn from the few available studies on Nama/Damara or Khoekhoegowab dialects such as those by Haacke, Eiseb and Namaseb (1997) and Du Plessis (2009). This was supplemented and complemented by document analysis and the various Khoekhoegowab literature. Interviews of limited key informants and focus groups were undertaken in various regions namely (Hardap, Karas and Kunene). The narratives from these interviews were used to determine the dialects currently in place as well as the differences and similarities. The collected data was then treated to a linguistic and dialectal analysis (cf. Guldenmann 2000, 2003, 2008; Du Plessis, 2009) as a way to discover similarities and differences, which will in turn inform the proposal on a possible standard form and composite orthography. The phonological differences of the three dialects under discussion were identified where the vowel system was discussed. With regard to the plain vowels, an argument was made that the Central Nama and Central Damara are in fact similar in terms of vowel inventory compared to Central Nama and the Bondelswarts dialects. The phonetic aspects of the consonant system of the identified dialects were also discussed. A discussion on clicks and click consonants was also made where a distinction was drawn between plain clicks and complex clicks. The morphosyntax of Khoehoegowab was also discussed where it was obvious that there were mainly more similarities than differences between the dialects. The phonetic inventories identified in chapters 4 and 5 were assessed using data from different sources such as the Bible, the Social Security booklet, the grade 9 school textbook, Facebook (a social media page), Google maps, Khoekhoegowab orthography (2003), and the Ministry of <b>Health</b> <b>booklet.</b> The aim of this was to account for differences and similarities between various materials in terms of symbols used for writing Khoekhoegowab. There were differences observed which were because of the influence of modern technology (especially the electronic keyboard) on the writing practices of Khoekhoegowab speakers. The proposed orthography takes technological developments into account. As a contribution, this study provides new insight into the issues of voicing, and voiced and voiceless consonants. In terms of theory the handling of tone and length was discussed in detail where it was established that tone is phonemic and not vowel length. The issue of whether or not complex clicks should be treated as units or clicks plus an accompaniment was discussed where I argued that the sounds are co-articulated and should be treated as one. Regarding the orthography, although there is orthography, the existing orthography is clearly not adequate as some of the sounds were not correctly captured. This has an implication on teaching the language in the schools. It will help in the revitalizing of Khoekhoegowab compared to more established Bantu languages...|$|E

A sample of the mothers in each group was subsequently followed up by an interview, at which a questionnaire was administered. This was designed to measure the mother's knowledge of {{the management of the}} symptoms described. The booklet did not lead to any increase in knowledge in the mothers receiving it. The questionnaire did, however, show that 76 % of the mother had consulted the booklet at some time in the year of the study and 28 % had consulted it in the three months before interview. The important result was a fall in the new request for care for the symptoms described in the booklet.

40|$|O acompanhamento do desenvolvimento infantil Ã configurado como uma das aÃÃes mais importantes para o alcance de melhor qualidade de vida. Objetivou-se avaliar o desenvolvimento motor de crianÃas com idade entre zero e 18 meses. Estudo descritivo, transversal, avaliativo, realizado nos Centros de SaÃde da FamÃlia (CSF) dos municÃpios de Fortaleza e Sobral, CearÃ (CE), Brasil. A amostra foi composta por 330 crianÃas, sendo 165 de cada municÃpio estudado. A coleta de dados ocorreu em Fevereiro-Maio/ 2012, foi utilizado um formulÃrio prÃ-estruturado contendo variÃveis da crianÃa e da famÃlia, a escala Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS), versÃo em portuguÃs, e o Instrumento de VigilÃncia do Desenvolvimento do MinistÃrio da SaÃde contido na Caderneta de SaÃde da CrianÃa (CSC), apÃs aprovaÃÃo pelo ComitÃ de Ãtica em Pesquisa. Observaram-se nos resultados que no municÃpio de Fortaleza, a maioria das crianÃas Ã do sexo feminino, nascida de parto cesÃreo; em Sobral prevaleceu o gÃnero masculino e o parto vaginal. Em Fortaleza, 7, 2 % das crianÃas eram prematuras, 6, 6 % baixo peso ao nascer; em Sobral 8, 5 % de prematuros e 8, 5 % com baixo peso ao nascer. Em relaÃÃo ao perfil socioeconÃmico e educacional dos pais/responsÃveis pelas crianÃas, prevaleceu, em ambos os municÃpios, 11 a 13 anos de estudo, idade entre 22 e 35 anos e nÃo ter ocupaÃÃo rentÃvel. Em relaÃÃo ao perfil sÃcio demogrÃfico, a maioria tinha rede de esgoto, coleta de lixo e chÃo com cerÃmica. O desenvolvimento motor das crianÃas avaliado pela escala AIMS, em ambos os municÃpios foi classificado como normal para a maioria das crianÃas (307), {{conforme}} ocorreu em relaÃÃo ao avaliado segundo o Instrumento de VigilÃncia do MinistÃrio da SaÃde (CSC) (302 crianÃas). Ao correlacionar os dois instrumentos utilizados, encontrou-se concordÃncia entre os mesmos, porÃm pobre (k= 0, 096; 0, 077). Analisando as classificaÃÃes dos instrumentos em separado, observando-se maior poder de concordÃncia entre as que detectam dÃficit no desenvolvimento, entÃo, foram agrupadas as classificaÃÃes em âCom DÃficitâ e âSem DÃficitâ, resultando em concordÃncia quase perfeita (k= 0, 879; 0, 910) entre os instrumentos. Evidenciou-se associaÃÃo significativa entre idade gestacional (p= 0, 012; 0, 000) e peso ao nascer (p= 0, 000; 0, 000), considerando a amostra completa, para ambos os instrumentos. Encontrou-se associaÃÃo significativa entre o desenvolvimento motor quando considerada a amostra total, e os fatores de risco ao nascimento internaÃÃo hospitalar, oxigenoterapia e fototerapia. A idade materna mostrou associaÃÃo significante em Fortaleza (p= 0, 001; 0, 004) e quando considerada a amostra completa (p= 0, 017; 0, 016), o estado civil (p= 0, 054; 0, 049) e a ocupaÃÃo rentÃvel em Sobral (p= 0, 003; 0, 013), ao serem associados com as classificaÃÃes das escalas. Em relaÃÃo aos dados sociodemogrÃficos nÃo foram evidenciados associaÃÃes estatisticamente significantes com o desenvolvimento segundo os instrumentos de avaliaÃÃo. Concluiu-se que nÃo existiu diferenÃa entre o desempenho motor das crianÃas residentes nos municÃpios estudados, os instrumentos utilizados possuem alto poder de concordÃncia entre si para detecÃÃo de dÃficit, e apresentaram correlaÃÃo significante com o desenvolvimento infantil com as variÃveis: idade gestacional, peso ao nascer, internaÃÃo hospitalar, oxigenoterapia, fototerapia, idade materna, estado civil e ocupaÃÃo rentÃvel da mÃe. The {{accompaniment of}} infant development {{is considered one}} of the most important initiatives to reach a better quality of life. We sought to evaluate motor development in babies aged zero to 18 months. This is a descriptive, transversal and evaluative study performed in Health Family Centers (CSF) of the municipalities of Fortaleza and Sobral CE), Brazil. The sample was composed of 330 children, 165 from each studied municipality. Data collection took place between February/March 2012 through a predetermined form with child and family variables using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS), Portuguese version and the Ministry of Health Control Protocol included in the Child <b>Health</b> <b>Booklet</b> (CSC), after approval granted by the Research Ethics Committee. According to results, in the Fortaleza municipality, most children were females born through cesarean section whereas in Sobral there was a predominance of males and natural births. In Fortaleza, 7. 2 % of children were premature and 6. 6 % had lower weight at birth while in Sobral, 8. 5 % were premature and 8. 5 % were born with low weight. As for the socioeconomic and educational profile of childrenâs parents/tutors, we found that in both municipalities the majority of them had 11 to 13 years of study, were aged 22 to 35 and did not have a paid occupation. With regards to their socio-demographic profile, most of them had basic sanitation, garbage collection service and ceramic floors. Child motor development was evaluated through the AIMS scale in both municipalities and it was considered normal for most children (307). This was corroborated by the second evaluation, made by the Ministry of Health Control Protocol (CSC) (302 children). The analysis of both documents showed agreement between them, however weak (k= 0096; 0. 077). When analyzing both results separately, we noticed more concordance among development deficit items. Different evaluation items were identified as âWith deficitâ or Without Deficitâ, resulting in an almost perfect concordance (k= 0. 879; 0. 910) between both instruments. There was also an important connection between the gestational age (p= 0. 012; 0. 000) and the weight at birth (p= 0. 000; 0. 000), considering the complete sample for both documents. We also found a relevant concordance between motor development when considering the full sample and risks factors associated to hospitalization, oxygen therapy and phototherapy. The maternal age showed a significant correlation in Fortaleza (p= 0. 001; 0. 004). The analysis of the full sample (p= 0. 017; 0. 016), the marital status (p= 0. 054; 0. 049) and paid occupations in Sobral (p= 0. 003; 0. 013), also resulted to be closely related to the scale qualifications. As for socio-demographic data, no statistically significant associations were found with regards to development levels according to the evaluation instruments. There was no difference between the childrenâs motor performance in the two studied municipalities. Both instruments presented high concordance levels in deficit detection and a significant correlation with infant mobility considering the following variables: gestational age, weight at birth, hospitalization, oxygen therapy, phototherapy, maternal age, marital status and mother paid occupation...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} of quality pharmacy services to rural and remote communities {{is influenced by}} the National Strategy for the Quality Use of Medicines. The implementation of National Medicines Policy is challenged by the shortage of pharmacists in rural areas. Australia compares unfavourably with both the United Kingdom and the USA in this regard. The study by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in 2002 identified that there is a severe shortage of hospital pharmacists in New South Wales and acute shortages of community pharmacists in Queensland regional areas. Although the lack of a telecommunications infrastructure has been a major impediment to the extension of telehealth into rural Australia, the challenge of delivering pharmaceutical services into rural areas may be augmented by the {{provision of}} telepharmacy applications such as remote dispensing of medications, counselling and implementing medication reviews by video conferencing. The aims of this thesis were to ascertain the opinions of relevant healthcare professionals to the concepts of telepharmacy; to identify the requirements of a telepharmacy system suitable for use in rural Australia; to develop a pilot telepharmacy system and to demonstrate the system by dispensing a limited range of products locally and then remotely via telecommunications. Thereafter, to identify an area of telepharmacy where there is a clinical need and to demonstrate the applicability of telepharmacy by means of a trial involving volunteer patients. This study initially involved interviewing healthcare workers in northern Queensland, the Tiwi Islands, and the western coast of Tasmania to assess the receptiveness, requirements and potential for telepharmacy applications in rural and remote regions in Australia. Thereafter a comprehensive literature search on telepharmacy applications was conducted with a view to identifying suitable equipment for use in rural Australia. Whilst the search revealed a number of examples of commercial telepharmacy applications in the USA and Europe, none met all of the defined criteria for an ideal rural Australian telepharmacy system. Accordingly, two pilot telepharmacy systems were developed and constructed, based upon the identified criteria. For remote controlled operations under video supervision, the criteria for a telepharmacy application were defined as: • a system capable of storing a range of individual medications to suit the intended application; • a standard commercial dispensary computer program; • an automated method of removing individual packs from the storage unit; • an image acquisition device to capture and store a picture of the dispensed pack, and • a bar code reader to record the bar code of the dispensed product. In addition, video conferencing capability was required to enable the remote pharmacist to provide counselling and medication review services to the patient. Four trials were conducted using the constructed pilot telepharmacy equipment to demonstrate the validity, accuracy and reliability of the systems in dispensing a limited range of products locally and then remotely via telecommunications. These studies adequately demonstrated the operation of the telepharmacy dispensing systems and identified the requirement for a different design of bar code reader in any further trials. These studies also identified that the inclusion of video conferencing in a single remote telepharmacy application was not the optimum solution and that a separate video conferencing unit was required. A simple system of quality assurance, incorporating a dispensed pack image acquisition and bar code verification was also demonstrated, resulting in the addition of a significant patient safety factor to mitigate dispensing errors. In order to ascertain the level of support for the concept of telepharmacy and its potential applications, four key healthcare professional groups in rural northern Australia were surveyed. Pharmacists and medical practitioners were surveyed by post and the nurse group was surveyed at the 2006 Royal College of Nursing annual conference in Cairns. The nurse/healthcare group was an online Internet survey, advertised in the Nursing Careers and Allied <b>Health</b> <b>booklet</b> published in June 2006. The major findings were that 87 per cent of all the healthcare respondents supported the use of telepharmacy to provide professional pharmaceutical services to rural and remote areas of Australia. The study did, however, identify that 70 per cent of the pharmacist group surveyed were not supportive, or neutral to, the use of remotely operated automated dispensing equipment as a telepharmacy application in rural areas, when the local pharmacy was closed. The pharmacist group were also not supportive of the use of such equipment in remote areas where there was no community pharmacy (58 per cent disagreed or were neutral). These results were further analysed and revealed that the younger pharmacist age group (less than 10 years experience), were in favour of the use of the automated dispensing equipment as a telepharmacy application, where there was no community pharmacy, compared to the older pharmacist group (P< 0. 05). Medication reviews are a key objective of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement and are provided as a fee for service basis for face to face reviews conducted in the home. They were identified in the surveys as a clinical need which may be solved by a telepharmacy application due to the difficulty and expensive of providing medication reviews to patients in rural and remote areas. A pilot study involving volunteer patients was conducted to demonstrate the use of a telepharmacy application in conducting medication reviews. The study recruited nine patients and the medication reviews were conducted by an accredited pharmacist via a local area wireless network, equivalent to a Broadband Internet connection. The telepharmacy interviews were recorded and provided valuable information for the pharmacist preparing the medication management reports. The patients were asked to complete a customer satisfaction questionnaire on conclusion of the video conference. Six of the patients rated the overall telepharmacy experience as excellent and three rated the experience as very good. Whilst not removing, or negating, the need for personal professional pharmacy services, there are many potential benefits for telepharmacy applications directed at rural communities. However, it is important that it includes and retains the active role of the pharmacist in the delivery of pharmacy services to achieve the highest quality of care for rural communities and for the safety, and welfare of the public related to the use of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacist involvement is essential for patient counselling and medication reviews, with their exclusion increasing risks to the patient and leading to a higher incidence of medication errors, adverse events, and excessive drug costs. The study has thus provided evidence that telepharmacy applications may potentially lead to unique and innovative ways to deliver quality pharmacy services to rural and remote areas...|$|E

40|$|Background: India {{currently}} {{has more than}} 60 million people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) and this is predicted to increase by nearly two-thirds by 2030. While management of those with T 2 DM is important, preventing or delaying {{the onset of the}} disease, especially in those individuals at ‘high risk’ of developing T 2 DM, is urgently needed, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial of a peer-led lifestyle intervention program to prevent diabetes in Kerala, India. Methods/design: A total of 60 polling booths are randomised to the intervention arm or control arm in rural Kerala, India. Data collection is conducted in two steps. Step 1 (Home screening) : Participants aged 30 – 60 years are administered a screening questionnaire. Those having no history of T 2 DM and other chronic illnesses with an Indian Diabetes Risk Score value of ≥ 60 are invited to attend a mobile clinic (Step 2). At the mobile clinic, participants complete questionnaires, undergo physical measurements, and provide blood samples for biochemical analysis. Participants identified with T 2 DM at Step 2 are excluded from further study participation. Participants in the control arm are provided with a <b>health</b> education <b>booklet</b> containing information on symptoms, complications, and risk factors of T 2 DM with the recommended levels for primary prevention. Participants in the intervention arm receive: (1) eleven peer-led small group sessions to motivate, guide and support in planning, initiation and maintenance of lifestyle changes; (2) two diabetes prevention education sessions led by experts to raise awareness on T 2 DM risk factors, prevention and management; (3) a participant handbook containing information primarily on peer support and its role in assisting with lifestyle modification; (4) a participant workbook to guide self-monitoring of lifestyle behaviours, goal setting and goal review; (5) the <b>health</b> education <b>booklet</b> that is given to the control arm. Follow-up assessments are conducted at 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome is incidence of T 2 DM. Secondary outcomes include behavioural, psychosocial, clinical, and biochemical measures. An economic evaluation is planned. Discussion: Results from this trial will contribute to improved policy and practice regarding lifestyle intervention programs to prevent diabetes in India and other resource-constrained settings.
