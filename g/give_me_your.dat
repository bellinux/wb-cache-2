500|$|The {{original}} backing {{track to}} [...] "Something", featuring a piano-led coda, and [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money", which leads into a fast rock-n-roll jam session, {{have appeared on}} bootlegs.|$|E
500|$|Musicologist Walter Everett interprets {{that most}} of the lyrics on side two's medley deal with [...] "selfishness and self-gratification – the {{financial}} complaints in 'You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money,' the miserliness of Mr. Mustard, the holding back of the pillow in 'Carry That Weight,' the desire that some second person will visit the singer's dreams – perhaps the 'one sweet dream' of 'You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money'? – in 'The End.'" [...] Everett adds that the medley's [...] "selfish moments" [...] are played {{in the context of the}} tonal centre of A, while [...] "generosity" [...] is expressed in songs where C major is central. The medley concludes with a [...] "great compromise in the 'negotiations'" [...] in [...] "The End", which serves as a structurally balanced coda. In response to the repeated A-major choruses of [...] "love you", McCartney sings in realisation that there is as much self-gratifying love ("the love you take") as there is of the generous love ("the love you make"), in A major and C major, respectively.|$|E

500|$|... "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money" [...] {{is a song}} by the Beatles, {{appearing}} as the first element in the B-side medley of their 1969 album Abbey Road. It was written by Paul McCartney (though credited to Lennon–McCartney) and documented the financial and personal difficulties facing the band. The song is {{the first part of}} the medley on side two of Abbey Road and was recorded in stages between May and August 1969.|$|E
500|$|Realising that Abbey Road {{could be}} the group's last album, McCartney and Martin decided to combine various {{portions}} of tracks into a medley, which would act as a climactic finale of the group's career. McCartney later said {{that the idea of}} a song suite was inspired by Keith West's [...] "Excerpt from A Teenage Opera". Some musical segments of [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money" [...] were reused for the [...] "Golden Slumbers" [...] / [...] "Carry That Weight" [...] portion of the medley, including the opening verses and later guitar arpeggios.|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Goldfrapp and Gregory {{write about}} the passion found in romance and love; the former sings, [...] "I want your love / All of the time" [...] during a [...] "slippery bass synth" [...] sound in the production. Opening the song, she demands, [...] "You're what I want / You're what I need / <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> love / Make me a freak". Goldfrapp sings with robotic, or [...] "android"-like, vocals and moans, [...] "Ooh, connect me / Ooh, to the other side". The {{aforementioned}} lyrics were also considered {{similar to the ones}} in their 2005 song [...] "Ooh La La".|$|E

500|$|The first track {{recorded}} for the medley was the opening number, [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money". McCartney has {{claimed that the}} band's dispute over Allen Klein and what McCartney viewed as Klein's empty promises were {{the inspiration for the}} song's lyrics. However, MacDonald doubts this given that the backing track, recorded on 6 May at Olympic Studios, predated the worst altercations between Klein and McCartney. The track is a suite of varying styles, ranging from a piano-led ballad at the start to arpeggiated guitars at the end. Both Harrison and Lennon provided guitar solos with Lennon playing the solos {{at the end of the}} track, which Beatles author Walter Everett considers his favourite Lennon guitar contribution.|$|E
500|$|This song {{transitions}} into Lennon's [...] "Sun King" [...] which, like [...] "Because", showcases Lennon, McCartney and Harrison's triple-tracked harmonies. Following it are Lennon's [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] (written {{during the}} Beatles' 1968 trip to India) and [...] "Polythene Pam". These in turn {{are followed by}} four McCartney songs, [...] "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window" [...] (written after a fan entered McCartney's residence via his bathroom window), [...] "Golden Slumbers" [...] (based on Thomas Dekker's 17th-century poem set to new music), [...] "Carry That Weight" [...] (reprising elements from [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money", and featuring chorus vocals from all four Beatles), and closing with [...] "The End".|$|E
500|$|On 26 April 1973, Harrison {{set up the}} Material World Charitable Foundation, {{to which}} he donated the {{publishing}} royalties from [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] and eight other songs on Living in the Material World. Part of the foundation's mission was to [...] "encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies" [...] and [...] " [...] established charitable organizations with consideration to those with special needs" [...] – so allowing Harrison to donate money without encountering the problems that had hampered the Bangladesh aid project. In his 2009 book You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money, Doggett writes that the foundation [...] "continues to fund worthy causes to this day".|$|E

Thank You for <b>Giving</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Valuable Time firmly established Kaada as a key voice on Norway´s blossoming music scene.

500|$|The {{track was}} {{completed}} in Abbey Road Studios. McCartney overdubbed a lead vocal onto the basic track on 1 July, and further vocals and sound effects were added on 15 July. On 30 July, a reduction mix {{was made of the}} original eight track tape, so further overdubs could be made, and a rough mix of the Abbey Road medley was put together. The cross-fade from [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money" [...] into the next track, [...] "Sun King", proved to be problematic, and the group made several attempts before deciding to merge the songs via an organ note. McCartney completed the instrumental overdubs the next day, on 31 July, by adding a bass guitar part and additional piano overdubs, including some punched-in honky-tonk piano in place of the original.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{was known}} for being {{sometimes}} prickly. [...] Aware of this general impression, he claimed that [...] "If you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> attention", the misanthrope's song from Princess Ida, was a satiric self-reference, saying: [...] "I thought it my duty {{to live up to}} my reputation." [...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary. [...] On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. [...] For money as money he cared less than nothing. [...] Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend." [...] The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{sessions}} for Abbey Road began on 22 February 1969, {{only three weeks}} after the Get Back sessions, in Trident Studios. There, the group recorded a backing track to [...] "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" [...] with Billy Preston accompanying them on Hammond organ. No further group recording occurred until April because of Ringo Starr's commitments on the film The Magic Christian. After a small amount of work that month and a session for [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money" [...] on 6 May, the group took an eight-week break before recommencing on 2 July. Recording continued through July and August, with the last backing track, for [...] "Because", being taped on 1 August. Overdubs continued through the month, with the final sequencing of the album coming together on 20 August the last time all four Beatles were present in a studio together.|$|E

500|$|The {{chorus of}} the song follows, which Madonna {{performs}} in a high-pitched voice: [...] "Don't play the stupid game / Cause I’m {{a different kind of}} girl / Every record sounds the same / You’ve got to step into my world / Give me all your luvin', <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> love / Give me all your love today." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lanford Beard observed that the song [...] "blends Katy Perry-meets-Gwen Stefani chanting, echoes of Ashlee Simpson's regrettable foray into New Wave-y synth-guitar sounds, and a 'Hold It Against Me' redux breakdown." [...] John Mitchell of MTV News commented that the instrumentation {{of the song}} consists of [...] "glittery synths, marching band drums, claps and a catchy-as-hell chorus." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called the song an [...] "'80s-inspired electro-thumper complete with a cheerleader chant of 'L-U-V Madonna!'" [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] is written in the key of D major and has a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It follows a basic chord progression of D–G–A in the verses, and D–F–C–G in the chorus and intermediate bridge. Madonna's vocals span from the tonal nodes of C4 to A4.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so hard on her, and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / If you love me, come and <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> everything".|$|E
500|$|Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys first {{recorded}} a Leslie in 1965 and used {{one for the}} title track of Pet Sounds, released the following year. The Beatles {{first recorded}} using a Leslie during the sessions for Revolver in 1966. After John Lennon had asked for his voice to sound [...] "as though I'm the Dalai Lama singing from the highest mountain top", Abbey Road engineer Geoff Emerick rewired the input of the studio's Leslie so a vocal microphone could be attached to it. Emerick used this setup to record Lennon's vocal on the track [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and claims the Beatles subsequently wanted to record everything through a Leslie. George Harrison played his guitar through a Leslie on [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] and [...] "You Never <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Money". The Beatles subsequently inspired other guitarists to use the speaker. George Harrison played through a Leslie in his guest appearance on Cream's song [...] "Badge", and David Gilmour used a similar setup when recording with Pink Floyd. Floyd's Richard Wright played a grand piano through a Leslie for the introduction of Echoes on 1971's Meddle. Guitarist Joe Walsh used the Leslie {{early in his career}} with the James Gang.|$|E
