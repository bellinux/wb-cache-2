5|$|The inner <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{supplied}} by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine artery, arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery.|$|E
5|$|The middle <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
5|$|The outer <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ears</b> <b>are</b> always pricked and {{directed}} straight up, but their size, pointed or slightly rounded tips of <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> variable. Generally, <b>ears</b> of the Khanty Laika are small to medium. In the Mansi Laika, <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> medium to long. <b>Ears</b> can <b>be</b> set high {{and close to}} each other or slightly apart.|$|R
50|$|The Pumi {{trademark}} <b>is</b> its <b>ears,</b> which <b>are</b> always {{alert and}} very lively. <b>Ears</b> <b>are</b> high-set and the tip bends down. <b>Ears</b> <b>are</b> covered with longer hair {{than the rest}} of the body.|$|R
50|$|Ears: Their <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> {{long and}} pendulous, {{opening to the}} front and {{resembling}} a curled up leaf. Gir <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> very large and are an excellent fly and insect swatter.|$|R
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The Broken <b>Ear</b> <b>is</b> one of The Adventures of Tintin {{that were}} adapted {{for the first}} series of the {{animated}} Hergé's Adventures of Tintin by the Belgian studio Belvision in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Michel Greg The Broken Ear was divided up into a six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverted from Hergé's original plot {{in a variety of}} ways.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the middle}} and inner <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> {{necessary}} for hearing, people with complete agenesis of the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> totally deaf. Minor agenesis that affects only the visible parts of the outer <b>ear,</b> which may <b>be</b> called microtia, typically produces cosmetic concerns and perhaps hearing impairment if the opening to the <b>ear</b> canal <b>is</b> blocked, but not deafness.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the tail}} is docked, {{although}} {{this practice is}} now illegal in many areas. In addition, the <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> traditionally cropped short. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> cropped short and rounded off on top. The reasons for these traditions are unknown but believed to ensure tails and <b>ears</b> cannot <b>be</b> bitten by cattle when herding.|$|R
5000|$|Ears: Triangular in shape, medium-sized, erect or semi-erect, {{somewhat}} {{set to the}} side. Erect <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> more desirable. <b>Ear</b> cropping <b>is</b> not allowed.|$|R
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The outer <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
50|$|Often the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> cropped short {{when the}} dogs are very young. This is alleged to be in homage {{to the days when}} they <b>were</b> hunted (the <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> {{presented}} for the bounty.) Most fighting dog breeds have their ears severely cropped.|$|R
50|$|Low-set <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> <b>ears</b> with {{depressed}} {{positioning of}} the pinna two or more standard deviations below the population average.|$|R
25|$|Cropping of the <b>ears</b> <b>is</b> {{done for}} several reasons, {{including}} the cultural demonstration of ownership vice feral dog, for appearance and for protection, as long <b>ears</b> can <b>be</b> vulnerable {{in a physical}} confrontation with a predator. It is also believed that cropping improves the dog's hearing because sound can travel into ear easier. It should be noted the cropping of <b>ears</b> <b>is</b> illegal in the UK.|$|R
5|$|The woman's left <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips. Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are {{partially}} haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer <b>ear)</b> <b>is</b> relatively thick, has the sides mostly parallel, and ends in a curved, rounded tip. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E

50|$|The {{head of the}} Pyrénées is {{slightly}} broader, and the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> not as long. On the Gascogne, if the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> pulled forward, they will reach {{the tip of the}} nose. The Gascogne has slightly pendulous lips, making the muzzle appear square; the Pyrénées muzzle looks more narrow.|$|R
5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer <b>ear)</b> <b>is</b> thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
5000|$|Ears: The {{hair on the}} pinnae (ears) of {{the horse}} may be clipped, {{sometimes}} both inside and out. The practice of clipping {{the inside of the}} <b>ears</b> <b>is</b> also controversial, as the hairs inside the ear protect the inner ear from dirt and insects. When the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> trimmed on the inside, a fly mask with <b>ear</b> protection <b>is</b> often put on the horse to replace its natural protection.|$|R
5000|$|When first {{registered}} as a breed, {{there were four}} distinctly described types of ears cataloged as acceptable for Lamancha breed registry. These were two specific 'gopher' types; short and long, and two 'elf' types; regular Lamancha ears and Cookie ears. Short gopher <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> closest to the head, could have one fold (but no length), and gave a smooth appearance to the head. After 1960, these were the only ear-type that a registered buck could have. Long gopher <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> small and round-tipped, between one-half inch and one inch long, and accordion-folded, such that when pulled out flat and released, they would fold right back. The elf types were a little longer, but still very small compared to other breeds. [...] Cookie ears, named by Mrs. Frey after the first goat born with such <b>ears,</b> <b>were</b> pointy-tipped and turned up and back toward the head; hugging closely to the head. Regular Lamancha <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> flat, stood out from the head, bent downward, and could be an inch or up to two inches long. Only Lamanchas with Swiss-type (long) <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> unregisterable.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ear</b> shaping <b>is</b> {{the process}} of {{altering}} {{the shape of the}} human ear(s) as a body modification practice, often resulting in a non-human appearance. The medical procedure via which <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> reshaped to give a normal appearance is known as otoplasty. <b>Ear</b> shaping <b>is</b> usually performed by body modification artists.|$|R
5|$|The mysticete <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{adapted for}} hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound {{frequencies}} as low as 7 Hz and as high as 22 kHz. It is largely unknown how sound is received by baleen whales. Unlike in toothed whales, sound does not pass through the lower jaw. The auditory meatus is blocked by connective tissue and an ear plug, which connects to the eardrum. The inner-ear bones are contained in the tympanic bulla, a bony capsule. However, this {{is attached to the}} skull, suggesting that vibrations passing through the bone is important. Sinuses may reflect vibrations towards the cochlea. It is known that when the fluid inside the cochlea is disturbed by vibrations, it triggers sensory hairs which send electrical current to the brain, where vibrations are processed into sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{adapted for}} hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} ear has specific {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> {{triangular}} and upright (leaning forward past vertical). The {{inside of}} the <b>ears</b> should <b>be</b> well-furred. <b>Ears</b> on puppies normally lie flat until they are past 5-6 months.|$|R
