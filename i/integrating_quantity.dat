40|$|Investments into {{information}} technology (IT), (hereinafter: IT investments) have reached very high figures, {{which are still}} continually on the rise. IT potentials are being used in {{an increasing number of}} ways. Various company managers have different approaches to this issue. A large number of methods/models for the assessment of IT investments is available, so the question is posed of how to choose the adequate assessment category. The said reasons have initiated a need for defining the generic approach in the choice of adequate methodology for the assessment of IT investments, which was indeed the goal of this paper. General ideas to this approach stem from the fact that each IT investment has its purpose and belongs to a certain type of IT investment (decision-making aspect) which demands its relevant methodology for assessing IT investments. Two groups of demands (conditions) have been defined in choosing relevant methodology. The first group pertains to methodology analysis and determination of its compatibility with characteristics of the defined decision-making aspect. The second group of conditions pertains to methodology analysis with respect to its possibilities (abilities) of <b>integrating</b> <b>quantity,</b> quality and risk factors of IT decision.

40|$|International audienceThe passive scalar {{dynamics}} in a freely decaying turbulent flow is studied. The classical framework of homogeneous isotropic turbulence without forcing is considered. Both {{low and high}} Reynolds number regimes are investigated for very small and very large Prandtl numbers. The long time behaviours of <b>integrated</b> <b>quantities</b> such as the scalar variance or the scalar dissipation rate are analysed by considering that the decay follows power laws. This study addresses three major topics. First, the Comte-Bellot and Corrsin (CBC) dimensional analysis for the temporal decay exponents is extended {{to the case of}} a passive scalar when the permanence of large eddies is broken. Secondly, using numerical simulations based on an eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) model, the time evolution of <b>integrated</b> <b>quantities</b> is accurately determined {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. These simulations show that, whatever the values of the Reynolds and the Prandtl numbers are, the decay follows an algebraic law with an exponent very close to the value predicted by the CBC heory. Finally, the initial position of the scalar integral scale $L_{T}$ has no influence on the asymptotic values of the decay exponents, and an analytical law predicting the relative positions of the kinetic and scalar spectra peaks is derived...|$|R

40|$|The {{terrestrial}} runoff {{component is}} a comparatively small but sensitive and thus significant quantity {{in the global}} energy and water cycle at the interface between landmass and atmosphere. As opposed to soil moisture and evapotranspiration which critically determine water vapour fluxes and thus water and energy transport, it can be measured as an <b>integrated</b> <b>quantity</b> over a large area, i. e. the river basin. This peculiarity makes terrestrial runoff ideally suited for the calibration, verification and validation of general circulation models (GCMs). Gauging stations are not homogeneously distributed in space. Moreover, time series are not necessarily continuously measured nor do they in general have overlapping time periods. To overcome this problems with regard to regular grid spacing used in GCMs, different methods {{can be applied to}} transform irregular data to regular so called gridded runoff fields. The present work aims to directly compute the gridded components of the monthly water balance (including gridded runoff fields) for Europe by application of the well-established raster-based macro-scale water balance model WABIMON used at the Federal Institute of Hydrology, Germany. Model calibration and validation is performed by separated examination of 29 representative European catchments.

40|$|Context. Convective {{regions in}} stellar models are always {{associated}} with uncertainties, for example due to extra-mixing or the possible inaccurate {{position of the}} transition from convective to radiative transport of energy. These have a strong impact on stellar models and their fundamental parameters. The most promising method to reduce these uncertainties is to use asteroseismology to derive diagnostics probing the structural characteristics of these regions. Aims. We wish to use custom-made <b>integrated</b> <b>quantities</b> to improve the capabilities of seismology to probe convective regions in stellar interiors. We hope {{to increase the number}} of indicators obtained with structural seismic inversions to provide additional constraints on stellar models and the fundamental parameters determined from theoretical modeling. Methods. First, we present new kernels associated with a proxy of the entropy in stellar interiors. We then show how these kernels can be used to build custom-made <b>integrated</b> <b>quantities</b> probing convective regions inside stellar models. We present two indicators suited to probe convective cores and envelopes, respectively, and test them on artificial data. Results. We show that it is possible to probe both convective cores and envelopes using appropriate indicators obtained with structural inversion techniques. These indicators provide direct constraints on a proxy of the entropy of the stellar plasma, sensitive to the characteristics of convective regions. These constraints can then be used to improve the modeling of solar-like stars by providing an additional degree of selection of models obtained from classical forward modeling approaches. We also show that in order to obtain very accurate indicators, we need l = 3 modes for the envelope but that the core-conditions indicator is more flexible in terms of the seismic data required for its use.
