50|$|Vereker {{believed}} that loss of information, often due to overload protection, was a damaging type of distortion that amplifiers were vulnerable to. Vereker attempted to reduce information loss at the design stage, by unconventionally disregarding test-bench measurements of harmonic distortion performance and output into a static resistive load. Naim says that to achieve amplifiers with low harmonic distortion, low noise, wide power-bandwidth, and constant dynamic output impedance, they {{pay attention to}} balancing <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedance,</b> open-loop bandwidth, slew rate, and propagation delay; the amplifiers {{are not subject to}} slew-rate limitation between 5 Hz and 50 kHz.|$|E

The solution is achieved numerically with a displacement based finite element approach. The model permits obtaining straightforwardly the <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedances</b> and the kinematic response functions of the embankment that, according to a substructure approach, may be used for the soil-structure interaction analysis of bridges.

30|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedances</b> are {{strongly}} attenuated at high frequencies, which {{can result in}} the occurrence of resonance peaks and the amplitude of resonance becomes more damped. The latter case occurs, if {{the depth of the}} piles is relatively large. Increasing the depth of the piles can induce a considerable increase of the soil contact surface. The phenomenon of wave refection is then larger. Moreover, there is an increase of the soil mass that participates in the vibratory movement. So, as the soil is damped, the movement will be damped especially for high frequencies.|$|R

The stiffness and damping of the soil layer described by fractional viscoelastic model are obtained based on the method of layer. The pile-soil dynamic interaction is modeled by Winkler dynamic elastic-damping model, the pile to pile dynamic interaction and vertical vibration of the pile groups in the soil described by fractional derivative viscoelastic model is solved. The influence of the pile spacing, order of fractional derivative and model parameter of soil on the vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedance</b> of pile groups is also investigated.

These group effects, due to the kinematic component of the pile-soil dynamic interaction, are quite small and can be neglected when, as in the case under examination, the ratio Ep/Es (L) between the pile and the soil (at the pile extremity) Young’s moduli of elasticity is ≪ 1000 (Gazetas et al. 1993).|$|R

Increasing the depth of the piles can induce a considerable increase of the soil contact surface. Therefore, there is an increase of the soil mass that participates in the vibratory movement. The results show that the anchored piles in the rigid layer give the best solution; therefore, the anchoring of the piles is not a negligible factor in the case of deep foundations.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to define the interface characteristics and constraints of 1 kW class arcjets run on simulated decomposition products of hydrazine and power processors. The impacts of power supply output current ripple on arcjet performance were assessed by variation of the ripple frequency from 100 Hz to 100 kHz with 10 percent peak-to-peak ripple amplitude at 1. 2 kW. Ripple had no significant effects on thrust, specific impulse or efficiency. The impact of output ripple on thruster lifetime was not assessed. The static and dynamic impedances of the arcjet were quantified with two thrusters of nearly identical configuration. Superposition of an AC component on the DC arc current was used to characterize the <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedance</b> {{as a function of}} flow rate and DC current level. A mathematical model was formulated from these data. Both the static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedance</b> magnitude were found to be dependent on mass flow rate.

Apparently, this option did not result in any significant loss in detail of the results. However, new techniques as cloud computing can offer us enough resources to easily lead the limits observed on this study with a single computer and get deeper knowledge in dynamic accessibility studies.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new macroelement model for shallow foundations. The model is defined through a non-linear constitutive law written {{in terms of}} some generalized force and displacement parameters. The linear part of this constitutive law comes from the <b>dynamic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the foundation. The non-linear part comprises two mechanisms. One {{is due to the}} irreversible elastoplastic soil behavior: it is described with a bounding surface hypoplastic model, adapted for the description of the cyclic soil response. An original feature of the formulation is that the bounding surface is considered independently of the surface of ultimate loads of the system. The second mechanism is the detachment that can take place at the soil-footing interface (foundation uplift). It is totally reversible and non-dissipative and can thus be described by a phenomenological non-linear elastic model. The macroelement is qualitatively validated by application to soil-structure interaction analyses of simple real structures...|$|R
