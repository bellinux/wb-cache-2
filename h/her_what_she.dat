[...] His main concern was personally mixing the paint to recolor the barn, which had a red coat he thought was hideous, so he painted it a light gray-green. Mamie, meanwhile, was delighted {{in being able to}} use everything they always had in storage, and decorated more for sentimentality than for aesthetics.|$|E

500|$|Edna asks [...] "Woodrow" [...] for a photograph, so Bart {{searches}} {{through a}} book called NHL Stars of 1969 and sends her a picture of ice hockey star Gordie Howe.

He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant {{on the verge of}} tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage. However, his constant swearing eventually puts enough money in the jar to purchase a dog house.|$|E
500|$|Manning's {{youth was}} divided between Portsmouth and Ireland, giving <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{described}} as [...] "the usual Anglo-Irish {{sense of belonging}} nowhere". She attended art school, and moved to London, where her first serious novel, The Wind Changes, was published in 1937. In August 1939 she married R. D. Smith ("Reggie"), a British Council lecturer posted in Bucharest, Romania, and subsequently in Greece, Egypt and Palestine as the Nazis overran Eastern Europe. Her experiences {{formed the basis for}} her best known work, the six novels making up The Balkan Trilogy and The Levant Trilogy, known collectively as Fortunes of War. The overall quality of her output was considered uneven by critics, but this series, published between 1960 and 1980, was described by Anthony Burgess as [...] "the finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer".|$|E
