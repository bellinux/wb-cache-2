50|$|The black {{triggerfish}} {{or black}} durgon (Melichthys niger), called Humuhumu'ele'ele in Hawaiian, is a blimp-shaped triggerfish with bright white lines running along its dorsal and anal fins. From a distance, {{it appears to}} be completely black. However, upon closer inspection with good lighting, one can see that it is actually mottled dark-blue/green coloration often with orange {{toward the front of the}} head. Black <b>durgons</b> are capable of changing color based on their surroundings.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with the Hawaiian black triggerfish or black <b>durgon</b> (Melichthys niger), which is often mistaken as being Indian triggerfish within the trade.|$|R
50|$|<b>Durgon</b> is an unincorporated {{community}} in Hardy County, West Virginia, USA. It {{is located on}} US 220/WV 28/WV 55 at its junction with County Route 220/5 west of Moorefield along the South Branch Potomac River.|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} species of life inhabit Saba National Marine Park. Soft corals abound. Hard corals live only in the waters on the island's east side. Types of fish found in the park include parrotfish, Atlantic blue tang, black <b>durgon,</b> and barracuda. Sharks and stingrays frequent certain areas. Octopus, turtles, and spiny lobster make the park their home also.|$|R
50|$|A study {{conducted}} in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago of the southwest Atlantic Ocean, revealed the feces and vomit of Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) formed part of the diet of twelve species of reef fish from seven different families. The most prolific consumer was the black <b>durgon,</b> which could even discern the postures dolphins assumed prior to voiding and positioned themselves for effective feeding. All these offal eating fish species are recorded plankton eaters and it is considered {{that this type of}} feeding may represent a change in its usual diet, i.e. drifting plankton.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} an interespecific association between spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) and the fishes black <b>durgon</b> (Melinchthys niger), sergeant major Abudefduf saxatilis) and jack (Carangoides sp.) in Dolphin's Bay, Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (3 º 51 'S; 32 º 25 'W) Brazil. The observations (n= 17) weremade between June and September 1985 {{through the use}} of the snorkelling, totalling approximately 76 hours. When the spinner dolphins entered the bay after their night feeding period, they frequently defecated a light brown semiliquid fecal material, and this was immediately swallowed by the three fish species above, which are exclusive residents of the reefs. The interaction most commonly observed occurred with black <b>durgon</b> (55, 7 %), followed by sergeant major (28, 3 %) and jack (16 %), all of which are opportunistic feeders. These interactions decrease in number throughout the morning as does the number of times the dolphins defecate. The spinner dolphins were not observed preying upon these fishes, althought on some occasions juvenile dolphins were seen chasing jacks, displaying behaviour which was clearly that of play. Este estudo descreve a associação interespecífica existente entre os golfinhos-rotadores (Stenella longirostris) e os peixes cangulos (Melinchthys niger), saberés (Abudefduf saxatilis) e xixarros (Carangoides sp.) na Baía dos Golfinhos, Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha (3 º 51 'S; 32 º 25 'W), Brasil. As observações (n= 17) foram realizadas entre os meses de junho e setembro de 1985 através de mergulho livre totalizando aproximadamente 76 horas. Quando entravam na baía, após o seu período de alimentação noturna, golfinhos-rotadores defecavam com frequência um material semi-líquido de cor castanho-claro que era imediatamente ingerido pelas três espécies de peixes exclusivamente recifais acima citadas. A interação mais comumente observada ocorreu com o cangulo (55, 7 %), seguida pelo saberé (28, 3 %) e xixarro (16 %), espécies de hábitos alimentares oportunistas. Essas interações vão decrescendo ao longo da manhã, quando os golfinhos passam a defecar com menor incidência. Não foram observados golfinhos-rotadores predando esses peixes, porém, em algumas ocasiões, juvenis perseguiram os xixarros em uma clara atitude de brincadeira...|$|R
