Most species (e.g. Blyth's river frog L. blythii or the fanged river frog L. macrodon) develop normally, with free-swimming tadpoles that eat food. The tadpoles of the {{corrugated}} frog (L. laticeps) are free-swimming but <b>endotrophic,</b> meaning they do not eat but live on stored yolk until metamorphosis into frogs. Before, L. limborgi was assumed to have direct development (eggs hatching as tiny, full-formed frogs), but more careful observations have showed it has free-swimming but <b>endotrophic</b> larvae; this probably applies to the closely related L. hascheanus, too.

We incubated fertile eggs (n= 2 egg clutches; 40 eggs per clutch) of the endangered Fijian ground frog Platymantis vitiana under controlled laboratory conditions (25 °C and 100 % relative humidity).

40|$|Starvation {{resistance}} in the larvae of a grapsid crab, Armases miersii, that breeds in supratidal rock pools in Jamaica was examined by point-of-no-return (PNR) and point-of-reserve- saturation (PRS) experiments. A. miersii shows an abbreviation of larval development (only 3 zoeal stages) and {{a high degree of}} lecithotrophy in the zoea I and II stages. In complete absence of food, larval development is possible from hatching to the zoea III stage. The potential for <b>endotrophic</b> development decreases during ontogeny: the zoea I is, in principle, entirely independent of food, without significant effects of starvation on survival; the zoea II shows significantly higher mortality under continued lack of food (since hatching) and delayed development after initial temporary starvation; the zoea III can also develop independently of food, but only if the preceding stages were fed continuously. Hence, no PNR or PRS can be given for individual zoeal stages of this species. Late effects of early feeding or starvation indicate that lecithotrophy in A. miersii is only facultative, i. e. food is not essential in the beginning of larval life, but it will be taken up when available. Conspicuous intraspecific variability in the degree of lecithotrophy was observed in larvae originating from 2 different females. In a hatch with particularly high <b>endotrophic</b> potential (but not in nutritionally more vulnerable larvae), development was significantly faster under starvation. This effect is interpreted as a change in energy partitioning: lack of food may induce a signal for switching from growth (accumulation of exogenous energy) to rapid mobilization of internal reserves (accelerated development, termination of the nutritionally vulnerable planktonic larval phase). Feeding after initial starvation may cause inverse effects, i. e. slower development, replacement of utilized reserves, and accumulation of additional energy for later stages. This switching should occur only in facultatively lecithotrophic larvae that have sufficient internal energy reserves to allow for this opportunistic bioenergetic strategy. Compared with most planktotrophic marine decapod larvae, the zoeal stages of A. miersii show higher starvation resistance and <b>endotrophic</b> potential.

40|$|The grapsid crab Armases miersii breeds in supratidal rock pools on the {{northern}} shore of Jamaica, West Indies. In 5 replicate field experiments, temperature and salinity were monitored {{during the course of}} larval development, and the hypothesis was tested that these rock pools represent a food-limited environment for the development of planktotrophic crab larvae. Food limitation should select for and, hence, may explain, ontogenetic traits that have been observed in the early larval stages of this species: abbreviated development, enhanced initial energy reserves, starvation resistance, and potential for partially <b>endotrophic</b> development (facultative lecithotrophy). In a rock pool with only 1 to 2 ppt salinity, in situ growth (measured as change in carbon content per larva) and development (occurrence of moulting to subsequent stages) were retarded, and only the zoea 2 stage was reached within a 6 d observation period. Successful larval development to the megalopa stage w! as observed in salinities ranging from 5 to 24 ppt and temperatures between 24 and 32 degree C. Diurnal temperature variation (up to 7 degree C) and sudden salinity changes (up to 16 ppt) after heavy rain falls did not visibly influence larval growth or development. These field observations show that the larvae of A. miersii are very tolerant of extremely low and variable salinity and, hence, are well adapted to survive and develop under the harsh and unstable physical conditions prevailing in supratidal rock pools. Larval growth in all 5 experiments was significantly reduced and development delayed (only from the zoea 3 stage) under natural (unmanipulated control) conditions compared with sibling larvae that received Artemia sp. nauplii as an additional food source. These results provide evidence that food is actually a limiting factor in supratidal rock pools, where larvae of A. miersii develop. In a series of 5 replicate laboratory experiments, the possible significance of ! cannibalism, especially in late stages, was tested. Canniba! listic activity shows an increasing trend with decreasing <b>endotrophic</b> potential of subsequent larval stages, reaching a maximum in the megalopa.

40|$|The {{relation}} of the mycorrhizal soil fungi {{to the growth of}} conifers has long been a controversial subject. 3 Recent experiments in nursery production, in afforestation and in extending the range of certain species of conifers (11, 14, 21, 32, 36, 37, 38) have reemphasized the importance of these fungi in promoting tree growth and aiding nutrition. Nonetheless, the manner in which these organisms work is still obscure, and growth stimulation of seedlings has been attributed both to effects resulting from the invasion of short roots by fungi and to the activity of the fungus in the soil adjacent to the roots. The invasion of the short roots by the fungus commonly results in the formation of ectotrophic mycorrhizae which are characterized by an external fungal mantle and an internal Hartig net (16). When the fungus is more active, intracellular haustoria (48) are formed in addition to the intercellular net, and these types of mycorrhizae have been called ectendotrophic. The nature of the fungal infection is apparently dependent to a considerable degree upon the species of fungus and the relative vigor of both the host plant and the fungus. <b>Endotrophic</b> mycorrhizae, which are characterized by intracellular infection, but which lack the fungal mantle and Hartig net, are apparently not common among the pines...|$|E

As crucial steps in the colonization, we identify the transitions of the larval nursery, ®rst, from the marine plankton into landlocked-brackish nurseries and, second, into fresh water. During these invasions, the early life-cycle stages were facing new ecological conditions and selective agents. We test hypotheses on the evolution of egg size and the mode of development in relation to the larval ecology of recent species and draw conclusions on their evolutionary past. As a model we focus on the genus Sesarma, that colonized Jamaica relatively recently and comprises species with a larval development in marine, brackish and freshwater habitats. In addition, we compare representatives of the crab genera Armases, Sesarma and Uca that invaded brackish-nursery habitats independently.

40|$|Understanding {{phenotypic}} diversity requires {{not only}} identification of selective factors that favor origins of derived states, but also factors that favor retention of primitive states. Anurans (frogs and toads) exhibit a remarkable diversity of reproductive modes that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates. Here, we analyze {{the evolution of}} these modes, using comparative methods on a phylogeny and matched life-history database of 720 species, including most families and modes. As expected, modes with terrestrial eggs and aquatic larvae often precede direct development (terrestrial egg, no tadpole stage), but surprisingly, direct development evolves directly from aquatic breeding nearly as often. Modes with primitive exotrophic larvae (feeding outside the egg) frequently give rise to direct developers, whereas those with nonfeeding larvae (<b>endotrophic)</b> do not. Similarly, modes with eggs and larvae placed in locations protected from aquatic predators evolve frequently but rarely give rise to direct developers. Thus, frogs frequently bypass many seemingly intermediate stages {{in the evolution of}} direct development. We also find significant associations between terrestrial reproduction and reduced clutch size, larger egg size, reduced adult size, parental care, and occurrence in wetter and warmer regions.

Fecundity was low, ranging from 134 to 848 eggs per female (cephalotoraxic shield length, SL, 2. 3 ^ 5. 0 mm). Hatching observed in the laboratory ranged from 6 to 30 d. The larval development was studied in laboratory cultures fed with Artemia sp. nauplii and kept at constant 7. 0 ± 0. 58 C. Larvae invariably passed through four zoeal instars and one megalopa stage. Mean durations of the zoeal stages I to IV were 14. 3 ± 1. 8, 16. 7 ± 4. 6, 23. 2 ± 6. 5, 33. 4 ± 9. 2 d, respectively.

The meroplankton community was found to be numerically dominated by decapod crustacean larvae (47 %), followed by polychaetes (20 %), echinoderms (16 %), cirripedes (8 %) and molluscs (7 %). A rich decapod community was detected, with 2 thalassinid, 5 brachyuran, 4 anomuran, 6 caridean, one astacid and one palinurid species/morphotypes identified. Cluster analyses clearly distinguished deep-water stations (250 - 400 m) south of the Straits of Magellan from shallow-water stations (30 - 100 m) in the Beagle Channel, where meroplankton was dominated by decapod larvae (> 90 %). Three main larval developmental modes, characterised by morphogenesis, mode of larval nutrition, and site of larval development, were observed in Magellan decapods: (1) extended, planktotrophic development of planktonic larvae, (2) abbreviated, planktotrophic development of planktonic larvae, and (3) abbreviated, <b>endotrophic</b> (lecithotrophic) development of demersally living larvae. Several caridean shrimps with abbreviated larval development, which have congeners in the Antarctic, suggest a strong synchronisation between abbreviated planktotrophic larval development and short periods of primary production. This seems to be an essential factor in early life history adaptation for the colonisation of the Antarctic environment.

40|$|In {{a review}} of {{adaptive}} patterns in the life-histories of freshwater-invading shrimp (Macrobrachium spp.), Jalihal, Sankolli and Shenoy coined in 1993 the term “freshwaterization”. This concept denotes a gradual evolutionary process, including an abbreviation of the larval phase, enhanced <b>endotrophic</b> potential of the larval stages, increasing tolerance of low salt concentrations, and a trend towards brood protection. All these patterns have extensively been documented {{in the literature on}} freshwater-invading clades such as palaemonid and atyid shrimp. However, the hypothesis of gradual “freshwaterization” does not explain, (1) why intermediate stages between extended and abbreviated larval developments (ELD, ALD) are practically absent, suggesting abrupt rather than gradual transitions; (2) why ELD does occur also in hololimnetic shrimp. Moreover, ALD and lecithotrophy occur not only in freshwater but frequently also in the sea, especially at high latitudes, where planktonic food limitation or extreme habitat specialization (e. g. commensalism) rather than low osmotic pressure select for those traits. Tentative selective forces favouring either the persistance of ELD and planktotrophy, or a shift to ALD and lecithotrophy, are discussed in relation to freshwater invasions. For the evolution of hololimnetic (i. e., excluding amphidromous) life-cycles, I suggest that an expression of osmoregulatory capabilities early in ontogeny is compulsory, while ALD, larval lecithotrophy, and maternal brood care are not necessarily required. In highly productive lentic waters such as seasonal flood plains (e. g. Amazon, Pantanal), ELD should even be advantageous for dispersal and connectivity of fully limnic inland populations. ALD and lecithotrophy may have evolved as adaptations to oligotrophic or nutritionally unpredictable environments such as fast-flowing lotic waters, groundwater wells, blackwater, clearwater, and troglobitic habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{species of}} Rhinoderma Duméril & Bibron are endemic to the {{temperate}} forests of South America in southern Chile and Argentina (Formas et al. 1975). Both have specialized reproductive modes, Rhinoderma darwinii Duméril & Bibron undergoes complete embryonic and larval {{development in the}} mouth of the male: newly metamorphosed frogs are expelled into the terrestrial environment (Jorquera et al. 1972). In contrast, embryos of R. rufum (Philippi) do not remain in the male's mouth, but instead are expelled into the water as larvae (Jorquera et al. 1974). Jorquera et al. (1972, 1974) described the normal development of both species. The chondrocranial morphology and visceral skeleton of R. darwinii was described by Lavilla (1987) and its internal oral features by Wassersug & Heyer (1988). The table of normal development of R. rufum (Jorquera et al. 1974) emphasized the duration of each stage of development: however, some features currently used for comparative purposes in tadpole morphological studies were not included or described only briefly. In this work, I include {{a detailed description of the}} morphology, particularly of the mouthparts, of the tadpoles of R. rufum, and describe the chondrocranium, hyobranchial skeleton, and the internal features of the oral cavity in this species. In addition, I compare the morphology of the mouth, chondrocranium, and hyobranchial skeleton of the congeneric tadpoles, considering different modes of feeding (<b>endotrophic</b> in R. darwinii versus exotrophic in R. rufum). Last, I present some thoughts about the evolution of larvae of Rhinoderma. Tadpoles of Rhinoderma rufum (n = 10) were collected by Emilio Pugin in Chiguayante (36 º 54 ’ S, 73 ° 01 ' W...|$|E
40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes in}} biomass and {{chemical}} composition were {{studied in the}} laboratory during the abbreviated larval and early juvenile development of the caridean shrimp Campylonotus vagans from the subantarctic Beagle Channel, Argentina. At 7 ± 0. 5 °C, development from hatching to metamorphosis took about 44 days. The larvae started feeding on Artemia nauplii immediately after hatching, although larval resistance to starvation was high (average 18 days, maximum 29 days). Dry mass (DM), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H) contents increased about a fourfold from hatching to metamorphosis, while the C:N mass ratio increased from about 3. 7 to 4. 3. The protein and total lipid contents increased gradually from hatching to the first juvenile stage, the former from 190 to 640 ?g/individual, the latter from 37 to 95 ?g/individual. The lipid mass fraction was low throughout larval development (3 – 9 % of DM), while the protein content was much higher and almost constant (30 – 40 %). The dominating fatty acids were 18 : 1 (n- 9), 16 : 0, 20 : 5 (n- 3), 18 : 1 (n- 7), 18 : 3 (n- 3), 18 : 0, 16 : 1 (n- 7). Except for 20 : 5 (n- 3), these resulted mainly from food uptake (Artemia nauplii). Exuvial losses of C, H and N (all larval stages combined) accounted for only 7 %, 1 % and 1 % of the initial values at hatching. In contrast, 37 % of initial DM was lost. Partially food-independent (<b>endotrophic)</b> larval development is discussed as an adaptation to food scarcity at high latitudes, while the abbreviated planktotrophic larval development appears to be synchronised with seasonal peaks in primary production, allowing for an optimal resource exploitation in a food-limited environment. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) to gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata L., larvae was investigated using fertilized eggs from a farm with previous reports of lymphocystis disease. LCDV genome {{was detected by}} PCR-hybridization in blood samples from 17. 5 % of the asymptomatic gilthead seabream broodstock analysed. Using the same methodology, eggs spawned from these animals were LCDV positive, as well as larvae hatched from them. The presence of infective viral particles was confirmed by cytopathic effects development on SAF- 1 cells. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed the presence of LCDV in the epidermis of larvae hatched from LCDV-positive eggs. When fertilized eggs were disinfected with iodine, no viral DNA was detected either in eggs (analysed by PCR-hybridization) or in larvae (PCR-hybridization and ISH). These results suggest the vertical {{transmission of}} LCDV, the virus being transmitted on the egg surface. Larvae hatched from disinfected eggs remain LCDV negative during the <b>endotrophic</b> phase, as showed by PCR-hybridization, ISH and IHC. After feeding on LCDV-positive rotifers, viral antigens were observed in the digestive tract, which suggests that viral entry could be achieved via the alimentary canal, and that rotifers {{can act as a}} vector in LCDV transmission to gilthead seabream larvae. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

At 7 ± 0. 5 °C, development from hatching to metamorphosis took about 49 days. The larvae started feeding on Artemia sp. nauplii immediately after hatching, although larval resistance to starvation was high (average: 18 d, maximum 29 d). Dry mass (W), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H) contents increased about a four-fold from hatching to metamorphosis, while the C:N mass ratio which increased from about 3. 7 to 4. 3. The dominating fatty acids were 16 : 0, 16 : 1 (n- 7), 18 : 0, 18 : 1 (n- 9), 18 : 3 (n- 3), 18 : 1 (n- 7), 20 : 5 (n- 3). Except for the latter, these resulted mainly from food uptake (Artemia sp. nauplii). Fatty alcohols detected (14 :OA, 16 :OA, 18 : 0 A) and wax esters played a negligible role as energy sources. The protein and total lipid contents increased gradually from hatching to the first juvenile stage, the former from 190 to 640 µg/individual, the latter from about 37 to 95 µg/individual. The lipid mass fraction was low throughout larval development (3 to 9 % of W), while the protein content was much higher and almost constant (30 - 40 % of W).
