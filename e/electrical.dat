5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred <b>electrical</b> conductor in nearly all categories of <b>electrical</b> wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of <b>electrical</b> equipment. <b>Electrical</b> wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for <b>electrical</b> wire and cable conductors. Many <b>electrical</b> devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high <b>electrical</b> conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Electrical</b> {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that <b>electrical</b> engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in <b>electrical</b> technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. <b>Electrical</b> power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E

5|$|<b>Electrical</b> {{power was}} {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total <b>electrical</b> output was 8,400kilowatts, {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450volts on an alternating current.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of <b>electrical</b> power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for <b>electrical</b> lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the <b>electrical</b> power sector.|$|E

5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of <b>electrical</b> energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the <b>electrical</b> battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of <b>electrical</b> energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large <b>electrical</b> demands <b>electrical</b> energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an <b>electrical</b> signal. It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an <b>electrical</b> signal.|$|E
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike <b>electrical</b> conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the <b>electrical</b> conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the <b>electrical</b> resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>electrical</b> energy cannot {{easily be}} stored in {{quantities}} large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required.
