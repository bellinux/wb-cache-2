5|$|In 1998 {{the event}} drew the {{attention}} of the foreign mass media and in the following year the Russian government condemned the event as a <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> Nazism. The event evolved into a political conflict between Latvians and Russians, posing a threat to public safety.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have noted}} several {{themes in the}} film, such as <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> violence, {{conformation}} to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese and for its <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing {{it as one of}} Hergé's weakest works.|$|E

5|$|Poems {{were also}} written to {{celebrate}} kingship. For example, at the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC) of the Eighteenth dynasty erected a stela commemorating his military victories {{in which the}} gods bless Thutmose in poetic verse and ensure for him victories over his enemies. In addition to stone stelas, poems have been found on wooden writing boards used by schoolboys. Besides the <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> kings, poems were written to honor various deities, and even the Nile.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} Szigeti's appeal to composers was {{articulated}} by Bloch {{upon completion of}} his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere {{would have to be}} delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music.|$|E

5|$|While {{continuing}} {{work on the}} Cronica and {{detailing the}} enormous loss of life during the Black Death in 1348, Villani died of the same illness. His work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew. Villani's work has received both praise and criticism from modern historians. The criticism is mostly aimed at his emphasis on supernatural guidance of events, his organizational style, and his <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> the papacy and Florence.|$|E
5|$|The film drew {{heavily from}} the {{conventions}} of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.|$|E
5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
50|$|He {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin {{at the time}} of latter's exile to Chişinău in 1820-1823. Stamati's most important work, Povestea poveştilor ("The Tale of Tales"), an idealized description of Moldavia's beginnings in verse, was published in Iaşi in 1843. His other works include contemporary satires and <b>glorifications</b> <b>of</b> Moldavia's past.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Roman Catholic {{priest and}} activist Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina parish in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood, {{wrote a letter}} to Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hilliard {{complaining}} of the <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> violence on The Jerry Springer Show, a popular television show which was produced in Chicago. Burke showed about ten minutes of clips from the show at the April 28, 1999 meeting of the City Council's Police and Fire Committee and convinced aldermen to invite, under threat of subpoena, show host Jerry Springer to testify under oath as to whether the violence on the show was genuine or scripted. If scripted, Burke proposed to force the show to obtain a city entertainment license, and, if genuine, Burke proposed that the off-duty Chicago policemen providing security at the show arrest fighting guests on the set.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers {{brought to}} an end Heinlein's series of {{juvenile}} novels. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The ideology of militarism {{and the fact that}} only military veterans had the right to vote in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as fascist. This description is disputed, some commentators arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.|$|E

5000|$|In {{politics}} {{he belonged}} to the Jeffersonian school of strict construction and states rights. He made speeches on all occasions through his life. “I have heard him,” writes one who knew him, “respond to a serenade, preach a funeral sermon, deliver a college commencement address, and make a harangue over the pyrotechnic <b>glorifications</b> <b>of</b> seceding states. He could never be scared up without a speech.” ...|$|R

5|$|The {{religious}} historian R.C. Dhere, {{winner of}} the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"Vedic or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an amalgam of various local heroes, who gave their lives to save their cattle. He was first worshipped by the Dhangar, the cattle-owning caste of Maharashtra. The rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had cowherd ancestry, could {{have led to the}} <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the <b>glorification</b> <b>of</b> the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

50|$|Historical {{events have}} also {{influenced}} {{the development of}} the liturgy. The great Christological and Trinitarian controversies of Late Antiquity are reflected in the <b>glorifications</b> <b>of</b> the Trinity heard in the numerous ekphonies encountered during the services. In response to Nestorius' attack on giving the title of Theotokos to the Virgin Mary, the Byzantines increased {{the use of the term}} in the liturgy, and now almost every string of hymns ends with one in her honour, called a theotokion.|$|R
6000|$|Stephen, whose {{composure}} {{had already}} broken down, {{burst into tears}} again, perhaps mostly at the downfall of all his own expectations and <b>glorifications</b> <b>of</b> the kinsman about whom he had boasted.

5000|$|The {{month of}} Koiak holds {{a special place}} in the rite of the Coptic Orthodox Church. It is known as the [...] "Mariam Month" [...] ("Month of Mary") because the Nativity {{according}} to the Coptic calendar falls on 29 Koiak. The month is characterized by beautiful midnight praises that commemorate the Lord's Incarnation and venerate His mother the Virgin Mary.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the iconographical {{analysis}} of the imperial representation of Joseph I and its literal and emblematic sources in graphics (university theses, book engravings) primarily from Czech and selectively also Austrian collections. The sophisticated concepts <b>of</b> sovereigns' <b>glorifications</b> <b>of</b> 17 th and 18 th century reside in the rhetoric figures representing continuity between the sovereign and the ancient Roman empire, solar symbolism of the triumph over the enemy, figures originating in the ancient mythology or pietas Austriaca, which {{is presented as a}} typical virtue of the Habsburg family. The young successor and afterward emperor is celebrated as a culmination of political, diplomatic and war successes of the Habsburg Empire and {{as an example of the}} rulers and human virtues also, among them the especially position has wisdom and justice. Principles of this iconography represent - in the case of Joseph I whose reign was very brief - an interesting and not so known intermediate stage between the well-developed "images" of Leopold I and Karel VI...|$|R
