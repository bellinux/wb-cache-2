2500|$|Historically, the {{international}} community would have targeted weak states for territorial absorption or colonial domination or, alternatively, such states would fragment into pieces small enough to be effectively administered and secured by a local power. However, international norms towards sovereignty changed {{in the wake of}} [...] II in ways that support and maintain the existence of weak states. Weak states are given de jure sovereignty equal to that of other states, even when they do not have de facto sovereignty or control of their own territory, including the privileges of international diplomatic recognition and an equal vote in the United Nations. Further, {{the international}} community offers development aid to weak states, which helps maintain the facade of a functioning modern state by giving the appearance that the state is capable of fulfilling its implied responsibilities of control and order. The formation of a strong international law regime and norms against territorial aggression is strongly associated with the dramatic drop in the number of interstate wars, though it has also been attributed to the effect of the Cold War or to the changing nature of economic development. Consequently, military aggression that results in territorial annexation became increasingly likely to prompt international condemnation, diplomatic censure, a reduction in international aid or the introduction of <b>economic</b> <b>sanction,</b> or, {{as in the case of}} 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, international military intervention to reverse the territorial aggression. Similarly, {{the international community}} has largely refused to recognize secessionist regions, while keeping some secessionist self-declared states such as Somaliland in diplomatic recognition limbo. While there is not a large body of academic work examining the relationship, Hironaka's statistical study found a correlation that suggests that every major international anti-secessionist declaration increased the number of ongoing civil wars by +10%, or a total +114% from 1945 to 1997. The diplomatic and legal protection given by the international community, as well as economic support to weak governments and discouragement of secession, thus had the unintended effect of encouraging civil wars.|$|E

40|$|The {{ethics of}} <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{is an issue}} that has been curiously {{neglected}} by philosophers and political theorists. Only a handful of philosophical journal articles and book chapters have ever been published on the subject; yet <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> as I will show, are significantly morally problematic and their use stands in need of moral justification. The aim of this thesis then is to consider how <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> might be morally justified. Of the few writers who have considered this issue, the majority point to the analogies between <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and war and use the just war principles (just cause, proportionality etc.) as a framework within which to assess their moral permissibility. I argue that this is a mistake. The just war principles are derived from a set of complex and detailed arguments all planted firmly within the context of war. These arguments contain premises that, whilst they may hold true in the case of war, do not always hold true in the case of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Nevertheless, the rich just war tradition does offer a valuable starting point for theorising about <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and in the thesis I consider how the wider just war tradition might be brought to bear on the case of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> beginning, not with the just war principles, but with the underlying arguments for those principles. In particular, I consider whether <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified {{on the grounds that they}} are a form of self- or other-defence, that they are the ‘lesser evil’ and that they are a form of punishment. I argue that certain types of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified on the grounds that they are a form of self- or other- defence and that, in extreme circumstances, certain types of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified as the ‘lesser evil’. However, I argue that <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> cannot be justified on the grounds of punishment. I also develop a ‘clean hands’ argument for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> that is unavailable to the just war theorist; I argue that where the goods and services to be supplied would contribute to human rights violations or other wrongful acts, there is a duty to impose <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> to avoid complicity in this wrongdoing...|$|R

50|$|One {{probable}} type {{of action}} against South Africa was <b>economic</b> <b>sanction.</b> If UN affiliates broke fiscal and trading links with the country, {{it would make it}} all the trickier for the apartheid government to uphold itself and its policies. Such sanctions were argued frequently within the UN, and many recognised and backed it as an effectual and non-violent way of applying force, but South Africa's major trading partners once more voted against mandatory sanctions. In 1962, the UN General Assembly requested that its members split political, fiscal and transportation connections with South Africa. In 1968, it suggested the deferral of all cultural, didactic and sporting commerce as well. From 1964, the US and Britain discontinued their dealings of armaments to South Africa. In spite of the many cries for sanctions, however, none were made obligatory, because South Africa's main trading partners were again primarily concerned for their own financial security.|$|E
