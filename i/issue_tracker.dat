40|$|Support systems play an {{important}} role for the communication between users and developers of software. We studied two support systems, an <b>issues</b> <b>tracker</b> and an email service available for Scratchpads, a Web 2. 0 social networking tool that enables communities to build, share, manage and publish biodiversity information on the Web. Our aim was to identify co-learning opportunities between users and developers of the Scratchpad system by asking which support system was used by whom and for what type of questions. Our results show that <b>issues</b> <b>tracker</b> and emails cater to different user mentalities as well as different kind of questions and suggest ways to improve the support system as part of the development under the EU funded ViBRANT programme. © Irina Brake et al...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFeedback from {{software}} users {{constitutes a}} vital part {{in the evolution of}} software projects. By filing issue reports, users help identify and fix bugs, document software code, and enhance the software via feature requests. Many studies have explored issue reports, proposed approaches to enable the submission of higher-quality reports, and presented techniques to sort, categorize and leverage issues for software engineering needs. Who, however, cares about filing issues? What kind of issues are reported in <b>issue</b> <b>trackers?</b> What kind of correlation exist between issue reporting and the success of software projects? In this study, we address the need for answering such questions by performing an empirical study on a hundred thousands of open source projects. After filtering relevant trackers, the study used about 20, 000 projects. We investigate and answer various research questions on the popularity and impact of <b>issue</b> <b>trackers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{collaborative}} {{development of}} web ontologies {{is an important}} topic being actively researched. In this paper, we present a set of tools that facilitate collaborative development of web ontologies using distributed version control systems. The main purpose of these tools is to replace inefficient built-in diff and three-way merge tools, which rely on text representation rather than on ontology structure. Being based on popular distributed version control systems, owl 2 vcs can be easily integrated into popular <b>issue</b> <b>trackers...</b>|$|R

Software managers are increasingly using these online activities to better evaluate job candidates. We introduce our tool, Visual Resume, that displays visual overviews of developers’ contributions in code sharing sites (e. g. GitHub) and Q&A forums (e. g. Stack Overflow). The design of the tool is broadly applicable as an approach to summarize and display online contributions...|$|R

With “Linked Data Driven Software Development ” (LD 2 SD) we have {{introduced}} a light-weight, linked data-based framework that allows to integrate software artefacts, such as version control systems and <b>issue</b> <b>trackers,</b> {{as well as}} discussion forums. The so created interlinked data-space enables uniform query and browsing facilities. In this paper we elaborate on the interaction part of LD 2 SD, and demonstrate how the LD 2 SD-interaction can be integrated into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

50|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a pure wiki, the Wikidot engine today has become {{more than just a}} web application framework. It provides page templating, so that the appearance of pages can be changed in one place. It provides page processing (the ListPages module) so that users can create summaries, graphs, lists, and reports. It provides data forms, so that pages can be edited as structured data (and not as a wiki at all). Some of the applications that Wikidot users have recently built are: calendars, chatrooms, <b>issue</b> <b>trackers,</b> blogs, and even MediaWiki emulations.|$|R
50|$|Homogenization of {{the tool}} {{environment}} through an ALM tool - ALM tool chains cover the whole life-cycle of a system and manage all artefacts of the development process in a holistic approach. <b>Issue</b> <b>trackers</b> implementing the Volere requirements template have been used successfully in distributed environments. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that the homogenization of artefacts allows to manage and analyze them easily with dedicated tools of the ALM tool. The disadvantage is {{that it is necessary to}} implement the whole ALM tool chain. If introduced, it is difficult to replace specific tools in the tool chain.|$|R
