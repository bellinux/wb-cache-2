30|$|The average {{student in}} this study scored {{reasonably}} well, which contrasts with previous studies, which have found many deficiencies in practicing physicians’ knowledge [6 – 8, 19]. This was probably because different standards of knowledge were required of doctors, and the questions asked of them were presented differently. The current study was designed with undergraduate students in mind, using closed ended questions. Previous studies have <b>examined</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> using open-ended questions requiring quantification of cancer risks and exact radiation doses of multiple imaging studies. Although {{it would be unfair}} to expect medical students to quantify exact doses, it is not unreasonable to expect them to know the forms of imaging that use radiation and the hierarchy of radiation exposure. Overall, the disappointing findings regarding student knowledge of many of the basic principles of radiation protection were interpreted as being {{due to a lack of}} formal focussed teaching/instruction in radiation protection.|$|R

30|$|For {{elective}} general anesthesia, {{an evaluation}} of the patient dental status prior to the intubation was recommended in order to identify possible risks to ensuing dental injuries, such as poor oral health and significant prosthetic reconstructions (Vogel et al. 2009). However, in case of emergency intubation, pre-operative dental evaluation is impractical, stressing the need for a thorough dental evaluation and follow-up after the emergency procedures. In the current case the patient complained on pain in the right side of her face, that started following the emergency intubation and surgery. Initially she was <b>examined</b> by <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> that could not locate the source of her symptoms. Only several months later, when the patient’s symptoms became more dental specific, and she also complained on pain during mastication and cold stimuli, she was examined by dentists.

40|$|Somatization, the {{presentation}} of physical symptoms without an identifiable cause, {{is among the most}} common problems in primary medical care. Treatment approaches are typically offered within the medical consultation interview once the medical provider distinguishes between physical and emotional etiology. This dualistic strategy is especially troublesome for patients whose physical complaints cannot be validated and who are recommended for only mental health therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} <b>examine</b> how <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> can instead motivate patients to consider both physical and emotional treatment. An analogue intervention consisting of an enhanced consultation interview was compared to a care as usual consultation interview on the key outcome of motivation to engage in mental health treatment. A total of 129 participants with medically unexplained symptoms were randomly assigned to these two conditions. Motivation to engage in mental health treatment was evaluated with the FMP Questionnaire, Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire, and the newly developed Motivation to Engage in Therapy questionnaire (MET). Results of ANCOVA revealed significant differences between the two analogue consultation interviews on 3 out of 5 outcome measures. The largest effect was found for the MET followed by the credibility and expectancy subscales (1. 6,. 9, and. 8).

40|$|This {{research}} <b>examined</b> why <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> {{are choosing}} either {{to stay in}} New Zealand or migrate, specifically to Australia. In addition, the study explored what potential exists to influence these choices by those concerned with workforce issues. A qualitative mixed method case study methodology involving a survey of participants in two different sub-projects was used. The first sub-project comprised 114 New Zealand-based <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> and 15 workforce experts. The second sub-project involved 85 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> who migrated to work in Australia. Respondents either participated in both the survey and the in-depth interviews, or {{in one of the}} two. The study has shown that while the media consistently cite higher salaries as the predominant factor, reasons for migration to Australia are complex and broader than perceived in social spheres. These include factors related to research, training and career aspirations; remuneration and alternative pay packages; working conditions; management and collegial relationships; health system and government policy factors; and intervening factors. The latter are personal, social and environmental in nature. Retention strategies suggested by participants also pointed to the above factors. The motivation theories of Herzberg and Maslow provided a framework for conceptualising the reasons for migration. They were also used as a framework for justifying strategies for dealing with trans-Tasman migration of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> to Australia. Migration and motivation theories offer some insights in understanding the trans-Tasman migration of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> When viewed individually however these theories leave gaps in explaining this phenomenon. An argument was therefore made that the factors for migration identified in this research can be represented in a comprehensive model that takes into consideration individual and contextual factors in both origin and destination countries. This calls for a model similar to Lee's push-pull factor theory. Recommendations made in this research were in two broad categories which are; radical or transformational strategies and small incremental steps for action. The recommendations in the radical or transformational category include regional or coalition strategies and migration friendly policies. The recommendations in the small steps for action category are in the areas of workforce planning action, government or policy action, medical education, boosting loyalty, creating inertia, multi-stakeholder action, building and developing research evidence base and competing internationally in a sustainable way. The incremental approach was recommended as a preferred option given the need to be pragmatic and for sustainability of reforms. These reforms are necessary for achieving medical workforce adequacy when dealing with the trans-Tasman migration. It is recommended that workforce planners implement complex and multifaceted approaches aimed at both recruitment and retention, where recruitment drives factor in the global dynamics and competition for medical professionals. The evidence generated from this research provides a platform to provoke action and promote policy discussions. These responses could lead to formulation of sound economic, social and international policies to address this issue. Regional and other international policies are also seen as crucial to this complex context. The reason for their importance is the growing interdependence of economies globally and the available evidence that migration is not stagnant but continually becoming unpredictable and increasingly more complex. Until New Zealand adopts such bold actions as proposed, current migration trends are likely to continue to unprecedented levels. ...|$|R

Data are collected via registration forms and a survey instrument administered by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, {{in conjunction with the}} annual registration renewal process for <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The main findings of the report are: In 2011, there were 87, 790 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> registered in Australia, and 85. 3 % of them responded to the workforce survey. Between 2007 and 2011, the number of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> employed in medicine increased by 17. 3 % from 67, 208 to 78, 833. In 2011, 93. 8 % (73, 980) were working as clinicians, of whom 33. 1 % were specialists and 33. 9 % were general practitioners. Of those employed as non-clinicians (6. 2 % of all employed <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners),</b> more than half were researchers (26. 9 %) or administrators (27. 7 %). Physician was the largest main speciality of practice among both clinician specialists and total specialists (5, 157 and 5, 689 respectively). The second-largest main speciality for clinician specialists and specialists (3, 951 and 4, 125 respectively) was surgery. The average weekly hours worked by employed <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> remained stable between 2007 and 2011. In 2011, male <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> worked an average of 45. 9 hours per week, while female <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> worked an average of 38. 7 hours per week. In 2011, both male and female <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> aged 20 – 34 worked the highest average weekly hours.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{describe}} {{an outbreak of}} invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after percutaneous needle procedures (acupuncture and joint injection) performed by a single <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner.</b> SETTING. A <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner's</b> office and 4 hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. PATIENTS. Eight individuals who developed invasive MRSA infection after acupuncture or joint injection performed by the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner.</b> METHODS. Weperformed a prospective and retrospective outbreak investigation, including MRSA colonization surveillance, environmental sampling for MRSA, and detailed molecular typing of MRSA isolates. We performed an infection control audit of the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner's</b> premises and practices and administered MRSA decolonization therapy to the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner.</b> RESULTS. Eight cases of invasive MRSA infection were identified. Seven cases occurred as a cluster in May 2004; another case (identified retrospectively) occurred approximately 15 months earlier in February 2003. The primary sites of infection were the neck, shoulder, lower back, and hip: 5 patients had septic arthritis and bursitis, and 3 had pyomyositis; 3 patients had bacteremia, including 1 patient with possible endocarditis. The <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> {{was found to be}} colonized with the same MRSA clone [ST 22 -MRSA-IV (EMRSA- 15) ] at 2 time points: shortly after the first case of infection in March 2003 and again in May 2004. After the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner's</b> premises and practices were audited and he himself received MRSA decolonization therapy, no further cases were identified. CONCLUSIONS. This outbreak most likely resulted from a breakdown in sterile technique during percutaneous needle procedures, resulting in the transmission of MRSA from the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> to the patients.

40|$|Introduction: The {{gap between}} the {{integration}} of medical and dental care in our country is quite evident, and requires the attention of both the faculties. Postgraduate training in Oral Medicine and Radiology is available in our country since many years. However, unlike other specialists in dentistry, it is not routine for a <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> to refer patients to a specialist in Oral Medicine and Radiology. An introspection regarding the present situation is essential to improve the accessibility and availability of comprehensive oral healthcare. Objective: This survey was conducted to assess the perceived need and availability of dentists and specialists in Oral Medicine and Radiology by <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Pune, Maharashtra. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was sent by post to 200 randomly selected <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Personal interviews were conducted among 41 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> in private practice and 25 working at a local teaching hospital. Hence, a total of 266 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> were approached {{for participation in the}} study. Results: Ninety-six percent of the practitioners have mentioned seeing patients with oral complaint(s) other than toothache in their practice. Thirty-four percent of the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> referred patients with dental or other oral problems directly to the dentists, 60 % referred them after prescribing medicines, whereas, 6 % of the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> treated such patients on their own. Sixty percent referrals were made to a general dental practitioner rather than a dental specialist. Seventy-two percent of them were not even aware of the presence of any Oral Medicine and Radiology specialists in their vicinity or city. Conclusion: <b>Medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> do perceive a need of dental practitioners for referring various oral problems. However, there seems to be little awareness among the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> regarding the expertise and availability of specialists in Oral Medicine and Radiology. Very few referrals of oral mucosal lesions are done to the dentists, as a majority of them are done to general dental practitioners rather than to an Oral Medicine and Radiology specialist...|$|R
