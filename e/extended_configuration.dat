30|$|The {{region of}} stable {{homogeneous}} glass-forming ability in ChG {{is known to}} be strongly dependent on glass preparation conditions (melting temperature, quenching rate, etc.) [23 – 26]. The obtained results show energetic preference of some cluster-forming tendencies. The structures of more <b>extended</b> <b>configurations</b> are determined by specifics of covalent chemical bonds with characteristic fluctuations in charge density distribution and bond directionality. The network-forming clusters in this research reflect principal conditions of covalent-like interactions, chemical composition, and space topology for ideal bond-saturated network in thermodynamically equilibrium conditions (there are no surfaces, coordination defects or dangling bonds, etc.). Anomalous preparation conditions provide ChG with different structural defects, which cannot be strictly evaluated within this simplified approach.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHistonelike {{nucleoid}} structuring protein (H-NS) is {{an abundant}} prokaryotic protein participating in nucleoid structure, gene regulation, and silencing. It {{plays a key}} role in cell response to changes in temperature and osmolarity. Force-extension measurements of single, twist-relaxed λ-DNA-H-NS complexes show that these adopt more <b>extended</b> <b>configurations</b> compared to the naked DNA substrates. Crosslinking indicates that H-NS can decorate DNA molecules at one H-NS dimer per 15 – 20 bp. These results suggest that H-NS polymerizes along DNA, forming a complex of higher bending rigidity. These effects are not observed above 32 °C or at high osmolarity, supporting the hypothesis that a direct H-NS-DNA interaction {{plays a key role}} in gene silencing. Thus, we propose that H-NS plays a unique structural role, different from that of HU and IHF, and functions as one of the environmental sensors of the cell...|$|R

The system is underactuated and a challenging {{problem is to}} control both the end effector location and the base attitude, using manipulator actuators only.

The key idea is to use high order polynomials as arguments in cosines, specifying a desired path directly in joint-space, drastically <b>extending</b> <b>configuration</b> accessibility. The initial problem is converted to one of satisfying the motion integrals by optimization techniques. This approach always leads to a path, provided that the desired change in configuration lies between physically permissible limits. The method is presented for 3 D systems.

40|$|The folding and {{partitioning}} of WALP peptides into lipid bilayers {{is characterized}} using atomic detail molecular dynamics simulations on microsecond time scales.

A new united atom parametrization of lipids is employed, adjusted for consistency with the OPLS allatom force field. In all simulations secondary structure forms rapidly, culminating {{in the formation of}} the native trans-membrane helix, which is demonstrated to have the lowest free energy. Partitioning simulations show that peptide insertion into the bilayer is preceded by interfacial folding. These results are in excellent agreement with partitioning theory. In contrast, previous simulations observed unfolded insertion pathways and incorrectly report stable <b>extended</b> <b>configurations</b> inside the membrane.
