[...] Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, [...] "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." [...] As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, [...] "Jack Warner...considered cartoons {{no more than an}} <b>extraneous</b> <b>service</b> provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." [...] In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't [...] "even know where the hell the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, [...] "The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse," [...] a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. [...] As Thomas noted, [...] "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, let us {{gauge the}} value of our {{lifeboats}} in this light. If a lifeboat saves a ship worth ten or twenty thousand sovereigns from destruction, it presents that sum literally as a free gift to owners and nation. A free gift, I repeat, because lifeboats are provided solely to save life--not property. Saving the latter is, therefore, <b>extraneous</b> <b>service.</b> Of course {{it would be too}} much to expect our gallant boatmen to volunteer to work the lifeboats, in the worst of weather, at the imminent risk of their lives, unless they were also allowed an occasional chance of earning salvage. Accordingly, when they save a ship worth, say 20,000 pounds, they are entitled to put in a claim on the owners for 200 pounds salvage. This sum would be divided (after deducting all expenses, such as payments to helpers, hire of horses, etcetera) between the men and the boat. Thus--deduct, say, 20 pounds expenses leaves 180 pounds to divide into fifteen shares; the crew numbering thirteen men:-- ...|$|E

50|$|The Police Station, a two {{storeyed}} {{brick building}} with a single storey rear section, incorporated offices for police duties {{on the ground floor}} and police barracks on the upper floor. The design allowed for the various police specialty divisions that had begun to evolve in larger urban centres. Offices were provided for the criminal investigation branch, the traffic branch, uniform inquiry men's room, constables' day room, as well as office space for senior staff. A public counter and room for police enquiries incorporated into the design, provided special space for the public to access the police and the many <b>extraneous</b> <b>services</b> located within police jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} conducted at a northwestern inter-mountain state university examined the marketing the university conducts {{to attract more}} students. This marketing is usually one characterized by allowing future students to obtain a “memorable college experience” {{through the use of}} <b>extraneous</b> goods and <b>services</b> offered by the university. Yet it was my belief that the university’s marketing unduly influenced students’ perceptions of what a “memorable college experience” was. This research is framed by works such as the New Spirit of Capitalism, and marketing’s literature on relationship marketing. To answer this hypothesis, fifteen open-ended interviews lasting roughly {{an hour and a half}} were conducted between the researcher and the student interviewee. These interviews uncovered that non-traditional students felt more left out of the university’s community than traditional students. While the university’s persistent calls for student involvement may not be possible for non-traditional students, the university is alienating these students away from obtaining a “memorable college experience”. On the other side of the spectrum, traditional students were more likely to be involved in on-campus recreation and other non-academic secondary services offered by the university. This involvement created network of traditional students who then use this social network as their support structure. Both traditional and non-traditionally aged students found that university goods and services, such as the recreation center, food offered on campus, and student involvement would not be their most memorable part of their university experience, instead citing things such as social connections gained through employment and or gained within the classroom...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{formulate}} and develop practicable solution methods to some important fleet routing, scheduling and fleet composition problems. These problems arise {{in the operation of}} air transportation systems like the operating domestic and international airlines. The problem of minimal fleet size to meet a variable schedule, which will be fixed when the system goes into operation, is formulated in several ways as Integer Linear Programs in 0 - 1 variables. The ILP's obtained are large scale programs and solved here by Land and Doig type Branch and Bound algorithms. The computational experiments with them, which were conducted with MPS/ 360, have been very sucessful and in the majority of cases, particularly when larger systems are solved, the algorithms terminated at the optimal integer solutions after a single iteration. The problem of scheduling and routing the minimal fleet is then formulated as an ILP which has exhibited equally successful computational results. The minimal single fleet-problem is extended to include some <b>extraneous</b> constraints on <b>service</b> frequencies between and at stations. Computational results with examples are provided. The problem of system design with and without a given fleet size is formulated. The problem of decomposition of the system into subsystems, each consisting of a single vehicle type is next formulated in several ways for several considerations. These formulations are also given as Integer Linear Programs. The first is proven to have at least one optimal integer solution. Computational experience with the application of the Land and Doig Branch and Bound algorithm to some of the other multi-fleet problems is also given. A computerized Airline Management Decision System which will use the models and solution methods developed in this work is briefly described in Appendix A. The Crew Scheduling Problem is also briefly discussed in this appendix since its solution procedures must be a part of such a Decision System. 1969 PB- 174912 Includes bibliographical references (p. 124 - 125) Office of High Speed Ground Transport, Dept. of Commerc...|$|R
