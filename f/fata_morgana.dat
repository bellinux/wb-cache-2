5|$|Real {{advantages}} of the peace came in the economic field. As an open economy, the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding <b>fata</b> <b>morgana.</b> True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the U.S.A. and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, {{and the decline of}} the fisheries.|$|E

25|$|Her enchanted realm {{would be}} placed {{elsewhere}} in the mythological landscape of medieval Europe. Morgan le Fay, or <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana</b> in Italian, has been in particular associated with Sicily {{at least since the}} Norman conquest of southern Italy, and European folklore describes her as living in a magical castle located at or floating over Mount Etna. As such she gave her name to the form of mirage common off the shores of Sicily, the <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana.</b> References linking Avalon to Sicily can be found in Gervase's Ottia Imperialia (c. 1211) and in Torroella's La Faula, as well as in Breton and Provençal literature, for example in Jaufre (an Occitan language Arthurian romance from c. 1180), and in La Bataille Loquifer (c. 1170). The 13th-century romance Floriant et Florete places Morgan's secret mountain castle of Mongibel (Montgibel, Montegibel; derived from the Arabic name for Etna), where, in the role of a fairy godmother, she spirits away and raises Floriant, the son of a murdered Sicilian king and the hero of the story; Floriant, {{with the help of her}} magic ship, eventually reunites with Morgan at her castle when he returns there with his wife Florete. The 15th-century French romance La Chevalier du Papegau (The Knight of the Parrot) gives Morgaine the Fairy of Montgibel (Morgaine, la fée de Montgibel, as she is also known in Floriant et Florete) a sister known as the Lady Without Pride (la Dame sans Orgueil), whom Arthur rescues from the Knight of the Wasteland.|$|E

These include a Venus recorded by Vasari; a Galatea carved for Bernardo Vecchietti (Giambologna's first Florentine patron); the Architecture now in the Palazzo del Bargello; a <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana</b> and a nude female statue in the Grotticella in the Boboli gardens.

40|$|Most {{people will}} {{probably}} be somewhat acquainted with optical phenomena like reflection in a warm asphalt road paving, and more generally with <b>fata</b> <b>morganas.</b> For some this may be even the case for blank strips in the sun as these may occur just before sunset. This might be even more so for the case when the sun seems to set a bit above the horizon. As an example see the photo on the next page, taken by the Vatican Observatory. Temperature inversion {{plays an important role}} for such optical phenomena. Gen-erally the temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing height. Some-times, however, one or more warmer layers may arise at a certain level. At the boundaries of these layers the refraction index undergoes discontinuous changes by which light rays can be refracted or reflected. In the latter case we speak of upper reflection. Apart from this also a lower reflectionmay occur in a warm layer near {{the surface of the earth}} or near sea level. The latter phenomenon also occurs in smooth sheets of ice or in mirroring lakes. Related to the phenomena just mentioned is the green flash that may arise from the fact that red light rays in the atmosphere are ben...|$|R

She returned to Seattle in 1976 to portray Brünnhilde in Götterdämmerung, a role she also sang with the Dallas Opera in 1981. In 1972 she sang the role of Mathilde in the Opera Orchestra of New York's concert performance of Gioachino Rossini's William Tell with Louis Quilico in the title role. That same year she sang Donna Anna to Jerome Hines's Don Giovanni for her debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company. In 1973 she made an unexpected debut at the Bavarian State Opera as Elektra, getting a call to fill in for a sick artist just 17 hours before the curtain went up. In 1974 she made her debut at La Scala as <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana</b> in Sergei Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges, also singing Leonore in Fidelio with the company that year.|$|E
500|$|Filchner's {{view that}} the {{supposed}} sighting of New South Greenland {{could be explained by}} a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage. One form of superior mirage, sometimes described as a <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana,</b> distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys. In his expedition account South, Shackleton gives a description of a <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana</b> observed on [...] 1915, coincidentally as his ship Endurance drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: [...] "The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs... The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene".|$|E
500|$|... "Fata Morgana" [...] was {{originally}} released as the back {{half of the}} eight original webisodes. The episode was given an ancient and mythological feel to set the intended tone of Sanctuary.

Writer Damian Kindler researched the subject and named the episode after <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana</b> as a reference to the Morrígan. During pre-production, the producers decided that around half of the episode would contain footage from the webisodes, and the other half would be rewritten to improve the storyline. Since they felt that Ashley Magnus was previously underused, they included her more into the storyline. The ending from the original webisodes, where the sisters manage to escape, was also rewritten.|$|E

In a moment it would change into a confused mass of long colonnades, lofty towers, and battlements waving with flags, and then the mountains reeling and falling, a long row of windows would appear glowing with rainbow colors, and perhaps, in another instant, all this would be swept away, and nothing be seen but gloomy cypress trees.|$|E

As to body and mind, I fancy I might as well inquire whether the fiddle or fiddlestick makes the tune. In youth this complaint used to throw me into involuntary passions of causeless tears.

"There {{are more}} things {{in heaven and}} earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy," [...] and among these may be placed that marvel and mystery of the seas, the island of St. Brandan. Every school-boy can enumerate and call by name the Canaries, the Fortunate Islands of the ancients; which, {{according}} to some ingenious speculative minds, are mere wrecks and remnants of the vast island of Atalantis, mentioned by Plato, as having been {{swallowed up by the}} ocean. Whoever has read the history of those isles, will remember the wonders told of another island, still more beautiful, seen occasionally from their shores, stretching away in the clear bright west, with long shadowy promontories, and high, sun-gilt peaks. Numerous expeditions, both in ancient and modern days, have launched forth from the Canaries in quest of that island; but, on their approach, mountain and promontory have gradually faded away, until nothing has remained but the blue sky above, and the deep blue water below. Hence it was termed by the geographers of old, Aprositus, or the Inaccessible; while modern navigators have called its very existence in question, pronouncing it a mere optical illusion, like the <b>Fata</b> <b>Morgana</b> of the Straits of Messina; or classing it with those unsubstantial regions known to mariners as Cape Flyaway, and the Coast of Cloud Land.|$|E
