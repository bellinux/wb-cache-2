5|$|The castle {{was also}} used as a {{location}} for Ron Howard's film adaptation of Dan Brown's book, The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> (1452–1519) {{was trained}} in anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio. He {{made use of}} his {{anatomical}} knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.|$|E
5|$|Part of Dan Brown's novel The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code {{was set in}} the Round Reading Room of the Maughan Library, {{although}} {{no part of the}} film adaption was filmed there.|$|E
5|$|The Maughan Library {{has also}} been the {{location}} of some film shoots of popular movies, most notably The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code, Johnny English (see Maughan Library description), The Imitation Game and V for Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> circa 1514 (or possibly {{by one of his}} followers at his direction), was a world map in which the spherical surface of the earth was divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, Opus Dei {{received}} some unwanted attention {{due to the}} extraordinary success of the novel The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.|$|E
5|$|Escher {{learned his}} wood {{engraving}} technique from Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita. He illustrated the octahedral compound of Stars in the beveled wire-frame style {{that had been}} used by Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book, De divina proportione.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the National Gallery was {{the subject}} of a {{documentary}} film by Frederick Wiseman. The film shows the gallery administration and staff at work, the conservation laboratory, docent tours, and the mounting of Leonardo <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> J. M. W. Turner, and Titian exhibitions in 2011–2012.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, Paramount won {{a bidding}} war against Universal Pictures {{for the rights to}} adapt Walter Isaacson's {{biography}} of Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci.</b> The studio bought the rights under its deal with DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions, which said that it planned to produce the film with DiCaprio as the star.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E
5|$|Characters, place names, and {{titles in}} Pratchett's books often contain puns, allusions and culture references. Some {{characters}} are parodies of well-known characters: for example, Pratchett's character Cohen the Barbarian, also called Ghengiz Cohen, is {{a parody of}} Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan, and his character Leonard of Quirm is a parody of Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci.</b>|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{travel to}} the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey, with his {{electric}} hammer to destroy the chair, but Homer notices a poster of Edison comparing himself to Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> much like how Homer compared himself to Edison. Feeling a renewed connection to Edison, he decides not to destroy the chair.|$|E
5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced {{the issues raised by}} The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code and other critics.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church was the {{dominant}} influence on Western civilisation from Late Antiquity to {{the dawn of}} the modern age. It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music. Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Titian, Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the Church.|$|E
5|$|The Codex Leicester {{is one of}} Gates's private acquisitions. He {{purchased}} the collection of famous scientific writings by Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> for $30.8million at an auction in 1994. Gates is also known for being an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby. He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{has also}} been used in other styles of architecture. For instance, Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. A modern high-rise building, the Kölntriangle in Cologne, Germany, was built with a Reuleaux triangle cross-section. Together with the circular shape of its core, this gives varied depths to the rooms of the building.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{academic}} libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library in the 5th arrondissement {{is the largest}} university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Archéologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ibériques. Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the René Descartes University Library.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|Born out {{of wedlock}} to a notary, Piero <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci {{in the region of}} Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by Francis I of France.|$|E
5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was {{the inability of the}} Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted {{that he may have}} been able to do so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{suggested}} that the Kir'Shara itself was similar in context to the Nag Hammadi library, which was a collection of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir'Shara {{in a similar manner}} to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code or James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci.</b> Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was installed}} at a triangular traffic island at {{a busy street}} intersection (Southwest 10th Avenue and West Burnside Street) in downtown Portland in November 2002. In 2003, Pod was included in a walking tour by the Americans for the Arts Public Art Conference. It was cleaned and underwent maintenance for approximately two weeks in August 2010. Dual Pendulum (2000), Beeman's kinetic prototype of Pod, was installed at Oregon State University for <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Days in 2007.|$|E
5|$|While Aronofsky's {{other movies}} have evoked {{significant}} emotional response, {{they were still}} far from the turmoil aroused by Noah. It was screened {{for the first time}} on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as one of the most controversial movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as The Passion of the Christ or The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code. Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nidal's {{most infamous}} {{operation}} was the 1985 {{attack on the}} Rome and Vienna airports. On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen opened fire on the El Al ticket counter at the Leonardo <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> International Airport in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In Vienna International Airport a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39. According to Seale, the gunmen had been told the people in civilian clothes at the check-in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.|$|E
5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply an unending stream of works by Picasso, Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{in their}} 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever argued that there is a conflict between these two groups.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, French art of {{the period}} often {{depicted}} women with low necklines and slender corsets; however, the mutilation by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> and Michelangelo paintings of the same subject, show that nudity could be controversial in France also. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis.|$|E
5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E
