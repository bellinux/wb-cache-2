5|$|Stick insect have <b>forewings</b> {{that are}} tough, opaque tegmina, short and {{covering}} only the base {{part of the}} hindwings at rest. Hindwings from costa to Cubitus are tough and opaque like the <b>forewings.</b> The large anal area are membranous and folded in fan-like manner. There are no or very few branching in stick insect wing veins.|$|E
5|$|Appendages: Two {{pairs of}} wings {{normally}} present. The <b>forewings</b> are modified into short smooth, veinless tegmina. Hindwings are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating outwards.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the similar}} {{raptorial}} forelegs, mantidflies may {{be confused with}} mantises. This similarity {{is an example of}} convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have the leathery <b>forewings</b> of mantises.|$|E
5|$|Other orders {{such as the}} Dermaptera (earwigs), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets), Mantodea (praying mantis) and Blattodea (cockroaches) have rigid {{leathery}} <b>forewings</b> that aren't flapped while flying, {{sometimes called}} tegmen (pl. tegmina), elytra, or pseudoelytron.|$|E
5|$|The thorax of the {{butterfly}} {{is devoted to}} locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the <b>forewings</b> have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The <b>forewings</b> and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like <b>forewings</b> with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having <b>forewings</b> with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the <b>forewings</b> may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the {{anterior}} part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both <b>forewings</b> and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forewings</b> {{are short}} oblong {{leathery}} plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like <b>forewings</b> with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that requires the use of the cerci.|$|E
5|$|Those {{species that}} make easily heard noises usually {{do so by}} rubbing a row of pegs on the hind legs against {{the edges of the}} <b>forewings</b> (stridulation). These sounds are {{produced}} mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.|$|E
25|$|When {{feeding on}} flowers, this {{butterfly}} is unhurried, often spending {{a long time}} sitting on the same flower. When sitting it either spreads its wings or closes them over its back the hindwings covering the <b>forewings</b> to a large extent. Sometimes the butterfly will not sit, but rest gently on the flower while feeding, while doing this, to maintain balance, it beats only its <b>forewings</b> while keeping the hindwings completely steady.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, later palaeontinids {{like the}} Upper Jurassic Eocicada and Early Cretaceous Ilerdocossus had {{triangular}} <b>forewings</b> with the flexion line {{closer to the}} base. They had smaller and narrower hindwings that did not overlap with the forewing. These indicate that they were highly versatile fliers, able to fly {{with a wide range}} of speeds and agility like modern wasps and sphinx moths. They also possessed changes to the leading edge of their <b>forewings,</b> suggesting an overall gain in lift.|$|E
25|$|It flies high, {{slowly and}} often descends to nectar on flowers below. On such {{occasions}} it often dives down with its wings held back, {{and as it}} approaches the flower, the wings open up to provide deceleration. The butterfly primarily depends on motive thrust on the powerful flapping of its <b>forewings</b> while the hindwings act as a balancing and steering mechanism. This flying technique gives a rather unusual look to its flight and an observer is left {{with the impression that}} it is dragging itself through the air with only the assistance of its <b>forewings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Lorquin's admiral has brown-black wings, {{each with}} a row of white spots across it. Its <b>forewings</b> have orange tips. Wingspan: 47 to 71mm; females are {{generally}} larger than males.|$|E
25|$|Most fairyflies possess wings {{with long}} {{bristles}} (marginal setae) on the fringes. The <b>forewings</b> usually have hypochaeta. These are small bristles (setae) which point distinctly backwards on the ventral {{surface of the}} wing membrane.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: Very {{similar to}} that of the male but without the sex-mark; the black areas on both <b>forewings</b> and hindwings {{slightly}} broader, with the inner edge of the black terminal band on the hindwing often diffuse.|$|E
25|$|In general, all Diptera {{have three}} body regions (head, thorax, and abdomen), {{three pairs of}} legs, one pair of <b>forewings</b> used for flight, one pair of halteres which are {{modified}} hindwings, and one pair of antennae.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dark brown, paler in the female, {{with very}} obscure black {{markings}} of transverse lines across {{the cells of}} both <b>forewings</b> and hindwings and an oblique discal fascia on the forewing; an ash-grey continuous band along the termen of both <b>forewings</b> and hindwings, gradually broadening from {{the apex of the}} forewing, where it is very narrow, to the tornus of the hindwing, where it covers about one-third of the wing. In the female this band is outwardly narrowly bordered with brown. Cilia white. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown above; beneath, the antennae ochraceous, the rest dusky white washed with ochraceous. Underside: Male ochraceous brown, female bright ochraceous. In both sexes the colours paler on the hindwing; the forewing somewhat narrowly, the hindwing much more broadly suffused with lilacine-grey on the terminal margins and along the dorsal margin of the hindwing; cells of both wings with dark brown sinuous transverse lines and looplike markings; both <b>forewings</b> and hindwings crossed by somewhat diffuse broad discal and narrower postdiscal dark bands, prominent on the forewing, obscure on the hindwing. Male with a patch of specialized dark scales above vein 4 on the upperside of the hindwing.|$|E
25|$|The upperside <b>forewings</b> are {{a bright}} orange {{with a dark}} outside edge border and with eight or nine black spots. The hindwings are dark with an orange border. Some females also have a row of blue spots inside the orange border and are known as form caeruleopunctata. The undersides are {{patterned}} {{in a similar way}} but are paler. The black spots on the <b>forewings</b> are outlined in yellow and the dark colouring is replaced by a pale brownish grey. The hindwings are the same brown/grey colour with small black dots and a narrow orange border. The caterpillars (larvae) are usually green, but some have a purple stripe {{down the middle of the}} back and along each side.|$|E

500|$|Dragonflies are {{powerful}} and agile fliers, capable of migrating across oceans, moving in any direction, and changing direction suddenly. In flight, the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six directions: upward, downward, forward, back, to left and to right. They have four {{different styles of}} flight: A number of flying modes are used that include counter-stroking, with <b>forewings</b> beating 180° out of phase with the hindwings, is used for hovering and slow flight. This style is efficient and generates {{a large amount of}} lift; phased-stroking, with the hindwings beating 90° ahead of the <b>forewings,</b> is used for fast flight. This style creates more thrust, but less lift than counter-stroking; synchronised-stroking, with <b>forewings</b> and hindwings beating together, is used when changing direction rapidly, as it maximises thrust; and gliding, with the wings held out, is used in three situations: free gliding, for a few seconds in between bursts of powered flight; gliding in the updraft at the crest of a hill, effectively hovering by falling at the same speed as the updraft; and in certain dragonflies such as darters, when [...] "in cop" [...] with a male, the female sometimes simply glides while the male pulls the pair along by beating his wings.|$|E
2500|$|Fairyflies exhibit {{considerable}} {{variation in}} their wing shapes {{in comparison to}} other chalcid wasps. The fully developed (macropterous) wings of fairyflies are normally flat with rounded tips and are several times longer than they are wide. These kinds of wings usually exhibit interspecific and intergeneric variation {{in terms of the}} length to width ratio and the shape of the wing outline (especially of the tips and the rear margins) of the <b>forewings.</b> In some species the <b>forewings</b> are relatively wide, like in the genus Paranaphoidea which have <b>forewings</b> only {{two and a half times}} as long as they are wide. In other species, the <b>forewings</b> are extremely narrow, like in Cleruchus bicilliatus whose <b>forewings</b> are about thirty times as long as they are wide.|$|E
2500|$|Commonly {{and easily}} mistaken for the similar viceroy butterfly, the monarch's {{wingspan}} ranges from [...] The uppersides of the wings are tawny orange, the veins and margins are black, {{and there are}} two series of small white spots in the margins. Monarch <b>forewings</b> also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of <b>forewings</b> and hindwings are yellow brown instead of tawny orange and the white spots are larger. The shape and color of the wings change {{at the beginning of the}} migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants. Wings size and shape differ between migratory and non-migratory monarchs. Monarchs from eastern North America have larger and more angular <b>forewings</b> than those in the western population.|$|E
2500|$|Kaniska canace has a {{wingspan}} {{of about}} [...] The upperside of <b>forewings</b> and hindwings is black, while the underside {{is black and}} brown. Also the body is completely black. [...] <b>Forewings</b> have a blue band at the wavy outer edge, a blue or white spot at the wing leading edge and a little white spot in the wing tip. Hindwings show a wide blue transversal band, with a row a small black spots and a narrow blue band at the outer very wavy edge.|$|E
2500|$|Palaeontinids {{had large}} bodies covered with {{bristles}} (setae). They had small heads and broad wings. They superficially resemble moths. Large palaeontinids like Colossocossus had <b>forewings</b> that reached {{the length of}} [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the <b>forewings</b> is 58 mm for males and 64 mm for females. Males have {{cinnamon}} brown wings with a yellow spot basad of the eye spot of the <b>forewings.</b> The apical area of the <b>forewings</b> is yellow, and the outer margin of the <b>forewings</b> is concave. Females have a distinct eye spot on the <b>forewings</b> with a white center and a brown iris margined externally with black.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the <b>forewings</b> is about 8-9 mm for females. The <b>forewings</b> are pale ochraceous brown. The hindwings are {{slightly}} paler than <b>forewings.</b> Adults have been recorded on wing in March.|$|E
50|$|Adults exhibit {{tremendous}} individual variation, {{with the}} <b>forewings</b> varying from brick red to tan, brown, or black. The subterminal {{area of the}} <b>forewings</b> can be concolorous with the ground color of the <b>forewings</b> or much paler. The anal margin of the <b>forewings</b> normally has a pale beige line, bordered by a brick red fringe.|$|E
