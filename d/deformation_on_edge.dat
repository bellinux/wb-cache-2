40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with obtaining exact solutions for the axisymmetric bending problem of elastic annular plates with internal concentric supports. The standard stiffness method of analysis is employed to solve the problems. The solutions can be obtained either numerically or in closed-form. Both thin and thick plates can be handled. For the thick plate analysis, the Mindlin plate theory has been adopted to cater for the effect of transverse shear deformation. Relationships between Kirchhoff and Mindlin plate solutions {{have been used to}} derive the stiffness matrix of thick plates. Present solutions are compared with published results for some representative annular plate bending problems to demonstrate their validity. Exact solutions for displacement, shear force and bending moment for an annular plate with an internal concentric support are presented. Numerical results showing the influence of transverse shear <b>deformation</b> <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> displacement under a concentric ring load applied at the free inner edge of a free/continuous support/fixed plate are also presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the functionalization of functional groups to graphene nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair edges using first principles calculations. We {{find that the}} formation energy for {{the configuration of the}} functional groups functionalized to the zigzag edge is ~ 0. 2 eV per functional group lower than that to the armchair edge. The formation energy difference arises from a structural <b>deformation</b> <b>on</b> the armchair <b>edge</b> by the functionalization whereas there is no structural <b>deformation</b> <b>on</b> the zigzag <b>edge.</b> Selective functionalization <b>on</b> the zigzag <b>edge</b> takes place at a condition of the temperature and the pressure of ~ 25 oC and 10 - 5 atm. Our findings show that the selective functionalization can offer the opportunity for an approach to the separation of zigzag graphene nanoribbons with their solubility change...|$|R

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of large-gradient deformation caused by coal mining {{is of great}} significance to the prevention and management of disasters in mining areas. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method captures the small-gradient ground <b>deformation</b> <b>on</b> the <b>edge</b> of the subsidence basin accurately but is unreliable for capturing large-gradient deformation. The intensity-based pixel-tracking method (e. g., the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method) can overcome the limitations of InSAR’s maximum detectable displacement gradient and incoherence. However, the pixel-tracking method is sensitive to template size. It is difficult to estimate ground subsidence accurately by the conventional pixel-tracking method with fixed template size. In this paper, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is redefined and an improved locally adaptive template size method is proposed by identifying optimal template adaptively based on maximization of the redefined SNR. The constraint radius is used to constrain the search area in this improved method. The frequency of misrepresentation is reduced by finding {{the peak of the}} correlation coefficient surface within the search area. Both simulation data and real ground subsidence data are used to test this algorithm. The results show that this method can improve monitoring accuracy compared with the traditional pixel-tracking method for fixed template size...|$|R
40|$|Diploma work {{discusses}} the dimensioning of intersections of reinforced concrete in states of boundary carrying capacity {{with use of}} tables and diagrams according to European Standard EN 1992. With diagrams of effective use of concrete reinforcement it touches also the boundary states of usability. By the creation of tables I have craved for bigger simplification of preliminary calculus of needed parameters. Tables for single axis big eccentricity are presented for individual material qualities as well as independently of material quality and they offer additionally the possibility to consider the reinforcement hardening. By small eccentricity we can simplify the intersection dimensioning with tables, which give optimal quantity of reinforcement, {{with which we can}} ensure minimal intersection of reinforcement by specified load without retardative searching of suitable pairs of concrete <b>deformations</b> <b>on</b> the <b>edges.</b> Interaction diagrams are created for chosen shapes of intersections with and without consideration of reinforcement hardening. In boundary state of usability we can simply check the effective use of reinforcement with given proper diagrams for the effective use of reinforcement, which are given in dependence of load, statical height of intersection and the reinforcement level. In calculus of effective use in boundary state we can quickly check the effective use of reinforcement with diagrams for effective use of reinforcement, which is given in dependence of statical height of intersection and at specified reinforcement levels...|$|R

40|$|During the {{hot-rolling}} {{of aluminium}} ingot into sheet, the material elongates {{in the rolling}} direction as it is reduced vertically. The spread which occurs in the lateral direction during the multiple pass schedules used in industry is minimal. However, the <b>deformation</b> <b>on</b> these <b>edges</b> is important. During the initial passes a concave profile develops - the material near the surfaces spreads outward while the material at the centre moves inward. The concave profile can lead to defects in the final product; these are the 'roll over' of material from the edges {{to the top and}} bottom surfaces, the fold over of material in the centre of the edge, and the formation of vertical edge cracks. To remove these the edges are trimmed {{at the end of the}} process. Research work in this area was motivated by the possibility of identifying means of reducing the amount of material that needs to be trimmed. The objectives of this thesis are to develop techniques of simulating the rolling, and to use these to investigate the deformation mechanisms which lead to the concave edge profile. Models of the rolling were developed using the general purpose, non-linear finite element code ABAQUS. To reproduce the edge profiles accurately requires large three-dimensional models, for which the explicit dynamic method was found to be the most suitable. The results of the analyses were used to investigate the mechanisms which lead to the concave edge profile. In the roll-gap the work-load arches through the ingot; and for roll passes with small reductions a stress pattern occurs which leads to the concave edge profile. In this pattern the stresses of highest magnitude at the surfaces are compressive stresses in the vertical direction, while in the centre of the ingot they are orientated in the rolling direction and are tensile. Thus deformation occurs by vertical compression near the surfaces, and by stretching in the rolling direction at the centre. At the edges the material is not constrained laterally; and due to the Poisson effect, the material spreads outward near the surfaces, and moves inward at the centre. The effect of certain variables <b>on</b> the <b>edge</b> profile were investigated with the modelling. The friction between the work-rolls and the ingot was found to have significant influence on the amount of lateral surface spread. Work hardening, strain rate and temperature effects in the material lead to variations in the yield stress through the height of the ingot. These effects were included in the modelling and were found to affect the shape of the profile, but to a lesser extent than the friction...|$|R
