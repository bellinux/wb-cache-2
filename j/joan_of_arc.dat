5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was not actually burned at the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; that she was not a true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> is actually a myth. None of these claims are widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E

5|$|<b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> {{puts the}} player {{in command of}} the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the {{beginning}} of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan of Arc intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc.</b> At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{novel is}} {{presented}} as a translation (by [...] "Jean Francois Alden") of memoirs by Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of Louis de Contes, <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc's</b> page.

5|$|The {{figure of}} <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> {{represents}} both a common {{person and a}} child that was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.|$|E
5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot {{has replaced the}} former <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> dormitory (JOA). The former parking lot was torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E

5|$|Jeanne d'Arc was a wooden-hulled armored {{corvette}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the late 1860s. She was named for <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc,</b> a Roman Catholic saint and heroine of the Hundred Years War. Jeanne d'Arc participated in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and remained in commission afterwards, unlike many of her sisters. The ship was condemned in 1883, but nothing further is known as to her disposition.|$|E
5|$|During 1794, Southey {{began to}} plan with Coleridge and others about a {{political}} system that they would start in America called Pantisocracy. He needed to get money for the project and he contacted Richard Cruttwell on 19 July 1794 to publish <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> for that end. After notifying Bedford about the plan, Bedford advised Southey to contact William Nicol, a London publisher, to publish the work and raise more money. Southey did find a publisher, Joseph Cottle, to print his poem. A notification for the publication of <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was included in a publication of Southey's poems later in 1794, but the edition was stopped from being printed since it lacked the minimum of 50subscribers {{to pay for the}} cost. The poem was finally published by Cottle in 1796 (see 1796 in poetry) after changes to the text including a section added by Coleridge. The second edition would later be printed without Coleridge's lines and they were instead published on their own. For the second edition, Southey revised many lines and added more research to the work. It was printed in May 1798. Later editions were published in 1806, 1812, and 1837, with the final one further toning down Southey's republican sentiment.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break from {{his work on the}} fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc,</b> and he wanted to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E

5|$|<b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent to the writing of the poem and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E
5|$|Nevelson's first {{experience}} of art {{was at the}} age of nine at the Rockland Public Library, where she saw a plaster cast of <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc.</b> Shortly thereafter she decided to study art, taking drawing in high school, where she also served as basketball captain. She painted watercolor interiors, in which furniture appeared molecular in structure, rather like her later professional work. Female figures made frequent appearances. In school, she practiced her English, her second language, as Yiddish was spoken at home. Unhappy with her family's economic status, language differences, the religious discrimination of the community, and her school, Nevelson set her sights on moving to high school in New York.|$|E
5|$|On 6March 1429 <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon.

Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to Poitiers {{so that she could}} be cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E

50|$|She {{has become}} {{especially}} popular among Traditional Catholics, particularly in France - {{both because of}} her obvious connection to this country {{as well as the}} fact that the Traditional Catholic movement is strongest there. This branch of Catholicism, which has refused to accept the changes made by the Second Vatican Council, has compared the 1988 excommunication of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre (one {{of the founders of the}} Traditional Catholic movement) to <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc's</b> excommunication by a corrupt pro-English bishop in 1431. Traditional Catholic parishes sometimes perform plays in <b>Joan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arc's</b> honor.|$|R
