Due to undersea conditions (high salt concentrations, fluctuating temperatures and limited nutrient supply), the Navy may deploy MFCs with a mixture of salt-tolerant microorganisms. A mixture would allow for a more complete utilization of available nutrients. Shewanella oneidensis is their primary candidate, but may include other heat- and cold-tolerant Shewanella spp.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} shift in the use of {{wireless}} sensor networks from standalone systems that use bespoke methods of communication and data transfer to systems that use Internet standards and can interact more directly with the Internet. This has allowed wireless sensor networks to become a key enabler of the Internet of Things; however, the same is not true for <b>environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> networks as the focus of most existing research into Internet of Things wireless sensor networks has been on 2. 4 GHz designs for indoor, urban and agricultural applications. In these applications, power, Internet connectivity and physical access are less of a challenge when compared to a typical <b>environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> network. <b>Environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> networks are used for monitoring natural processes and are generally deployed in harsh, remote environments where these factors are more of a concern. Sub-GHz radios are commonly used for communication due to their increased range and desirable propagation characteristics. Unlike wireless <b>sensor</b> networks, <b>environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> networks have been slow to adopt Internet standards and have continued to rely on bespoke methods of communication and data transfer, keeping their usability low. This has impeded the adoption of <b>environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> networks for earth sciences research. This thesis investigates whether the Internet standards that have helped to make wireless sensor network {{an important part of the}} Internet of Things can be applied to sub-GHz <b>environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> networks. It is demonstrated that 6 LoWPAN can successfully be used with an 868 MHz network in a series of real-world deployments in the Highlands of Scotland that collected usable earth science data and facilitated research in other fields. Additionally, the suitability of these standards for real-world networks is assessed in terms of energy, throughput and latency performance and compared to a theoretical 2. 4 GHz network. An publicly available open source Contiki radio driver for the CC 1120 was developed as part of this work. Additionally, timing parameters for using ContikiMAC with 868 MHz radios were determines and shared with researchers at other institutions, facilitating further research into sub-GHz IoT ESNs by other researchers...|$|R

The study authors selected three publication years (1995, 2005, 2015) from an extensive corpus of peer-reviewed journal publications, identified each paper’s specific citation of and uses of the Mesonet’s <b>environmental</b> <b>sensor</b> data, and derived a typology of those usages (assimilation, experimentation, observation, simulation, utilization, validation) found to be most common. The rapid increase in data assimilation research projects today is discussed in terms of the difficulty and importance of correct attribution to individual data sources in these complex research projects. The study examines the possible role played by highly-cited papers that describe the quality assurance procedures in sensor data sources, which may serve as surrogates to signal the quality of the data provided by such sources, and which may also provide a useful contribution towards understanding data citation as a special form of scholarly citation...|$|R
