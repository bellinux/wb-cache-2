5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Skáldskaparmál, a partially euhemerized account is given of Ægir visiting the gods in Asgard and shimmering swords are brought out and used as their sole source of light as they drink. There, numerous gods feast, they have plenty of strong mead, and the hall has wall-panels covered with attractive shields. This location <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> as Valhalla in chapter 33.|$|E

5|$|Planet Nine {{does not}} have an {{official}} name, and it will not receive one unless its existence <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> typically through optical imaging. Once confirmed, the IAU will certify a name, with priority typically given to a name proposed by its discoverers. It will likely be a name chosen from Roman or Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass <b>is</b> <b>confirmed.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} Haemophilus influenzae could not <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> by Rice Bran agar, but could <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> by Rice Bran broth, blood one, and {{the mixing of}} the both in after 24 hours of cultivation.

5|$|The {{location}} of the battle <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> in the Township (Exterior) Notes of U.S. Deputy Surveyor John H. Mullet. The range line (between Roxbury (Section 19 of T9N, R7E) and Mazomanie (Section 24 of T9N, R6E) was surveyed on October 23, 1832, just {{three months after the}} battle. Because of this record, there is contemporary and sworn proof of the battle site's location.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} James Bond's final {{confrontation}} with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, {{while on a}} mission in Japan, a man claiming to be Bond appears in London and demands to meet {{the head of the}} Secret Service, M. Bond's identity <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> but during his debriefing interview with M, Bond tries to kill him with a cyanide pistol; the attempt fails. The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld's castle in Japan, Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia. Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months, Bond travelled into the Soviet Union to learn his true identity. While there, he was brainwashed and assigned to kill M upon returning to England.|$|E
40|$|Screening {{results of}} 488 {{pregnant}} women aged 15 – 44 years whose blood samples had been tested on-site, using First Response® HIV 1 / 2, and confirmed with INNO-LIA™ HIV I/II Score were used. Of this total, 178 were reactive (HIV I, 154; HIV II, 2; and HIV I and HIV II, 22). Of the 154 HIV I-reactive samples, 104 <b>were</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> HIV I-positive and 2 <b>were</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> HIV II-positive, while 48 <b>were</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> negative [false positive rate = 17. 44 % (13. 56 – 21. 32) ]. The two HIV II samples submitted <b>were</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> negative with the confirmatory test. For the 22 HIV I and HIV II samples, 7 <b>were</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> HIV I-positive and 1 <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> HIV I- and HIV II-positive, while 14 <b>were</b> <b>confirmed</b> to <b>be</b> negative.

5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by Alec Clifton-Taylor, {{who notes that}} the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of the chapter house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E

5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by {{a map of}} the island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
