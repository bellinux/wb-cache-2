60|$|I {{turned and}} ran and ran till I came over the hill and saw {{the boy and the}} little fair, sober maiden sitting {{together}} once more on the open slope, under the <b>high</b> <b>blue</b> heaven.

60|$|There was no wind {{except the}} draught the steamer made as she lurched across the {{dazzling}} swell. Cuba floated like a <b>high,</b> <b>blue</b> cloud over the port hand, {{cut off from}} the water by a blaze of reflected light, and the broad Yucatan Channel, glimmering like silver, stretched ahead. The deck had been holystoned and well sluiced before sunrise and was not quite dry, and there was a slight coolness in the air where Evelyn Cliffe sat under the awning.|$|E

Exactly why and how this day differs from those that came before and those that will come after, cannot be told; {{it is as though}} the Park said: 'To-day I live; the Past is past.

60|$|Carl {{believed}} that he thought of nothing but work and the restaurants and theaters of civilization. No more rolling for him until he had gathered moss! He played {{that he was a}} confirmed business man. The game had hypnotized him for nearly a year. He whistled as he cleaned plugs, and glanced out at the eucalyptus-trees and the sunny road, without wanting to run away. But just to-day, just this glorious rain-cleansed November day, with <b>high</b> <b>blue</b> skies and sunlight on the feathery pepper-trees, he was going to sneak away from work and have a celebration all by himself.|$|E
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} we heard {{her in the}} distance. Very faint at first were the birr of wheels and the tat-tat-tat of the horses' feet. Then they grew louder and clearer and louder yet, until a pair of yellow lanterns swung round the curve, and in their light we saw the two big brown horses tearing along the <b>high,</b> <b>blue</b> carriage {{at the back of}} them. The postilion pulled them up panting and foaming within a few yards of us. In a moment we were at the window and had raised our hands in a salute to the beautiful pale face which looked out at us.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{nodded and}} glanced across the {{dazzling}} water towards the <b>high,</b> <b>blue</b> coast. He {{did not think}} the steamer could {{be seen from the}} land, and the launch would, no doubt, be invisible from her deck, but this was not important and he began to calculate {{how long it would take}} them to reach a point ahead. Some time later, he looked round again. The steamer was fading in the distance, but no smoke trailed behind her and he did not think she had started yet. His attention, however, was occupied by the headland he was steering for, because he thought it marked the neighborhood of their port.|$|E

60|$|Except {{for some}} American and German merchants they saw few white people. The {{citizens}} were mulattos of different shades, negroes, and half-breeds who sprang from Spanish and Indian stock, {{although it was}} often hard to guess what blood ran in the Mestizos' veins. For the most part, they were a cheerful, careless lot; the coast basked in sunshine, with <b>high,</b> <b>blue</b> mountains for a background, and Marston felt nothing of the gloom and mystery that haunted the African rivers. At some of the ports Wyndham made arrangements for {{the extension of the}} house's trade, but Marston could not tell if he was satisfied or not.|$|E
60|$|They ran under a lofty railway viaduct {{and through}} a {{colliery}} village; then the road led upward across open country toward a <b>high,</b> <b>blue</b> ridge that rose {{between them and the}} south. As the car sped on, the careful cultivation that marks the Lothian levels became less evident. There were fewer broad belts of stubble, and the dark-green turnip fields were left behind; no copses and patches of woodland lined the winding road. Rushy pastures rolled away from it, the hedgerows were made of ragged, wind-stunted thorns, which presently gave place to dry stone dykes. Round hilltops began to rise above the high table-land where the white bent-grass grew, and a keen wind from the North Sea stung their faces as they climbed the last ascent. Here Dick's eyes swept the landscape.|$|E
60|$|We had {{now turned}} southward towards Kaa, {{following}} a shapeless bridle-track {{which is the}} high road of Hawaii. The sea was on one hand. Our way was across--the woods we threaded did but cling upon--the vast declivity of the island front. For long, as we still skirted {{the margin of the}} forest, we kept an open view of the whole falling seaboard, the white edge of surf now soundless to our ears, and the <b>high</b> <b>blue</b> sea marbled by tide rips, and showing under the clouds of an opalescent milky white. The height, the breeze, the giddy gradient of the isle, delighted me. I observed a spider plant its abhorred St. Andrew's cross against the sea and sky, certainly fifty yards from where I rode, and five feet at least from either tree: so wide was its death-gossamer spread, so huge the ugly vermin.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} use of artificial light on captive animals, {{its effect on}} those animals has rarely been studied experimentally. Housing animals in controlled light conditions is useful for assessing the effects of light. The chicken {{is one of the}} best-studied animals in artificial light experiments, and here, we evaluate the effect of polychromatic light with various green and blue components on the growth and physiology in chicks. The results indicate that green-blue dual light has two side-effects on chick body mass, depending on the various green to blue ratios. Green-blue dual light with depleted and medium blue component decreased body mass, whereas enriched blue component promoted body mass in chicks compared with monochromatic green- or blue spectra-treated chicks. Moreover, progressive changes in the green to blue ratios of green-blue dual light could give rise to consistent progressive changes in body mass, as suggested by polychromatic light with <b>higher</b> <b>blue</b> component resulting in higher body mass. Correlation analysis confirmed that food intake was positively correlated with final body mass in chicks (R 2  =  0. 7664, P =  0. 0001), suggesting that increased food intake contributed to the increased body mass in chicks exposed to <b>higher</b> <b>blue</b> component. We also found that chicks exposed to <b>higher</b> <b>blue</b> component exhibited <b>higher</b> blood glucose levels. Furthermore, the glucose level was positively related to the final body mass (R 2  =  0. 6406, P =  0. 0001) and food intake (R 2  =  0. 784, P =  0. 0001). These results demonstrate that spectral composition plays a crucial role in affecting growth and physiology in chicks. Moreover, consistent changes in spectral components might cause the synchronous response of growth and physiology...|$|R

60|$|Voices crying {{behind them}} never reached through the waters {{in which they}} were now sunk. The {{repetition}} of Hewet's name in short, dissevered syllables was to them the crack of a dry branch or the laughter of a bird. The grasses and breezes sounding and murmuring all round them, they never noticed that the swishing of the grasses grew louder and louder, and did not cease with the lapse of the breeze. A hand dropped abrupt as iron on Rachel's shoulder; {{it might have been a}} bolt from heaven. She fell beneath it, and the grass whipped across her eyes and filled her mouth and ears. Through the waving stems she saw a figure, large and shapeless against the sky. Helen was upon her. Rolled this way and that, now seeing only forests of green, and now the <b>high</b> <b>blue</b> heaven; she was speechless and almost without sense. At last she lay still, all the grasses shaken round her and before her by her panting. Over her loomed two great heads, the heads of a man and woman, of Terence and Helen.|$|E
60|$|Theseus {{promised that}} he would do so. Then going on board, the mariners trimmed the vessel's black sails to the wind, which blew faintly off the shore, being pretty much made up of the sighs that {{everybody}} kept pouring forth on this melancholy occasion. But by and by, when they had got fairly out to sea, there came a stiff breeze from the north-west, and drove them along as merrily over the white-capped waves {{as if they had been}} going on the most delightful errand imaginable. And though it was a sad business enough, I rather question whether fourteen young people, without any old persons to keep them in order, could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable. There had been some few dances upon the undulating deck, I suspect, and some hearty bursts of laughter, and other such unseasonable merriment among the victims, before the <b>high</b> <b>blue</b> mountains of Crete began to show themselves among the far-off clouds.
