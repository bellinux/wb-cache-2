5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{was born}} on August21, 1961, at Fort Sill, a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, KellyN. HillenburgJr. (July16, 1936 August30, 2006), {{was working for the}} U.S. military. His mother, Nancy (née Dufour), taught visually-impaired students. When he was a year old, the family moved to Orange County, California where his father began a career as a <b>draftsman</b> and {{designer}} in the aerospace industry. His younger brother, Bryan, followed in their father's footsteps, becoming a <b>draftsman</b> and designer. Hillenburg has no recollection of life in Oklahoma, having grown up in Anaheim, California.|$|E
5|$|Because he and {{his father}} held strong anti-communist beliefs, Koubek decided to flee Czechoslovakia after the Communist coup d'état of February 1948. He tried to cross the border into the American Zone of Occupation of Allied-occupied Germany, and failed. A second attempt in July succeeded. Koubek emigrated to the United Kingdom in October 1948, where he worked in a brickyard, as a <b>draftsman</b> for the city of Gloucester and county of Gloucestershire, a <b>draftsman</b> for the Ministry of Works, and {{announcer}} for the Czech language news service of the BBC. He encountered his future wife, Eva, in a bookstore in London. Eva was born in Prague, the daughter of a Czech Army officer. Her brother, whom she later rescued, was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Flanders's {{first major}} {{experience}} in machine design {{came when he}} helped an entrepreneur in Nashua, New Hampshire develop a box-folding machine. After that, {{he worked as a}} <b>draftsman</b> for General Electric until 1905, when he moved to New York City to work for Machine.|$|E
50|$|Law costs <b>draftsmen</b> must be {{skilled in}} the {{application}} of the statutory law relating to legal costs, and be familiar with the system of legal fees. For this reason, many firms of litigation solicitors retain law costs <b>draftsmen</b> as employees. Others rely on the services of dedicated costs drafting organisations and independent <b>draftsmen.</b>|$|R

5|$|He {{proved to}} be an {{excellent}} student, winning scholarships in both his second and third years, and {{was the first person to}} finish the course within the proscribed four years. He completed his apprenticeship with Davies in 1904, and was admitted as an Associate to the South Australian Institute of Architects, although the ongoing impact of the depression made finding work difficult. In spite of this, he found employment as a <b>draftsman,</b> initially with Ernest Bayer and later with John Quinton Bruce.|$|E
5|$|In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all {{relations}} {{with his family}} {{to hide the fact that}} he dropped out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River. Tesla moved to Maribor, where he worked as a <b>draftsman</b> for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific <b>draftsman,</b> keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.|$|E
50|$|A {{professional}} body, the Association of Cost Lawyers (ACL), {{was formed}} in 1977 as the Association of Law Costs <b>draftsmen.</b> The ACL regulates and provides training and accreditation for Law Costs <b>Draftsmen</b> and Costs Lawyers in the UK. The ACL {{was formed in}} 1977 with the object of promoting the status and interests of the profession of law costs <b>draftsmen</b> generally and ensuring {{the maintenance of the}} highest professional standards. The association promotes and fosters an appreciation of the contribution made by law costs <b>draftsmen</b> within the legal profession. Further aims include the exchange of ideas and information with other legal bodies and the regulation of the conduct of law costs <b>draftsmen</b> and those engaged in the practice of law costs. The ACL is recognised as an important contributor to law reform relating to costs law and procedures. The ACL is the only professional body that regulates law costs <b>draftsmen.</b> It does so through its rules, regulations and bylaws. The ACL is the only professional body providing recognised training and education in costs law. The ACL modular training course provides a structured training course covering all aspects of costs law and practice.

5|$|Wulfstan {{must have}} early on {{garnered}} the favour of powerful men, particularly Æthelred king of England, for we find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under Æthelred's reign from 1005 to 1016. There {{is no doubt}} that Wulfstan had a penchant for law; his knowledge of previous Anglo-Saxon law (both royal and ecclesiastical), as well as ninth-century Carolingian law, was considerable. This surely made him a suitable choice for the king's legal <b>draftsman.</b> But it is also likely that Wulfstan's position as archbishop of York, an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom, made him not only a very influential man in the North, but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South. It is indicative of Wulfstan's continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal <b>draftsman</b> for, and perhaps advisor to, the Danish king Cnut, who took England's West Saxon throne in 1016.|$|E
5|$|Immediately thereafter, Hickling was {{transferred}} to Malaya as its first parliamentary <b>draftsman,</b> and in that capacity he helped to prepare the Malayan (now Malaysian) constitution for that country's independence from Britain in 1957. Subsequently, as Commissioner of Law Revision he drafted the Internal Security Act of 1960, based on the Emergency Ordinance 1948 which had been enacted to provide the British colonial authorities with powers to tackle a communist insurgency. For his contributions to Malaya, Hickling was made a Companion of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (known in Malay as the Johan Mangku Negara or JMN) by the Malaysian head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Tesla {{moved to}} Budapest, Hungary, {{to work under}} Tivadar Puskás at a {{telegraph}} company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so {{he worked as a}} <b>draftsman</b> in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 Lichtenstein {{left his}} study of {{painting}} and drawing at The Ohio State University {{to serve in the}} U.S. Army, where he remained until January 1946. After entering training programs for languages, engineering, and piloting, all of which were canceled, he served as an orderly, <b>draftsman</b> and artist in noncombat roles. One of his duties at Camp Shelby was enlarging Bill Mauldin's Stars and Stripes cartoons. He was sent to Europe with an engineer battalion, but did not see active combat. As a painter, he eventually settled on an abstract-expressionist style with parodist elements. Around 1958 he began to incorporate hidden images of cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny into his abstract works.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a <b>draftsman</b> and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started {{designing}} and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master <b>draftsman</b> and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E

5|$|Pflueger, {{who started}} as a working-class <b>draftsman</b> and never went to college, {{established}} his imprint {{on the development of}} Art Deco in California architecture yet demonstrated facility in many styles including Streamline Moderne, neo-Mayan, Beaux-Arts, Mission Revival, Neoclassical and International. His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces, including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the Patent Leather Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at The Fairmont, three of the most successful San Francisco bars in their day.|$|E
5|$|The {{agents of}} the Catholic Church wrote {{detailed}} accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and <b>draftsman</b> Frederick Catherwood. Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya {{to the attention of}} the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{starting}} {{classes at}} Purdue, Chaffee sought out {{a job to}} complement his coursework and involvement in the Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. His first job during his sophomore year {{was working as a}} server at one of the women's residences, but he disliked the job and sought new employment. He was hired as a <b>draftsman</b> at a local small business near Purdue. As a junior, he was hired as a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department to teach classes to freshman students. He also joined the Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Gamma Tau engineering honor societies.|$|E

5|$|After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pflueger {{continued}} his grade-school education, graduating at age 13 {{in a mass}} ceremony held in Golden Gate Park for all the city's devastated public schools. By 1907, Pflueger {{was working as a}} <b>draftsman</b> and soon joined the architectural firm Miller and Colmesnil, under the guidance of James Rupert Miller, senior partner. Young Pflueger sketched ornamental details based on ideas from his bosses, and attended Mission High Evening School to further his education. In 1911, Pflueger joined the San Francisco Architectural Club (SFAC), an organization that helped budding architects receive training in the informal Atelier Method where older experts taught the practical side of architecture including waterproofing, lighting and structural concerns to students who had no hope or wish to study Beaux-Arts in an established school abroad. Pflueger became thoroughly involved with SFAC's collegial activities and was chosen director in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont, and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from Vermont, Flanders described life on his family’s subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the machine tool industry for most of his career. In his first years as a machinist and <b>draftsman,</b> he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to Vermont. In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, where Flanders became president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company. Flanders and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).|$|E
5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the <b>draftsman.</b> The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E
