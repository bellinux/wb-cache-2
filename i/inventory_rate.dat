40|$|Hurricanes and {{tropical}} cyclones constitute significant sources of economic loss and social disruption. Furthermore, {{according to the}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, enhanced greenhouse conditions may increase the intensity and/or frequency of tropical cyclones (hurricanes), which potentially will result in more wind damage. The paper develops a risk-cost-benefit framework to assess regional cyclone damage risks and economic viability of several hazard mitigation strategies to address the challenge of potential increase in wind damage due to enhanced greenhouse conditions, using residential construction in North Queensland, Australia as an example. The analysis includes a probabilistic wind model to account for cyclone intensity and frequency, and a vulnerability function to represent the potential damage for a given wind speed. Increases in mean annual maximum wind speed from 0 to 25 % over 50 years are considered to represent the uncertainty in changing wind hazard patterns {{as a result of}} climate change. The effect of regional changes to building <b>inventory,</b> <b>rate</b> of retrofitting, cost of retrofit, reduction in vulnerability, and discount rate will be considered. The risk-based cost-benefit analysis can be used to help optimize the timing and extent of retrofitting existing houses to adapt to the potential impact of enhanced greenhouse conditions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a dynamic model to {{simultaneously}} determine the optimal position of the decoupling point and the optimal path of the production rate as well as the inventory level in a supply chain. With the objective to minimize the total cost of the deviation from the target setting, the closed forms of the optimal solution are derived over a finite planning horizon with deterioration rate under time-varying demand rate. Design/methodology/approach: The Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is employed to explore the optimal position of decoupling point and the optimal production and <b>inventory</b> <b>rate</b> for the proposed dynamic models. The performances of parameters are illustrated through analytical and numerical approaches. Findings: The results denote that the optimal production rate and inventory level are closely related to the target setting which are highly dependent on production policy; meanwhile the optimal decoupling point is exist and unique with the fluctuating of deteriorating rate and product life cycle. The further analyses through both mathematic and numerical approaches indicate that the shorten of product life cycle shifts the optimal decoupling point forward to the end customer meanwhile a backward shifting appears when the deterioration rate increase. Research limitations/implications: There is no shortage allowed and the replacement policy is not taken into account. - 1368 -Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to {{understand}} how to improve the <b>inventory</b> turnover <b>rate</b> for an MTO-company in a purchasing and logistics perspective. With emphasis on lot sizing methods and different approaches of how to calibrate safety buffers, the <b>inventory</b> turnover <b>rate</b> measure’s denominator: the value of average inventory has been in focus. The research was built around UniCarriers Manufacturing Sweden AB’s purchasing and logistics division and its operations in the beginning of 2014. The <b>inventory</b> turnover <b>rate</b> is a key performance indicator within procurement for most manufacturing companies {{at the same time as}} procurement activities get increasingly important. The insights from the research are thus believed to be valuable for any MTO-company managing a large number of purchase articles. The report is divided into a literature framework, a part describing empirical findings at UniCarriers Manufacturing Sweden AB and an analysis part that elaborates on the theoretical and empirical findings. The report ends with a discussion and conclusion part where final recommendations are presented. By introducing economic order quantity to generate article specific order quantities, each article’s average inventory would according to simulations be reduced. As the other core area for improvement, a redefined ABC-matrix that generates fill rates to determine safety buffers has been introduced. Volume value is an inventory policy measure that is directly connected to the <b>inventory</b> turnover <b>rate.</b> By only using the volume value, the service level towards production would increase and the employed capital in inventory would be reduced in the long term. The suggested proposals concerning the two core areas, lot sizing and safety buffer, do not constitute the full improvement potential. Therefore other factors were investigated to find additional improvement potentials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Physical store {{retailers}} {{are facing a}} tougher situation than ever. In order to tackle this tough situation, they need not only to reduce cost by effectively executing SCM but also to introduce measures to increase profit like CRM. They are effective by themselves, {{but if they are}} combined the retailers can enjoy more benefits from these practices. However, there is no good application that realize both two business practices together. In this study, assuming that RFID system captures consumer behavior information on the sales floor, we propose an application, in which discount prices are offered to FSP member customers based on their loyalty level and the discount prices are computed to achieve a target <b>inventory</b> turnover <b>rate.</b> To realize this application, we also propose two algorithms that effectively control an <b>inventory</b> turnover <b>rate</b> at the same time reward FSP customers based on their loyalty status.

Observations noted during the project lead to the following conclusions: The delaminations rebonded with epoxy have remained solid through five years. The percentage of delamination has stayed essentially the same for both the epoxy injected and non-repaired areas. Epoxy injection appears to be a practical, cost effective alternative to other forms of deck rehabilitation when undertaken at the proper time. Cost effectiveness would reduce dramatically if delayed until breakouts have occurred. On the other hand it would be a slow, labor intensive process if undertaken too early when delaminations are small...|$|R
40|$|Psycho-behavioural <b>rating</b> <b>inventories</b> {{are used}} {{routinely}} by psychologists and psychiatrists as assessment instruments {{to assist with}} the evaluation and ‘diagnosis’ of children and adolescents. They are also used in epidemiological studies to obtain normative/prevalence estimates of children/adolescents with psycho-behavioural ‘problems’. Advantages entailed in their use include ease of administration and the convenience of obtaining estimates of normative behaviours from large numbers of informants. However, serious decisions are frequently {{made on the basis of}} ‘measures’ obtained from such instruments, including the labelling of a child as ‘pathologic’, subsequent referral to intervention therapy services, and prescription of medication by a physician. This workshop highlights key methodological issues endemic to the design and use of psycho-behavioural <b>rating</b> <b>inventories,</b> and the analyses of data derived from them. With specific reference to the assessment of inattentive behaviours, the workshop provides evidence indicating that traditional psychometric methodologies employed to construct ‘scales’ (typically from ordinal, item-response formats) and to report ‘norms’ that ignore the sampling, measurement, distributional and structural properties of the derived data, have long since passed their ‘use-by-date’. Also demonstrated is that claims of validity and reliability employing these traditional methodologies can no longer be justified. Using data obtained from the administration of psycho-behavioural <b>rating</b> <b>inventories</b> in several large-scale research projects, these issues are illustrated and discussed in terms their substantive implications. The outcomes of more robust methodologies are presented that stress the need to revise the design of child/adolescent psycho-behavioural <b>rating</b> <b>inventories,</b> and point to the adoption of more rigorous approaches to measurement and analyses of the related data...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a short-term discounting {{model in which}} the distributor offers a discounted price for the retailers' orders placed {{at the beginning of}} its replenishment cycle, in a non-cooperative distribution system with one distributor and multiple retailers, each facing price-sensitive demand. We examine the value of the price discount strategy as a mechanism for the distributor to coordinate the retailers' ordering and pricing decisions under two common types of demand, linear demand in price and constant elasticity demand in price. Our numerical study reveals that, in the presence of homogeneous retailers (namely, retailers with identical demand rates), the distributor's profit improvement due to coordination generally decreases as the number of retailers or the <b>inventory</b> holding cost <b>rate</b> increases, but increases as price elasticity increases. Although an increase in the <b>inventory</b> holding cost <b>rate</b> has a negative effect on the distributor's profit, it may {{have a positive effect on}} the retailers' profits. We further find that with heterogeneous retailers (namely, retailers with different demand rates), offering a discounted price under linear demand benefits the distributor when both the <b>inventory</b> holding cost <b>rate</b> and the variation in demand are either small or large. This cross effect, however, is absent under constant elasticity demand. Coordination Price discount Supply chain Short-term discounting...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between Behavior <b>Rating</b> <b>Inventory</b> of executive functions and academic achievement of high school students. It was hypothesized that “The scores on Behavior <b>Rating</b> <b>Inventory</b> of Executive functions will be positively correlated with the scores on academic achievement test in all three areas (i. e. spelling, reading and arithmetic) in high school students”. Study Design: Correlational research design. Place and Duration of Study: high school students with grade level of 7 and 8 were randomly selected from different schools of Karachi, Pakistan in 2009 and 2010. Methodology: At the first stage of study permission was taken from the authors of different tests that were to be used in the study. After getting permission from school administration a sample of 100 (50 male and 50 female) students with grade level of 7 and 8 were randomly selected from various schools of Karachi-Pakistan. The age range of participants was from 12 to 14 years (mean age: 12. 50; SD =. 92). The participants were briefed about the purpose of the study for establishment of rapport. All participants were scattered by seating them randomly in order to control the corresponding and cheating factors. In order to ensure their willingness of voluntary participation in the study written consent was taken from them. They were asked to complete the demographic forms, after which the spelling subtest of Wide Range Achievement Test-III –WRAT-III (Wilkinson, 1993), and The Behavior <b>Rating</b> <b>Inventory</b> of Executive Function -BRIEF (Gioia, Peter, Guy, & Kenworthy, 2000) were administered on them in a group. However, the other two subtests i. e. arithmetic and reading were administered on each participant separately. The procedure for administration of all three subtests was followed according to the instructions given in the manual. Results: For statistical analyses Pearson Product moment coefficient of correlation was calculated through SPSS version 12. 0. Analysis indicated that the correlation between the scores on Behavior <b>Rating</b> <b>Inventory</b> of executive functions and academic achievement in all three areas i. e. reading, spelling and arithmetic is not statistically significant.
