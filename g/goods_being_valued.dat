40|$|Renewable {{energy has}} become an {{important}} feature of most modern economies with clean and non-exhaustible sources of power being given a greater significance. Wind energy {{is one of the}} favoured renewable, as it is (2013) generally the cheapest and most mature technology available for commercial use. The South African government, as outlined by the Department of Energy's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), aims to install 5 GW (Gigawatts) of wind energy by 2020. However, South Africa has had little experience in the wind energy industry which is limited to two projects, Klipheuwel (2002) and Darling (2008). Much effort has been dedicated to calculating balance sheet costs, which carries uncertainty due to the high reliance on country specific and site specific variables. An aspect which deserves more attention, and is often ignored, is the public‟s attitudes towards local wind farm developments, which have been known to "make or break" a project during the planning stages. Public backlashes have mostly been concerned with the visual "intrusiveness" of wind farms in the landscape. Detrimental effects on scenery, while seemingly innocuous, are acknowledged as being the single largest barrier to successful wind farm development. Individuals within an area become sentimentally attached to their surroundings, where significant rapid changes in the landscape are viewed as "damage". Economics recognises such declines in scenic resources as market failures, where an externalised cost is passed on to the public and is often not accounted for by private parties responsible for the liability. The primary objective therefore was to measure the magnitude of the visual impact, caused by the Waainek Wind Farm, on the Grahamstown community. Conventional NIMBY¹ (not in my back yard) reasoning, which seeks to explain local wind farm resistance, has attracted criticism with regard to its simplistic approach to wind farm problem identification. Contemporary arguments propose that NIMBY is a poor explanation for the trouble experienced on the local level because it groups problems into one all-encompassing term, leaving much of the discontent unexplained. Instead, the NIMBY explanation is really a broad set of unattended problems, largely resulting from the unsound practices present in the public participation process. Insufficient community involvement and disparities in the negotiation power structures have become the recent focus in wind farm literature. Essentially, these disparities force opposition groups to select factors which may seem more serious to developers, leading to ineffective remedial measures because the core underlying problems are not being remedied. Thus these considerations formed an additional area of investigation. No NIMBY effect was found for the Grahamstown community, as support for both the local and general level was roughly 80 %. The public participation process on the other hand revealed that while many found the practices of the developer to be unfair, attitudes towards the wind farm were not adversely affected, especially for the lower income Grahamstown East areas. While the public participation process in this instance did not have any effect on people’s attitudes, careful inspection of the circumstances need to be given. Wind farms are new to South Africa, where the novelty and benefits are the focus of enthusiasm. Job opportunities as well as clean energy are positive drivers for attitudes; however given time, once the anticipation for wind farms dulls, real problems may be revealed. Thus it is crucial to implement good practice procedures during the public participation process, especially when national adoption rates of wind energy are low. Early implementation of an effective public participation process system will ensure that when major problems do arise in future projects, experience and institutional processes would have had ample opportunity to evolve appropriately over a period of time. The double bounded Contingent Valuation Method was used to value the impact of the wind farm on the Waainek scenery through a hypothetical scenario based procedure which presented pictures of the landscape before and after the wind farm had been installed. Based on the perceived impact of the wind farm, respondents were asked their Willingness to Pay to relocate the development, based solely on visual impacts. Learning design Contingent Valuation (Bateman et al., 2008) is a novel technique employed to familiarize respondents with the hypothetical market institution as well as the scenic <b>goods</b> <b>being</b> <b>valued.</b> Average Willingness to Pay was found to be R 67 per month, with a final total monthly negative visual impact of R 104, 000 to R 121, 000 per month for the entire Grahamstown community. Grahamstown Central (middle-high income) residents were more likely to pay than Grahamstown East (low-middle income) East residents because of socio-economic differences present in each area. A ranking exercise determined that while negative visual impacts are present, the overall benefits derived from the wind farm are potentially much higher. Additionally, positive scenic improvements were found, but were not measured due to time constraints, and would have worked to reduce the net visual impact of the Waainek Wind Farm. ¹Problem where individuals support the general concept of wind power, {{but when it comes to}} local implementation, opposition to the development arises within the same group...|$|E

40|$|Benefit {{transfer}} is {{an approach to}} estimating {{costs and benefits of}} policies in the absence of original data collection. Many different meth-ods have been proposed (Navrud and Ready 2007). They all use estimates from one or more previous studies to predict the benefits from a new policy at a different point in space, time, or both. Under what conditions will these predic-tions be valid? Previous work on benefit trans-fer methodology has addressed this question by suggesting informal guidelines for the selec-tion of previous studies (Water Resources Re-search 28 (3), 1992 and Ecological Economics 60 (2), 2006).

Current measures are subject to several biases. Quantitative judgments of value are often based on a concept of importance that ignores the quantity of the <b>good</b> <b>being</b> <b>valued.</b> They are sensitive to irrelevant factors, such as cost of the good (vs. its benefit) and whether it has been reduced by human action or nature.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of respondents to contingent valuation surveys tend to either state a zero bid, or refuse to state a bid at all, for reasons associated {{with the process of}} valuation. These protest responses are routinely removed from contingent valuation samples because it is assumed that they are not indicative of respondents’ ‘true’ values. The censoring of protest responses has led to the emergence of a definitional controversy. One view is that the definition of protest responses and the rules for censoring them are dependent on whether the practitioner conceives of the contingent valuation survey as a market or as a referendum. However, what is not acknowledged is the possibility that protest responses and their meaning may vary according to the type of <b>good</b> <b>being</b> <b>valued,</b> the elicitation format, and the interaction between these elements and external factors. This potential renders the development of unambiguous rules for censoring protest responses difficult. Moreover, when willingness to pay is viewed as a behavioural intention, it becomes important to determine what the responses actually mean. This approach does not assume an interpretative position a priori against which the responses should be judged, but seeks to inform an existing understanding which is inadequate.

40|$|Cost-benefit {{analysis}} {{has long been}} a dominant method of policy analysis. When applied to policies affecting the environment, however, it faced a serious problem. Many policies exert environmental impacts that are external to market transactions, so the values of these impacts resist monetary measurement. This shortcoming in cost-benefit analysis led some researchers to develop indirect and nonmarket methods of valuing environmental goods monetarily. They include the travel cost method, hedonic pricing, and contingent valuation. The popularity of these methods has grown since their inceptions, but so have controversies over their use. Economists and others have taken all sides of the debate over the validity of the methods and their normative implications. These methods popularity and controversies necessitate their critical evaluation. This research fills this need through an extensive meta-analysis of 228 existing environmental valuation studies representing the contemporary practices in each method, and capturing varieties of environmental goods and settings. The analysis tested the convergent validity of the three valuation methods, and measured the moderating effects of select variables. The results show that effect sizes of the hedonic pricing and travel cost methods converge, but contingent valuation produces effect sizes that average 40 % to 55 % less than the other two methods. This difference varies significantly with the environment <b>good</b> <b>being</b> <b>valued.</b> Other significant moderating variables include the magnitude of the environmental change, the description of the change, and the location of the study. The year of study does not significantly moderate effect sizes. These results supplement descriptive and normative frameworks for environmental valuation described by Barbier (1994), Navrud and Pruckner (1997), and Norton (1995). When the evidence and these frameworks are considered together, the defensible uses of these three valuation methods become very limited. Valuation efforts should focus on multiple dimensions of environmental value, besides economic dimensions, that reflect ecological health and public concerns for the environment. Ph. D.

Since a comprehensive theory of hypothetical bias has not been developed, we use a set of explanatory variables based on issues that have been investigated in previous research.

The aim of the valuation exercise is to understand the public costs and benefits of particular changes in land management practices, to achieve improved NRM outcomes. The results from the evaluation survey, i. e. community values for improvements in resource condition will then be assessed in a cost-benefit framework against the potential costs and production losses to landholders that are estimated in another component of the AG 13 project. The valuation survey will assess community values and preferences for improvements in resource condition. The valuation will also determine how these values may change from region to region according to the environmental issues and impacts involved, and how values may vary across different population groups, inside and outside of catchments. These values will be assessed at both the regional and state level and will require a number of case studies to include: (a) a general study of values held by Queenslanders across the six NAP catchment areas; (b) a specific study within a catchment that assessed values held by the local population compared to the state population; and (c) a specific study between two catchments that assessed how community values changed when very different resources and improvements were involved. For example, community values may differ between a Murray-Darling catchment and one draining into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Assessing the values associated with improvements in resource condition requires specialist non-market valuation techniques because there is no market for environment goods and services in which their value might be revealed. In this project the Choice Modelling valuation technique was applied. This method was selected because of its ability to assess different attributes of a particular good.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to estimate adults' willingness to pay to reduce health risks to their or other families's infants, the latter to test for altruism. A choice experiment was conducted by having adults pay for bottled water for infants to reduce infants' exposure to nitrates in drinking water. Since nitrates only affect infants' health, we have isolated the adults' willingness to pay just for infants' health by buying bottled water to avoid infants' nitrate intake. Respondents were separated into two treatments, one with hypothetical choices, and the other where respondents were told that one of their four choices would be binding, and they would actually buy bottled water using money given to them {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. Results indicate that the marginal willingness to pay for a. 001 reduction in risk of shock, brain damage and mortality in the real cash treatment was $ 2, $ 3. 50 and $ 10, respectively. In the hypothetical treatment these amounts were $ 13, $ 23 and $ 64, indicating substantial hypothetical bias for the risk reductions. Nonetheless, in both treatments the relative marginal values across the severity of risk reductions are sensible, with willingness to pay to avoid the less severe health effects (e. g., shock) being much less than for the more serious effects such as brain damage and death. While the ratio of hypothetical WTP to actual WTP was rather high at a factor of nearly seven, such degree of hypothetical bias has been found in other experiments (Neil et al., 1994). This high hypothetical bias may be due to the nature of the <b>good</b> <b>being</b> <b>valued,</b> i. e. infant health. Many people express a very strong desire to protect infants, since infants cannot control their own health outcomes. Several statistical tests consistently confirmed that the marginal WTP for the risk reduction was not influenced by whether the individual was buying for his or her own infant or buying for another infant. This suggests there is a high degree of altruism reflected in our WTP results. This altruism continued to hold even when we focused solely on the consequential treatment where real money was involved. altruism, conjoint, drinking water, validity, willingness to pay, Health Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|At {{the core}} of the stated {{preference}} method is choice of payment vehicle. Since payment vehicle is an intrinsic characteristic of a good, the choice of payment vehicle will naturally impact on the valuation of the good. Typical payment vehicles applied in the context of health are income tax levies, out-of-pocket payments at the point of consumption or private health insurance premiums. Where out-of-pocket payments will elicit use value only, private health insurance premiums will also disclose option value, i. e. the utility of knowing that one has access to a healthcare service should one need it. Income tax levies will disclose what in this paper is referred to as citizen’s preferences, i. e. individual preferences that include use value, option value as well as (caring) externalities. This paper advocates that researchers design stated preference studies that encompass all relevant dimensions of value, and that serious thought is given to choice of payment vehicle. However, it is important to acknowledge that choice of payment vehicle has other potential implications for valuations. Payment vehicle and provider of services may be strongly linked in people’s minds. If respondents implicitly associate a specific type of provider with a certain type of payment vehicle, it is important that any misperception is corrected by way of a precise description of the <b>good</b> <b>being</b> <b>valued.</b> Further, a pertinent issue {{is the extent to which}} respondents ‘protest’ to the stated preference question and how we should deal with these ‘protesters’. No agreement currently exists about the procedure used to separate genuine zero values from protest values, nor about the treatment of protest responses in subsequent analyses. Beliefs are strongly associated with protesting, and exclusion of protest bids may therefore exclude individuals who have strong preferences for a payment vehicle. If it is acknowledged that payment vehicle is an intrinsic component of a good, exclusion of respondents who exhibit specific viewpoints may result in biased welfare estimates. Yet another issue is the presence of self-consciousness amongst respondents. If people derive utility from saying they are willing to pay for a public good (social desirability bias or warm glow), this potentially drives a wedge between people’s stated value for a good in a survey and people’s value for a good provided to them from the government. Tax payments are more binding than out-of-pocket payments. Payment towards public health programs via income tax may therefore generate lower consumer surplus than if the intervention was financed out-of-pocket with the option of opting out both in terms of participation as well as financially. Finally, only a few studies have looked at the impact of frequency of payments. The effect of temporal framing is clearly potentially important and at the same time an unavoidable component of the payment vehicle, yet it remains at present unexplored...|$|R
5000|$|In July 1994, Roger Bell of the UKs Independent {{tested the}} 2.5-litre {{turbodiesel}} {{variant of the}} XM. He said that [...] "the introduction of a new high-torque diesel is among a range of sales-boosting improvements made by Citroen to its flagging flagship, still shunned by the British as a Gallic oddity." [...] The pricing and equipment were viewed as competitive. The comfort and roominess were praised, but comments on the drive quality focused on the idiosyncrasies. Even though the steering ratio was much reduced compared to the CX, Bell still considered it over-direct and said that [...] "clumsy drivers should look elsewhere". Roger Bells conclusion was that [...] "anyone {{in the market for}} a big, roomy, comfortable car that goes well on little fuel would be foolish to ignore it. Apart from <b>being</b> <b>good</b> <b>value,</b> the XM is one of the last true characters left in a market of lookalikes." [...] Fuel economy of 40 mpg was reported for this test.|$|R
