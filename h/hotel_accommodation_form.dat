40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to present a straightforward and achievable online strategy {{in the form of a}} structured conceptual framework for <b>hotel</b> <b>accommodation</b> providers and practitioners that was extensive and holistic yet easy to understand and achievable. The basis of this framework was achieved through critical analysis of the literature around the online <b>hotel</b> <b>accommodation</b> process under two main headings (1) online <b>hotel</b> <b>accommodation</b> behaviour and (2) online <b>hotel</b> <b>accommodation</b> thoughts and emotions. Each of these main headings were examined under the influencing factors which were internal to the online process (the individual, search engines, third parties / social media and <b>hotel</b> <b>accommodation</b> websites) and external to the process (online access devices and device visual interaction). The data collected was extracted from the 100 individual in-depth observational interviews, the 3, 107, 281 individual online searches extracted from the online analytics of 18 different hotels over an 18 month period and the interviews of the managers of these 18 hotels. Analysis of the data reinforced the conceptual framework structure providing a standardised map of online <b>hotel</b> <b>accommodation</b> behavioural, thoughts and emotional process patterns. The analysis also revealed mismatches with current perceived norms. Mismatches noted between the requirements of online consumers and the online experience being presented prevent targeted personalisation and individualisation difficulties such as single individuals using multiple devices, multiple individual using single devices, complex multiple segments within single individuals and individual behavioural differences within a single travelling group. Other areas analysed with complex behavioural mismatches included travel stage behavioural differences and psychological advertisement blindness. The thesis culminates in the presentation of the conceptual framework structured on the internal and external factors, the process factors and the sub factors. All these factors and sub factors are correlated through the structure of the thesis, starting from the literature review going through to the research methodology, the data collection and analysis and ending with the recommendations and conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Textbook {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors determining the success of learning. John (2001 : 23) stated that majority of teachers use a textbook as their principal curriculum guide and source of lesson, so textbook can support what teacher explains to the students in teaching learning process. Tourism Vocational High School students basically work closely with many tourists from many countries when they practice in the real job such as a tourism guide or a hotel server. The students are demanded to have a good speaking ability to enable them to communicate with their customer from foreign country. Therefore, speaking skill has become the primary task for students who study in Tourism Vocational High School.
