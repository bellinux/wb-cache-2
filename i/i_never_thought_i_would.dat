In [...] "", {{she immediately}} dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that [...] "...sparks fly {{between the two}} women". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> meet one of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria's son {{remembered her}} fondly: [...] "My mother was very quick on the uptake, very talkative, very {{aggressive}} and argumentative. With her marvellous brain she sharpened people's wits." [...] Her granddaughter thought her [...] "formidable, but never intimidating... a supremely honest woman, full of commonsense and modesty." [...] Victoria wrote her own typically forthright epitaph {{at the end}} of her life in letters to and conversation with her son: [...] "What will live in history is the good work done by the individual & that has nothing to do with rank or title... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be known only as your mother. You're so well known now and no one knows about me, and I don't want them to." ...|$|E
500|$|A Manhattan {{power broker}} who is hired {{to act as}} a [...] "fixer" [...] in {{response}} to the bank heist. Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee: [...] "Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E

After her release in 2006, she published a memoir, , and started recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled [...] "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told Billboard: [...] "My hand-eye coordination was so bad , I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> work again." [...] Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of [...] "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song [...] "Samantha", originating from an interview with NPR, were also distributed on the internet in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hear myself say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cowell was {{confirmed}} to return {{as a judge}} for the 12th series. In April 2015, Walsh sighted his desire to quit the show and return to management, {{and that it would}} take serious thought for him to return for the series' 12th series. He also revealed {{that he was in the}} dark about whom Cowell had the intentions of bringing onto the panel. On 14 May 2015, Walsh confirmed his exit from the series, stating, [...] "The truth is I've done it for 11 years; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> even be on TV for four or five. To get 10 was great, to get 11 was amazing - I'm not hanging around for them this year."

2500|$|AllMusic felt [...] "...the Soulful British crooner James Blunt's wistful debut infuses the {{listener}} – in order – with rainy-day hope, the wistful comfort of unattainable love, and finally, world-weary resignation. While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley-era Rod Stewart {{with a healthy}} dose of Antony and the Johnsons, it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam." [...] Q magazine and Common Sense Media awarded the album four stars out of five. RocknWorld stated [...] "It's hard to describe James Blunt or his music without falling prey to many a cliché or hyperbole. Comes from the UK, serves in the army then makes an album of movingly sincere ballads which make a huge impression on his homeland and Australia, thus allowing him to enjoy phenomenal, chart topping success. However, in this case, the music Blunt is making does really deserve and warrant the hype surrounding him. Strangely enough, even with his music being all over the radio here in Australia, I cannot begrudge the fact that Blunt is truly talented and has made himself a damn good debut record." [...] BBC Collective said [...] "It's very rare I give an album 5 stars. Many have come close, but just missing it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>i</b> <b>would</b> say this, but Back To Bedlam has not got one bad track on it. I've listened to it 3 times back to back, just to make sure." [...] Slant Magazine said, in a three and a half star review, that [...] "Bedlam is an overall raw listening experience" [...] and that though [...] "Blunt's writing often juxtaposes love with death" [...] that it's [...] "More reason for American girls to go gaga over this able British bloke." ...|$|E
