As Percy continued to move eastward, forecasters predicted the storm to strengthen into a Category2 or Category3 storm within 12–24hours. meanwhile, forecasters issued gale warnings for Tokelau.

However, forecasters predicted Percy would make landfall on Tokelau.

Later, the gale warnings for Tokelau were changed to hurricane warnings as Percy moved to within 75miles (121km) north of Atafu. In Nukunou and <b>Fakaofo,</b> forecasters predicted that the cyclone would bring 60-70mph (95–111km/h) winds, heavy rains and possible flooding in low lying areas.|$|E
