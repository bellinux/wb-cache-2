This paper describes the legal and institutional framework for this arrangement and discusses its advantages and disadvantages for local governments. It analyses the effectiveness of agency-delegated functions in achieving their objectives by comparing the delivery of kindergarten and nursery school services over time. It shows that nursery services for pre-schoolers, mandated to local governments through the agency-delegated function, expanded faster than kindergarten services which were left to the discretion of local governments. It also reports a negative correlation between per capita prefectural income and the availability of nursery schools. These two findings suggest that agency <b>delegated</b> <b>functions</b> can help meet both quantity and redistribution objectives of the national government...|$|E
