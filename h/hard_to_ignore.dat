500|$|Christianity Today writer Russ Breimeier was {{positive}} about Katy Hudson, highlighting Hudson's songwriting style for being [...] "insightful and well matched {{to the emotional}} power" [...] of Hudson's music. He further deemed Hudson a [...] "young talent" [...] and expected to hear more from her in the next year. Similarly, Tony Cummings from Cross Rhythms also considered Hudson to be a [...] "vocal talent", recommending readers {{to listen to the}} album. The Phantom Tollbooth's Andy Argyrakis stated that Hudson having been reared in church had [...] "paid off", and noted that [...] "Although a mere pop lightweight, it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> Hudson's sincerity and lyrical maturity." [...] DEP from Billboard, also calling Hudson a talent, classified the record as [...] "textured modern-rock collection that is equal parts grit and vulnerability" [...] and [...] "impressive". The album was a commercial failure for bankrupted Red Hill Records, only selling between 100 and 200 copies.|$|E
500|$|Polygons Arthur Gies remarked {{positively}} {{upon the}} exploration for collectables and secrets, and their {{relevance to the}} new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning. Zack Furniss of Destructoid was originally skeptical regarding the [...] "glory kills" [...] feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well {{in the flow of}} gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace. Giant Bombs Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor [...] "makes them {{an essential part of the}} give-and-take of Dooms super-fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?" [...] Conversely, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> for players that choose not to use them.|$|E
500|$|Mayberry {{made the}} Phillies' opening day roster {{for the first}} time, and {{recorded}} the game-winning RBI via a pinch hit single in the Phillies' first game, but was optioned back to the minors after the Phillies activated Shane Victorino from the disabled list in early June. Subsequently, Mayberry returned to the big-league club when Victorino {{went back to the}} disabled list. Throughout 2011, Mayberry did not have a defined role on the club. In August, columnist David Murphy wrote, [...] "While the Phillies may not see evidence that Mayberry should be part of their everyday plans, it is getting <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the two huge offensive tools he brings to the table: immense power, and a curious ability to hit when it counts." [...] He added, [...] "Charlie Manuel has always seemed to have a soft spot in his heart for Mayberry. And, more importantly, he has always seemed to have a knack for when to put him into a game." [...] Manuel compared Mayberry to former Phillie Jayson Werth in terms of their size, athleticism, {{and the fact that they}} both hit better against left-handed pitching than right-handed pitching, noting that he planned to give Mayberry a chance to start if Ben Francisco floundered. Ultimately, the Phillies traded away Francisco after the season, in part due to Mayberry's emergence. He finished the season batting [...]273/.341/.513, with a [...]854 OPS and 15 home runs in 104 games, and made his postseason debut in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals that September.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that domestic cats {{can learn to}} manipulate their owners through vocalizations {{that are similar to}} the cries of human babies. Some cats learn to add a purr to the vocalization, which makes it less harmonious and more dissonant to humans, and therefore <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore.</b> Individual cats learn to make these vocalizations through trial-and-error; when a particular vocalization elicits a positive response from a human, the probability increases that the cat will use that vocalization in the future.|$|R
2500|$|On May 24, 2007, former US {{president}} Jimmy Carter wrote {{a letter}} to state attorney-general Thurbert Baker (who is also African-American) in which he questioned whether Wilson's race had played a role in his treatment.

[...] It seems incongruously {{out of character for}} Lee to have whipped a slave woman himself, particularly one stripped to the waist, and that charge may have been a flourish added by the two correspondents; interestingly enough, it was not repeated by Wesley Norris when his account of the incident was published in 1866. [...] lthough it seems unlikely that he would have done any of the whipping himself, he may not have flinched from observing it to make sure his orders were carried out exactly." ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the Book of Revelation was written {{during the reign of}} Domitian (81-96 A.D.). Beginning at the middle down to {{the last quarter of the}} first century, extensive persecutions were carried out throughout the Empire, though they were sporadic. Most were initiated by local governors, who were expected to keep their cities “pacate atque quita” (‘settled and orderly’). As pressure from the demands of the citizens to get rid of the Christians became <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> or control, they were driven to acquiesce.|$|R
50|$|Leagues of laymen {{began to}} form in many cities for the Church's defence. In Moscow and Petrograd 6-10% of their {{population}} joined these leagues. These leagues took action in preventing the state from taking over monasteries. Between February to May 1918 687 persons were killed in clashes between these leagues and the government. These leagues were effective in saving the Church, partly because the state found it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the working masses who constituted these leagues {{than they did in}} ignoring the disenfranchised clergy.|$|R
50|$|The {{defeat of}} the village of Mattau and its allies in 1636 was an unequivocal display of the superiority of Dutch arms in Taiwan, gaining the Company great {{prestige}} among the aboriginal villages who themselves placed great stock in martial prowess. Dutch military success also irrevocably shifted the delicate balance of power that had previously existed between the various native villages, and {{as more and more}} villages submitted to Dutch sovereignty (however loose in actual practice), the cost of staying antagonistic to the Dutch and the newly formed federation of “united villages” became increasingly untenable, and the tangible benefits <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In Office at Night (1940), another [...] "couple" [...] painting, Hopper {{creates a}} {{psychological}} puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing {{on his work}} papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he is working <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources, from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several [...] "office" [...] pictures, but none with a sensual undercurrent.|$|E
2500|$|Game Informer {{gave the}} game {{a rating of}} 8.75 out of 10, writing [...] "a number of new {{features}} have been attempted to make Revelations feel new and different from its predecessors.

[...] GameTrailers also gave the game a rating of 8.8 out of 10, saying that [...] "the engine is a bit long in the tooth and some of the content isn't entirely worth exploring, but if you're looking for an unforgettable top shelf action/adventure, heed the creed." ...|$|E

50|$|On 13 June 1982, {{after the}} death of King Khalid and Crown Prince Fahd became the King, Prince Sultan was {{appointed}} second deputy prime minister. Opposition to his appointment as second deputy prime minister came in particular from two half brothers, Musaid and Bandar, both of whom, like Abdullah, were born in 1923 and therefore, were older than Prince Sultan, who was born in 1925. The objection of Prince Musaid was easily ignored since his son, Faisal bin Musaid, had assassinated King Faisal. However, the interests of Bandar bin Abdulaziz were much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore.</b> Thus, he was compensated and the dispute was resolved.|$|R

60|$|But this {{ceases to}} be true {{directly}} we emerge from the region of chemistry and physics. In the biological sciences of the eighteenth century, common-sense struggled <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> individuality in shells and plants and animals. There {{was an attempt to}} eliminate the more conspicuous departures as abnormalities, as sports, nature's weak moments; and it was only with the establishment of Darwin's great generalizations that the hard and fast classificatory system broke down and individuality came to its own. Yet there had always been a clearly felt difference between the conclusions of the biological sciences and those dealing with lifeless substance, in the relative vagueness, the insubordinate looseness and inaccuracy of the former. The naturalist accumulated facts and multiplied names, but he did not go triumphantly from generalization to generalization after the fashion of the chemist or physicist. It is easy to see, therefore, how it came about that the inorganic sciences were regarded as the true scientific bed-rock. It was scarcely suspected that the biological sciences might perhaps after all be TRUER than the experimental, in spite of the difference in practical value in favour of the latter. It was, and is by the great majority of people to this day, supposed to be the latter that are invincibly true; and the former are regarded as a more complex set of problems merely, with obliquities and refractions that presently will be explained away. Comte and Herbert Spencer certainly seem to me to have taken that much for granted. Herbert Spencer no doubt talked of the unknown and unknowable, but not in this sense as an element of inexactness running through all things. He thought, it seems to me, of the unknown as the indefinable Beyond of an immediate world that might be quite clearly and definitely known.|$|E

40|$|Marxism {{has long}} been subject to {{criticism}} from the theorists of Political Ecology, and in recent years, as the concerns of Green thinkers have become <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore,</b> Marxists have begun {{to respond to this}} challenge, defending and sometimes amending Marxist theory in response to Green criticisms. This paper addresses one issue within this debate: the controversy over Marx’s commitment to the growth, or development, of the productive forces. My aim is to dispute the contention of Marx’s Green critics, that his concept of the development of the productive forces leads inevitably to the exacerbation of ecological problems, and, more speculatively, to suggest some advantages of using this concept to investigate ecological problems...|$|R
40|$|Distractor {{interference}} effects were compared between distractors in the periphery and those placed at fixation. In 6 experiments, the authors show that fixation distractors produce larger {{interference effects}} than peripheral distractors. However, the fixation distractor effects are modulated by perceptual load {{to the same}} extent as are peripheral distractor effects (Experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3 showed that fixation distractors are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> filter out than peripheral distractors. The larger distractor effects at fixation are not due to the cortical magnification of foveal stimuli (Experiments 4 and 5), nor can they be attributed to cuing by the fixation point (Experiment 2), the lower predictability or greater location certainty of fixation distractors (Experiment 5), or their being in a central position (Experiment 6). The authors suggest that preferential access to attention renders fixation distractors <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> than peripheral distractors...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{possible}} explanation is that van Maanen simply saw what he had been trained to see for years.

50|$|Examinees {{are shown}} a simple {{geometric}} figure {{and then asked}} to find the simple figure embedded or hidden in a relatively complex figure.

The Witkin EFT was first developed by Herman Witkin as suggested by the figures of Kurt Gotschaldt and described in his book Psychological Differentiation by Witkin's group. Thurston had an earlier Hidden Figures Test which correlated with the EFT but had a different pattern of other correlations.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The "simultaneous {{ascending}} auction" {{was first}} introduced in 1994 to sell licenses to use bands of radio spectrum in the United States. Much of the attention devoted to the auction came from its role in reducing federal regulation of the radio spectrum and allowing market values, rather than administrative fiat, to determine who would use the spectrum resource. Many observers were also fascinated by the extensive reliance of the auction on web-like information technology. The {{large amounts of money}} involved were yet another source of interest. The very first use of the auction rules was a US$ 617 million sale of ten paging licenses in July 1994. In the broadband PCS auction, which began in December 1994, ninety-nine licenses were sold for a total price of approximately US$ 7 billion. Once the auctions had been conducted, it became much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the tremendous value of the large amounts of spectrum allocated to uses such as high definition te...|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{forensic}} photography and the documenting {{of victims of}} violent crimes have increased awareness by exposing the crimes.

The gained support has led to the starting of movements and programs dedicated to aid victims and stop future instances of these crimes. Among these are child abuse, spousal abuse, rape, and many others.|$|R
