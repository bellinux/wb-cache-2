40|$|When {{settling}} up {{spatial development}} for a construction, development of building land {{is a very}} demanding activity, one that enables the transition from un-build up areas to built-up areas. Spatial development for construction is read as assurance (provision) for such infrastructure, which is required {{to ensure that the}} designed spatial development will serve it's purpose. Legislation on settling up spatial development for construction in areas in Slovenia dating from 1931 to 2005 has been collected and analyzed. Many changes have occurred in these areas and in their respective terminologies. Especially the law on building up the land from the year 1984, its later instruction and the 4 th part of the currently valid law on settling up environment: Spatial development for construction has been analyzed. Contents for getting assurance for spatial development with infrastructure according to the law of Building areas from 1984 and by the Law Building areas from 1997 are extended. With the law on settling up a spatial from 2002 and its subsequent corrections, spatial development for construction is becoming an integral part of settling up the spatial, also gaining influence on spatial planning, above all in rational spatial development. Legally formal, from 1977 on, developed land has been a precondition for <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> for construction. ...|$|E

Hinter vielen der Projekte, die von Luftverkehrsprognosen begleitet werden, stehen Interessen. Dies gilt insbesondere für Ausbauvorhaben von Flughäfen, die von eindeutigen Zielen und Wünschen getragen werden. Die Gutachter, die im Rahmen solcher Ausbauvorhaben tätig werden, sind der Gefahr ausgesetzt, beeinflusste Prognosen zu erstellen. Es ist Ziel der folgenden Arbeit, die Qualität von Luftverkehrsprognosen in Deutschland empirisch zu überprüfen. Dabei stößt man auf das Problem, dass es für Luftverkehrsprognosen praktisch nur einen Gutachter gibt. Dies ist die Intraplan Consult GmbH. Prognosen anderer Gutachter liegen in so geringer Zahl vor, dass sie nicht empirisch auswertbar sind. Wir beschränken uns im Folgenden deshalb darauf, die Prognosen von Intraplan Consult GmbH zu analysieren. Wir glauben, dass die Untersuchungsergebnisse allgemeingültigen Charakter haben und auf andere Luftverkehrsprognosen übertragbar sind. Es werden drei Fragestellungen untersucht. •	Überzeichnen die Luftverkehrsprognosen der Intraplan Consult GmbH die tatsächliche Verkehrsentwicklung? •	Gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass Überzeichnungen bei bestimmten Prognosegrößen (z. B. PAX, Fracht, Flugbewegungen) besonders häufig vorkommen? •	Gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass Überzeichnungen bei bestimmten Gutachtentypen bzw. Gutachtenanlässen (z. B. Erweiterungen, behördliche Genehmigungen) besonders häufig vorkommen? Die empirische Untersuchung zeigte, dass die Prognosen insgesamt betrachtet tendenziell die tatsächliche Verkehrsentwicklung überschätzen. Es konnte zudem ermittelt werden, dass die Qualität der Ergebnisse stark streut und sich nicht normalverteilt verhält. Weiterhin konnten Wendepunktefehler im Prognose-Realisierungs-Diagramm beobachtet werden. Das bedeutet, dass das Modell von Intraplan Wendepunkte von Entwicklungen nicht erkennen kann. Die Airlines haben in den von den Prognosen erfassten Zeiträumen Strategiewechsel vorgenommen, die von Intraplan nicht erkannt wurden. Im weiteren Verlauf wurden die drei Prognosegrößen (i) Passagiere, (ii) Fracht- und Postaufkommen sowie (iii) Flugbewegungen einzeln analysiert. Alle drei Größen zeigten systematisch überschätzende Prognosen. Besonders stark ist dies bei den Flugbewegungen zu erkennen. Die Prognosen wurden nach ihrem Zweck in die Kategorien „Planfälle bei Genehmigungsgutachten“, „Worst-Case-Fälle bei Genehmigungsgutachten“ sowie „Marktstudien“ getrennt. Alle drei Kategorien weisen systematische Fehlschätzungen auf. Bei den Marktstudien liegen systematische Überschätzungen vor. Sie sind tendenziell etwas geringer als bei Planfallprognosen, wo die Überschätzungen erhebliche Größenordnungen annehmen (20 - 50 % zu hohe Wachstumsraten). Worst-Case-Prognosen unterschätzen die tatsächliche Entwicklung systematisch. Da die beiden letzteren Kategorien (also Planfälle vs. Worst-Case-Fälle) im Zusammenhang mit Ausbauvorhaben an Flughäfen stehen, liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass im Rahmen der Genehmigungsgutachten die Worst-Case-Prognosen gezielt zu niedrig angesetzt werden (Unterschätzung), während die Planfallprognosen zu hoch angesetzt werden (Überschätzung), um das jeweilige Ausbauvorhaben in einem bedeutenderen Licht erscheinen zu lassen. Die Wendepunktfehler zeigen, dass Intraplan Strategiewechsel der Luftverkehrsunternehmen nicht richtig prognostiziert. Dies kann im Zusammenhang mit dem von den Auftraggebern verfolgten Zweck der Projekte stehen: Andere als die von den Auftraggebern gewünschten Strategien werden nicht abgebildet. Dieses sind, wie die empirischen ex post Ergebnisse zeigen, weder alle denkbaren Strategien und nicht einmal die wahrscheinlichsten Strategien. In der Luftverkehrswirtschaft wird argumentiert, dass die Prognosen von Intraplan nur wegen der Finanzkrise 2008, die nicht vorhersehbar gewesen wäre, so schlecht seien. Unsere Analyse zeigt für einige Flughäfen tatsächlich deutliche Brüche der Entwicklung nach der Finanzkrise. Bei anderen Flughäfen ist demgegenüber eine Konstanz der Entwicklung vor und nach der Finanzkrise festzustellen. Auch bei diesen Flughäfen ist aber die Prognose schlecht. Darüber hinaus gibt es Flughäfen, bei denen Airlines Strategiewechsel schon vor der Finanzkrise vorgenommen haben. Auch bei diesen hat das Prognosemodell von Intraplan schlechte Resultate erzielt. Bei anderen Flughäfen dagegen, ist die Prognoseleistung trotz Finanzkrise gut. Alles in allem zeigt sich deshalb, dass es weniger die Finanzkrise von 2008 ist, die zu Fehlprognosen führt, als die fehlende Fähigkeit, die Strategien der Airlines richtig abzubilden. Aviation traffic {{forecasts}} and airport {{analyses are}} important instruments which influence decisions on aviation related infrastructure. Behind many of such infrastructure projects, which {{are supported by}} forecast analyses, one finds political interests. This is especially the case for aviation projects, such as infrastructure enlargement projects of airports, which are motivated by distinct goals and desires. Referees who act within this framework {{are exposed to the}} risk of producing biased results. The quality of such aviation traffic forecasts {{is the subject of this}} working paper. To begin with, one major obstacle is that there is only one such referee available in Germany - Intraplan Consult GmbH. Other referees have only a minimal, insignificant share of output, which cannot be used for any further empirical investigation. This is the reason why the present working paper focuses on airport analyses produced by Intraplan Consult GmbH. We believe that these research results are of common character, and thus are transferable to other related airport studies. The following three research questions have been investigated: •	Do recent aviation traffic forecasts performed by Intraplan Consult GmbH overestimate actual traffic developments? •	Are there any indications that some specific forecast measures (such as PAX, freight and cargo, flight movement) might be overestimated exceptionally frequently? •	Are there any indications that specific types and events of forecast analysis (such as airport expansion projects, official authorisation of a project by the public administration) overestimated exceptionally frequently? Empirical investigation has shown that forecast analyses tend to be indeed overestimated, compared to the actual traffic developments. It could be shown that the quality of the research results is widespread and not normally distributed. Furthermore, systematic errors with regard to the point of inflection in forecast-realisation-diagrams were identified. This means that models constructed by Intraplan could not identify points of inflection on the development path in the real world. For instance, airlines have undergone structure and strategic changes over the periods of investigation which could not be captured by Intraplan models. In addition, three forecast measures, namely the amount of (i) passenger, (ii) freight and post and the (iii) flight movements, have been analysed. All three of them have shown systematic overestimated forecast results. In particular, forecasts of flight movements have been largely overestimated. These forecast analyses have further been categorized according to their purpose, namely project cases for the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> certificates, worst-case scenarios for the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> certificates and market studies. All three categories show systematic misjudgements and miscalculations. Regarding the market studies, systematic overestimation was identified. It tends to be less severe than for the project cases, where extreme estimates of 20 - 50 % higher growth rates were found. In contrast to this, worst-case scenarios systematically underestimated actual development trends. The last two of which suggest the assumption that, when analysing enlargement projects of airports, worst-case scenario forecast figures and project case forecast figures have been deliberately manipulated in order to put the expansion project in question into the right perspective. Misjudgement by Intraplan, regarding the points of inflection, shows that they cannot forecast any strategic development by the aviation industry flawlessly. However, it can be assumed that this may also be in the interest of their contractors. Others as those suggested strategies by their clients are not included in their models. To further strengthen this suggestion, all empirical ex post results show that only a small share of all possible strategies, and especially the most improbable strategies, had been used. The aviation industry argues that miscalculation by Intraplan only relates to the events around the financial crisis in 2008, which have been unpredictable. Our research results showed that few airports had indeed been hit, regarding their development, by the financial crisis in 2008 and after. Others, however, have shown no effect and continued their rather constant development before and after the financial crisis. Forecast analyses have also been inaccurate and false for these airports. In addition to this, some of these airports had already undergone a strategic change, airline strategic change, before the financial crisis. As well, with regard to these airports, the forecast model by Intraplan produced false results. On the other hand, some forecast results have been correct, despite the financial crisis. All in all, it can be argued that incorrect forecasts have not been caused as much by the financial crisis as by the missing capacities of the model to incorporate strategic change...|$|E

The current models of approval/accreditation by boards of nursing in the U. S. are presented, and advantages/disadvantages of each model are discussed. The 5 models are: I. Boards of nursing act independently to approve/accredit nursing programs. II. Boards of nursing collaborate with the national nursing accreditors, on visits and/or with the program reports, when approving programs. III. Boards of nursing deem national nursing accreditation as meeting state approvals. III a. Boards of nursing deem accreditation as meeting approvals, though they require further documentation. IV.
