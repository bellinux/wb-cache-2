25|$|The spacecraft's onboard {{computer}} system was contained in an <b>Integrated</b> <b>Electronics</b> Module (IEM), {{a device that}} combined core avionics into a single box. The computer featured two radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000s, a 25megahertz main processor, and a 10MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For data storage, the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one gigabyte each. The IBM RAD6000 main processor collected, compressed, and stored data from MESSENGERs instruments for later playback to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} carries two computer systems: the Command and Data Handling {{system and}} the Guidance and Control processor. Each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy, {{for a total of}} four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is the Mongoose-V, a 12 MHz radiation-hardened version of the MIPS R3000 CPU. Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (<b>integrated</b> <b>electronics</b> modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9boards. The software of the probe runs on Nucleus RTOS operating system.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Babak Taheri, at University of California, Davis {{demonstrated}} {{the first single}} and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994. The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to silver/silver chloride electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with <b>integrated</b> <b>electronics</b> to reduce noise by impedance matching. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode.|$|E

The puck had <b>integrated</b> <b>electronics</b> to track its position on screen; a blue streak traced the path of the puck across the ice. The streak would turn red if the puck was shot especially hard. This was an experiment in broadcasting intended to help viewers unfamiliar with hockey to better follow the game by making the puck more visible. It was ill-received by many traditional hockey fans, but appreciated by many of the more casual viewers. The system debuted with much publicity in the NHL All-Star game at the Boston Fleet Center on January 20, 1996, but the system was shelved when Fox Sports lost the NHL broadcast rights three years later.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>integrated</b> power <b>electronics,</b> and more specifically, the design and manufacture of integrated power electronic components. After evaluating and optimising the flame spray process as a manufacturing technology for <b>integrated</b> power <b>electronics,</b> it was decided to integrate the partial series resonant converter (PSRC) as a case study. Both an integrated and discrete PSRC was built after a thorough investigation of the design of parasitic inductances as resonant components. Finally, the integrated PSRC was evaluated by comparing it to the conventionally manufactured discrete PSRC. The evaluation results showed that the integrated PSRC compared favourably with the discrete PSRC, and also takes up a smaller packaging volume, mainly because of the planar shape of the integrated magnetic cores and windings. However, if efficiency is used as a measuring rod, it is clear that the technology of <b>integrated</b> power <b>electronics</b> cannot yet compete against the conventional technology of discrete power electronics, mainly because of materials as well as manufacturing problems. As soon as the manufacturing technologies and materials used for <b>integrated</b> power <b>electronics</b> become competitive with respect to conventional manufacturing technologies and materials used for discrete power <b>electronics,</b> <b>integrated</b> power <b>electronics</b> will become economically viable...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{combination}} of an ionization chamber with one-dimensional spatial resolution and a MicroCAT structure will be presented. The combination between gas gain operations and <b>integrating</b> front-end <b>electronics</b> yields a dynamic range as high as eight to nine orders of magnitude. Therefore this device is well suitable for medical imaging or applications such as small angle x-ray scattering, where the requirements on the dynamic of the detector are exceptional high. Basically the described detector is an ionization chamber adapted to fan beam geometry with an active area of 192 cm and a pitch of the anode strips of 150 micrometer. In the vertical direction beams as high as 10 mm can be accepted. Every read-out strip is connected to an analogue <b>integrating</b> <b>electronics</b> channel realized in a custom made VLSI chip. A MicroCAT structure utilized as a shielding grid enables frame rates as high as 10 kHz. The high dynamic range observed {{stems from the fact}} that the MicroCAT enables active electron amplification in the gas. Thus a single photon resolution can be obtained for low photon fluxes even with the <b>integrating</b> <b>electronics.</b> The specialty of this device is that for each photon flux the gas amplification can be adjusted in such a fashion that the maximum DQE value is achieved.
