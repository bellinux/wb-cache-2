With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
