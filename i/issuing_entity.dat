40|$|In Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the simple, monopolistic {{organizational}} {{model of}} certificate <b>issuing</b> <b>entities</b> works fine until we consider real-world issues. Then, {{issues such as}} scalability and mutually suspicious organizations create {{the need for a}} multiplicity of certificate <b>issuing</b> <b>entities,</b> which introduces {{the problem of how to}} organize them to balance resilience to compromise against efficiency of path discovery. Many solutions involve organizing the infrastructure to follow a natural organizational hierarchy, but in some cases, such a natural organizational hierarchy may not exist. However, systems research has given us secure coprocessing for securely carrying out computations among multiple trust domains. Cryptography has produced a number of methods for distributing cryptographic computations, such as secret splitting and threshold cryptography. Last, distributed computing has given us peer-to-peer networking, for creating self-organizing distributed systems. In this paper, we use these latter tools to address the former problem by overlaying a virtual hierarchy on a mesh architecture of peer certificate <b>issuing</b> <b>entities,</b> and achieving both resilience and efficiency. ∗ This work was supported in part by Internet 2 /AT&T, by IBM Research, and by the U.

40|$|Credit {{ratings are}} a quasi-public good, and investors and {{financial}} markets regulators need an independent {{assessment of the}} credit-worthiness of an <b>issuing</b> <b>entity</b> because of information asymmetries and principal agent problems.

However, natural barriers of entry in the rating business and conflicts of interest have led to an inflation of ratings and a deterioration in their quality. It would thus appear that CRAs need closer supervision. While certainly burdensome and likely to raise barriers of entry, the European Commission's proposal seems to be the most sensible solution given the circumstances. Market discipline based on competition and transparency as envisioned in the US will lead to a weak surveillance regime, while leaving the regulatory license intact...|$|E

Finally, I summarise a few of the interesting research questions which can be addressed with such a data set in section 3. These are by no means exhaustive and certainly others will be suggested by the particular nature of other stock market jurisdictions. Section 1 : Data set construction A. What is an IPO? I define an IPO as the first occasion when any security issued by a firm is traded on a stock exchange and that is accompanied by the sale of securities either existing securities sold by insiders or new securities issued by the firm. It is possible for a company to go public by issuing a bond, a preference share or an ordinary share (common stock). This definition could apply to an <b>issuing</b> <b>entity</b> other than a firm, for example, a sovereign issuer. However, I confine myself in the rest of this paper to discussing onl...|$|E
40|$|Issuers in {{registered}} securities offerings must disclose the expected tax consequences to investors {{investing in the}} offered securities (“nonfinancial tax disclosure”). This Article advances three arguments regarding nonfinancial tax disclosures. First, nonfinancial tax disclosure practice, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) has sanctioned it, does not fulfill its intended regulatory purposes. Currently, nonfinancial tax disclosures provide irrelevant information, sometimes fail to provide material information, create unnecessary transaction costs, and divert valuable administrative resources to the enforcement of largely-meaningless requirements. Second, the practical reason for this failure is the SEC and tax practitioners’ unsuccessful attempt to address investors’ heterogeneous tax preferences. Specifically, nonfinancial tax disclosure practice assumes {{the existence of a}} “reasonable investor” who is also an “average taxpayer,” and tax disclosures are drafted for the benefit of this average taxpayer. The concept of an “average taxpayer,” however, is not defensible. Third, the theoretical reason for the regulatory regime’s dysfunctionality is the misapplication of mandatory disclosure theory to nonfinancial tax disclosure requirements. Mandatory disclosure theory, even if accepted at face value, does not support the current regulatory framework, due to the special nature of tax laws. To remedy this failure, this Article describes the types of tax-related disclosures that mandatory disclosure theory would support. Under the proposed regulatory reform, nonfinancial tax disclosures will only include issuer-level tax items (namely, tax items imposed on the <b>issuing</b> <b>entity)</b> that affect how “reasonable investors” calculate their own individual tax liabilities. Under such a regime, {{there is no need to}} rely on the “average taxpayer” construct...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{potential}} {{on both the}} demand and supply sides of the ÎukËk market, the current ÎukËk structures fall short of adequately meeting the market’s needs as the SharÊ’ah compliance of many of them and/or their economic efficiency are questionable. Even though partnership-based ÎukËk are claimed to reflect the true spirit of Islamic finance, their underuse as a financing instrument is a notable fact. Such a situation, if not addressed, will mpede {{the development of the}} ÎukËk market in the future. This paper proposes an innovative ÎukËk mushÉrakah model for consideration by companies and revenue generating infrastructure projects. The model has an incentive-compatible feature by making the share of the <b>issuing</b> <b>entity</b> in the profit positively related to its performance in addition to a convertibility clause. The sector Return on Equity (ROE), adjusted with the firm beta, is considered a benchmark for measuring the performance of the firm. The paper examines the design of the model, its risk return profile as well as its pricing for secondary market trading. The theoretical properties of the model are empirically validated through two types of simulations: Monte Carlo Simulation and backtesting. The proposed model constitutes a new class of financial security with respect to the residual nature of the claim and its limited tenor. It, thus, presents an opportunity for diversification. The model implies higher risk for the investor, as neither the profit nor the capital is guaranteed–like common stock– but the return is expected to be higher. The model would entail higher financial cost for companies–as compared to debt instruments–but it would imply at the same time lower probability of bankruptcy, since the ÎukËk are equity-based instruments. ...|$|E
