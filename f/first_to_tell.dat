500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who will be the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you {{for the rest of your}} career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E

2500|$|He was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information {{would result in a}} riot. When {{the audience}} quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E
