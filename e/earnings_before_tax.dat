Loan loss provisioning ratio indicates the ability of bank management in maintaining asset quality so that the amount of allowance for loan loss provisioning can be managed properly. The purpose of this study is to determine differences in the factors that affect the loan loss provisioning between conventional banks and Islamic banks. Variables that affect the loan loss provisioning is firm size (SIZE), capital adequacy ratio (CAR), loan-to-debt-to-ratio (LDR) and <b>earnings</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and provisions (EBTP). Method of data collection was purposive sampling. The research data is secondary data Islamic banks and conventional banks for four consecutive years from 2008 - 2011. The statistical method used is multiple regression and chow test. These results indicate that firm size (SIZE), capital adequacy ratio (CAR), loan-to-debt-to-ratio (LDR) and <b>earnings</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and provisions (EBTP) in conventional banks have a significant effect on the loan loss provisioning. While not a significant factor is firm size (SIZE), capital adequacy ratio (CAR), loan-to-debt-to-ratio (LDR) and <b>earnings</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and provisions (EBTP) in Islamic banks. Chow test results of the analysis indicate that there are differences between the factors that influence the PPAP in conventional and Islamic banks is that the ratio of the size or the size of the company konvensinal bank has total assets greater than Islamic banks. This reflects how much the total assets owned by describing the capital, as well as its rights and obligations.

The results show that the persistence, capitalization coefficients, and the value relevance do not necessarily correspond with each other by the industry and by the year. Each index reflects the different attitudes of earnings or income. The definition and concept of earnings quality and the measure of quality should be developed more rigorously in the future. The above results partly support the current reporting form in Japan, which divide net income into profits and earnings having different attributes. However, we find that, by modifying the dividing line, investors could calculate another multi-step income that is superior in the persistence, capitalization coefficients, and the value relevance to the reported income. Therefore, the current rule and the firm's operation of the classification of income components is not necessarily the best way for the decision usefulness. These results imply that there is room for improving the form of performance reporting in Japan. ...|$|E

Institutional influences, such as the sector you work in and the way your pay is set also play a role.

In fisheries, {{as well as}} {{in other}} natural {{resource}} based industries, {{there is a difference between}} the concepts of profit and rent. The former is a basic indicator for gauging the business performance of firms and industries, and the latter is for the evaluation of the economic welfare contribution of resources and industries. Economists are mainly concerned about resource rent and the managers of the industry with the objective of maximising rent - often conditional on ecological and social issues. Business economists are mainly concerned about the profitability of the firms. In the academic literature and in costs and earnings studies there are not always clear definitions of the profit and rent concepts and the use of them in actual analyses. We discuss differences and similarities of the profit and rent concepts, theoretically and based on data from the Icelandic and Norwegian fish harvesting industries. At the aggregate level for both countries, the resource rent (RR) is higher than the <b>earnings</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> (EBT), both for each year and on average 2009 - 2013.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} loan loss provisions {{with the presence of}} earnings management and capital management by commercial banks in the emerging and developed markets during the period of 2004 to 2012. Besides the main objective, there are external factors as well as the internal factors investigated in determining the loan loss provisions. This study focuses on the banking sectors that specify the commercial banks for the period of 2004 to 2012 in selected emerging and developed markets. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, Malaysia and Thailand are chosen to represent the emerging markets, while the developed markets are represented by Hong Kong and Japan. The empirical findings based on Pooled Ordinary Least Square (Pooled OLS) with Newey-West Standard Error for emerging markets and Fixed Effects (FE) with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation for developed markets recommend that earnings management, gross domestic product and certain bank internal factors have a statistically significant impact on loan loss provisions. This study found that the proxy of earnings management, <b>earnings</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and provisions is positively related to loan loss provisions in both economies. Surprisingly, the variable of capital management is found to be insignificant in emerging market economies and positively associated with LLP in developed markets. Based on the empirical findings of GDP implying that during the period of study, the economic expansion does influence the decision of loan loss provision by following the normal pattern of business cycle for both markets and contributes to the procyclicality behaviour of loan loss provisions. With respect to the effect of bank specific factors on the loan loss provisions of emerging and developed markets, it clearly indicates from the overall perspective of the results, that the obvious factors that have really contributed to loan loss provisioning practice of both markets are only the non-performing loan and the return on assets. Meanwhile, the robustness check using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) has basically generated the same results as Fixed Effects with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation for developed markets...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates on {{the effects}} of {{economic}} recession in 2008 after the "financial crisis" with Firm - Level Data (non-financial sector) from the Corporate Enterprise Annually Statistics - from 1994 to 2008. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of the shock on the firms' earnings and their adoptive accounting behavior. Four major findings of this paper are as follows. First, the recession in 2008 caused to the decline of firms' operating revenues and operating earnings. Moreover, the valuation losses of holding securities hit against their poor business performance. However, financing activities were not the point at the issue for most firms. Originally, not financial, but business performance of loss reporting firms in 2008 was lower than the other firms. Because "winners" disappeared in 2008, the performance of Japanese firms so seriously declined on the whole. Second, the persistence of earnings greatly dropped in 2008, because the more firms reported losses and the more firms experienced the earnings decrease. I detect the evidence that, under controlling the change of earnings signs between profits and losses, the persistence of earnings is declining during 15 years. Third, though the accounting standards for the financial instruments and for the impairments of fixed assets gave an effect on the "cherry-picking" sales behavior of the investments, i. e. financial assets and holding securities, I find that "cherry-picking" sales still remain. By "cherry-picking", big companies smoothed the net income when <b>earnings</b> <b>before</b> <b>tax,</b> special and extraordinary items were relatively lower. However, they abandoned the income smoothing in 2008, {{in the face of the}} rapid and great decline of performance. Fourth, the time series behavior of earnings components, the persistence of earnings, and income smoothing behavior are different among the capital size classes. All of those varieties would not necessarily be brought by the actual and real differences in corporate management. The fact that we don't know the accounting standards, which are used in the middle and small capital size firms, is a new and very important problem for Corporate Enterprise Statistics, collecting the data of financial statements from firms belong to the various capital classes and combining those data without modification. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} the implementation in Greece {{of a type}} of poll tax, namely the ‘trad ing duty’. In the past, the poll tax was chiefly a fixed tax charge applied to an individual, irrespective of the latter's income, property and consumer expenditure. Similarly, the ‘trading duty’ is a fixed tax levy which runs contrary to modern perceptions of society as a who le regard ing proportional and progressive taxation. Nowadays, a fair d istribution of the tax burden must be characterized by both horizontal and vertical tax equality. The principles of universality of taxation, taxation equality, justice and certainty and the princ ip le that no tax measures should be retroactive are embodied in the Greek Constitution. In Greece, {{the last three years}} have seen the approval of numerous tax laws, non-tax laws containing artic les on tax provis ions and Ministry of Finance decisions and decrees, while, in 2012, for the first time after many decades, all sectors of the economy are ‘in the red’. Despite the gloomy financ ial environment in Greece, in fiscal year 2012 a type of poll tax was imposed as a ‘trading duty’ for traders who filed Natural Person Income Tax (NPIT) returns. The implementation of the ‘trading duty’ allows for an extension from the terms ‘Operating Leverage’ (OL) and ‘Financial Leverage’ (FL) to the term ‘Tax Leverage’ (TL). Thus, when a percentage change in <b>Earnings</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Tax</b> (EBT) trans lates into growth of Earnings After Tax (EAT), then the phenomenon of the magnifying effect may be called Tax Leverage (TL) and it will be due to the possible constancy of the tax burden (e. g. trading duty, poll tax). In this study, through a detailed examp le, financ ial results (Degrees of Operating, Financial and Tax Leverage) determined at different levels of sales volume exhib it similar financial characteristics. Statistically they show linearity and a strong correlation, which create reasonable grounds for introducing a new termino logy in F inance. We consider it a given that OL is determined to a large extent by techno logy and can increase or decrease as a result of decisions relating to the investment budget. Furthermore, FL is positively related to the profitab ility of Assets, when EBIT/Assets>Borrowing Costs. Then, {{on the basis of the}} data and limitations of this study, TL is positively related to the profitab ility of Assets, when EBT/Assets>Tax Costs, while the Degree of Tax Leverage and the size of EAT are directly related accordingly. Lastly, a specific degree of combined leverage can be achieved through a different mix of OL, FL and TL, in order to offset any negative results that may arise from one of the three...|$|E
