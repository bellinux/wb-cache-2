5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety <b>Executive</b> <b>said</b> that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E

25|$|Despite these {{losses and}} the {{consequent}} increase in debt, Romanov pledged to construct a £51M new main stand at Tynecastle, which would increase its capacity to 23,000. Pedro Lopez, Hearts deputy chief <b>executive,</b> <b>said</b> that the proposals show Romanov's long term commitment to the club and that the increased capacity and revenue potential {{would allow them to}} reduce the debt in the long run. On 7 July 2008, Hearts issued a statement that stated the club would issue debt for equity {{in order to reduce the}} debt by £12M.|$|E

25|$|On the January 21, 2011, {{episode of}} Countdown, Olbermann {{abruptly}} {{announced that the}} show would be his final MSNBC broadcast. Olbermann thanked viewers, producers, and technical staff for his show's eight-year success. However, he did not thank Griffin or NBC News president Steve Capus. Neither Olbermann nor MSNBC divulged {{the reason for the}} cancellation. Many liberal bloggers and commentators blamed the cable operator Comcast for Olbermann's departure, accusing the company of silencing the host for political purposes just days after acquiring NBC Universal on January 18. Statements from MSNBC and Comcast denied this allegation. Media critic Howard Kurtz, former MSNBC anchor David Shuster, and an anonymous NBC <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> that Olbermann's 2010 suspension was a more likely precipitating factor in Countdowns cancellation.|$|E
25|$|In {{a further}} Panorama {{documentary}} broadcast on BBC One on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, {{had been paid}} huge bribes by FIFA's marketing partner ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. He claimed they appeared {{on a list of}} 175 bribes paid by ISL, totaling about $100million. A former ISL <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> that there were suspicions within ISL that the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels'.|$|E
500|$|Chow was {{inspired}} to create the film by the martial arts films he watched {{as a child and}} by his childhood ambition to become a martial artist.

50|$|Joeckel played {{alongside}} future Atlanta Falcon Jake Matthews, {{who played}} right tackle from 2010-2012. When Joeckel left Texas A&M, Matthews switched to left tackle in 2013.

50|$|Reasons for loss: Though {{the story}} was fairly well-written and the {{illustration}} work was praised, the usage of rhyming verse was felt to have misfired badly, and the book was agreed to have been targeted at the wrong age range.

500|$|Gilbert Heatherwick, an Angel Records <b>executive,</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} label sought {{to market the}} album as an [...] "event record" [...] and would {{position}} it [...] "upfront in pop departments".

Full Circle was released in India through the EMI-owned label Virgin India.|$|E
500|$|In March 2017, a Warner Bros. <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> that an R-rated DC Extended Universe film could [...] "absolutely" [...] happen, while Sony Pictures began {{developing}} an R-rated {{adaptation of the}} character Venom with a smaller budget, inspired by Fox's success with Deadpool and Logan. In June, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said {{in response to the}} successes that, though that company was not planning any R-rated films for its Marvel Cinematic Universe, [...] "it’s not out of the question".|$|E
500|$|After {{heavy rain}} {{resulted}} in drainage problems that affected the previous year's {{running of the}} race, workers employed by the track's owners sealed its tarmac surface and added an extra layer of [...] above it with a sealant which would allow standing water to drain from it. David Grace, the circuit's chief <b>executive,</b> <b>said</b> they had more knowledge of how the track behaved and expected that the event would be run more smoothly and noted that people expected more in its second year. Rockingham Motor Speedway's facilities underwent improvements which included the addition of access roads and signage for visiting spectators.|$|E

50|$|Reason for loss: The <b>executives</b> <b>said</b> that Kinetic {{had a great}} cliffhanger, storyline, and webisode. However, they couldn't {{get a lot of}} {{information}} about the product due to the dialogue (presented by Muna) in their webisode. Kinetic had to cut out some of the scenes entirely because it was too difficult to understand what Muna was saying about the product.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Silver King Broadcasting, the Home Shopping Network's {{television}} station group, bought WSJT from Press Broadcasting for an astonishing $27 million.

However, the purchase never occurred.|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} promote the album, Madonna's {{recording}} company Warner Bros. spent £1 million (£ million in [...] pounds) on its promotion, to generate excitement in the album {{without the support of}} media interviews or TV performances, as Madonna was in Malta filming Swept Away. A company <b>executive</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "There will be no Top of the Pops appearance or interview on Radio One or in Q magazine this time so we want the unusual name to get people thinking about the association between Madonna and GHV2" [...] and to generate extra media interest to compensate for the artist's unavailability to promote the release at the time. However, in December, Madonna made an appearance at the 2001 Turner Prize award ceremony and mentioned that she [...] "had a new record in stores called GHV2".|$|E
500|$|Body of Lies earned $12.9 {{million on}} its first weekend in theatres in the United States and Canada, 40% less than expected. This placed it as the third highest earning film that weekend, behind Disney's Beverly Hills Chihuahua, which turned [...] out to be No. 1 with a take of $17.5 million in its second week, and Sony/Screen Gems's Quarantine, which earned $14.2 million—about $2 million more than it cost to make. A Warner Bros. <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> he was {{disappointed}} with the film's opening and attributed it to its controversial storyline, although Body of Lies fared better than previous pictures about the [...] "war on terrorism" [...] such as Rendition, In the Valley of Elah, and Lions for Lambs, which all performed well below studios' expectations. In a fourteen-week theatrical run in the United States and Canada, the film earned $39 million.|$|E
500|$|The book, {{which was}} Rowling's debut novel, was written between {{approximately}} June 1990 and {{some time in}} 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, [...] "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy {{became more and more}} of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." [...] Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to an agent and a publisher, and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book, and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "so much better than anything else".|$|E

50|$|In 2000, a local {{judge ruled}} that Miners Memorial Medical Center was {{property}} tax exempt. The school board had appealed due to the significant loss of tax revenue to the District.

50|$|Office romances {{can be a}} {{cause of}} {{workplace}} conflict. 96 percent of human resource professionals and 80 percent of <b>executives</b> <b>said</b> workplace romances are dangerous because they can lead to conflict within the organization. Public displays of affection can make co-workers uncomfortable and accusations of favoritism may occur, especially {{if it is a}} supervisor-subordinate relationship. If the relationship goes awry, one party may seek to exact revenge on the other.|$|R
500|$|The {{confession}} {{has been}} received with incredulity, {{and many of}} the facts surrounding his mysterious disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after him vanishing, have been called into question. The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: [...] "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [...] {{did not seem to be}} able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation". Human Rights Watch was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility." [...] The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even. But that may be the point. Televised confessions don't tend to trade in logic, or truth. They trade in fear." [...] Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai – and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, Reporters Without Borders condemned China's [...] "dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for [...] "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress". Hong Kong's chief <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> that he was unable to act as [...] "the Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government".|$|E
500|$|E.T. {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} most {{important}} titles in the industry's history. As early as January 1983, after Atari admitted that the game had sold poorly, an industry <b>executive</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "the lesson of E.T. has not been lost on the industry". Infamously, the game is also cited to be one of the main causes of the video game industry crisis of 1983. Billboard magazine Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold E.T. games along with an increase in competition prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers. By the end of 1982, Atari had begun to lose dominance as more competitors entered the market. Poor critical reception and lack of a profitable marketing strategy made this game one of many cited decisions that led Atari to report a $536 million loss in 1983 and led to the company being divided and sold in 1984. GameSpy's Classic Gaming called E.T. Atari's biggest mistake, as well as the largest financial failure in the industry. Reiley commented that the game's poor quality was responsible for ending the product life of the Atari 2600. Occurring soon after Pac-Mans negative critical response on the Atari 2600, E.T.s poor reception was attributed by Kent to a negative impact on Atari's reputation and profitability. Authors Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost echoed similar comments about Pac-Man and E.T.s combined effect on the company's reputation and the industry's reaction. Buchanan also cited the game as a factor to Atari and the industry's crash. He stated that the large amount of unsold merchandise was a financial burden to Atari, which pushed the company into debt.|$|E

50|$|The show's set {{was similar}} to that of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

The Pat Sajak Show began as a 90-minute talk show, but was reduced to 60 minutes in October 1989.
