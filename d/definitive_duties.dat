40|$|The paper {{examines}} the EU governmentâ€™s {{choice of a}} proper policy instrument given the cost structure of the foreign firms that are present at the EU market. The empirical model {{which is based on}} a 2 -digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) level sector data and information on the EU anti-dumping (AD) and production subsidy investigations from 1985 - 1995 supports the theoretical findings that the EU maximizes its social welfare if it imposes definitive AD measures on the foreign firm which enjoy location-specific and thus nontransferable cost advantage, and subsidizes domestic production if the foreign firm with transferable cost advantage can avoid AD duties by undertaking FDI. The overview of AD and production subsidy cases in the EU shows important changes in targeting sectors and countries in the observed period. Most of the AD cases that ended in imposition of <b>definitive</b> <b>duties</b> or negotiating price undertakings affected low-wage developing East-Asian countries and non-market economies. On a sectoral level, chemical products followed by capital-intensive sectors accounted for more than 70 percent of all affirmative cases. So called strategically important sectors that were highly privileged in the early 1980 s switched to an alternative form of protection: production subsidies. ...|$|E

50|$|Given {{that there}} are {{concerns}} in Indonesia {{on the impact of}} EU's environmental regulations there is a strong dialogue on the issue. An anti-dumping investigation was initiated in August 2012 as there was evidence of dumping by companies from both Indonesia and Argentina of biodiesel on the EU market. Provisional measures were imposed in May 2013. As of 27 November 2013 the EU will impose <b>definitive</b> anti-dumping <b>duties</b> on imports of biodiesel from Indonesia.|$|R
5000|$|As of November 2013, the EU {{has imposed}} <b>definitive</b> {{anti-dumping}} <b>duties</b> on imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia. The anti-dumping measures consist {{of an additional}} duty of about 24.6% for Argentina and 21.3%, which measures were based on decisions taken by the Council after a 15-month investigation that the European Commission carried out in 2012. The investigation revealed that Argentine biodiesel products were being dumped in the EU market, just as thought by the congress. This Dumping have had a significant {{negative effect on the}} financial and operational performance of European producers. [...] Also, the European commission has proposed tariffs of 217 Euros per ton of biodiesel imported, this has caused the sales of the biodiesel imported more expensive than the one produced nationally, causing the sales of the Argentine and Indonesia biodiesel to decrease, considering that the sales had decrease severely due to the strict import laws on biodiesel newly applied. The amount of biodiesel imported to the European Union has decreased a 36% overall in 2013, and just from Argentina's overall imports decreased a 57%. [...] Also, the European government has started to charge a $1 tax per gallon of biodiesel in 2013, and it has constantly been increasing since then, making the biodiesel more expensive for the consumers. So as we can see, Europe has not only decreased the amount of imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia, but from other countries too. As a result, even though the total amount of imports have decreased drastically, the domestic producers of biodiesel have seen a huge increase in sale and in revenues thanks to the taxes and tariffs applied to imports that caused the drops in total imports.|$|R
