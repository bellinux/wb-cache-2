5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stipe).|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} African crake on the wintering grounds, {{but can be}} distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner wing. In both the breeding and wintering ranges {{it is unlikely to}} be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.|$|E
50|$|Wingspan {{of female}} is 40mm. Female with some crimson specks on thorax and abdomen. Wings with rufous <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white markings. Fore wings with rufous <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white markings. Fore wings with a crimson patch beyond the postmedial line on inner area.

5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{produces}} colourless, ellipsoid basidiospores {{of between}} 8 and 10 by 4 to 6micrometres (μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not amyloid and have thin cell walls. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any basidia, {{but he did}} describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10μm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gill) form a sterile <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The pileipellis, the top layer of the cap, forms a hymeniderm, a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1μm thick. The stipitipellis, the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6μm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1μm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. The {{rest of the}} upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring. The iris is dark brown. The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red tint to the forehead and chin. The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. The gape is yellow. One study suggested {{a connection between the}} female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood patches. Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower mandible. Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers on their faces after around a month of age. Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into full colour. M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.|$|E

5000|$|In particular, chordality is {{enforced}} by adding some [...] "fake" [...] binary constraints <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem. These are binary constraints satisfied by any pair of values, {{and are used}} only <b>to</b> add <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> primal graph of the problem. In particular, chordality is obtained by adding edges producing the induced graph of the primal graph according to an arbitrary ordering. This procedure is correct because the induced graph is always chordal and is obtained adding <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original graph.|$|R

25|$|This trait was {{developed}} because the herbicides used on grain and grass crops {{at the time}} were highly toxic and not effective against narrow-leaved weeds. Thus, developing crops that could withstand spraying with glyphosate would both reduce environmental and health risks, and give an agricultural <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farmer.|$|E

25|$|Therion {{signed with}} Active Records for its second album, Beyond Sanctorum. Prior to the {{recording}} sessions, Gustafsson left the band {{to return to}} the United States, so Therion continued as a trio with Hansson, Forss and Johnsson, the last of whom covered the bass.

25|$|Oakey accepts that Martin Rushent's adept {{sequencing}} {{and programming}} skills brought a professional <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's sound, and added many new elements and techniques.

25|$|By February, the Royal Lao Government's hold on Nam Tha seemed tenuous {{enough that}} it was {{reinforced}} by the paratroopers of GM 15.

The presence of armed American Special Forces advisors should have stiffened them with military expertise. In May, a PAVN assault broke the RLG forces and routed them.

25|$|At least 1/2 of all {{edges are}} always good.

So every bad edge, that enters a node v, can be matched to a distinct set of two edges that exit the node v. Hence the total number of edges is at least 2 times the number of bad edges.|$|E
25|$|New in 1971 were tubular {{landing gear}} legs with a 16% greater width (6feet 6inches (1.98m) to 7feet 7inches (2.31m) for better ground handling.

Also in 1971, the landing and taxi lights were {{moved from the}} wing leading <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nose bowl to better illuminate the ground.
