50|$|Since 1997, Konami has {{released}} many different series of music games under the Bemani brand. Each series {{has a unique}} way of playing the game and detaches players from the typical <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>controller</b> of modern game systems by using their whole body to control the game. Dance Dance Revolution lets players dance with their feet, Beatmania gives players a DJ style mixing board complete with turntable, ParaParaParadise is controlled with the players hands and arm by setting off motion sensors during the dance routine, and GuitarFreaks & DrumMania let players use simplified instruments to create music. Below are the Bemani series of video games in no particular order.|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of the UAV pirating system with the SilenTrack video tracking system will allow the combined system to automatically identify and track a suspicious air vehicle visually as well as identify and decode the RF control signal. Once a threat has been identified, the system will execute an algorithm to associate each control channel with the corresponding flight control surface. Once the control channels have been decoded the user can use a <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> radio <b>controller</b> to maneuver the drone which is now under their command...|$|R
40|$|An implantable {{automatic}} defibrillator includes sensors {{which are}} placed {{on or near the}} patient's heart to detect electrical signals indicative of the physiology of the heart. The signals are digitally converted and stored into a FIFO region of a RAM by operation of a direct memory access (DMA) controller. The DMA controller operates transparently with respect to the microprocessor {{which is part of the}} defibrillator. The implantable defibrillator includes a telemetry communications circuit for sending data outbound from the defibrillator to an external device (either a patient controller or a physician's console or other) and a receiver for sensing at least an externally generated patient ECG recording command signal. The patient recording command signal is generated by the <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> patient <b>controller.</b> Upon detection of the patient ECG recording command, DMA copies the contents of the FIFO into a specific region of the RAM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{handheld}} {{computers in}} medicine {{has increased in}} the last decade, they are now used {{in a variety of}} clinical settings. There is an underlying assumption that electronic data capture is more accurate that paper-based data methods have been rarely tested. This report documents a study to compare the accuracy of <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer data capture versus more traditional paper-based methods. Methods Clinical nurses involved in a randomised controlled trial collected patient information on a <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer in parallel with a paper-based data form. Both sets of data were entered into an access database and the <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer data compared to the paper-based data for discrepancies. Results Error rates from the handheld computers were 67. 5 error per 1000 fields, compared to the accepted error rate of 10 per 10, 000 field for paper-based double data entry. Error rates were highest in field containing a default value. Conclusion While popular with staff, unacceptable high error rates occurred with <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computers. Training and ongoing monitoring are needed if <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computers are to be used for clinical data collection. </p...|$|R
