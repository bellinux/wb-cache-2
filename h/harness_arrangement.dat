5000|$|In early 1976, Brian Gaskin designed, created, {{and tested}} the first 16-gore canopy design which he named [...] "Waterbird". The Waterbird was revolutionary in its canopy design, its unique tow yoke <b>harness</b> <b>arrangement,</b> its construction, {{and the use}} of zero {{porosity}} fabrics which allowed it to be used over water safely. The majority of commercial parasail operators then moved to the 16-gore canopy arrangement. In 1976 Gaskin founded his company, Waterbird Parakites, which is still in operation today, producing commercial and recreational 16-gore parasails.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first known}} hospital-based {{ambulance}} service was based out of Commercial Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, (now the Cincinnati General) by 1865. This was soon followed by other services, notably the New York service provided out of Bellevue Hospital. Edward Dalton, a former surgeon in the Union Army, {{was charged with}} creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, morphine, and brandy, reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: {{within a few months}} this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' <b>harness</b> <b>arrangement,</b> whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30 seconds of being called. The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392. For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes. [...] This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.|$|E

5000|$|A {{common form}} of armbinder {{consists}} of a sheath, roughly conical, that encloses both of the wearer's arms from fingertips to above the elbow, holding them together behind the back, combined with one of various <b>harness</b> (straps) <b>arrangements</b> {{to hold it in}} place. The sheath is commonly of latex or leather which itself typically covers the arms from the fingertips to above the elbows, and is closed and tightened with a zipper, lacing, or sometimes both; the sheath is frequently supplemented with straps around the wrists and the elbows or upper arms. The sheath alone is ineffective without a harness to keep it from slipping down the arms; the most common harness is a pair of straps that join to the outer top of the sheath, run over the shoulders and under the armpits, and join again at the inner top of the sheath. The straps are usually crossed, behind the neck or across the upper chest, to prevent the straps from slipping off the shoulders. The latter position can cause problems if the straps tend to ride up and press on the wearer's throat. Left strap is brought from under left armpit, brought over right shoulder and then buckled up behind the neck [...] same is done with right strap and then both right and left strap are buckled together to prevent falling of armbinder. Due to this armbinder, elbows are kept in touch with {{each other for a long}} time which can cause injury if kept for a very long time.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} {{nihilism}} offers fertile avenues {{for exploring the}} antinomies of classical liberalism. In its instantiation as violence, nihilism challenges classical liberalism and its recognised political settlement, notably received <b>arrangements</b> <b>harnessed</b> to cultivate uncontrolled passions or religious fervour. In its affinity to Islam, nihilism defies the secular settlement through its appeals to transcendence. By seeking legitimacy in the sacred, nihilism disrupts established boundaries between the religious and the secular. Nihilism exposes the difficulty of forging worlds of transcendence on the modern register of immanence. Transcendence affords the possibility of escape, immanence closure. The two can be reversed in politics, as the experience in several Islamic Cultural Zones (ICZs) suggests. Appeals to transcendence seek to reorganise the social world {{in the name of}} escaping it. Immanence, on the other hand, can rework notions of redemption and salvation into secular stories of progress. This paper explores how the presumed nihilistic tendency appearing in the ICZs destabilises the liberal settlement, not in the conventional sense of presenting a religious counterpoint, but in reworking religious themes into secularity. Nihilism illustrates both the contradictory character of modernity and modernity's potential to generate varied societal projects, including those informed by the sacred. The recognition that modernity can spawn discordant impulses in reconciling religion and politics helps rethink post-secular lives under the long shadow of disenchantment. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Keywords:CAN bus; {{electric}} vehicle; J 1939 protocol; network topology; transmision length Abstract. Controller {{area network}} (CAN) {{is one of}} the popular networks with the international standard, and adopted mostly on the vehicle. SAE J 1939 is designed to allow electronic devices from different vendors {{to communicate with each other}} through a standard architecture. CAN communication length have some relationship with CAN bus rate, which may influence the rate choice and network topology. We design a CAN network with distributed control systems for a pure electric vehicle. The identification bit implementation of data for vehicle controllers is present in accordance with J 1939 protocol. The vehicle network topology is considered based on controlling functions and CAN bus <b>harness</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The communication process for them is given based on CANoe platform and finally tested in real electric vehicle environment...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidic {{techniques}} herald {{the arrival}} of a new era in biomedical experimentation, where new and more powerful screens will be possible. Droplet-based microfluidics constitute a particularly relevant example of this possibility. These compartments can be rapidly generated with volumes as small as just a few femtoliters. This has two major implications: fare more experiments can be carried out with limited amounts of sample and the screening of analytes at the single unit level (either cells or molecules) is possible with increased ease. Still many hurdles need to be overcome to fulfill the full potential of these techniques. To highlight some of our current efforts towards increasing the applicability of droplet-based microfluidics for high throughput screening applications, I will present the following ongoing studies: 1. - <b>Harnessing</b> the <b>arrangement</b> of particles (or cells) with the use of inertial effects: here I will show how the effects of confinement and inertia lead to a diversity of particle-particle interactions, some of which are instrumental in obtaining a robust spacial ordering (pseudo-crystalline structure) of particles enabling controlled droplet encapsulation. 2. - Understanding the physicochemical properties of droplets: effective compartmentalization of analytes in droplets is a non-trivial problem which I will discuss presenting strategies to ameliorate cross-talk between droplets. 3. - Identifying individual droplets: in order to trace back in time events in individual droplets I will showcase our current efforts towards establishing an effective protocol for the barcoding of individual droplets. 4. - Building large droplet libraries: producing droplets with a combination of a small number of analytes/reagents (at different concentrations) is a simple task. But achieving the degree of variability obtainable with liquid handling techniques is not. Here I will present our current efforts to build a hybrid strategy to produce droplet libraries from multiwell plates with the aim to couple liquid handling instrumentation with droplet-based assays. 5. - Enabling biomembrane-bound screens: many biological processes of medical interest occur within the confines of biological membranes. Here I will show a droplet-based method that can empower the study/screening of such processes. 6. - Finally I will present some of our current efforts to apply droplet-based techniques towards improved antibody screens and to develop novel autologous cell therapies...|$|R
40|$|Rivers provide {{water for}} irrigation, {{domestic}} supply, power generation and industry {{as well as}} a range of other ecosystem services and intrinsic and biodiversity values. Managing rivers to provide multiple benefits is therefore foundational to water security and other policy priorities. Because river flow is often insufficient to meet all needs fully, water management experts have acknowledged the need for trade-offs in river management. Ecosystem scientists have classified and quantified goods and services that rivers provide to society. However, they have seldom examined the way in which water management infrastructure and institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>harness</b> and direct goods and services to different groups in society. Meanwhile, water management paradigms have often considered freshwater ecosystems as rival water users to society or a source of natural hazards and have underplayed the role healthy ecosystems play in providing multiple social and economic benefits. We argue that physical and social structures and processes are necessary to realize multiple benefits from river ecosystems, and that these structures and processes, in the form of (formal and informal) institutions and (gray and green) infrastructure, shape how benefits accrue to different groups in society. We contend that institutions and infrastructure are in turn shaped by political economy. We suggest a more coherent framework for river management research, policy and planning that focuses on (a) the ways in which political economy, institutions and infrastructure mediate access and entitlements to benefits derived from ecosystem services, and (b) the feedbacks and trade-offs between investments in physical and social structures and processes...|$|R
40|$|ICRAF and the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MOARD) are {{implementing}} a project on “Improved Land Management in the Lake Victoria Basin. ” The project began in 1999 – 2000 with a one-year startup year of activities under the Sida-sponsored National Soil and Water Conservation Programme (NSWCP). The collaborative project of ICRAF and MOARD {{has now been}} continued for another three years under the National Agriculture and Livestock Extension Programme (NALEP). This paper summarizes achievements and findings for the project for the year 2000 / 2001. The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) supports “Improved Land Management in the Lake Victoria Basin” through NALEP. Additional financial support for the activities reported herein was also provided by the Rockefeller Foundation, ICRAF core funds, Danida, the University of Florida and the USAID. Research conducted during 2000 / 2001 addressed {{a range of issues}} across a large tract of Western Kenya. A coarse resolution assessment of soil erosion risk conducted for the entire Lake Victoria Basin identified the Nzoia / Yala and Kagera river basins as those with the greatest percentage of land at risk. Biophysical research on land management problem domains has quantified the widespread spatial extent of soil physical and chemical degradation in the Nyando river basin and illustrated four contrasting biophysical problem domains within the basin. District-level data on population density, poverty and agricultural production available from secondary sources have been complemented with baseline household and community survey data collected in 9 villages around the Nyando river basin. The overall picture that is emerging is that while much of the Nyando river basin has experienced some physical and chemical land degradation, there are pockets of severe poverty, severe environmental degradation and extremely low agricultural production. Different approaches to extension, investment and policy may be needed to address poverty – environment – agricultural problems {{in different parts of the}} river basin. Reversing trends in environmental deterioration will require interventions on farmers fields and in the many areas between farms that publicly-used, although usually privately-owned. Farmers have demonstrated their willingness to adopt recommended conservation practices on their individual family fields, but the intensity of adoption depends upon the potential returns to investments, their cultural grouping, and the approach that extension providers take to the provision of information and mobilization of community participation. Adoption of improved practices and investments on publicly-used areas between farms requires the mobilization of collective action among small, medium and large groups. Collective action in the Nyando River basin is most likely to be effective where it <b>harnesses</b> local institutional <b>arrangements</b> (e. g. sub-clan affiliations among the Luo) and advances common interests in the provision of high quality water and the generation of additional cash income. Among other opportunities, there appears to be good prospects for market-oriented agroforestry for production of fruit, fuelwood and timber. Changes in local and national policies would help to ensure good returns for smallholder farmers. This report begins with a presentation of a number of major findings, implications of those findings for extension and investment and implications for policy. A summary of progress by activity is then presented, followed by lists of personnel involved, presentations and publications. An annex presents detailed accomplishments by activity...|$|R
