40|$|Machinability {{studies of}} silicon carbide {{reinforced}} aluminum alloy (Al/SiC) composites have attracted widespread scientific and public attention. The metal matrix composites (MMCs) {{are difficult to}} machine, since the matrix and reinforcement possess widely different properties and the cutting tool alternately encounters matrix and reinforcement, demanding higher wear resistance coupled with fracture toughness, owing to the hard SiC reinforcement embedded in the soft ductile aluminum matrix. In the present study, fine grooving of Al / SiCp composite using standard <b>dressing</b> <b>diamond</b> has been carried out. The processing has been characterized in terms of force components and acoustic emission (AE) emanating from the workpiece. The force components were measured using a standard piezoelectric type dynamometer and acoustic emission from the workpiece was monitored using standard broad-band AE sensor. The monitored AE signal was evaluated in frequency domain (power spectra) and rms values of the emitted signal. From the observations, it is concluded that lower grooving speeds, medium table feeds and medium grooving depths are preferred for grooving of Al / SiC MMC’s...|$|E

In order to machine the 300 mm~ 400 mm silicon wafer to the specified surface roughness and flatness, precision ELID (electrolytic in-process <b>dressing)</b> <b>diamond</b> grinding and CMP (chemical-mechanical polishing) were employed in this study to replace the conventional grinding, etching and polishing routine. Various machining conditions such as wheel grain size, spindle speed, feedrate, ELID conditions and CMP parameters were studied in the present research. The ELID-ground and CMPed specimens were subsequently examined using OM, SEM and AFM {{to ensure the quality}} of surface. Sub-surface damage layer of the machined surface was also investigated using high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and chemical etching techniques. It was found that sub-surface cracks generated by diamond grinding process could in some cases penetrate up to 20 mm deep into the surface. Although the subsequent CMP process could improve the surface roughness to a Ra of 1 nm, sub-surface cracks could be revealed by chemical etching if it were not fully removed.

40|$|Abstract — A new {{development}} of hybrid in-process electrical <b>dressing</b> of metal-bonded <b>diamond</b> grinding wheels is proposed in this paper. The electrical dressing method {{is used for}} overcoming {{the limitations of the}} conventional dressing methods available in relation to a super-abrasive wheel because of the hardness of its abrasive grains and the durability of its bonding material. The proposed hybrid in-process electrical dressing method consists of electro-discharge and electro-chemical processes and is implemented with twin copper electrodes and alternating power supplies. The results show that with properly maintained process conditions, a better surface finish is produced by the proposed method compared with traditional rotating SiC wheel dressing. Index Terms — Electro-chemical, electro-discharge, inprocess <b>dressing,</b> metal-bonded <b>diamond</b> grinding wheel. eliminates the need for a carbon brush as a means to deliver the current to the wheel during a dressing process. A combination of electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressing has been developed by Schopf et al. [2] and Ohmori et al. [3]. It suggested that the electro-chemical dressing is assisted by the thermal erosive effect of electrical discharge. The application is implemented for centreless grinding with single electrode supplied with a DC power supply via a pair of brushes. A further improvement is proposed here. The use of twin electrodes [4] and in-process dressing using AC power supplies are implemented. This approach allows electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressings to be performed individually as required, rather than conducted alternating on single electrode. The gap could be set differently according to the requirement of each process. I...|$|R

Understanding the process of generating the grinding wheel surface is important for the control of the grinding process. Generation of the wheel surface is simulated as a single <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> process on a computer generated wheel. The wheel is simulated by grains randomly spaced in the wheel volume. The topography of the wheel cutting surface is generated by simulating the action of an ideal dressing tool as it dresses the wheel. The simulation of the wheel topography takes account of the motion of the dressing tool, grain size, grain spacing, grain fracture and grain break-out. The simulated cutting surface is used for further simulations of grinding. The simulation of grinding using the simulated grinding wheel surface is described in Sections 2 and 3 where a comparison is made of results predicted from simulation with results obtained from experiments. By matching simulated and experimental results, it is possible to explain the relative importance of dressing and grinding parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Diamond {{grinding}} wheel {{is used in}} high precision grinding process, when work piece has a very high hardness. For a specific grinding interval, the wheel must be properly dressed, in order to remove swarf, sharpen the worn diamond grits, open up new diamond protrusions, and recondition the bond material. <b>Dressing</b> of <b>diamond</b> {{grinding wheel}} by alumina dressing tool has been simulated in a pin-on-disk machine in the research. Sharpening of the wheel is indicated by the increase of its roughness value, and surface microstructure with protruding sharp diamond grits. It was found that increasing of sliding distant from 100 to 500 m will increase the roughness of the wheel. The increase of contact load from 10 to 20 N will also increase roughness of the wheel, and the severity of wheel wear, indicated by high values of friction coefficient. A proper dressing of this nickel bonded SD 1200 diamond wheel is by sliding against alumina dressing tool for at least 300 m under 10 N load. Sliding velocity between 0. 1 to 0. 3 m/s has minimal effect to the results. A too large sliding distant and load will cause severe damage to wheel surface, and severe wheel wear, indicated by its large mass loss...|$|R
40|$|The most {{effective}} method for finish machining of hard-metals and alloys {{is to use}} the diamond grinding wheels for grinding. An application of diamond wheels significantly increases the employee output, reduces costs, and raises manufacturing efficiency with achieving the high performance properties of treated surfaces. During grinding a working surface of diamond wheel wears out. It adversely affects the cutting capability of the diamond grains, and depending on the grinding conditions can occur through different mechanisms. Wear of diamond wheel causes distortion of its shape and reduces cutting properties. However, <b>dressing</b> of <b>diamond</b> wheels is a complicated and time-consuming operation in terms of manufacturing technique. Methods to make <b>dressing</b> of <b>diamond</b> grinding wheel have different types of classification. Classification of dressing methods by the type of energy used is as follows: mechanical, chemical, electrophysical, electromechanical, and electrochemical. All these methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Electrochemical method of dressing is the most productive and efficient. Electrochemical method comprises anode-mechanical dressing and electrochemical (electrolytic) one. The paper presents the electrochemical in-process dressing (ECD) and the electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID). The source of energy, grinding a wheel with metal bond, and an electrode are necessary for providing ELID. The ELID consists of several stages. The first stage is preliminary electrolytic <b>dressing</b> of <b>diamond</b> wheel. The electrolyte is placed into the gap between the wheel and electrode. The bond of the wheel is oxidized. An insulating layer is formed. It reduces an electrical conductivity of the wheel and controls consumption of diamond grains, as well as polishes the surface of the work piece. Further, the insulating layer is destroyed. The cycle of dressing begins anew. The ECD proceeds {{in the same way as}} ELID. However during the ECD-process there is no insulating layer formed. The oxides are washed out by electrolyte flow. The method provides a constant escape of abrasive grain. The grain escape reaches 100 - 120 % of average diameter. Adaptation of ECD on conventional grinding machine is performed. For this, the copper electrode is mounted to the grinding wheel. The electrolyte circulates in the gap between the wheel and electrode. The control system for the normal and tangential forces of process is also used during the adaptation. The enterprise VNIIINSTRUMENT has designed a special experimental stand for diamond grinding. At this stand the ECD-dressing of diamond wheel with metal bond is implemented. This machine consists of a longitudinal support and a cross slide. Spindle of grinding wheel is set on the longitudinal support. A rotating speed of this spindle is about 50 - 3000 rev/min. A spindle of work piece is set on the cross slide. A rotating speed of this spindle is about 10 - 1000 rev/min. The copper electrode is mounted on the spindle of grinding wheel. An area of electrode surface is 1 / 3 of the wheel area. The gap between the grinding wheel and electrode is about 0. 3 mm. The electrolyte is placed in the gap. The electrode is anode and the grinding wheel is cathode. Wheel and electrode are connected to the direct current source. When switching on the power source, the process of electrolysis begins. A bond of the wheel is oxidized and washed out. Waste of dressing is carried away with electrolyte. The electrolyte leaves the zone of cutting. Next, the liquid gets into a special trough. Thereafter, the electrolyte enters the filter unit to have three steps of purification. The purified liquid is supplied to the pump, and then again enters the cutting zone. ECD provides a large escape abrasive grain out of bond. It ensures that the cutting force is constant. The constant cutting force ensures the surface finish consistency, decreased surface roughness, and improved accuracy of work piece form. Due to ECD, space for chips is formed between diamond grains. This allows the grinding wheel to avoid loading. The stand solves the problem of electrolyte purification. This helps to avoid burn marks and defects during grinding. A maximum efficiency of process may be achieved by adjusting the modes of wheel dressing. The ECD allows the use of nontraditional methods of grinding, including ductile mode grinding. However, for this it is necessary to apply the special kinematic scheme of grinding. </p...|$|R
