40|$|This paper, {{which follows}} {{those on the}} design for {{durability}} with prescriptive and performance-based approaches, focuses {{on the importance of}} the practical implementation of the design choices aimed at the durability of a reinforced concrete structure. First of all, it shows how the design phase should address durability issues under different aspects (in addition to those already analyzed in the previous papers of this focus). On the one hand it is important to select construction details that lead to the formation of micro-climates that do not promote degradation, but instead make the structure less susceptible to the action of aggressive agents. On the other hand, it also reminds the role of concrete technology and the possibilities it offers both by using ordinary materials and special concretes. Then it stresses the importance of formulating clear design requirements on the materials, construction details and techniques of quality control. The placement and curing of concrete are the times when the design choices are put in practice through a series of quality controls which should be successful in ensuring the fulfilment of design requirements. Finally, the role of planned <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> as <b>tools</b> for durability, especially for those structures exposed to aggressive environments, is stressed. A systematic control of the structure during its service life allows a constant update of the initial design decisions, by reformulating predictions on the service life, and thus anticipate any corrective action that might be necessary, with significant savings on future maintenance cost...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a variety}} of factors that can {{influence}} the performance of plant assets. These include the design and the operating mode, {{but one of the most}} influential factors is the effectiveness of maintenance programmes. Best practice operators generally spend less on maintenance but still avail of good operational performance. The first step in any improvement program is to benchmark the current status of the plant in terms of its operation <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> process effectiveness. Once this has been established, programmes can be developed to address any skills or procedural deficiencies. This is followed by an assessment of plant condition related risks to safety and availability. Two distinct phases are thus involved in an Asset Maintenance Optimisation System (AMOS). The first phase is a performance benchmarking exercise and management processes review involving historical performance relative to industry norms and integrity management programme and programme implementation audits. The second phase involves comprehensive plant-wide implementation of risk-based <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> (RBI) planning <b>tools</b> which output risks, safe run lengths <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> plans at equipment level. The study describes the processes involved in Phase 1 and Phase 2. Examples of implementation are illustrated using TWI&# 146;s RISKWISE software for process units, utilities plant and pipelines...|$|R
40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval optimization for a processing {{facility is}} proposed. Often <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval estimation modeling {{is available in}} the concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> interval for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally failure caused by wear or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> strategy...|$|R
