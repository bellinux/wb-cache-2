40|$|Background and Aims : According to {{the common}} {{application}} of non-metal prefabricated posts in dentistry and lack of enough information about the stress distribution in the root canal walls by these posts, this study was performed to compare the effect of two simple <b>taper</b> and <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> posts on the stress distribution on root canal walls by photo elastic method.   Materials and Methods: The design {{of this study was}} experimental in photoelastic system. The posts, used in this investigation, were <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> and simple taper fiber posts with 0. 9 mm diameter and 20 mm length and epoxy resin. First two photo elastic models with tooth dimensions were fabricated and the posts were placed inside the model. Then the core of the each post was fabricated on the model. Each models were loaded in polariscope and the formed fringe order colored ring were photographed.   Results: In 100 N, 90 degree angle loading in cervical and apical fringe order showed 2. 50 and 1. 39 in simple taper posts and 1. 39 and 2. 35 in <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> post. In 150 N, 30 degree angle loading in cervical and apical fringe order showed 4 and 2. 65 in simple taper posts, and 4 and 2. 5 in <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> post.   Conclusion: In the vertical and oblique loads, <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> fiber post showed better stress distribution than that of simple tapered posts...|$|R

40|$|Background: With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} methods that could increase the fracture resistance of structurally compromised endodontically treated teeth, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the effect of three esthetic post systems on the fracture resistance and failure modes of structurally compromised and normal roots. Materials and Methods: Forty five extracted and endodontically treated maxillary central teeth were assigned to 5 experimental groups (n= 9). In two groups, the post spaces were prepared with the corresponding drills of the post systems to be restored with <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> light posts (DT. Light-Post) (group DT. N) and zirconia posts (Cosmopost) (group Zr. N). In other 3 groups thin wall canals were simulated to be restored with <b>Double</b> <b>taper</b> Light posts (DT. W), <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> Light posts and Ribbond fibers (DT+R. W) and Zirconia posts (Zr. W). After access cavity restoration and thermocycling, compressive load was applied and the fracture strength values and failure modes were evaluated. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Tukey and Fisher exact tests (P< 0. 05). Results: The mean failure loads (N) were 678. 56, 638. 22, 732. 44, 603. 44 and 573. 67 for groups DT. N, Zr. N, DT. W, DT+R. W and Zr. w respectively. Group DT+R. W exhibited significantly higher resistance to fracture compared to groups Zr. N, DT. W and Zr. w (P< 0. 05). A significant difference was detected between groups DT. N and Zr. W (P= 0. 027). Zirconia posts showed significantly higher root fracture compared to fiber posts (P= 0. 004). Conclusion: The structurally compromised teeth restored with <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> light posts and Ribbond fibers showed the most fracture resistance and their strengths were comparable to those of normal roots restored with <b>double</b> <b>taper</b> light posts.
