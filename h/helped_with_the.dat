5|$|At 1045 hrs a short service began {{unveiling}} the plaque, verses {{were read}} {{and the names}} of those killed and injured were read out. Wreaths were laid on behalf of The Veterans Charity and the 1st Iver Heath Scouts who had <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> research as their leader is a former RAF Police dog handler. After the event a local resident and former RAF member offered to create a more permanent memorial featuring the names of those lost and details of the incident.|$|E
5|$|Before and After Science is {{the fifth}} studio album by British {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it was originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and jagged to more languid and pastoral.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the Scare, {{filmed in}} a North London school, {{consists}} of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers {{to listen to}} the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote child protection projects in schools. Although Harris appears in Beyond the Scare, his role is less prominent than in Kids Can Say No! and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their first}} {{loss of the}} season, the All-Americans {{challenged}} the Cleveland Tigers. The owner of the Tigers, Jimmy O'Donnell, <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> foundation of the APFA. A total of 5,000 fans showed up to the game. The only score of the game came in the third quarter. Anderson scored an 8-yard rushing touchdown. This loss for the Tigers would be their {{final game of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 to 2013, XV was {{developed}} by what was then Square Enix 1st Production Department. In the wake of extensive business restructuring in 2013, development of XV transferred to the newly formed Business Division 2, headed by Tabata and incorporating the core Final Fantasy development team. Along with bringing in staff members from other sections of the company, they also recruited help from other development studios: HexaDrive {{was brought in to}} help with engineering the game, XPEC Entertainment <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design for the later sections of the game, Shanghai company Plusmile <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design of buildings, licensed middleware from Umbra was used to boost the game's graphics, while Streamline Studios was brought in to help with technical development. It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to help create the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to developing a}} suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had {{to assist in the}} design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Osbert {{was opposed}} to the {{election}} of William fitzHerbert as Archbishop of York and supported William's rival and successor Henry Murdac. Although he remained a supporter of Murdac after 1147, he did oppose Murdac's interventions in Selby Abbey, where Murdac had deposed one abbot and appointed another. In 1153, Osbert deposed Murdac's choice as abbot of Selby and appointed another abbot. Originally, Osbert had supported Elias Paynel, Murdac's choice for abbot, but then changed his stance and <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deposition.|$|E
5|$|Roger did {{not like}} monks, and William of Newburgh said that he often {{referred}} to the foundation of Fountains Abbey as the worst mistake of Archbishop Thurstan's episcopate. Roger also was accused of avarice, and of making unworthy clerical appointments. However, he also started the rebuilding of York Minster, which had been damaged by fire in 1137, and <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> building of a church at Ripon. He also endowed the school at York with an annual income of 100 shillings.|$|E

5|$|Schweitzer {{had prior}} {{interest}} in nursing {{and the medical}} field before Albert became involved in medicine. Therefore, Schweitzer played {{a vital role in}} his work, acting as a possible influence. In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hospital. She played an essential part in sanitation efforts, especially by preparing medical equipment for surgery. Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations.|$|E
5|$|To {{fund the}} new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an {{investment}} from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and {{scientist at the}} lab were interested in this {{state of the art}} calculator kit and <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual in return for a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|Walter also <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are {{the first signs of}} a professional judiciary.|$|E

5|$|After {{confirming}} {{the development of}} a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert for coastal regions on September14. The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country. National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages to the public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones. A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September15, extending south from Puerto Cabezas to the adjacent islands. In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival. Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico were placed under a tropical storm warning on September17 until Gert's landfall the next day.|$|E
5|$|Burnell {{was behind}} {{the efforts of the}} royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the Quo warranto procedures. He also <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland <b>helped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
