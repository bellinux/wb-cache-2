In <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> the increases in circulating total thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were accompanied by an increase in the thyroid hormone uptake test. These changes may reflect a quantitative increase in thyroxine binding globulin. Reverse triidothyronine concentrations in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> were normal. The thyrotrophin-releasing hormone elicited a diminished thyrotrophin response in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> which was significantly different from that in control subjects and ex-addicts. An elevation of serum prolactin was noted in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts,</b> while ex-addicts had normal levels.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare HCV and HIV {{infection}} among <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in MMT {{and not in}} MMT in {{two large}} cities in central China. METHODS: A total of 541 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> were recruited from MMT clinics and voluntary detoxification centers in Changsha and Wuhan, China. Structured questionnaires collected data on their socio-demographics, clinical status, risk behaviors, and their knowledge of HIV. Their HIV serostatus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus were determined by testing antibodies in blood serum. RESULTS: We observed a higher prevalence of HCV infection among MMT <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> (82. 3 %) than that in the non-MMT group (50. 6 %). However, our findings indicated that the <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in MMT had less drug or sexual HIV/HCV risk behaviors and more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT <b>addicts.</b> The <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in MMT had a significantly higher percentage of individuals who always used condoms (44. 9 %) compared with patients in the non-MMT group (14. 6 %, p = 0. 039), and they had more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT individuals (p<. 001). The percentage of HIV-positive addicts in the MMT group (0. 7 %) and non-MMT group (0. 8 %) were almost same. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated {{that the rate of}} HCV infection among <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> among MMT or non-MMT settings in central China is very high. The non-MMT <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> have higher risk of becoming infected with HCV in the future, while at present they have lower rates of HCV infection than MMT <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> Although rates of HIV infection among MMT and non-MMT <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> are low now, they are all at great risk of becoming infected with HIV in the future, especially for non-MMT <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> We should use the MMT sites as a platform to improve the control of HCV and HIV infection in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> given Jitai tablet treatment during abstinence. Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Settings/Location: Drug Rehabilitation Bureau of Shanghai Police, China. Participants: 99 volunteers, including 69 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and 30 healthy volunteers. Interventions: 69 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> randomly divided into two groups: the Jitai tablet group, which comprised 34 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> given Jitai tablet treatment during abstinence, and the placebo group, which comprised 35 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> given placebo. A control group consisted of 30 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. Outcome Measures: ACTH and cortisol in plasma were measured in all groups at baseline and in the Jitai tablet and placebo groups on the third, seventh, and 14 th days of abstinence. Results: Levels of both ACTH (p <. 01) and cortisol (p <. 001) were significantly higher in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> at baseline than in the healthy volunteers. Jitai tablet treatment restored plasma cortisol levels to normal more rapidly than did placebo treatment (p <. 05), but not ACTH levels. A positive correlation between ACTH and cortisol values at baseline (p <. 01) was also found with withdrawal symptom scores and daily dosages of <b>heroin.</b> Conclusions: <b>Heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> could respond to Jitai tablets through changes in the hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal axis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Cryoglobulins {{are single}} or mixed {{immunoglobulins}} that {{are subject to}} reversible precipitation at low temperatures. Objective. The aims of this paper were: 1. Comparison of cryoglobulin positive (CP), cryoglobulin negative (CN) <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and the control group (CG) in terms of serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM and complement components C 3 and C 4; 2. Comparison of CP and CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in terms of rheumatoid factor (RF) and circulating immune complexes (CIC); 3. Assessment of clinical manifestations in CP <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> Methods. This is a comparative study of cases (outpatients) treated at the University Clinic of Toxicology in Skopje over 3. 5 years, from January 2009 to June 2012. In this study 140 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> without HbsAg were examined, seronegative for HCV and HIV infections. They were divided into 2 groups: 70 CP and 70 CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> A previously designed self-administered questionnaire {{was used as a}} data source on participants. All <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> underwent the following analyses: urea and creatinine in serum; creatinine in urine; proteinuria; 24 -hour proteinuria; IgM, IgG, IgA, C 3, C 4; RF; CIC; creatinine clearance; ECG; toxicological analyses for opioids in a urine sample; cryoglobulins. In addition to these 2 groups, IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3 and C 4 were also examined in 70 healthy subjects (CG). Results. The study showed that there was no statistically significant difference between CP, CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and CG regarding the concentration of IgA, IgG, IgM, C 3 and C 4, and between CP and CN regarding the concentration of CIC. There was significant difference between CP and CN regarding the concentration of RF. The following conditions were significantly more frequently manifested in CP than in CN heroin addicts: arthralgia, Raynaud’s phenomenon, respiratory difficulties, neurological disorders, manifested skin changes, hematuria, 24 -hour proteinuria levels, and decreased renal clearance. Conclusion. There were no differences in concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3, C 4 and CIC, while there was a difference in concentration of RF between CP and CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> Clinical manifestations (arthralgias, Raynaud’s phenomenon, respiratory, neurologic, renal disorders and skin changes) were more common in CP <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts...</b>|$|R

5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a <b>heroin</b> <b>addict</b> whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E

40|$|Although {{in several}} {{countries}} <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> {{have been found to}} engage in illicit use of methadone, no studies have been addressed to this behavior in Italy. The present study gives evidence that methadone dispensed by public health services in Rome is paralleled by a black market in this drug. Of sixty-five <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> hospitalized for medical or surgical problems, the majority (89. 2 %) referred to the existence of an illicit methadone market in Rome, and 38 % used it. When asked why they bought illicit methadone the addicts stated that the daily dose obtainable from public health services was inadequate. However this statement is in contrast with the evidence that the <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> using illicit methadone had highest daily doses similar to those of <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> not referring to the illicit methadone market. We wonder whether illicit use of methadone is influenced by the therapeutic benefit that addicts expect to obtain from methadone. These "expectations" may lead <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> to extend consumption of methadone to alleviate problems altogether unrelated to the withdrawal syndrome. If so, the illicit market in methadone may be sustained not by the drug's addictive properties but by its therapeutic effects...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impulsivity {{refers to}} a wide {{spectrum}} of actions characterized by quick and nonplanned reactions to external and internal stimuli, without taking into account the possible negative consequences for the individual or others, and decision-making is one of the biologically dissociated impulsive behaviors. Changes in impulsivity may be associated with norepinephrine. Various populations of drug addicts all performed impulsive decision making, which is a key risk factor in drug dependence and relapse. The present study investigated the effects of clonidine, which decreased norepinephrine release through presynaptic alpha- 2 receptor activation, on the impaired decision-making performance in abstinent <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Decision-making performance was assessed using the original version of Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Both <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and normal controls were randomly assigned to three groups receiving clonidine, 0, 75 µg or 150 µg orally under double blind conditions. Psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression and impulsivity, were rated on standardized scales. <b>Heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> reported higher scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and exhibited impaired decision-making on the IGT. A single high-dose of clonidine improved the decision-making performance in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest clonidine may have a potential therapeutic role in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> by improving the impaired impulsive decision-making. The current findings have important implications for behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting decision-making in heroin addiction...|$|R
