He further agreed with them that the market wage had to be sufficient to nurture community standards of virtue. His application of the concept differed from theirsn due to his recognition of the problems caused by social distance.

40|$|Based {{upon the}} thesis that public {{education}} represents a technology of human maturation essential to an advanced technological society, this study examines one controversial aspect of the teaching system: the public teacher labor contract. More specifically, this inquiry applies the social concept of the <b>just</b> <b>wage</b> to the contractual labor agreement in a specific public school district. ^ The financial settlement, which represents about two-thirds of such agreements, is often the most difficult aspect of these contract negotiations. Money and benefit issues can be highly charged with emotion, leading to bitter deadlocks and teacher strikes. Consequently, two key questions will be addressed: Can adjustments to the existing negotiating process obviate these disputes so detrimental to public education? Is the existing process influenced by a technological mind-set that subtly suppresses or enhances different views of fair compensation when citizens negotiate with public school teachers to educate their children? ^ Through contract analysis and document reviews, the study examines the essential factors determining a <b>just</b> <b>wage.</b> This contract analysis {{is based on a}} close study of the differences between two successive and recently negotiated teacher contracts. The analysis focuses on specific contract provisions when economic variables have been separated from other issues. Economic variables are the monetary rewards and collateral or fringe benefits that are direct or indirect forms of compensation included in a <b>just</b> <b>wage.</b> Documents that help to clarify the economic variables are official memoranda, letters, educational policies, and reports of contract negotiations published by the news media. ^ The most recent teacher contract is then assessed from three perspectives of fairness to determine how, why, and to what extent the public education system‚Äîas an advanced technology‚Äîpromotes or obstructs the determination of a <b>just</b> <b>wage.</b> Six ethical criteria for a <b>just</b> <b>wage</b> are applied to the assessment, which take into account teacher expectations, area standards of living, local labor supply, the community 2 ÃÜ 7 s financial ability to pay, and concern for the common good. ...|$|E

40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either social contributions or general taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, social contributions tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment ‚Äì unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for social contributions. Other funding bases like income taxes and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups ‚Äì and not <b>just</b> <b>wage</b> earners ‚Äì they may be less detrimental to employment than social contributions. The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the ‚Äúprogressivity ‚Äù of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between social contributions and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.

The basic information for a proper differentiation of wages is provided by analytical valuation of work. The article describes differentiation of wages and work on worker- and non-worker-jobs in an industrial enterprise against the back-ground of results of work valuation by means of "UMEWAP- 87 " method. Moreover, there are shown changes in the field of employees' grading and wages caused by the new system of employees' grading.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{comparing}} {{the views of}} the main economic stream (represented mainly by the neo-classical) with Catholic social teaching on the issue of just wages. In Catholic social teaching, this matter is explicitly analyzed in contrast to the neoclassical theory which omits it. For this reason, in order to compare views of those two different schools of thought, the work focuses on the relationship of normative and positivist science, the hidden assumptions of neoclassical theory that concern the individual and the concept of work, her understanding of justice with regard to distribution, and the theory of minimum wages. Further work analyzes the paradigms and principles of Catholic social teachings related to just wages, which are rooted in the teachings of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas. This study examines the compatibility and difference in the two schools of thought not only in respect to the issue of just wages, but also juxtaposes the roots of the various assumptions of both theories.
