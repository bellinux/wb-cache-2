40|$|The Vienna Doctoral Programme on Water Resource Systems (DK-WRS) is a {{programme}} {{that aims}} to educate students in interdisciplinary water science through cutting edge research at an international level. It is funded by the Austrian Science Fund and designed to run {{over a period of}} 12 yr during which 80 doctoral students are anticipated to graduate. This paper reports on our experiences of setting up and implementing the Programme. We identify three challenges: integrating the disciplines, maintaining depth in an interdisciplinary programme, and teaching subjects remote to each student's core expertise. To address these challenges we adopt a number of approaches. We use three levels of instruments to foster integration across the disciplines: joint groups (e. g. a <b>joint</b> <b>study</b> <b>programme),</b> joint science questions (e. g. developed in annual symposia), and joint study sites. To maintain depth we apply a system of quality control including regular feedback sessions, theses by journal publications and international study exchange. For simultaneously teaching students from civil and environmental engineering, biology, geology, chemistry, mathematics we use visually explicit teaching, learning by doing, extra mentoring and by cross relating associated subjects. Our initial assessment of the Programme shows some very positive outcomes. Joint science questions formed between students from various disciplines indicate integration is being achieved. The number of successful publications in top journals suggests that depth is maintained. Positive feedback from the students on the variety and clarity of the courses indicates the teaching strategy is working well. Our experiences have shown that implementing and running an interdisciplinary doctoral programme has its challenges and is demanding in terms of time and human resources but seeing interactions progress and watching people grow and develop their way of thinking in an interdisciplinary environment is a valuable reward...|$|E
40|$|The project aims to {{contribute}} to innovation and internationalisation of European HEIs by exploiting the full potential of ICT and Virtual Mobility and broadening the access to international learning experience to all European students. Its objectives are to:- Develop a Quality Assurance approach for VM- Develop institutional awareness of VM potential- Develop students' awareness on opportunities and concerns offered by ICT to develop intercultural study- Develop mutual support service for HEIs willing to pilot VM programmes- Test a set of mutual support services for HEIs- Integrate VM in institutional academic contexts- Enlarge the initial partnership to involve {{a significant number of}} HEIs and relevant HE associations/networksThe project organises and supports the convergence of the existing body of knowledge and expertise on VM towards a common initiative to help HEIs to identify and utilise the full potential of VM: the VM co-laboratory intends to support inter-cultural development of European curriculum components and to generalise the practice of cooperation, based on mutual trust and specialisation, aimed at excellence in European HE and, at the same time, broader equity and accessibility of <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> worldwide. The VMCOLAB project is primarily directed to HEI staff in charge of curriculum development, international relations and use of ICT to support teaching and learning; however the main final beneficiaries of the project are students, particularly those who could not access international study experiences. In the life-span of the project the target groups will be involved as direct contributors to the project development: in each HEI partner a project implementation team will be constituted, that will take part in the quality development/assurance design process, in the choice and development of <b>joint</b> <b>study</b> <b>programmes,</b> in the evaluation of outcomes and in the design of valorisation and exploitation strategies.

40|$|Introduction: joint {{international}} programmes stimulate {{staff and}} student mobility, provide <b>joint</b> <b>studies,</b> provide development of <b>joint</b> <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> of excellence, {{and open up}} new possibilities for cooperation between countries. Promotion and development of joint international programmes depend on effective quality assurance system which is high on the universities` priority list. ESG provide solid basis for the quality assurance system development at both institutional and programme levels. The problems of ESG interpretation in compliance with national legislative systems and education traditions in the countries participating in Bologna process are paid much attention to. Our emphases are on the practical aspects of ESG (2015 version) implementation. The article concentrates {{on one of the}} most acute problems facing Russian Higher Education Institutions in the field of development and promotion of joint international programs: the problem of setting up modern quality assurance systems compatible with those in European HEIs is closely correlating with the profile of the journal “Integration of Education”. The journal centers around the publications on the enhancement and dissemination of the best practices on integration of regional education in Russia and abroad. Materials and Methods: methodical and practical aspects of the implementation of the ESG provisions for international joint educational programs on the basis of the European approach to education quality are the materials of study. The descriptive method, analysis of documents about education quality, and synthesis were used as research methods. Results: the authors come up with concrete recommendations for the implementation of the ESG renewed version (2015) in Quality Assurance systems of joint international programmes. This approach enhances the practical value of ESG. Modern Quality Assurance system is one of the main prerequisites for the successful collaboration among higher Education Institutions worldwide. Discussion and Conclusions: the authors have identified and analyzed the key directions of ESG implementation in Quality Assurance system within joint international proggrames...|$|R

40|$|Being able to {{communicate}} is relatively indispensable in today’s world considering the increased people’s mobility, <b>joint</b> <b>study</b> <b>programmes,</b> and commercial networks. Pronunciation is a salient element of effective communication. However, due to different cultural backgrounds and native languages, non-native English speakers experience pronunciation difficulties. The conventional pronunciation teaching method of aural-oral approach has not achieved the expected outcomes, and it shapes the learners to be passive and dependent by mere duplicating the sounds of words without any explicit understanding to critically discern the sounds. Thus, this study investigates the contribution of mouth movements and digitised phonetic symbols on the learning of pronunciation among non-native English speakers with different psychological profiles. The Multimedia Pronunciation Learning Management System (MPLMS) designed and developed {{in this study is}} expected to address the issues by teaching pronunciation through the universally agreed system of phonetic symbols. A 3 x 3 x 2 quasi-experimental factorial design in a non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design is adopted in this study. The independent variables are the three modes of Multimedia Pronunciation Learning Management System (MPLMS) : Text + Sound + Mouth Movements (TSMM), Text + Sound + Phonetic Symbols (TSPS), and Text + Sound + Mouth Movements + Phonetic Symbols (TSMMPS). The moderator variables are visualiser/verbaliser, language anxiety and language aptitude. The dependent variable is pronunciation competence (as measured by the posttest mean scores). ANOVA is to be used to determine the significant differences of the pretest scores among the three groups. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) and Post hoc will be carried out to examine the main effects as well as interaction effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables. Simple and Multiple Regression Analysis will be used to determine the relative contribution of each factor to the changes in the dependent variable...|$|R
40|$|The main {{challenge}} facing internationalsation {{of higher education}} is retaining roots in a cultural setting while being open to new influences. Internationalsation affects every aspect of university life. An initial issue this raises is language. Universities must decide in which languages to teach and which languages will be offered, decisions that raise questions regarding graduation requirements. It would seem a logical step to require all students to study a foreign language. Introducing language requirements into the curriculum necessitates considerable and probably continual revision of <b>study</b> and degree <b>programmes.</b> However, to meet their challenges and realise their opportunities, universities {{will no longer be}} able to go it alone. Apart from staff and student mobility, distance education, and other forms of delivery, universities will need to work together.

40|$|Abstract ⎯ In {{this paper}} we present the MENU project. The major {{goal for the}} MENU project {{is to create a}} model for a European Networked (Virtual) University, {{offering}} a variety of e-learning opportunities. 11 partners in 7 European countries are joining forces to establish the model, based on experiences from previous, national and international, projects and activities at the partner institutions. The model will propose an organisational structure, a quality assurance system, examples of <b>joint</b> courses and <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> across institutional and national borders. A demonstrator will show practicar e-learning environments, applied to ICT-related studies. Partners in MENU will constitute the core of a future consortium, a permanent, sustainable ENU, offering courses and degree programmes across Europe. ICT will be extensively applied for administration, contact and information, leaming environment and virtual mobility of students and staff. Dissemination of findings will make the model and the consortium available to other institutions. MENU is coordinated from Norway, lead by Stord / Haugesund University College. Most of the partners have long experience from net based learning activities at university level, as well as from national and international collaboration. Some of the partners represent already existing networks of academic institutions, e. g. The Finnish Virtual University (FVU, 21 member institutions) and the Norwegian NetWorkUniversity (NVU, 9 institutions). The intention now is to combine and expand such networks into a European dimension, demonstrating its functionality for practical e-learning Index Terms ⎯ Online Degree Programs, Collaboration, e-learning, web platforms...|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} of the EQUASP model for quality assurance of <b>study</b> <b>programmes,</b> developed in framework of a TEMPUS project, is introduced. The introduction section contains brief information {{on the concept of}} quality and quality assurance of <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> along with the Tuning approach to the design of <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> and the standards and guidelines for quality assurance in the European Higher Education Area. The fourth section describes the EQUASP approach to quality assurance and pinpoints the necessary documentation for the quality assurance of <b>study</b> <b>programmes.</b> More specifically, the EQUASP standards for the quality assurance of <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> are defined, followed with the identification of the fundamental processes for a quality management of <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> together with the associated quality requirements and expected activities for their accomplishment. The information and data which <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> need to document in order to provide evidence {{of the quality of the}} educational service offered and therefore, to assure their quality, are established. The standards and guidelines constitute the ‘EQUASP Model’ for the quality assurance of <b>study</b> <b>programmes.</b> The fifth section introduces the EQUASP approach for monitoring of quality of <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> perceived by interested parties (students, graduates, employed graduates and employers).
