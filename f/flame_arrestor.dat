5000|$|Back-fire <b>Flame</b> <b>Arrestor</b> (Gasoline engines {{installed}} after April 25, 1940) ...|$|E
50|$|Additional {{accessories}} include: <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor,</b> a blank firing {{device for}} low-noise shooting (UPMS), {{various types of}} optical and night sights, and tactical lights. The rifle has a folding stock, which, along with the pistol grip and handguard, are made of impact resistant plastic.|$|E
50|$|Residential {{combustion}} {{water heaters}} manufactured since 2003 in the United States have been redesigned to resist ignition of flammable vapors and incorporate a thermal cutoff switch, per ANSI Z21.10.1. The first feature attempts to prevent vapors from flammable liquids and {{gases in the}} vicinity of the heater from being ignited and thus causing a house fire or explosion. The second feature prevents tank overheating due to unusual combustion conditions. These safety requirements were made in response to homeowners storing, or spilling, gasoline or other flammable liquids near their water heaters and causing fires. Since most of the new designs incorporate some type of <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> screen, they require monitoring to make sure they do not become clogged with lint or dust, reducing the availability of air for combustion. If the <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> becomes clogged, the thermal cutoff may act to shut down the heater.|$|E
50|$|Liquid seal <b>flame</b> <b>arrestors</b> are liquid {{barriers}} {{following the}} principle of a siphon where the liquid stops the entering deflagration and/or detonation and extinguishes the flame, they work by bubbling the gas through a non-flammable and ideally non-gas-absorbing liquid, which is typically water. They stop the flame by preventing it from reaching the submerged intake.|$|R
40|$|Understanding flame {{quenching}} {{for different}} conditions {{is necessary to}} develop safety devices like <b>flame</b> <b>arrestors.</b> In practical applications, {{the speed of a}} deflagration in the lab-fixed reference frame will be a strong function of the geometry through which the deflagration propagates. This study reports on the effect of the flame speed, at the entrance of a quenching section, on the quenching distance. A 2 D rectangular channel joining two main spherical vessels is considered for studying this effect. Two different velocity regimes are investigated and referred to as configurations A, and B. For configuration A, the velocity of the flame is 20 m/s, while it is about 100 m/s for configuration B. Methane-air stoichiometric mixtures at 1 bar and 298 K are used. Simultaneous dynamic pressure measurements along with schlieren imaging are used to analyze the quenching of the flame. Risk assessment of re-ignition is also reported and analyzed...|$|R
50|$|E85 ethanol {{is used in}} engines {{modified}} to accept higher concentrations of ethanol. In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to 85% ethanol, whereas {{in countries such as}} Brazil where the climate is typically warmer, FFV run on neat alcohol. There are a few major differences between FFVs and non-FFVs. One is the elimination of bare magnesium, aluminum, and rubber parts in the fuel system. Fuel injection control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to 34% more fuel (which in turn produces more power). Stainless steel fuel lines, sometimes lined with plastic, and stainless-steel fuel tanks in place of terne fuel tanks have been used. In some cases, FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity. For vehicles with in-tank-mounted fuel pumps, precautions to prevent arcing, as well as <b>flame</b> <b>arrestors</b> positioned in the tank's fill pipe, are sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|Maximum Experimental Safe Gap (MESG) is a {{standardized}} measurement of how easily a gas flame will {{pass through a}} narrow gap bordered by heat-absorbing metal. MESG is used to classify flammable gases for the design and/or selection of electrical equipment in hazardous areas, and <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> devices. The National Electric Code classifies Class I hazardous locations into different groups depending on the respective MESG's of gases in the area.|$|E
50|$|Backfires {{may also}} occur before the {{combustion}} chamber. One possible {{cause of this}} is timing. If the timing is too early, the spark plug fires before the intake valves close, causing the combustion to propagate into the intake manifold, further igniting the air-fuel mixture there; the resulting explosion then travels out of the carburetor and air filter. On many small marine engines, a screen is placed over the intake of the carburetor as a <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor,</b> to prevent these flames from escaping the intake and potentially igniting fuel or fuel vapors in the enclosed sump or bilge of the boat, causing a fire or explosion. Alternatively, the ignition timing may be late, {{in which case the}} combustion is not completed by the time the exhaust valves open, allowing the combustion to propagate into the exhaust system.|$|E
40|$|Bibliographic {{citations}} {{are presented}} {{to describe and}} define aircraft safety methods, equipment, and criteria. Some of the subjects discussed are: (1) fire and explosion suppression using whiffle balls, (2) ultraviolet flame detecting sensors, (3) evaluation of <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> materials for aircraft fuel systems, (4) crash fire prevention system for supersonic commercial aircraft, and (5) fire suppression for aerospace vehicles...|$|E
30|$|Depending on the design, and {{regardless}} {{of the amount of}} combustible material used, fire growth may be affected by {{the presence or absence of}} features such as gaps between major upholstered areas, armrests, tufting, welt cords, and open loop arms. As measured using Cal TB 133, a separated seat and back generally results in a lower HRR, because the back may not become involved in the fire ([Sundstr√∂m 1995]; [Grand et al. 1994]; [Damant & Nurbakhsh 1994]). Also, chairs with large gaps between the seat and the back are generally of a more functional design and contain less fuel. On the other hand, chairs with a separated seat and back provide a gap through which the flames from an intensely burning seat can readily reach the back support and accelerate flame spread. Upholstered chairs with no gap between the seat and the back generally contain more fuel and flames remain confined within the structure, thereby assisting fire growth. More luxurious upholstered chairs with armrests present a greater fire hazard, primarily due to the greater amount of flammable material and secondarily because the armrests can facilitate more radiative feedback to the seat, which can result in intense burning. The effect of tufting and welt cords depends on the type of combustion. In the case of smoldering fires, tufting and welt cords act as significant heat sinks, whereas for flaming combustion they act as <b>flame</b> <b>arrestors.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{quenching}} of gaseous hydrocarbon-air flames in packed beds of spherical particles {{has been investigated}} experimentally. Experiments were {{carried out in the}} standard flammability apparatus of Coward and Jones modified by the insertion of a packed bed of solid monosize spheres in the flame tube. Laminar flames were spark-initiated in quiescent combustible mixtures and failure or successful transmission of the flames through the packed bed was determined by visual observation. The quenching limits were determined {{as a function of the}} packed bed parameters (i. e., sphere material, sphere size, length of packed bed, etc.) to elucidate the mechanisms of flame extinction in the bed of spherical particles. The results have direct application to the design of <b>flame</b> <b>arrestors</b> using a packed bed as the flame arresting element. The flame quenching limits are found to be relatively insensitive to the material of the solid spheres, but are dependent on the sphere size through a characteristic length scale that describes the open passages of the packed bed. Flame extinction was always observed to occur within a few millimeters of penetration into the packed bed section indicating that the length of the packed bed has little influence on the quenching of laminar flames. Analysis of the experimental results indicates that the mechanism for flame quenching in a packed bed is governed primarily by heat loss to the sphere surfaces by conduction, convection effects being negligible in the small channels of the packed bed. It is shown that, while conduction is the dominant flame quenching mechanism, selective diffusion and flame stretch also play an important role in the quenching process...|$|R
40|$|A {{program to}} {{determine}} the feasibility of performing in situ calibration of combustible gas detectors was successfully completed. Several possible techniques for performing the in situ calibration were proposed. The approach that showed the most promise involved {{the use of a}} miniature water vapor electrolysis cell for the generation of hydrogen within the <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> of a combustible gas detector to be used for the purpose of calibrating the combustible gas detectors. A preliminary breadboard of the in situ calibration hardware was designed, fabricated and assembled. The breadboard equipment consisted of a commercially available combustible gas detector, modified to incorporate a water vapor electrolysis cell, and the instrumentation required for controlling the water vapor electrolysis and controlling and calibrating the combustible gas detector. The results showed that operation of the water vapor electrolysis at a given current density for a specific time period resulted in the attainment of a hydrogen concentration plateau within the <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> of the combustible gas detector...|$|E
40|$|The {{generated}} {{flow rates}} of gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen from an electrical vehicle nickel-iron battery system were determined {{and used to}} evaluate the flame quenching capabilities of several candidate devices to prevent flame propagation within batteries having central watering/venting systems. The battery generated hydrogen and oxygen gases were measured for a complete charge and discharge cycle. The data correlates well with accepted theory during strong overcharge conditions indicating that the measurements are valid for other portions of the cycle. Tests confirm that the gas mixture in the cells is always flammable regardless of the battery status. The literature indicated that a conventional <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> would not be effective over the broad spectrum of gassing conditions presented by a nickel-iron battery. Four different types of protective devices were evaluated. A foam-metal arrestor design was successful in quenching gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen flames, however; the application of this <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> to individual cell or module protection in a battery is problematic. A possible rearrangement of the watering/venting system to accept the partial protection of simple one-way valves is presented which, in combination with the successful foam-metal arrestor as main vent protection, could result in a significant improvement in battery protection...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an in situ calibration procedure for combustible gas detectors (CGD). The CGD will be a necessary device for future space vehicles as many subsystems in the Environmental Control/Life Support System utilize or produce hydrogen (H 2) gas. Existing calibration techniques are time-consuming and require support equipment such as an environmental chamber and calibration gas supply. The in situ calibration procedure involves utilization of a water vapor electrolysis cell for the automatic in situ generation of a H 2 /air calibration mixture within the <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> of the CGD. The development effort concluded with the successful demonstration of in situ span calibrations of a CGD...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{for use in}} underground coal mines measures the response times of machine-mounted methane monitors. This technique uses a calibration cup to deliver gas to the sensor head to measure response times. For comparison, in the current study, response times were measured by placing methane sensor heads in a specially designed test box where they were exposed to an atmosphere containing a constant concentration of methane. Response time readings measured in the test box were shorter than the readings obtained using the calibration cup. The response times measured in the test box were comparable for sensors from three different manufacturers. The effects of dust cap and <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> design on response times were also evaluated using the test box...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{universal}} applicability under extremely demanding conditions, non-oxide ceramic membranes {{are able to}} extend the present area of applications and to realize novel separation techniques. Current tendencies in process engineering towards integrated processes can benefit by these materials. Multifunctional membranes concurrently used, for instance, for catalytical conversions or electrochemical processes and separation may lead to novel routes of chemical synthesis and industrial-scale separation and purification. In addition, the design and technological control of production of porous non-oxide materials is also interesting for other applications. Feasible fields of application range from catalytic technology (high-temperature catalysis, abrasive resistant loose catalyzer in fluid-bed reactors), via aeration equipment in aggresive media (metal melts), to modern gas burner devices and <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> vents. For these reasons porous SiC and Si 3 N 4 ceramics represent an esse ntial and potential material, which can serve as an important component in environmental technological systems...|$|E
40|$|Hydrazine {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{propellants}} for attitude and orbital control systems in spacecrafts. The handling of hydrazine is difficult due to its high toxicity. There are political efforts in Europe to restrict the use of hydrazine (REACH-Regulation). For this reason, research for environmentally friendly, alternative propellants is conducted. One of those so called ‚ÄúGreen Propellants‚Äù is a mixture consisting of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and ethylene (C 2 H 4), which is under experimental investigation at the Institute for Space Propulsion of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Lampoldshausen. In future application, the propellant is intended to be stored premixed and liquefied in a tank combining the advantages of mono and bipropellants. A specific risk of such premixed fuel-oxidizer-mixtures is flashback into the propellant feeding lines. In this case, the flame could flash back into the tank. Such an event would be fatal for the propulsion system of a spacecraft and its whole mission. A particular effort must be made to prevent the occurrence of flashback. This thesis looks at the theoretical models of flame propagation and flashback. Based on this examination and previous experimental test results possible flame arrestors are chosen for further investigations. The flame arrestors consist of porous sintered metal. To investigate their properties, an ignition test bench was built. The test setup consists of two chambers: a cylindrical ignition chamber and a secondary chamber. The cambers are connected and the <b>flame</b> <b>arrestor</b> can be placed in between them. Ignition tests were conducted at a constant oxidizer to fuel ratio and variation of the initial pressure. A selection of the tests was recorded by high-speed camera. The gained data is analyzed, illustrated and discussed. It is shown, that there are porous materials with small pore sizes, for example the GKN‚Äôs SIKA-B 30 or SIKA-R 200 from a length longer 10. 5 mm and with a diameter of 12. 45 mm, can prevent flashback to an initial pressure of 4 bar. Furthermore, experiments were conducted on the quenching ability of orifices with a diameter of 0. 3 and 0. 5 mm. The critical Peclet numbers at our initial conditions are in the order of 30. High-speed recordings of the ignition show, that the flame in the ignition chamber propagates laminar and the maximum expansion speed of the flame tip is in the order of 60 to 70 m/s. The maximum expansion speed is combined by the laminar burning rate of the flame and a velocity induced by the expansion of the combustion products...|$|E
