25|$|Air-cured tobacco <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> well-ventilated barns {{and allowed}} to dry {{over a period of}} four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.|$|E
25|$|Fire-cured tobacco <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> large barns where {{fires of}} {{hardwoods}} are kept on {{continuous or intermittent}} low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on {{the process and the}} tobacco. Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire-cured.|$|E
25|$|Holy Name Cathedral {{continues}} {{the tradition of}} raising the galero, a wide-brimmed tasseled hat, of a deceased cardinal over the cathedra from the highest point of the semicircular, domed cathedral apse. The galero <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> Holy Name Cathedral where they remain until they are reduced to dust, symbolizing how all earthly glory is passing. Looking up above the Cathedra are the galeri of Cardinals Mundelein, Stritch, Meyer, Cody, Bernardin, and George.|$|E

2500|$|In a note {{police found}} in a phone booth nearby, the FALN wrote, [...] "we … take full {{responsibility}} for the especially detornated (sic) bomb that exploded today at Fraunces Tavern, with reactionary corporate executives inside." [...] The note explained that the bomb — roughly 10 pounds of dynamite that had been crammed into an attaché case and slipped into the tavern's entrance hallway — was retaliation for the [...] "CIA ordered bomb" [...] that killed three and injured 11 in a restaurant in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico two weeks earlier. [...] a memorial plaque with some victims' names <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the Tavern's large dining room.|$|E
2500|$|Kater built a {{reversible}} pendulum (shown at right) {{consisting of a}} brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular [...] "knife" [...] blades (a) near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod (b,c). In operation, the pendulum <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> front of a precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and {{the distance between the}} pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration g very accurately.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Whistler, however, sends {{one really}} good picture to this exhibition, a {{portrait}} of Mr. Carlyle, which <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the entrance hall; the expression on the old man's face, the texture and colour of his grey hair, and the general sympathetic treatment, show Mr. Whistler {19} {{to be an artist}} of very great power when he likes.|$|E
60|$|When Sammy Jay, who was {{listening}} and chuckling as he listened, heard that, he flew down {{where he would}} be just out of reach of Old Man Coyote, and then he just turned that tongue of his loose, and you know that some people say that Sammy's tongue <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the middle and wags at both ends. Of course this isn't really so, but when he gets to abusing people it seems as if it must be true. He called Old Man Coyote every bad name he could think of. He called him a sneak, a thief, a coward, a bully, {{and a lot of other}} things.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time Berrie showed signs of {{weakness}} and distress. [...] "Why, you see, Alec Belden and Mr. Moore were over there {{to look at some}} timber, and old Marm Belden and that Moore girl went along. I suppose they sent word to Cliff, and I presume that Moore girl put him on our trail. Leastwise that's the way I figure it out. That's the worst of the whole business." [...] She admitted this with darkened brow. [...] "Mrs. Belden's tongue <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the middle and loose at both ends--and that Moore girl is spiteful mean." [...] She could not keep the contempt out of her voice. [...] "She saw us start off, and she is sure to follow it up and find out what happened on the way home; even if they don't see Cliff they'll talk." ...|$|E

60|$|It will be {{seen that}} the XXth of the Articles of War provides, that if any person in the Navy negligently perform the duties {{assigned}} him, he shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge; but if the offender be a private (common sailor) he may, {{at the discretion of}} the Captain, be put in irons or flogged. It is needless to say, that in cases where an officer commits a trivial violation of this law, a court-martial is seldom or never called to sit upon his trial; but in the sailor's case, he is at once condemned to the lash. Thus, one set of sea-citizens is exempted from a law that <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> terror over others. What would landsmen think, were the State of New York to pass a law against some offence, affixing a fine as a penalty, and then add to that law a section restricting its penal operation to mechanics and day laborers, exempting all gentlemen with an income of one thousand dollars? Yet thus, in the spirit of its practical operation, even thus, stands {{a good part of the}} naval laws wherein naval flogging is involved.|$|E
6000|$|MOISÈ, CHURCH OF ST., III. 124. Notable {{as one of}} the basest {{examples}} [...] of the basest {{school of}} the Renaissance. It contains one important [...] picture, namely [...] "Christ washing the Disciples' Feet," [...] by Tintoret; on [...] {{the left side of the}} chapel, north of the choir. This picture has been [...] originally dark, is now much faded--in parts, I believe, altogether [...] destroyed--and <b>is</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the worst light of a chapel, where, on a [...] sunny day at noon, one could not easily read without a candle. I [...] cannot, therefore, give much information respecting it; but it is [...] certainly one of the least successful of the painter's works, and both [...] careless and unsatisfactory in its composition as well as its color. [...] One circumstance is noticeable, as in a considerable degree detracting [...] from the interest of most of Tintoret's representations of our Saviour [...] with his disciples. He never loses sight of the fact that all were [...] poor, and the latter ignorant; and while he never paints a senator, or [...] a saint once thoroughly canonized, except as a gentleman, he is very [...] careful to paint the Apostles, in their living intercourse with the [...] Saviour, in such a manner that the spectator may see in an instant, as [...] the Pharisee did of old, that they were unlearned and ignorant men; [...] and, whenever we find them in a room, it is always such a one as would [...] be inhabited by the lower classes. There seems some violation of this [...] practice in the dais, or flight of steps, at the top of which the [...] Saviour is placed in the present picture; but we are quickly reminded [...] that the guests' chamber or upper room ready prepared was not likely [...] to have been in a palace, by the humble furniture upon the floor, [...] consisting of a tub with a copper saucepan in it, a coffee-pot, and a [...] pair of bellows, curiously associated with a symbolic cup with a [...] wafer, which, however, is in an injured part of the canvas, and may [...] have been added by the priests. I am totally unable to state what the [...] background of the picture is or has been; and the only point farther [...] to be noted about it is the solemnity, which, in spite of the familiar [...] and homely circumstances above noticed, the painter has given to the [...] scene, by placing the Saviour, in the act of washing the feet of [...] Peter, at the top of a circle of steps, on which the other Apostles [...] kneel in adoration and astonishment.|$|E
