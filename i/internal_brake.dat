50|$|The turbine was {{manufactured}} by Endurance Wind Power {{and is designed}} to produce between 80,000 and 200,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year depending on wind levels. The wind turbine will not turn {{unless there is a}} sustained wind of approximately 8 mph for a period of 4 minutes, so gusty winds will not cause the turbine to turn. The wind makes the turbine blades turn under low wind conditions (8 mph) due to the pitch/angle of the blades. It turns the same speed all the time. It has an <b>internal</b> <b>brake</b> that will shut the unit off when the wind speed exceeds 50 mph.|$|E
40|$|Both {{constitutive}} secretion and Ca 2 +-regulated exocytosis {{require the}} assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. At present, {{little is known about}} how the SNARE complexes mediating these two distinct pathways differ in structure. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular synapse as a model, we show that a mutation modifying a hydrophobic layer in syntaxin 1 A regulates the rate of vesicle fusion. Syntaxin 1 A molecules share a highly conserved threonine in the C-terminal + 7 layer near the transmembrane domain. Mutation of this threonine to isoleucine results in a structural change that more closely resembles those found in syntaxins ascribed to the constitutive secretory pathway. Flies carrying the I 254 mutant protein have increased levels of SNARE complexes and dramatically enhanced rate of both constitutive and evoked vesicle fusion. In contrast, overexpression of the T 254 wild-type protein in neurons reduces vesicle fusion only in the I 254 mutant background. These results are consistent with molecular dynamics simulations of the SNARE core complex, suggesting that T 254 serves as an <b>internal</b> <b>brake</b> to dampen SNARE zippering and impede vesicle fusion, whereas I 254 favors fusion by enhancing intermolecular interaction within the SNARE core complex...|$|E
40|$|Competitive {{performance}} of an F 1 race car relies upon a well designed and highly developed aerodynamic system. In {{order to achieve}} this, total understanding of the downstream wake of exposed rotating wheels is essential. Components such as bargeboards and indeed much of the front wing are developed to provide pressure gradients and vortex structures to influence the wheel wake, ensuring high energy mass-flow to the sensitive {{leading edge of the}} underfloor and eventually the rear wing. Wind tunnel testing of model-scale deformable tyres has become a common occurrence in F 1 in recent years although there is a significant lack of available literature, academic or otherwise, as to their use. This work has studied in detail the aerodynamic consequences which occur from the varying sidewall bulge and contact patch region making use of several techniques. These include scanning rotating tyre profiles under load, static contact patch size measurements, five-hole pressure probe wake measurements, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and load-cell drag measurements. CFD simulations utilising two industrial codes have also been performed to support the experimental work. Coordinates representing tyre profiles under a range of on-track conditions are available for other researchers to use as a basis for CFD studies. The work presented here includes a full range of representative on-track axle heights which far exceed the more conservative range usually tested in an industrial setting for longevity reasons. The most sensitive parameters for aerodynamic testing of wheels have been identified. For development of a full car, in decreasing order of priority, the following must be correctly matched to the realistic scenario: axle height, yaw condition (without glycerol - often used to reduce friction at the expense of a compromised tyre profile), camber angle, detailed internals, high inflation pressure, through-hub flow rate and least significantly the rotation of the <b>internal</b> <b>brake</b> rotor. The study of through-hub flows revealed that the external aerodynamic effect of the brake scoop inlet varies significantly with the amount of internal restriction. The pumping effect of the brake rotor was measured to be negligible compared to the restrictive effect of its internal passages and that leads to an effect known as inlet spillage with a negative cooling drag trend, whereby the drag of the wheel assembly decreases with increased through-hub flow...|$|E

5000|$|The Lion was an {{automobile}} built in Adrian, Michigan, United States, by the Lion Motor Car Company from 1909-12.

50|$|Provided {{that the}} wheel load and {{configuration}} of the landing gear remain unchanged, the weight and volume of the tire will decrease {{with an increase in}} inflation pressure. From the flotation standpoint, a decrease in the tire contact area will induce a higher bearing stress on the pavement, thus eliminates certain airports from the aircraft’s operational bases. Braking will also become less effective due to a reduction in the frictional force between the tires and the ground. In addition, the decrease {{in the size of the}} tire, and hence the size of the wheel, could pose a problem if <b>internal</b> <b>brakes</b> are to be fitted inside the wheel rims. The arguments against higher pressure are of such a nature that commercial operators generally prefer the lower pressures in order to maximize tire life and minimize runway stress. To prevent punctures from stones Philippine Airlines had to operate their Hawker Siddeley 748 aircraft with pressures as low as the tire manufacturer would permit. However, too low a pressure can lead to an accident as in the Nigeria Airways Flight 2120.|$|R
50|$|In 1898, {{after the}} advent of {{freewheel}} coasting mechanisms, the first <b>internal</b> coaster <b>brakes</b> were introduced for the rear wheel.

50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{a plurality}} of smaller yaw drives (usually six) to facilitate easy replacement. Such a configuration with plurality of yaw drives often offers the possibility of active yaw braking using differential torque from the yaw drives. In this case half of the yaw drives apply a small mount of torque for clockwise rotation {{and the other half}} apply torque in the opposite direction and then activate the <b>internal</b> magnetic <b>brakes</b> of the electric motor.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{prostaglandin}} D 2 synthase (hPGD 2 S) metabolizes cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandin (PG) H 2 to PGD 2, {{which is}} dehydrated to cyclopentenone PGs, including 15 -deoxy-Δ 12, 14 -PGJ 2 (15 d-PGJ 2). PGD 2 acts through two receptors (DP 1 and DP 2 /CRTH 2), whereas 15 d-PGJ 2 can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors or inhibit {{a range of}} proinflammatory signaling pathways, including NF-κB. Despite eliciting asthmatic and allergic reactions through the generation of PGD 2, {{it is not known}} what role hPGD 2 S plays in T helper (Th) 1 -driven adaptive immunity. To investigate this question, the severity and duration of a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction was examined in hPGD 2 S knockout and transgenic mice. Compared with their respective controls, knockouts displayed a more severe inflammatory response that failed to resolve, characterized histologically as persistent acute inflammation, whereas transgenic mice had little detectable inflammation. Lymphocytes isolated from inguinal lymph nodes of hPGD 2 S−/− animals showed hyperproliferation and increased IL- 2 synthesis effects that were rescued by 15 d-PGJ 2, but not PGD 2, working through either of its receptors. Crucially, 15 d-PGJ 2 exerted its suppressive effects through the inhibition of NF-κB activation and not through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling. In contrast, lymph node cultures from transgenics proliferated more slowly and synthesized significantly less IL- 2 than controls. Therefore, contrary to its role in driving Th 2 -like responses, this report shows that hPGD 2 S may act as an <b>internal</b> <b>braking</b> signal essential for bringing about the resolution of Th 1 -driven delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Consequently, hPGD 2 S-derived cyclopentenone PGs may protect against inflammatory diseases, where T lymphocytes play a pathogenic role, as in rheumatoid arthritis, atopic eczema, and chronic rejection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHydrophysical {{measurements}} {{carried out}} in the deep tropical crater lake Alchichica, Mexico, showed the presence of intense internal waves with a one-day period, generated by the regular influence of a mountain breeze.

The <b>internal</b> waves <b>brake</b> close to the shoreline and into the lake's bottom, which generates baroclinic circulation and water masses mixing. According to the data obtained with a ADCP, two diurnal and two semidiurnal inclined waves propagate in the lake towards each other in depth and can form fluctuations of a vertical mode, if the depth of the lake is a multiple of one-half the vertical wavelength. This multiplicity applies to both the diurnal and semidiurnal waves. The simultaneous existence of horizontal and vertical modes corresponds to a volumetric mode, or resonant lake oscillation.
