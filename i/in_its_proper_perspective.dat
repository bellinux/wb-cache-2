40|$|This paper re-examines the {{historical}} {{dynamics of the}} events that led to Suez Canal crisis of 1956. Most significantly, and unlike several other works on the Suez Canal with their emphasis on political, military and strategic factors, this present study points out that economic factors exerted a preponderant influence in shaping the course of events during the period under review. Consequently, the approach adopted in this work is that of the economic theory of imperialism. Thus, apart from situating the history of the Canal <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>proper</b> historical <b>perspective,</b> the paper posits that the intense struggle for the control of the Canal between Egypt on the one hand, and the West on the other, emanated primarily from the latter’s attempt to exploit and dominate the Egyptian economy...|$|R

50|$|Later, Congregations {{properly}} so called, {{governed by}} a Superior General, were established within the Order so as to maintain their common observances. Among these Congregations, which gave new life to the Order, were the Windesheim Congregation, whose spirituality (known as the “devotio moderna”) had a wide influence. During the 15th and 16th centuries the Lateran Congregation added to the Order’s luster by its spirituality and scholarship. In the 17th and 18th centuries the French Congregation of Saint Genevieve and later the Congregation of Our Savior founded by Saint Peter Fourier (1566-1640), responded to new needs by combining the religious life with pastoral work.

[...] Penton gave examples of what he claimed were distortions of New Testament texts to support Watch Tower Society teachings on house-to-house preaching, criticized the appointment of elders chiefly on the basis of field service records and described circuit overseer visits as “military inspections”.

40|$|The Haitian Revolution was {{the first}} {{incidence}} of mass emancipation in a colonial society and the only slave revolt {{that resulted in the}} formation of a modern state. However, existing canonical works on this revolution have largely concentrated on providing a central symbiotic relationship between the slave revolt and the broader changes in the Atlantic World during the 18 th century. It has even been widely assumed that the Haitian Revolution was intellectually inspired by Western cultural values. Indeed, the Yoruba slave, Dutty Boukman, who ignited the revolution has been reduced to a mere footnote {{in the body of the}} prevailing Western-biased Haitian hegemonic historiography. This paper argues that the revolution, which was historically rooted in a legendary Yoruba tradition that abhors injustice, corruption and oppression, represents the very best of Yoruba’s cultural attainment in the Diaspora. The study further ‘resurrects’ the monumental contributions of Dutty Bookman to the outbreak of the revolution and underscores the fact that the Yoruba god of Ogun was the most portent rallying force that drove the revolution. Thus, the paper situates the cultural roots of the Haitian Revolution <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>proper</b> historical <b>perspective</b> and challenges one of the prevailing stereotypes about the “meagre” contributions of enslaved Africans to the emancipation of African slaves. The study, therefore, represents a major revision of the current historiography on the emancipation movement, and further highlights the methodological challenges of reconstructing the history of the slave trade in the Diaspora...|$|R
