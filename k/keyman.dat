[...] The estate was left in trust for his children, and his widow was left with an allowance of $60,000 per year. [...] He also left more than $1.5 million in life insurance, most of which went to the companies that he ran. [...] Only seven other men in the United States carried as much life insurance as Shevlin. [...] After his death, the $1.5 million life insurance purchased by the Shevlin companies was used by life insurance in a major advertising campaign promoting the use of <b>keyman</b> insurance.

[...] Then insurance {{in favor of the}} business should be ready to replace him.

50|$|Although many {{railways}} in {{the world}} have switched to other methods of inspection, it is still widely used over Indian Railways in addition to other techniques, especially for inspecting railway track and assets like bridges which are situated between stations. The push trolley carries one or more officials inspecting the track and the railside equipment. The official carries instruments to measure and check the condition of the tracks and monitor the work being done by the trackmen, <b>keymen,</b> gatemen etc. who maintain, patrol, man the track and installations. The push trolley is also used by officials inspecting signalling installations in some parts of India. On routes carrying high volumes of traffic, such as the suburban section in Mumbai, push trolleys cannot be used and foot inspections are being resorted to.|$|R
40|$|Major {{earthquakes}} may {{provoke a}} substantial number of crush casualties complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). After the 1988 Armenian earthquake, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) established the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force (RDRTF) to organize renal care in large disasters; this approach proved to be useful in several recent disasters. This paper depicts the organizational aspects of the rescue intervention during the Kashmir earthquake, in 2005. Specific problems were fierce geographic circumstances, lack of pre-registered local <b>keymen,</b> transportation problems, and inexperience of local teams to cope with problems related to mass disasters. Once treatment was installed, global outcomes were favorable. It is concluded that well-organized international help in renal disasters can be effective in saving many lives, but still necessitates conceptual adaptations owing to specific local circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Fourty-two village {{animal health}} workers called <b>keymen</b> (KM) and 84 {{veterinary}} assistants (VA) {{involved in a}} Basic Animal Health Service (BAHS) Programme in northern Malawi were interviewed during 1998. The general characteristics and perceptions of both groups were analysed using uni- and multivariate techniques. Detailed sales and treatment patterns of six KMand 12 VAwere evaluated for the period September 1996 to August 1997. Results indicated an overall job-satisfaction for 82 % of KM and 83 % of VA. Estimated weekly involvement in livestock service delivery, particularly of KM, was 3. 7 days on average. Total annual drug sales of KM and VA between 1996 and 1997 on average were equivalent to US$ 124 and US$ 218 respectively. Most livestock remedies were issued for treatment of calves, followed by adult cattle, chickens and small ruminants.

40|$|Many {{community-based}} {{animal health}} services {{have been established}} in developing countries. There are {{a large number of}} publications and references describing these services but only a few researchers have attempted a quantitative analysis of the components and benefits of such programs. The Basic Animal Health Service (BAHS) Project/GTZ in northern Malawi was established in 1989 and will finish its activities in 2003. An Impact Assessment was implemented during the BAHS field consolidation in 1996 / 97. The goal was to verify the effectiveness of the scheme and to demonstrate the benefits farmers obtain by using BAHS would pay. A series of studies were conducted. In Chapter I the characteristics of community-based livestock service programs are described and an overview of different international projects is provided. In addition, the background and philosophy of BAHS is explained and the traditional way of livestock keeping portrayed. In Chapter II data of a representative livestock population survey for the study area is analyzed. The results provide evidence that more households keep various species of livestock than official data would suggest. An attempt is made to evaluate the link of income status and livestock ownership of the rural people. The results of a cross-sectional study involving 96 users, 96 part-users and 96 non-users of the scheme are presented in Chapter III. The findings suggest that users owned larger numbers of livestock, were better educated and more open towards new methods compared to their fellow part- and non-users. Results of interviews with 42 village <b>keymen</b> (KM) and 84 veterinary assistants (VA), who are the key players in service delivery, are analyzed in Chapter IV. Additional information about their visit and treatment patterns are included. The foremost trend emerging from this data was the overall job satisfaction for both, KM and VA, which is a solid basis for further expanding the scheme. Chapter V contains the results of a longitudinal study. All 288 farms visited for the crosssectional study were monitored in regard to their livestock performances and husbandry applications between July 1997 and February 1999. The results show that users of BAHS had higher off-take rates in cattle, maintained more stable herds of ruminants and that their livestock mortality was lower compared to both of the other groups. Users also applied a range of livestock husbandry and management measures more frequently than part- and non-users. During concluding interviews in January and February 1999, BAHS-users felt significantly more positive about the past year in terms of livestock health and production compared to both of the other groups. Chapter VI presents the results of the economic analysis of the BAHS-scheme. Partial budget and cost benefit analysis are applied by using a spreadsheet model. Different farming levels were modeled. Users achieved higher net returns from livestock production compared to part- and non-users. It is assessed that the regional gross benefit farmers obtain through livestock production annually amounts to US$ 45 Mio with BAHS and US$ 44 Mio without, respectively. Different models were applied to evaluate the impact of an increased density in BAHS usage. The main challenge for the BAHS-program lies in intensified field extension, better support for village <b>keymen</b> and veterinary assistants and a significant increase of involvement of very poor households...|$|R

5000|$|Key person insurance, also {{commonly}} called <b>keyman</b> insurance and key man insurance, {{is an important}} form of business insurance. There is no legal definition for [...] "key person insurance". In general, it {{can be described as}} an insurance policy taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of an important member of the business. To put it simply, <b>Keyman</b> Insurance is a standard life insurance, TPD insurance or trauma insurance policy that is used for business succession or business protection purposes. The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business. <b>Keyman</b> Insurance policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity. Key person insurance does not indemnify the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified on the insurance policy.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (D. Litt. et Phil. (Biblical Studies)) The Fertile Crescent, {{due to its}} {{geographical}} characteristics, {{has always}} been an area troubled with conflict and warfare. The men who participated in these wars, from ca 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE operated from an ethos which was governed by a system of rules, all which were conceived to be the creation of divine will, to which kings and their warriors (<b>keymen)</b> were subject. The cuneiform texts from Mari, Ugarit, Ebla, Amarna and others, have not only thrown light on the political, social, religious and military aspects of those turbulent times, but have also given insight into the formation of armies as well as the commanders who led those armies and the royal officials who governed cities and provinces, all appointed by the monarch in order to effect the smooth running of his kingdom. They also shed light on the formation of coalitions and alliances in order to promote peace, arrange marriages to the daughters of other ruling powers and to promote trade relations. These were no easy tasks, considering the diversity of peoples, the birth and fall of kingdoms and empires, and the ever shifting and changes of loyalties of greedy kings and their men, to attain power and conquest for themselves [...] However, these texts also give glimpses of the human side of the king and the close relationships between himself and his men of authority, whilst the women of the court also played their role in some areas of the social field. The responses, of these people towards matters and events, whether they were confrontations, marriage alliances, trade ventures or hunting expeditions, occurred within an ever changing world yet, it was also a world with an ethos of ancient traditions, which did not disappear but instead remained, albeit in adapted or altered form, {{to be a part of}} their contextual reality.
