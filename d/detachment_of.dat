5|$|No.77 Squadron {{operated}} a <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> Pilatus PC-9 {{aircraft in the}} forward air control role from 2000 until 2003; this role was subsequently filled by the Forward Air Control Development Unit. Four Hornets from No.77 Squadron were deployed to protect the US base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean between November 2001 and February 2002, during the early phase {{of the war in}} Afghanistan. In March 2006, the squadron sent a <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> aircraft to RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, to assist with security for the Commonwealth Games being held in Melbourne. No.77 Squadron deployed to the Middle East in September 2015 as part of Operation Okra, Australia's contribution of the military intervention against ISIL; it handed over to the next rotation, from No.3 Squadron RAAF, in April 2016.|$|E
5|$|A small <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> men {{performs}} a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the bunker. He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the bunker. The operation is a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely malnourished and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 May 1972, the 3rd Battalion was {{converted}} and redesignated as the 297th Cavalry, a CARS parent regiment {{that included the}} 5th Squadron. The squadron's elements were redesignated from 3rd Battalion units: Headquarters and Headquarters Troop was redesignated from the 3rd Battalion's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Troop A from Company A at Ketchikan, <b>Detachment</b> 1 <b>of</b> Troop A from <b>Detachment</b> 1 <b>of</b> Company A at Sitka, <b>Detachment</b> 2 <b>of</b> Troop A from <b>Detachment</b> 2 <b>of</b> Company A at Kodiak, Troop B from Company B at Anchorage, <b>Detachment</b> 1 <b>of</b> Troop B from <b>Detachment</b> 1 <b>of</b> Company B at Kenai and Soldotna, <b>Detachment</b> 2 <b>of</b> Troop B from <b>Detachment</b> 2 <b>of</b> Company B at Seward, and Company C from the 216th Transportation Company at Fairbanks. [...] The 297th Infantry remained active with the 1st and 2nd Scout Battalions.|$|R
5|$|Although in {{operational}} theatres {{such as the}} Gulf War the Jaguar {{proved to}} be mechanically more reliable than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions. Owing to the Jaguar A's shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be escorted by Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale {{is named}} {{after a series of}} forts built by the United States during the Second Seminole War. The forts took their name from Major William Lauderdale (1782–1838), younger brother of Lieutenant Colonel James Lauderdale. William Lauderdale was the {{commander}} of the <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> soldiers who built the first fort. However, development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned {{at the end of the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|Harmonic {{manipulations}} {{of this kind}} {{create a sense of}} standstill, of arrest of time and motion; they often suggest a feeling of <b>detachment,</b> <b>of</b> entering a new dimension, independent of the preceding material, such as the realm of dreams and memories (if the preceding material is conceived as reality); some tonally detached passages may convey a feeling of an alienated, inhospitable environment, an exile (if the preceding material is conceived as home).|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> Sea Kings {{to be withdrawn}} from the region in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron {{deployed}} to the Middle East during Operation Okra {{as part of}} the military intervention against ISIL.

5|$|In {{addition}} to British outposts on the Atlantic coast at Tangier and the Cumberland Islands, {{there was a}} similar outpost on the Gulf coast at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River in Spanish East Florida which attracted Redstick Creek Indians and Black Seminoles. George Woodbine and a <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> Royal Marines were landed from HMS Orpheus in May 1814 with gifts, two thousand muskets and blankets for the Indians. A fort was constructed, and Cochrane sent Edward Nicolls to oversee the operations at Prospect Bluff.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1942, a small <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> an American fighter control {{squadron}} {{had been}} stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance {{warning to the}} Australian fighters based at Milne Bay. On 7 August, five Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron made forced landings on the grassy plains.

5|$|It is {{suggested}} that by the Early Cambrian, organisms higher in the food chain caused the microbial mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial substrate, leading to displacement or <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> the biota; or that {{the destruction of the}} mat destabilised the ecosystem, causing extinctions.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1777, the {{regiment}} and a <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> the Maryland Line {{under the command}} of General William Smallwood (the 2nd Maryland Brigade) arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, to protect the city from the British. They encamped at the present-day Brandywine Park in Wilmington. The highlight of this time included Smallwood's capture of the British armed brigantine Symmetry on December 30. This ship was laden with supplies, including winter clothing, en route to the British in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 1832, a <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> 275 militia {{under the}} command of Majors Isaiah Stillman and David Bailey, under orders from Illinois Governor Reynolds, were encamped near Old Man's Creek, not far from its {{confluence}} with the Rock River. The militia camp was located about three miles (5km) east of the Rock River near present-day Stillman Valley, Illinois, and seven miles (11km) south of the Sauk encampment. It is believed that the militia and its commanders were unaware of their proximity to Black Hawk's British Band.|$|E
