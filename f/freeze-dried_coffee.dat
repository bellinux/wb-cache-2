5000|$|... 1964 - General Foods {{introduced}} Maxim, {{the first}} American brand of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nestlé began {{developing}} a coffee brand in 1930, at {{the initiative of}} the Brazilian government, to help to preserve the substantial surplus of the annual Brazilian coffee harvest. Max Morgenthaler led the development project. Nestlé introduced the new product under the brand name [...] "Nescafé" [...] on 1 April 1938. [...] In 1965, Nestlé introduced a <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> brand called [...] "Nescafé Gold" [...] in Europe.|$|E
50|$|High-vacuum <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> was {{developed}} shortly after World War II, as an indirect result of wartime research into other areas. The National Research Corporation (NRC) {{was formed in}} Massachusetts as a process-development company employing high-vacuum technology. It developed high-vacuum processes to produce penicillin, blood plasma, and streptomycin for US military use. As the war ended, NRC looked to adapt its processes for peacetime uses. It formed Florida Foods Corporation to produce concentrated orange juice powder, and originally sold its product to the United States Army. That company later {{changed its name to}} Minute Maid.|$|E
50|$|While the Nescafé brand {{was created}} for soluble coffee, it has {{subsequently}} been used as an umbrella brand {{on a number of}} instant coffee products, including, in the UK, Gold Blend and Blend 37 <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffees.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "Instant tea", {{similar to}} <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee</b> and an {{alternative}} to brewed tea, can be consumed either hot or cold. Instant tea {{was developed in the}} 1930s, with Nestlé introducing the first commercial product in 1946, while Redi-Tea debuted instant iced tea in 1953.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to drip filter coffee, boiled coffee increases the serum cholesterol level in man. To identify the substance(s) {{responsible for this}} effect, {{it is necessary to}} find an animal model sensitive to boiled coffee. In this study, three groups of 20 male gerbils and three groups of six male hamsters were fed a control diet or a control diet supplemented with either <b>freeze-dried</b> boiled <b>coffee</b> or <b>freeze-dried</b> filtered <b>coffee.</b> At the end of the 5 -week feeding period serum cholesterol levels were not different in either species fed the different diets. These results suggest that these animal species are not sensitive to boiled coffee, or that the cholesterol-raising factor in boiled coffee is lost during the process of freeze-drying...|$|R
5000|$|When {{they arrived}} they were {{disappointed}} with the appalling quality of the local coffee. By the time Howell had left Berkeley, West Coast coffee pioneer Alfred Peet was already successfully established in the Bay Area and had already inspired Starbucks founders Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker {{to start their own}} high-quality coffee store further north in Seattle. Howell and his wife had developed a taste for the strong, flavorful coffee available around San Francisco. But the East Coast was different. He has said that [...] "Boston was a desert of stale, brown-painted wooden pellets and liquified ground saw dust." [...] Though high-quality coffees had been popular in the United States at earlier points in its history, Americans' taste for strong, flavorful coffee declined during World War II. Severe rationing of coffee supplies at home and the wide consumption of the newly developed instant, <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> among soldiers caused American coffee palates to devolve. Though espresso or [...] "Italian coffee" [...] did emerge as a micro-niche product in Beatnik bars of the 1950s, weak-tasting, cheap canned coffee made in percolators and on diner hot plates was the rule of the day until Alfred Peet started his company and began to elevate tastes in the late 1960s.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{diffusivity}} is {{an important}} transport property of foods, which is useful in computations, simulation and control of several unsteady-state food processing operations. Limited data on thermal diffusivity are available, especially, at low moistures, which are of interest in drying and storage processes. Experimental values of the thermal diffusivity (alpha) in the low moisture range were obtained directly for <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee,</b> potato and meat, using the transient method of Dickerson (1965), and indirectly for granular starch, flour, rice, and raisins, using thermal conductivities, obtained by the heated probe method. A nonlinear relationship was found between (alpha) and moisture content in granular and! porous foods in the low moisture region. An evaluation of published data indicates a strong effect of physical structure (especially porosity) on the thermal diffusivity. A similar effect has been observed on the moisture diffusivity. These anomalies {{may be related to}} the state of water (adsorbed or capillary) in the porous structure of the low-moisture foods. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited...|$|E
40|$|Split-plot {{and other}} multistratum {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in factorial and response surface experiments. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) and generalized least squares (GLS) estimation {{is seen as the}} state of the art method of data analysis for non-orthogonal designs. We analyse data from an experiment that was run to study the effects of five process factors on the drying rate for <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> and find that the main plot variance component is estimated to be 0. We show that this is a typical property of REML–GLS estimation in non-orthogonal split-plot designs with few main plots which is highly undesirable and can give misleading conclusions. Instead, we recommend a Bayesian analysis, using an informative prior distribution for the main plot variance component and implement this by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Paradoxically, the Bayesian analysis is less dependent on prior assumptions than the REML–GLS analysis. Bayesian analyses of the coffee freeze-drying data give more realistic conclusions than REML–GLS analysis, providing support for our recommendation. <br/...|$|E
50|$|The company's {{range of}} {{products}} consists {{of different types of}} instant coffee manufactured using various production methods (spray drying, agglomerated, <b>freeze-dried,</b> decaffeinated), instant <b>coffee</b> beverages such as cappuccino, white coffee and iced coffee as well as coffee substitutes, e.g., different types of grain coffees. In addition, DEK has an extensive brand portfolio, which it makes available to prospective customers.|$|R
25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} to Japan by the Dutch in the 17th century, but remained a curiosity until the lifting of trade restrictions in 1858. The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later. By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as import barriers were removed. The introduction of <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee,</b> canned coffee, and franchises such as Starbucks and Doutor Coffee in the late 20th century continued this trend, {{to the point that}} Japan {{is now one of the}} leading per capita coffee consumers in the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of oil (a hydrophobic agent) can significantly accelerate the collapsing process localized {{reduction in the}} foam elasticity, resulting {{in the creation of}} a lighter foam with average bubble diameter larger than 4 mm. This is the reason it is not possible to make a good frappé in many countries, unless one can find spray-dried coffee (which is actually generally less expensive than <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee).</b> The utilization of a hand mixer makes possible the creation of finer bubbles which increases the time that the foam can last. The best frappé coffees are often held to be those with the smallest bubbles and a thickness of about 1.5 inches to 2 inches (30 mm to 50 mm) of foam.|$|R
40|$|The oil {{obtained}} from Brazilian roasted coffee by supercritical CO 2 extraction shows considerable aromatic properties, mainly composed by five aromatic compounds, 2 -methylpyrazine; 2 -furfurylalcohol, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine; &# 947;-butyrolactone and 2 -furfurylacetate. Sensory analyses {{were used to}} verify {{the influence of a}} mixture of these important classes of aromatic coffee compounds (pyrazines, furans and lactones) and of the roasted coffee aromatic oil on the coffee aroma and flavour of black instant freeze and spray-dried coffee beverages. In the acceptance evaluation of the aroma, the samples prepared with freeze-dried instant coffee without the mixture of volatile compounds (sample 4) were not significantly different from the freeze-dried instant coffee in which the aromatic coffee oil was added (sample 5) and from the sample prepared with <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> in which the mixture of the five volatile was added (sample 3), coincidentally from the same drying process. Therefore, sample (3) did not differ from samples prepared with spray dried instant coffee without (sample 1) and to which (sample 2) the mixture of volatile was added. Therefore, with respect to this attribute, the addition of this mixture did not interfere in this drink acceptance. Taking into consideration the flavor, samples prepared with freeze-dried instant coffee in which the aromatic coffee oil was added (5) and the samples with (3) and without (4) the mixture of the five volatile was added did not differ significantly, however sample (4) did not differ from samples (1) and (2). Regarding this attribute, the addition of the aromatic oil of roasted coffee or a mixture of volatile in samples of freeze-dried instant coffee had a better acceptance than those dried by spray dryer (1) and (2). Thus, the enrichment of drinks with the aromatic oil of roasted coffee, or even with the mixture of the five components did not influence the consumer acceptance with respect to the aroma, but exerts influence with respect to flavour...|$|E

O óleo do café torrado Brasileiro obtido através de extração com CO 2 supercrítico mostrou consideráveis propriedades aromáticas, constituído principalmente por cinco compostos aromáticos: 2 -metilpirazina; 2 -furfuril álcool, 2, 5 -dimetilpirazina; &# 947; -butirolactona e 2 -furfuril acetato. Análises sensoriais foram usadas para verificar a influência da mistura destas importantes classes de compostos aromáticos de café (pirazinas, furanos e lactonas) e do óleo aromático de café torrado no aroma e sabor de bebidas preparadas com café solúvel instantâneo liofilizado e seco por spray dryer. Na análise da aceitação do aroma, a amostra preparada com café liofilizado sem a mistura de compostos voláteis (amostra 4) não diferiu da amostra de café liofilizados com adição de óleo (amostra 5) nem tão pouco da amostra de café liofilizado com adição da mistura dos cinco voláteis (amostra 3), coincidentemente oriundas do mesmo processo de secagem. Entretanto a amostra 3 não diferiu das amostras preparadas com café seco por spray dryer sem (amostra 1) e com (amostra 2) a mistura de voláteis. Indicando que a adição desta mistura, com relação a este atributo não interfere na aceitação desta bebida. Na avaliação do sabor, as amostras preparadas com café solúvel liofilizado enriquecida com óleo aromático (5) e as amostras com (3) e sem (4) a mistura dos cinco voláteis não diferiram significativamente, entretanto a amostra (4) não diferiu das amostras (1) e (2). Para este atributo, a adição do óleo aromático de café torrado ou da mistura de voláteis nas amostras de café liofilizado fez com que tivessem uma melhor aceitação que aquelas secas por spray dryer (1) e (2). Desta forma, o enriquecimento das bebidas com o óleo aromático de café torrado, ou mesmo com a mistura dos cinco componentes não influenciou a aceitação do consumidor com relação ao aroma, mas exerce influência com relação ao sabor...|$|E
5000|$|Although General Foods {{had been}} {{marketing}} decaffeinated coffee under various brand {{names such as}} [...] "Sanka" [...] since 1927, and [...] "Brim" [...] and [...] "Maxim", the latter a <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee,</b> since the 1950s, it refrained from actually selling Maxwell House-labeled decaffeinated coffee products until 1983, when it introduced ground [...] "Maxwell House Decaffeinated" [...] into East Coast markets. (At the same time, a decaffeinated version of its long-established, lighter-tasting [...] "Yuban" [...] brand was introduced on the West Coast.) [...] "Maxwell House Instant Decaffeinated Coffee" [...] finally came to store shelves in 1985. A further modification of the decaf theme, [...] "Maxwell House Lite", a [...] "reduced-caffeine" [...] blend, was introduced nationally in 1992 and its instant form the following year.|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{is examined}} as a rapid alternative to wet chemistry methods {{for the detection}} of adulteration of <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffees.</b> Spectra have been collected of pure coffees, and of samples adulterated with glucose, starch or chicory in the range 20 - 100 g kg(- 1). Two different FTIR sampling methods have been employed: diffuse reflectance, and attenuated total reflectance. Three different statistical treatments of the spectra were carried out. Firstly, the spectra were compressed by principal component analysis and a linear discriminant analysis performed. With this approach, a 98 % successful classification rate was achieved. Secondly, a simultaneous partial least square regression was carried out for the content of three added carbohydrates (xylose, glucose and fructose) in order to assess the potential of FTIR spectroscopy for determining the carbohydrate profile of instant coffee. Lastly, the discrimination of pure from adulterated coffee was performed using an artificial neural network (ANN). A perfect rate of assignment was obtained. The generalization ability of the ANN was tested on an independent validation data set; again, 100 % correct classifications were achieved...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} coffee bean have {{acquired}} worldwide economic importance: these are, Coffea Arabica and Coffea Canephora variant Robusta. Arabica beans are valued most highly by the trade, {{as they are}} considered to have a finer flavor than Robusta. In this work, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is explored as a rapid alternative to wet chemical methods for authentication and quantification of coffee products. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to spectra of <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffees,</b> acquired by DRIFT (diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform) and ATR (attenuated total reflection) sampling techniques, and reveals clustering according to coffee species. Linear discriminant analysis of the principal component scores yields 100 % correct classifications for both training and test samples. The chemical origin of the discrimination is explored through interpretation of the PCA loadings. Partial least squares regression is applied to spectra of Arabica and Robusta blends to determine the relative content of each species. Internal cross-validation gives a correlation coefficient of 0. 99 and a standard error of prediction of 1. 20 % (w/w), illustrating {{the potential of the}} method for industrial off-line quality control analysis...|$|R
