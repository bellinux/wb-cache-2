5|$|Abzû is an {{adventure}} video game developed by <b>Giant</b> <b>Squid</b> Studios {{and published by}} 505 Games for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Initially released as a digital title in August 2016, a retail version for consoles was released in January 2017. Following the journey of a diver exploring the ocean and restoring life using magical springs, the gameplay allows the player to freely navigate underwater environments ranging from open water and natural caverns to ancient ruins.|$|E
5|$|Interested in {{the ability}} of the human body to {{withstand}} and survive pain, No forces Bond to navigate his way through an obstacle course constructed in the facility's ventilation system. Bond is kept under observation as he suffers electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders. Bond's ordeal ends in a fight with a captive <b>giant</b> <b>squid,</b> which he defeats by using improvised weapons. After his escape he encounters Rider, who has been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; they had ignored her and she managed to escape.|$|E

5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Abzû {{lay in the}} {{development}} of Journey, an independent video game developed by Thatgamecompany and released in 2012. Abzûs creator, director and art director Matt Nava had previously worked as art director for Journey during its three-year development. Having worked in a game featuring a desert setting, Nava wanted to change to a more vibrant and populated setting for his next title. Nava began creating the pitch for Abzû before leaving Thatgamecompany and founding the game's developer <b>Giant</b> <b>Squid</b> Studios. One of the main elements Nava incorporated was his love for ancient cultures and their artwork, particularly relating to the myths surrounding the concept of Abzu. Nava's love of the ocean, which he explored through his hobby of scuba diving, also figured heavily in the design of Abzû. The team at <b>Giant</b> <b>Squid</b> Studios grew to ten developers from across the industry, mainly programmers who specialized in multiple aspects of game design from gameplay to graphics, in addition to a graphical and technical artist who helped create and animate the character models. The game was first announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was later previewed at E3 2016. The game was released digitally on PlayStation 4 via PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows through Steam on August 2, 2016. It released on Xbox One through Xbox Live on December 6. The game received a physical release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 31, 2017. All versions were published by 505 Games.|$|E
5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a <b>giant</b> <b>squid,</b> and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> feed on deep-sea fish and other squid species. They catch prey using the two tentacles, {{gripping}} it with serrated sucker rings on the ends. Then they bring it toward the powerful beak, and shred it with the radula (tongue with small, file-like teeth) before it reaches the esophagus. They {{are believed to be}} solitary hunters, as only individual <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> have been caught in fishing nets. Although the majority of <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> caught by trawl in New Zealand waters have been associated with the local hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) fishery, hoki do not feature in the squid's diet. This suggests <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> and hoki prey on the same animals.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of the {{mitochondrial}} DNA of <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> {{individuals from}} all over the world has found that there is little variation between individuals across the globe (just 181 differing genetic base pairs out of 20,331).

25|$|The elusive {{nature of}} the <b>giant</b> <b>squid</b> and its foreign appearance, often {{perceived}} as terrifying, have firmly established {{its place in the}} human imagination.

2500|$|The kraken (...) is {{a legendary}} sea monster of giant size that {{is said to}} dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland.

The sheer size and fearsome appearance attributed to the kraken have made it a common ocean-dwelling monster in various fictional works. It was first described by the Dane Erik Pontoppidan in 1752–3.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{discuss that}} the {{dynamics}} of <b>squid</b> <b>giant</b> axons is a typical example of chaotic dynamics. There are two reasons why {{the dynamics of}} <b>squid</b> <b>giant</b> axons is a typical example of chaotic dynamics. The first {{reason is that the}} maximal Lyapunov exponent has a positive value which coincides with the metric entropy. The second reason is that the analysis of recurrence plot shows that the underlying dynamcis of <b>squid</b> <b>giant</b> axon is consistent with Devaney's definition of deterministic chaos...|$|R
25|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, kraken have been {{depicted}} {{in a number}} of ways, primarily as large octopus-like creatures, and it has often been alleged that Pontoppidan's kraken might have been based on sailors' observations of the <b>giant</b> <b>squid.</b> The kraken is also depicted to have spikes on its suckers. In the earliest descriptions, however, the creatures were more crab-like than octopus-like, and generally possessed traits that are associated with large whales rather than with <b>giant</b> <b>squid.</b> Some traits of kraken resemble undersea volcanic activity occurring in the Iceland region, including bubbles of water; sudden, dangerous currents; and appearance of new islets.|$|E

50|$|Ambergris {{is formed}} from a {{secretion}} of the bile duct in the intestines of the sperm whale, {{and can be}} found floating on the sea or washed up on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the abdomens of dead sperm whales. Because the beaks of <b>giant</b> <b>squids</b> have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten. The sperm whale usually vomits these, but if one travels further down the gut, it will be covered in ambergris.|$|R
