He had been there for six months, without a flaw being detected, either in his integrity, his diligence, or his regularity; indeed, it was evident that he had been gradually acquiring a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> and confidence than he had at first enjoyed, and had been latterly more employed by his uncle. That a young man of superior education should find the daily drudgery tedious and distasteful, and that one of sensitive honour should be startled at the ordinary, he might almost say proverbial, customs of the miller's trade, was surprising to no one; and that he should unbosom himself to a friend of his own age, and indulge together with him in romantic visions of adventure, was, to all who remembered their own boyhood, an illustration of the freshness and ingenuousness of the character that thus unfolded itself.

However, to be angry with you to whom I am indebted for the greatest obligation I could possibly receive, would be the highest ingratitude.

(William Oldys reports a traditional view that the inscription on Jonson's tomb ("O rare Ben Jonson") refers to the applause this play received, after the failure of Catiline, indicating some degree of popularity. Samuel Pepys records seeing it four times in 1661, twice with the puppet show and twice without (8 June 27 June, 31 August and 7 September 1661).

It retained a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> in the study even as it disappeared from the boards; both Isaac Reed and Horace Walpole praised its wealth of invention in their accounts of Renaissance drama. John Brown revised the play and offered it to David Garrick; Garrick refused it, however, and Brown's text is lost.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops and assesses empirically a Cognitive-Emotional Theory <b>of</b> <b>Esteem</b> Support Messages. Esteem support may be {{best understood}} as a particular form of social support that is provided to others {{with the intent of}} enhancing how they feel about themselves and their attributes, abilities, and accomplishments. Limited research indicates the importance <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support for a variety of personal and relational outcomes; however, very few studies have considered the nature of messages used to convey esteem support. In this dissertation, two studies aided in the development of detailed descriptions of the features of better and worse esteem support messages. A theory <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support messages is proposed, identifying the dimensions along which these messages fall, as well as the mechanisms through which sophisticated esteem support messages should have their effects. The merits of this theoretical model were evaluated in a subsequent empirical study that tested whether messages identified by the model as theoretically sophisticated were evaluated as better than less sophisticated messages by naïve actors. Many of the theory’s tenets were supported in this final study. ^ To provide a context {{for the development of a}} theory <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support messages, Chapter 1 discusses the nature and development of self-esteem, reviews the limited literature on esteem support, and emphasizes the importance <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support in shaping self-esteem and other outcomes. In Chapter 2, a model <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support interactions is sketched. Chapter 3 focuses specifically on esteem support messages, detailing the normative criteria that may distinguish better and worse forms <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support messages, as well as proposing strategies for identifying features of these messages. In this chapter, the general research questions for the dissertation’s three empirical studies are presented. The first empirical study, a retrospective study <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> support messages, is discussed in Chapter 4. Study 2, a study <b>of</b> participant-generated <b>esteem</b> support messages, is discussed in Chapter 5. The Cognitive-Emotional Theory <b>of</b> <b>Esteem</b> Support Messages is presented in Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 describes the initial empirical assessment of this theory in Study 3. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes the dissertation by discussing implications, limitations, and future directions for the theory developed here. ...|$|R

5000|$|Politically, {{the system}} of {{government}} created by Kublai Khan {{was the product of}} a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esteem</b> that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong [...] "colonial" [...] coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of [...] "barbarians" [...] in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: [...] "... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only [...] "Mongols and Tartars" [...] and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them".|$|E

40|$|Styria {{can hardly}} be {{imagined}} without its ubiquitous pumpkin. With its long shoots, the Styrian oilseed pumpkin (cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo var. styriaca) is particularly popular as it does not only create identity but also holds large economic potential considering the countless products made from the vegetable, such as pumpkinseed oil, pasta, jams, soaps and many other items. It {{seems as if the}} vegetable has always been cultivated in this region and has enjoyed at least some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esteem.</b> The historical perspective reveals, however, that pumpkins as a culinary trait of Styria's food culture are far from being as old as various marketing policies try to make us believe. The vegetable, which is a native of Central America, arrived in Europe not before the 16 th century. In Styria, it was not accepted as foodstuff for a long time. Similar to potatoes, pumpkins were regarded as pig feed. However, there is evidence that the consumption of pumpkinseed oil dates back to the late 17 th century. In {{the second half of the}} 18 th century, bad harvests and similar disasters led to food shortages and famines. In 1773, under the rule of Joseph II, an information pamphlet was published and widely distributed among the populace. The aim of this 'publicity campaign' was to promote the cultivation and consumption of pumpkins. The pamphlet also contained a number of pumpkin recipes to compensate for the grain scarcity. This paper analyses the effectiveness of these measures by examining references to pumpkin in cookery books of the time. The analysis includes fifteen cookery books from the late 17 th to the mid 19 th century which were printed in the city of Graz. This study illustrates political approaches towards the improvement of the food situation in the late 18 th century, while establishing the extent of acceptance by the populace or parts thereof...|$|E
