Because there is such a low expectation <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids.</b> Nobody expects these kids to succeed. —Ellen Garrity I think we’re in a toxic environment here, I really do …. It’s like trying to swim in an undertow or something. It’s like banging your head against the wall. You’re working so hard every day to try and make changes, and it just feels like, I know it’s not true, but it feels like you’re alone. Because there’s no sense of community, no communication between colleagues, and it’s really hard. You go home sometimes and it’s just so depressing, and no one understands in your family, what you’re talking about … it can make you sick. That’s why I said it’s toxic. I think it could make you physically sick, but it can make you emotionally sick every day. If you don’t figure out some way to shut it off. It’s just really sad. I mean, it’s heartbreaking because when you get to know these kids, so many of them have so much potential and are so bright, and so few of them go anywhere from here. I mean they don’t. They don’t even go to college. They don’t even go to community college. They go and work at McDonald’s or Kroger’s. And they’re just as smart as the kids who live 20 minutes away. But we seem to {{not be able to do}} anything to change it. And it’s just, you know, it’s wrong. It’s a huge injustice to them.

40|$|Variety is {{the spice}} of life: {{multiple}} intelligence and the gifted From Kathy Frazier, teacher of academically talented {{middle school students}} comes the following comment: “The MI (Multiple Intelligences) approach is very valuable <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> even though they already do well academically. We talk a lot in this class about metacognition and how we think. This project fits right in. Some of these students are perfectionists and very self-critical. It can help some kids who are very strong in one area like language {{but they have to}} struggle with math. They're frustrated because the math doesn't come as easy as they expect. It's not that they're not good in math but they don't just get it as easy as, say, the language arts. It helps with that. Some students get really down on themselves when they must struggle in one subject while everything else comes very easily. They think, ‘I'm really, really, really bad at this’. I have to tell them, ‘No, it's just more challenging’. One boy who was working on an art project said that he wanted to give up because "This is hard for me because I'm not strong in my spatial intelligence". I had a talk with him and pointed out that accepting challenges to improve even those areas where we are not strong {{is an important part of}} your education. They should select those weaker areas sometimes and not always take the road of what they're best in. What MI theory and the MIDAS profile points out is that we all have strengths as well as weaknesses and that it's OK to have areas where you're not so good. It makes it more acceptable to the self-critical student. When you give this type of student reasons and techniques for understanding why they think the way they do, it is very powerful. It's like the MIDAS normalized them so they don't feel too different or abnormal. We talk a lot about thinking-about-thinking and being the non-conforming, round peg in the square hole of the classroom. This helps them to be not so frustrated. We talk about how they might approach a teacher about doing alternative projects that better match their learning skills so they're not so frustrated by the standard assignments. A teacher might still say "no " but it will give her something to think about and maybe find ways to help the student who is frustrated in her class. This gives students a tool that they can take the initiative with. "...|$|E
