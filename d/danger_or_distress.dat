25|$|According to {{attachment}} theory, the {{two goals}} of the caregiving behavioural system are to protect close others from harm and decrease their suffering during times of threat, and to promote close others’ personal growth and exploratory behaviour. Attachment theorists call the former aspect of caregiving behaviour “providing a safe haven”, and the latter “providing a secure base”. The caregiving system is therefore likely to be activated when an individual perceives that a close relationship partner is experiencing <b>danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>distress,</b> or when the partner has an opportunity for exploration, learning, or mastery of a new skill, and could benefit from help in pursuing the opportunity or from celebration of his/her accomplishments and goal strivings.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not likely}} that the more {{accurate}} methods of recent mental education will now long permit young people {{to grow up in}} the persuasion that, in any <b>danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>distress,</b> they may expect to be themselves saved by the Providence of God, while those around them are lost by His improvidence: but they may be yet long restrained from rightly kind action, and long accustomed to endure both their own pain occasionally, and the pain of others always, with an unwise patience, by misconception of the eternal and incurable nature of real evil. Observe, therefore, carefully in this matter; there are degrees of pain, as degrees of faultfulness, which are altogether conquerable, and which seem to be merely forms of wholesome trial or discipline. Your fingers tingle when you go out on a frosty morning, and are all the warmer afterwards; your limbs are weary with wholesome work, and lie down in the pleasanter rest; you are tried for a little while by having to wait for some promised good, and it is all the sweeter when it comes. But you cannot carry the trial past a certain point. Let the cold fasten on your hand in an extreme degree, and your fingers will moulder from their sockets. Fatigue yourself, but once, to utter exhaustion, and to the end of life you shall not recover the former vigour of your frame. Let heart-sickness pass beyond a certain bitter point, and the heart loses its life for ever.|$|E

50|$|That's Life! was {{influential}} {{in many different}} ways, not least in {{the introduction of the}} videolink for child witnesses in court procedures, and it was responsible for the launch of ChildLine in 1986, the first national helpline for children in <b>danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>distress.</b> Rantzen had suggested the Childwatch programme to BBC One Controller Michael Grade after the death of a toddler who had starved to death, locked in a bedroom. The aim of the programme was to find better ways of detecting children at risk of abuse and to that end, viewers of That's Life! who had themselves experienced cruelty as children were asked {{to take part in a}} survey detailing the circumstances of their abuse.|$|E
50|$|In {{monitoring}} and security solutions, {{an important contribution}} to alarm detection and alarm verification can be supplied, using sound recognition techniques. In particular, these methods could be helpful for intrusion detection in places like offices, stores, private homes or for the supervision of public premises exposed to person aggression. In all these cases, a recognition system can report about a <b>danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>distress</b> event. It could further identify sounds like glass break, doorbells, smoke detector alarms, red alerts, human screams, baby cries and others. Sometimes, the alarm is triggered by other of detectors (e.g. temperature or video-based) and the sound recognizer would be associated to these other modalities, to verify the alarm, with the purpose of decreasing the global false alarm detection rate.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986 Esther Rantzen, {{presenter}} of That's Life!, {{a popular}} consumer TV show, suggested to the BBC that they create [...] "Childwatch", a programme about child abuse that was screened on 30 October 1986 on BBC1, the aim being {{to try to}} detect children at risk before their lives were in danger. Viewers {{were asked if they}} would take part in the survey in an edition of That's Life!. A helpline was opened after the programme so that any child currently suffering abuse could call for help. Rantzen, together with her BBC producers Sarah Caplin and Ritchie Cogan, therefore suggested they should create a helpline specifically for children in <b>danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>distress,</b> to be open throughout the year, 24/7, and launch it on the programme. The project was made possible by a benefactor Ian Skipper who underwrote the charity for the first three years.|$|E

50|$|The Reason of this, {{according}} to my Opinion, is; because the Faculties of the Soul are too Vast an Extent, to be supplied by the Present Objects, so that 'tis obliged to|<125> have recourse to what's past, and to come, in Truth and in Fictions, in Imaginary Spaces and Impossibilities, for Objects to exert it self upon. The Objects of Sense fill the Desires of the Soul of Brutes, who have no farther Concern; so that we can't discover in them these restless Emotions, which continually actuate the Mind of Man, and carry it into the Pursuit of a recent Information, to proportion (if possible the Object to the Faculty; and enjoy a Pleasure resembling that which we perceive in the Appeasing a Violent Hunger, and Extinguishing a Corroding Thirst. This is that which Plato intends, in the Marriage of Do-|<126>rus and Penia, (in which Terms he would express Riches and Poverty,) which produces exquisite Pleasure. The Object is signified by Riches, which are not so but in Use and Intention; otherwise they are unfruitful and afford no Delight. The Faculty is intended by Inquietude, while 'tis separated from Riches; whereas its Union with them, supplies the Highest Satisfaction. The Case is the same with our Souls: Poverty, the same with Ignorance, is Natural to it; it sighs continually after Science; which is its Riches; and when 'tis possess'd of this Enjoyment, it feels the greatest Pleasure. But|<127> this Pleasure is not always equal; it often is the Purchase of much labour and Difficulty: As when the Soul applies it self to intricate Speculations, and Occult Sciences, the Matter whereof is not present to our Senses; where the Imagination, which acts with Faculity, has a Less Part in the Pursuit than the Understanding, whose Operations are more Vehement and Intense: And because Labour is naturally tedious, the Soul is not carried to Hard and Spinous Learning, unless in Prospect of some Advantage, or Hope of some remote Amusement, or else by Necessity. But the Knowledge which attracts and delights it most, is that which is acquired without|<128> Pain and where the Imagination alone acts on Subjects which fall under our Sense, ravish our Passions, and are great Movers in all the Affairs of Life. Such are Romances, which require no great Intention or Dispense of Mind, to understand them. No long Reasonings are exacted; the Memory is not overburthened: Nothing is demanded, but Fancy and Imagination. They move our Passions; but 'tis on purpose to sooth and calm them again: They excite neither Fear nor Compassion; unless it be to display to us the Pleasure of seeing those we are afraid, or concern'd for, out of Reach of <b>Danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>Distress.</b> In short, all our Emo|<129>tions there find themselves agreeably provoked and appeased.|$|E
30|$|The {{origins of}} these hashtags suggest {{they are used}} to express {{different}} forms of social support for Bostonians. The #prayforboston hashtag is a variant on the ‘#prayfor{X}’ hashtags that have been used in recent years in response to various disasters [86]. In response to the riots in London in 2011, [86] find that users largely tweeted messages of general concern and sympathy to the different #prayfor hashtags associated with that event (#prayforlondon, #prayforuk). Tweets to #prayforboston would thus express feelings associated with empathic concern, defined as ‘an other other-oriented emotional response elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone else’ [87] (pp. 145 - 146). In these tweets individuals may attempt to comfort other people or express concern for their welfare based on the knowledge that these others are in <b>danger</b> <b>or</b> <b>distress.</b>|$|E
