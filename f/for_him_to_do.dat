5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt made it impossible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in all cases, {{and most of the}} time these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|MacGregor {{joined the}} British Army at 16, the {{youngest}} age {{it was possible}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, in April 1803. His family purchased him a commission as an ensign in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot, probably for around £450. MacGregor's entrance to the military coincided with {{the start of the}} Napoleonic Wars following the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens. Southern England was fortified to defend against a possible French invasion; the 57th Foot was at Ashford, Kent. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to lieutenant—an advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in Guernsey with the regiment's 1st Battalion, the 57th Foot was posted to Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|Hershiser {{remained}} with the Dodgers briefly as a player-personnel consultant. He went to AAA Albuquerque and filed one report but there wasn't much <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so {{he left the}} position.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} very hard in this. The match was to be broken off without any notice to him; and when he requested, at any rate, to hear this decision {{from the mouth of}} the only person competent to make it, he was told that it was indelicate <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. This put his back up.|$|R

25|$|Following {{talks with}} the ECB, however, Pietersen then unreservedly {{committed}} his future to all forms of cricket for England in a video interview posted on YouTube.

He was replaced by Jonny Bairstow.|$|E
25|$|Iban Mayo, {{struggling}} the {{day before}} already, had trouble getting up the climbs from the first few meters yet again. He was also extremely annoyed by the cameraman following him and filming his struggle, as that camerman knew Mayo was probably {{going to give up}} and was waiting <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In the end Mayo was fined for 200 Swiss Francs for incorrect behaviour in front of the camera. He abandoned when the cameraman stopped following him.|$|E

25|$|Although Lebed was {{compared}} by some Western and Russian analysts to Augusto Pinochet and Napoleon Bonaparte, {{he was considered}} to the most popular candidate for the presidential election of 2000 during the second term of President Yeltsin. After getting elected as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai in 1998, however, he decided to stay in that position and did not run for president, despite calls <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. General Lebed held the position {{until his death in}} the 2002 helicopter crash.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} at Heinz, O'Reilly held roles as a major {{shareholder}} and chairman of several companies, including Waterford Wedgwood (1995–2009) and Independent News & Media, and of a major partnership of solicitors, Matheson, in Dublin. Provision <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this was written into his contract {{before he went to}} the United States. After he left Heinz, he focused on three of these: Independent News & Media; Waterford Wedgwood; and Fitzwilton; and later, for a brief time, eircom. He was the main shareholder in Arcon, the Irish base-metal mining company that developed the Galmoy lead-zinc deposit, the company being co-founded with Richard Conroy, and later sold to Lundin Mining in 2005. He also retained a 40% stake in Providence Resources Plc, the Irish-based oil and gas exploration and development company.|$|E
25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is the wrong thing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|E

25|$|French forces {{commanded}} by General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919. Gouraud {{was determined to}} bring all of Syria under French control and demanded the immediate deployment of French forces to the Beqaa Valley. Against King Faisal's wishes, his delegate to General Gouraud, Nuri al-Said, agreed to the French deployment. However, when a French officer was assaulted by Shia Muslim rebels opposed to the French presence, Gouraud violated his agreement with al-Said and occupied the large city of Baalbek. The French deployment along the Syrian coast and Beqaa contributed to unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between al-'Azma's camp and those who sought compromise with the French. On 10 December 1919, Prime Minister al-Rikabi resigned amid pressure <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by the nationalists and popular opinion. French forces later occupied parts of northern Syria in early July 1920.|$|E
25|$|After Morgoth's defeat, his {{lieutenant}} Sauron gradually rallied many of Morgoth's {{servants to}} his own cause, and during the Second Age established himself {{in the land of}} Mordor. Sauron lacked the raw power and malice of his master, but he seduced many to his allegiance with lies and false promises. In the Second Age, Sauron repeatedly used his fame among Men as Morgoth's erstwhile lieutenant to portray himself as Morgoth's representative and thus gain the allegiance of his former master's worshippers. Similarly, in Númenor following his capture, Sauron became very powerful by seducing Ar-Pharazôn to the worship of Melkor, establishing a Cult in which it was only natural that, as Melkor's foremost former disciple, he became high priest. This cult exploited the Númenórean fear of death by claiming that human sacrifice to Melkor would grant the Men of Númenor immortality. In actuality, by turning away from Eru and the Valar they only dwindled more rapidly. Sauron used this religion among his means of encouraging Ar-Pharazôn's invasion of Valinor, which resulted in the destruction of Númenor by Eru. By the Third Age Sauron came more often to propound himself, rather than Morgoth, as the object of worship for his servants and subjects, but in his pride also portrayed himself as Morgoth returned when it was more convenient <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

500|$|Phillips, {{who lives}} in the United Kingdom, {{sometimes}} has difficulty accurately portraying modern America and said [...] "1948 Hollywood might as well be sci-fi". Since there was not enough time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his own research and maintain a monthly schedule, Brubaker hired Amy Condit as a research assistant. Condit, who is the manager of the Los Angeles Police Museum, supplied Phillips with thousands of reference photos.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into {{a story about the}} relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is hard <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
500|$|In 1983 Kevin McClory, {{one of the}} {{original}} writers of the novel Thunderball, produced Never Say Never Again, a re-make of the 1965 film Thunderball. McClory's rights to the film were held separate to those of Eon Productions, although he {{had been one of the}} producers for {{the original}} Thunderball adaptation. The film marked the return of Sean Connery to the Bond role; he spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter might make him more memorable. [...] Smith and Lavington consider Casey to be [...] "the most compelling Felix Leiter since Jack Lord", although again there was little in the script <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

500|$|Barney Gumble is {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta. Early on the show, Castellaneta {{discovered}} {{that it was not}} easy <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, {{with the exception of the}} episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps.
