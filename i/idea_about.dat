5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It would {{have been one of the}} first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani {{came up with an}} <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, and the other a wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{the findings}} from a comparative study on existing and proposed science curricula of grades IX-X in Bangladesh. It aims to explore relevant research {{to find out what}} <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> science are recommended to include in school science curriculum, and then to compare the existing and proposed curricula in terms of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> science. This interpretive study analyzed curriculum documents and textbooks qualitatively, and the results reveal that the proposed science curriculum portrays more <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> science compared to the existing two science curricula. However, some important <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> science have not been portrayed well in the proposed curriculum, and therefore, there is a broad scope for improvement in communicating <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> science...|$|R

Based on three short stories and one novel, the paper will show how cultural <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> a foreign and distant culture are shaped through the reflection of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> one’s own culture...|$|R

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> making a film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous {{connections with the}} NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> getting The Rolling Stones to do {{a commercial for}} Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E
5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> the {{men with}} the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> Mort before the episode ends.|$|E

40|$|What {{makes the}} {{literary}} journalism classroom a particularly creative {{one is the}} permission to experiment. It is an opportunity {{towards the end of}} a degree program to rethink core <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> journalism, core <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> writing, core <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> ethics and core <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> how to bring all these ideas into alignment. This is the unique pedagogical value of literary journalism. It {{is one of the few}} areas of journalism that takes both the world and the personal immensely seriously. The symbolic and the factual, emotion and observation, the tangible and the intangible all jut up against one another. So it becomes one of the few opportunities within the journalism curriculum where the deeply personal – who am I and how do I express what is unique and important to me – is given space...|$|R

25|$|After {{successfully}} {{creating the}} first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like GZSZ, the format {{was based on}} an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled Verbotene Liebe, which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of Verbotene Liebe, the network turned Marienhof into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa-produced Unter uns in late 1994.|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{can give}} {{some sense of}} history when {{combined}} {{with a little bit}} more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E
25|$|These {{two events}} helped create an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> North among the Pawnee Scouts as having supernatural powers and being invulnerable to harm. The scouts served distinctively in the Battle of the Tongue River on August 29. In the fight, about 200 United States {{soldiers}} and 70 Indian Scouts (including 30 of the Pawnee) captured an Arapaho village containing about 500 people, mostly women and children, under Medicine Man. The few Arapaho warriors counterattacked but were repulsed by the soldiers' repeating carbine's and mountain howitzer's fire. Sixty-three Arapahos, mostly unarmed noncombatants {{were killed and}} eighteen {{women and children were}} captured and later released. Additionally, hundreds of Arapaho horses and ponies were shot after the battle. Five U.S. soldiers and Indian Scouts were killed or mortally wounded and an additional two were wounded in the battle.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} Junker Ove and Hilda suspect {{that they are}} in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> the ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] of the possible ways of approaching audience history is by focusing on the history of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> audiences. This article examines the benefits and shortcomings of such an approach and develops a set of methodological propositions, drawing on the principles and methods of the German tradition of Begriffsgeschichte (history of concepts). To demonstrate the usefulness of these propositions, the article briefly examines the <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> audiences in socialist Yugoslavia, focusing on the surge of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> politically engaged audiences in the late 1960 s. The concluding part of the article situates this historical episode in the wider geographical context and outlines possible avenues for a broader, transnational investigation of the history of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> audiences...|$|R
