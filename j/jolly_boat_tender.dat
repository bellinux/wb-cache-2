25|$|<b>Jolly</b> <b>boats</b> {{were usually}} the {{smallest}} type of boat carried on ships, and were generally between 16 and 18 feet long. They were clinker-built and propelled by four or six oars. When {{not in use}} the <b>jolly</b> <b>boat</b> normally hung from davits at the stern of a ship, and could be hoisted {{into and out of}} the water. <b>Jolly</b> <b>boats</b> were used for transporting people and goods to and from shore, for carrying out inspections of the ship, or other small tasks and duties that required only a small number of people, and did not need the use of the larger boats, such as the launch or cutter. <b>Jolly</b> <b>boats</b> were carried on practically all types of warships of the Royal Navy during the age of sail, from ships of the line down to sloops and brigs. Ships of the line would carry a barge, launch, pinnace, two cutters, all of various sizes, and a <b>jolly</b> <b>boat,</b> while the brigs might just carry a <b>jolly</b> <b>boat</b> and a cutter.|$|R

25|$|The {{application}} of the <b>jolly</b> <b>boat</b> was developed further during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly by the frigate commander Sir George Collier. Collier, who {{was active in the}} close blockade of the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, combined the features of a <b>jolly</b> <b>boat</b> with those of a whaleboat and found the result extremely seaworthy and particularly effective in carrying out shore landings. The design was particularly buoyant and was often described as a type of lifeboat. Several captains ordered these boats for their own ships, while the Admiralty considered the possibility of ordering a general replacement of old-style <b>jolly</b> <b>boats</b> with the new 'lifeboat' design on several occasions, but were deterred by the cost. By 1815 however the Stores Committee had authorised the replacement of the old-style <b>jolly</b> <b>boats</b> with the improved versions as and when it proved practical for a ship's commander to carry this out.|$|R
