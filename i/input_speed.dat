We present a novel approach that relies on compression. Users are required to compress text using a very simple abbreviation technique that yields an average keystrok reduction of 26. 4 %. Input text is automatically decoded using weighted finite-state transducers, incorporating both word-based and letter-based n-gram language models. Decoding yields a residual error rate of 3. 3 %.

5000|$|A {{subset of}} CVT designs are called {{infinitely}} variable transmissions (IVT or IVTs), {{in which the}} range of ratios of output shaft speed to input shaft speed includes a zero ratio that can be continuously approached from a defined [...] "higher" [...] ratio. A zero output speed (low gear) with a finite <b>input</b> <b>speed</b> implies an infinite input-to-output speed ratio, which can be continuously approached from a given finite input value with an IVT. Low gears are a reference to low ratios of output speed to <b>input</b> <b>speed.</b> This low ratio is taken to the extreme with IVTs, resulting in a [...] "neutral", or non-driving [...] "low" [...] gear limit, in which the output speed is zero. Unlike neutral in a normal automotive transmission, IVT output rotation may be prevented because the back-driving (reverse IVT operation) ratio may be infinite, resulting in impossibly high backdriving torque; in a ratcheting IVT, however, the output may freely rotate in the forward direction.|$|E
50|$|Known as an <b>input</b> <b>speed</b> sensor (ISS). This sensor sends a varying {{frequency}} {{signal to the}} TCU to determine the current rotational speed of the input shaft or torque converter. The TCU uses the input shaft speed to determine slippage across the torque converter and potentially to determine the rate of slippage across the bands and clutches. This information is vital to regulate {{the application of the}} torque converter lock-up clutch smoothly and effectively.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a streaming oriented PE-ring framework on FPGA for counting frequent items. Compared with the best existing FPGA implementation, our basic PE-ring framework saves 50 % lookup table resources cost and achieves the same throughput in a more scalable way. Furthermore, we adopt SIMD-like cascaded filter for further performance improvements, which outperforms the previous work by up to 3. 24 times in some data distributions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{based on}} the finite element method, the type of XB 1 - 120 - 100 {{harmonic}} drive output torque and <b>input</b> rotational <b>speed</b> impact on transmission efficiency has been analyzed. The {{results show that the}} efficiency of harmonic gear drive increases with the output torque increased, and it has no relation with <b>input</b> rotational <b>speed.</b> When the output shaft takes the value of rated torque (Tout= 450 Nm), the transmission efficiency of harmonic gear drive obtained by the finite element numerical simulation is 87. 1 %. This value of transmission efficiency is quite close to the type of XB 1 - 120 - 100 harmonic drive efficiency (75 %- 90 %). The above analysis method and results have a guiding significance for the transmission design and performance analysis of harmonic gear drive...|$|R
30|$|Driving {{cycles and}} {{constant}} velocity condition are compared between the simulation {{results and the}} drum test results. The car driveline simulation model demonstrates better accuracy in terms of driving cycles and constant velocity condition at speeds below 120  km/h. The largest error of the results between the car driveline simulations and the real car drum tests for driving cycles is 4.099 %, which is 5.449 % under constant velocity condition in driver control mode and 4.2 % under constant velocity condition in automatic cruise mode. Good agreements among the ratios, <b>input</b> <b>speeds,</b> and <b>input</b> torques are found between simulation results and the real car drum test results. The contrastive results confirm that the car driveline simulation model based on CVT efficiencies, which are measured from a bench test, exhibits good performance and can accurately forecast fuel consumption under different driving conditions.|$|R

50|$|A {{magnetic}} {{continuous variable}} transmission system was developed at the University of Sheffield in 2006 and later commercialized. mCVT is a variable magnetic transmission which gives an electrically controllable gear ratio. It {{can act as a}} power split device and can match a fixed <b>input</b> <b>speed</b> from a prime-mover to a variable load by importing/exporting electrical power through a variator path. The mCVT is of particular interest as a highly efficient power-split device for blended parallel hybrid vehicles, but also has potential applications in renewable energy, marine propulsion and industrial drive sectors.|$|E
50|$|A {{constant}} speed drive (CSD) is a mechanical gearbox that takes {{an input shaft}} rotating at {{a wide range of}} speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a {{constant speed}}, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators, that require a constant <b>input</b> <b>speed.</b> Constant speed drives are usually found as part of the accessory drives of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines.

50|$|As a fluid {{coupling}} operates kinetically, low viscosity fluids are preferred. Generally speaking, multi-grade motor oils or automatic transmission fluids are used. Increasing {{density of the}} fluid increases the amount of torque that can be transmitted at a given <b>input</b> <b>speed.</b> However, hydraulic fluids, much like other fluids, are subject to changes in viscosity with temperature change. This leads {{to a change in}} transmission performance and so where unwanted performance/efficiency change has to be kept to a minimum, a motor oil or automatic transmission fluid, with a high viscosity index should be used.|$|E
50|$|Many {{distortion}} {{effects can}} be more clearly understood in video, such as effects of speed and distance, notably parallax. Further, in addition to lengths in the output being inverse to speed in the <b>input,</b> <b>speed</b> in the output is inverse to speed in the input. In the extreme, a stationary point in one strip in the input becomes a stripe across a single frame in the output, approximating crossing the frame at infinite speed. Further, mirrors in the input function as mirrors in the output, and due to parallax (reflections are further away), reflections move faster than the images they are reflecting.|$|E
50|$|When {{the current}} is applied, it creates {{magnetic}} flux. This passes into the rotor {{portion of the}} field. The hysteresis disk physically passes through the rotor, without touching it. These disks {{have the ability to}} become magnetized depending upon the strength of the flux (this dissipates as flux is removed). This means, as the rotor rotates, magnetic drag between the rotor and the hysteresis disk takes place causing rotation. In a sense, the hysteresis disk is pulled after the rotor. Depending upon the output torque required, this pull eventually can match the <b>input</b> <b>speed,</b> giving a 100% lockup.|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} addresses {{two issues}} that will be crucial in the successful development of emerging multimodal user interfaces: how the problem of interpretation errors can be addressed, and how to evaluate such applications. We present results from a user study that compares multimodal correction methods with conventional correction methods (with and without keyboard input). The study confirms the hypothesis that multimodal correction expedites keyboard-less correction in speech user interfaces. Choice between modalities for experienced users is driven by correction accuracy; however there is initially a strong bias towards using speech. We also present a performance model of multimodal human-computer interaction that predicts <b>input</b> <b>speeds</b> including the time necessary for correction of recognition errors. We apply the model to important issues in speech user interfaces, such as what recognition accuracy is necessary to make multimodal input faster than typing, and we extrapolate results from the user study. To evaluate multimodal applications more effectively, a combination of user studies and modelbased predictions is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Steerable needles can {{potentially}} increase the accu-racy of needle-based diagnosis and therapy delivery, provided {{they can be}} adequately controlled based on medical image information. We propose a novel sliding mode control law {{that can be used}} to deliver the tip of a flexible asymmetric-tipped needle to a desired point, or to track a desired trajectory within tissue. The proposed control strategy requires no a priori knowledge of model parame-ters, has bounded <b>input</b> <b>speeds,</b> and requires little computational resources. We show that if the standard nonholonomic model for tip-steered needles holds, then the control law will converge to de-sired targets in a reachable workspace, within a tolerance that can be defined by the control parameters. Experimental results vali-date the control law for target points and trajectory following in phantom tissue and ex vivo liver. Experiments with targets that move during insertion illustrate robustness to disturbances caused by tissue deformation.

50|$|The {{movement}} {{of an ideal}} joint is generally associated with a subgroup {{of the group of}} Euclidean displacements. The number of parameters in the subgroup is called the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the joint.Mechanical linkages are usually designed to transform a given input force and movement into a desired output force and movement. The ratio of the output force to the input force is known as the mechanical advantage of the linkage, while the ratio of the <b>input</b> <b>speed</b> to the output speed is known as the speed ratio. The speed ratio and mechanical advantage are defined so they yield the same number in an ideal linkage.|$|E
50|$|Fleksy is a {{third party}} virtual {{keyboard}} extension and input method for touchscreen devices, which attempts to improve traditional tap-typing <b>input</b> <b>speed</b> and accuracy through enhanced auto-correct and gesture control.
