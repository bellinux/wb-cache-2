5|$|The <b>ink</b> <b>sac</b> of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the <b>ink</b> <b>sac.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, {{but they can also}} use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the <b>ink</b> <b>sac.</b> The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish have ink, like squid and octopus species, {{which they}} use to help evade predators. This ink is stored inside an <b>ink</b> <b>sac.</b>|$|E

50|$|The extant genera all possess <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> {{that open}} into their cloacae {{from which they}} can produce a cloud of black ink when {{threatened}} (as in many cephalopods).|$|R
25|$|In females, the <b>ink</b> <b>sac</b> {{is hidden}} from view {{by a pair of}} white nidamental glands, which lie {{anterior}} to the gills. Also, red-spotted accessory nidamental glands are present. Both organs are associated with nutrient manufacture and shells for the eggs. Females also have a large translucent ovary, situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass.|$|E
25|$|Squid {{have three}} hearts. Two branchial hearts feed the gills, each {{surrounding}} the larger systemic heart that pumps blood around the body. Squid blood contains the copper-rich protein hemocyanin for transporting oxygen. The faintly greenish hearts {{are surrounded by}} the renal sacs – the main excretory system. The kidneys are difficult to identify and stretch from the hearts (located at the posterior side of the <b>ink</b> <b>sac)</b> to the liver. The systemic heart is made of three chambers, a lower ventricle and two upper auricles.|$|E
25|$|Like all cephalopods, squid have complex {{digestive}} systems. The muscular {{stomach is}} found roughly in {{the midpoint of}} the visceral mass. From there, the bolus moves into the caecum for digestion. The caecum, a long, white organ, is found next to the ovary or testis. In mature squid, more priority is given to reproduction such that the stomach and caecum often shrivel up during the later life stages. Finally, food goes to the liver (or digestive gland), found at the siphon end, for absorption. Solid waste is passed out of the rectum. Beside the rectum is the <b>ink</b> <b>sac,</b> which allows a squid to rapidly discharge black ink into the mantle cavity.|$|E
5000|$|Phragmoteuthis is a genus of coleoid {{cephalopod}} {{known from}} the late Triassic to the lower Jurassic. [...] Its soft tissue has been preserved; some specimens contain intact <b>ink</b> <b>sacs,</b> and others, gills. [...] It had an internal phragmocone and ten arms.|$|R
50|$|Although mastigoteuthids possess <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> (which could suggest {{forays into}} shallower, lit waters), all {{observations}} {{have been over}} the bottom in deep water. Deep-sea squids commonly possess ink. The squid seem to lack the ability of rapid jet propulsion and instead rely on their large fins.|$|R
50|$|The {{suborder}} {{is named}} for small, cilia-like strands (cirri) on {{the arms of the}} octopus, a pair for each sucker. These are thought to play some role in feeding, perhaps by creating currents of water that help bring food closer to the beak. Cirrate octopuses are noteworthy for lacking <b>ink</b> <b>sacs.</b>|$|R
500|$|The spermatophores {{of males}} are about [...] long and 0.15mm wide. The <b>ink</b> <b>sac</b> is pear-shaped, with a silvery blue-green outer layer. The vane of the gladius (the rigid {{internal}} {{remnants of the}} mollusc shell) is oval-shaped and pointed at both ends (lanceolate). It has a broad midrib (rachis).|$|E
500|$|Cephalopods {{have existed}} for 500 million years and octopus {{ancestors}} {{were in the}} Carboniferous seas 300 million years ago. The oldest known octopus fossil is Pohlsepia, which lived 296 million years ago. Researchers have identified impressions of eight arms, two eyes, and possibly an <b>ink</b> <b>sac.</b> Octopuses are mostly soft tissue, and so fossils are relatively rare. Octopuses, squids and cuttlefish belong to the clade Coleoidea. They are known as [...] "soft-bodied" [...] cephalopods, lacking the external shell of most molluscs and other cephalopods like the Nautiloids and the extinct Ammonoidea. Octopuses have eight arms like other coleoids but lack the extra specialised feeding appendages known as tentacles which are longer and thinner with suckers only at their club-like ends. The vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis) also lacks tentacles but has sensory filaments.|$|E
500|$|The specimen's head, mantle, and dorsal {{arms were}} covered in warts of varying sizes. Chun {{measured}} the specimen's mantle as being 99 millimeters wide and 80 millimeters long. The specimen's head was {{as wide as the}} mantle, and was dominated by large eyes, which were measured as 38 millimeters wide and 53 millimeters long, with sickle-shaped pupils. Chun described the arms as being [...] "well developed", and noted that the dorsal arms were the longest, and the arms got shorter as they moved to the ventral end. V. togata has a single line of suckers on each arm. Chun described the membranes on the arms in detail, stating that [...] "The arms bear dorsal and ventral membranes. The ventral margins are unusually large and extend to the tip of all arms. They are not restricted to the ventral surface but also extend to the dorsal margin of the neighboring ventral arms, where they again continue to the tip, but are more weakly developed.". The hectocotylus is on the third arm. V. togata contains an <b>ink</b> <b>sac,</b> but it is tiny and does not contain any ink, a common trait in cephalopods that live in deep water where {{there is little or no}} light.|$|E

She became {{an expert on}} the fossils {{to be found in the}} Blue Lias around the town and discovered the first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton at The Spittles. Other important discoveries of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and a pterosaur followed, as well as invertebrates such as cephalopods and their <b>ink</b> <b>sacs.</b>|$|R
50|$|O. joubini often seeks {{shelter from}} predators in empty clamshells, cans or small openings, pulling the opening closed with its arms, {{combining}} {{sand and gravel}} to form a lid. It employs the two defensive mechanisms typical of all octopuses: <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> and camouflage. All Cephalopods have chromatophores, special pigmented and light reflecting cells on their skin which allows them to change colour and texture quickly.|$|R
2500|$|Although ammonites {{do occur}} in {{exceptional}} lagerstatten {{such as the}} Solnhofen limestone, their soft part record is surprisingly bleak. Beyond a tentative <b>ink</b> <b>sac</b> and possible digestive organs, no soft parts are known at all. [...] They likely bore a radula and beak, a marginal siphuncle, and ten arms. [...] They operated by direct development with sexual reproduction, were carnivorous, and had a crop for food storage. [...] They are unlikely to have dwelt in fresh or brackish water. Many ammonites were likely filter feeders, so adaptations associated with this lifestyle like sieves probably occurred.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the Nautilidae and the species of octopus belonging to the suborder Cirrina, all known cephalopods have an <b>ink</b> <b>sac,</b> which can be used to expel a cloud of dark ink to confuse predators. This sac is a muscular bag which originated {{as an extension of the}} hind gut. [...] It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents – almost pure melanin – can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel means the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion. [...] The ejected cloud of melanin is usually mixed, upon expulsion, with mucus, produced elsewhere in the mantle, and therefore forms a thick cloud, resulting in visual (and possibly chemosensory) impairment of the predator, like a smokescreen. However, a more sophisticated behaviour has been observed, in which the cephalopod releases a cloud, with a greater mucus content, that approximately resembles the cephalopod that released it (this decoy is referred to as a Pseudomorph). This strategy often results in the predator attacking the pseudomorph, rather than its rapidly departing prey. For more information, see Inking behaviors.|$|E
6000|$|Husband {{and wife}} walked {{slowly in the}} {{afternoon}} sunlight across the still beautiful garden. Each was gravely aware of an embarrassed incapacity for the task they had set themselves. They {{were going to talk}} things over. Never in their lives had they really talked to each other clearly and honestly about anything. Indeed it is scarcely too much to say that neither had ever talked about anything to anyone. She was too young, her mind was now growing up in her and feeling its way to conscious expression, and he had never before wanted to express himself. He did now want to express himself. For behind his rant and fury Sir Isaac had been thinking very hard indeed during the last three weeks about his life and her life and their relations; he had never thought so much about anything except his business economics. So far he had either joked at her, talked [...] "silly" [...] to her, made, as they say, [...] "remarks," [...] or vociferated. That had been the sum of their mental intercourse, as indeed it is the sum of the intercourse of most married couples. His attempt to state his case to her had so far always flared into rhetorical outbreaks. But he was discontented with these rhetorical outbreaks. His dispositions to fall into them made him rather like a nervous sepia that cannot keep its <b>ink</b> <b>sac</b> quiet while it is sitting for its portrait. In the earnestness of his attempt at self-display he vanished in his own outpourings.|$|E
50|$|The ink is {{released}} from the <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> (located between the gills) and is dispersed more widely when its release {{is accompanied by a}} jet of water from the siphon. Its dark colour is caused by its main constituent, melanin. Each species of cephalopod produces slightly differently coloured inks; generally, octopuses produce black ink, squid ink is blue-black, and cuttlefish ink is a shade of brown.|$|R

40|$|Melanin is a {{ubiquitous}} biological pigment {{found in}} bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. It has a {{diverse range of}} ecological and biochemical functions including display, evasion, photoprotection, detoxification, and metal scavenging. Two forms of melanin produced from different molecular precursors are present in nature - eumelanin (dark brown-black in color) and pheomelanin (orange-red in color). Both eumelanin and pheomelanin are complex highly cross-linked biopolymers that are found intertwined with proteins, lipids, and metal ions in nature. Recent reports have used morphological evidence to suggest the presence of melanin in the fossil record. These studies have been met with criticism due to their lack of chemical evidence to support melanin identification. This dissertation describes chemical approaches to unambiguously verify the presence of melanin in the fossil record and characterize the ancient pigment. It also explores the limitations {{for the survival of}} melanin in the fossil record and the possibility that melanin acts as a protective matrix to preserve other biomolecules that are embedded in the pigment. Melanin has unique chemical signatures that are commonly used to characterize and compare the pigment of modern organisms. We applied these chemical approaches to the study of fossil pigmentation. Analysis of the black pigmentation of two > 160 million year old (Mya) Jurassic cephalopod <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> provided the first conclusive evidence for eumelanin in the fossil record. The preserved fossil eumelanin was then compared to modern cephalopod eumelanin from Sepia officinalis. Using these chemical approaches we found that fossil eumelanin was chemically and morphologically identical to S. officinalis eumelanin. 	Although there is mounting chemical evidence for the presence and preservation of melanin in the fossil record, there is very little data constraining its long-term survival. We applied the analytical approaches designed to study fossil melanins and techniques used to study fossil sediments to compare the fossil inks from three deposits of similar age and lithology, but different maturation histories. Specifically, two ~ 180 Mya fossil <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> from a site that has entered the oil window in Holzmaden, Germany were compared to the previously analyzed fossil inks from two less mature sites in southern England. The chemistry of eumelanin was shown to alter {{at the onset of the}} oil window regardless of the age of the specimen. The decrease in surviving melanin was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of organic macromolecular material (kerogen), but no consistent change in melanin morphology. 	Finally, the role of melanin as a matrix that enhances the preservation of other biomolecules in the fossil record was considered. Proteins, commonly associated with melanin in modern organisms, were discovered in the aforementioned fossil <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> during full-scale chemical analysis. The amino acid profile of the protein in each fossil specimen was determined with an amino acid analyzer and compared to the amino acid profile the protein in modern S. officinalis. Statistical analysis of the amino acid distributions indicated that there is no significant difference between the amino acid profile of modern and fossil melanins. In order to verify the ancient origin of the amino acids in the fossil <b>ink</b> <b>sacs,</b> the ratio of D/L amino acid isomers was determined. While the proteins of living organisms consist of only L-amino acids, post-mortem the amino acids slowly convert from L to D form until they reach equilibrium (D/L = 1). This process is called racemization. The amino acids in the fossil <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> were racemized, which suggests their ancient origin. This marks the oldest determination of protein in a fossil system and provides evidence that the longevity of proteins may be enhanced when associated with melanin. Dissertatio...|$|R
50|$|Adult squid {{have several}} {{distinguishing}} features. The mantle encloses the visceral {{mass of the}} squid, and has two fins, which are not the primary method of propulsion. Instead, the squid has a siphon, a muscle which takes in water from one side, and pushes it out the other side: jet propulsion. The squid has eight arms and two tentacles with suction cups along the backs. In between the arms sits the mouth, or beak. Inside the mouth is a tooth-tongue-like appendage called the radula. Squid have <b>ink</b> <b>sacs,</b> which they use as a defense mechanism against possible predators. Squid also have three hearts.|$|R
50|$|Cephalopod ink has, as {{its name}} suggests, {{been used in the}} past as ink; indeed, the Greek name for {{cuttlefish}}, and the taxonomic name of a cuttlefish genus, Sepia, is associated with the brown colour of cuttlefish ink (for more information, see sepia). Modern use of cephalopod ink is generally limited to cooking, where it is used as a food colouring and flavouring, for example in pasta and sauces. For this purpose it is generally obtainable from fishmongers or gourmet food suppliers.

40|$|Phenoloxidase (PO) from <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> of Octopus ocellatus was {{purified}} by gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, and characterized {{in terms}} of its biochemical and enzymatic properties by using L-dihy-droxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as the specific substrate. It was found that prophenoloxidase from O. ocellatus was isolated as a heterodimeric protein of 153. 8 kDa, and two subunits of 75. 6 and 73. 0 kDa were often detected in preparations after SDS activation. The PO-like activity showed optimal pH of 7. 0, optimal temperature of 408 C, and an apparent Km value of 3. 1 mM on L-DOPA, and 6. 3 mM on catechol, respect-ively. The PO-like activity was extremely sensitive to 1 -phenyl- 2 -thiourea and sodium sulfite, and very sensi-tive to ascorbic acid, thiourea, citric acid, and benzoic acid. Together with its specific enzyme activity on cate-chol and L-DOPA, it can be concluded that the Octopus PO is most probably a typical o-diphenoloxidase. The PO-like activity was also strongly inhibited by Cu 21, Zn 21, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and diethyl-dithiocarbamate (DETC), and the DETC-inhibited PO-like activity could be perfectly restored by Cu 21. These results indicated that Octopus PO is most prob-ably a copper-containing metalloenzyme. All these results implied that the PO from O. ocellatus has the properties of a catechol-type copper-containing o-diphe-noloxidase which functions not only as a catalytic enzyme in melanin production in <b>ink</b> <b>sacs</b> but also as a humoral factor in host defense via melaninization as in other crustaceans...|$|R
