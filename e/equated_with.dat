5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> Osiris.|$|E
5|$|A {{contradictory}} figure, Caion was <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently unsubstantiated {{allegations against}} Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians.

40|$|Four major climato-environmental phases {{have been}} {{identified}} in the Eastern Cape, Plettenberg Bay-Knysna region and Little Karoo between somewhat before ~ 40 000 cal. a BP and the present: the Birnam Interstadial from before 40 000 cal. a BP until ~ 24 000 cal. a BP; the Bottelnek Stadial (apparently <b>equating</b> <b>with</b> the Last Glacial Maximum) from ~ 24 000 cal. a BP until before ~ 18 350 cal. a BP; the Aliwal North (apparently <b>equating</b> <b>with</b> the Late Glacial) from before ~ 18 350 cal. a BP until ~ 11 000 cal. a BP; the Dinorben (apparently <b>equating</b> <b>with</b> the Holocene) from ~ 11 000 cal. a BP until the present.

5|$|As the sun, the Eye of Ra is {{a source}} of heat and light, and it is {{associated}} with fire and flames. It is also <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the red light that appears before sunrise, and with the morning star that precedes and signals the sun's arrival.|$|E
5|$|In his history, Harry Altham {{wrote that}} the 1884 Australians have been <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the 1882 team but he himself {{disagreed}} with that assessment.

However, the concepts of those keystone texts cannot be <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> Taoism as a whole.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
5|$|The Eye of Ra was {{involved}} {{in many areas of}} ancient Egyptian religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> it. Its life-giving power was celebrated in temple rituals, and its dangerous aspect was invoked in the protection of the pharaoh, of sacred places, and of ordinary people and their homes.|$|E

5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea of a}} Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E

5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> Salitis, {{then the}} seals of Sheshi {{discovered}} in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 13th Dynasty {{as soon as they}} arrived in the Nile Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of Gebelein. According to Manetho as reported by Josephus in Against Apion, Salitis reigned from Memphis, and fortified the existing town of Avaris, which was to become the Hyksos' seat of power.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{tears of}} the Eye of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the Eye can also be <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{design was}} a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture. It was a greatly elaborated variant {{on the design of}} an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ba, or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the Duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.|$|E
5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is <b>equated</b> <b>with</b> the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
