5|$|Christ's agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:43–44) – {{included}} by {{the original}} scribe, marked by the first corrector as <b>doubtful,</b> but the third corrector (c) removed the mark.|$|E
5|$|Codrington and {{archaeologist}} Frank Elgee {{consider the}} structure was flanked {{in a few}} sections by lateral parallel ditches but Hayes is <b>doubtful</b> whether {{they were part of}} the original construction or if they even existed.|$|E
5|$|In Luke 11:4 ἀλλὰ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ (but deliver us from evil) {{included}} by {{the original}} scribe, marked by the first corrector (a) as <b>doubtful,</b> but the third corrector (c) removed the mark.|$|E
5|$|Matthew 24:36 – phrase ουδε ο υιος (nor the Son) {{the first}} {{corrector}} marked as <b>doubtful,</b> {{but the second}} corrector (b) removed the mark.|$|E
5|$|Melvyn Douglas as Homer Bannon: Hud's father, Lonnie's {{grandfather}} {{and owner of}} the Bannon ranch. Although Paramount was <b>doubtful</b> about casting him due to his heart condition, Martin Ritt insisted that he was the right actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|The Baronetage Committee was {{established}} by a 1910 Order in Council, during Edward VII's reign, to scrutinise all succession claims (and thus reject <b>doubtful</b> ones) {{to be placed on}} the Roll of Baronets.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury praised Æthelnoth's wisdom. A {{story of}} <b>doubtful</b> {{authenticity}} tells how {{he refused to}} crown King Harold Harefoot, as he had promised Cnut to crown none but a son of the king by his wife, Emma.|$|E
5|$|The meteoritic {{hypothesis}} is now viewed by geologists as <b>doubtful.</b> The British Natural History Museum {{suggests that it}} may be a pseudometeorite, in other words a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.|$|E
5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that it is <b>doubtful</b> that he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cylinder}} passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains <b>doubtful,</b> further tests {{can be applied}} to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{a team of}} Mayanists {{including}} Coe {{published a}} review of the evidence and presented further arguments in support of the authenticity of the document; in 2017, a critical review of the argument by Bruce Love concluded that the alleged codex's authenticity remains <b>doubtful.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and <b>doubtful.</b> They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|The Big Six and {{the cabinet}} spent August 13 debating their {{reply to the}} Allied response, but {{remained}} deadlocked. Meanwhile, the Allies grew <b>doubtful,</b> waiting for the Japanese to respond. The Japanese had been instructed that they could transmit an unqualified acceptance in the clear, but in fact they sent out coded messages on matters unrelated to the surrender parlay. The Allies took this coded response as non-acceptance of the terms.|$|E
5|$|Trachylepis tschudii is {{an enigmatic}} skink, purportedly from Peru. First {{described}} in 1845 {{on the basis}} of a single specimen, it may be the same as the Noronha skink (T.atlantica) from Fernando de Noronha, off northeastern Brazil. T.tschudii represents one of two <b>doubtful</b> records of the otherwise African genus Trachylepis on mainland South America; the other is T.maculata from Guyana.|$|E
5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This <b>doubtful</b> attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Between the 4th and 12th centuries, {{seven or}} more correctors {{worked on this}} codex, {{making it one of}} the most {{corrected}} manuscripts in existence. Tischendorf during his investigation in Petersburg enumerated 14,800 corrections only in the portion which was held in Petersburg (2/3 of the codex). According to David C. Parker the full codex has about 23,000 corrections. In addition to these corrections some letters were marked by dots as <b>doubtful</b> (e.g. ṪḢ). Corrections represent the Byzantine text-type, just like corrections in codices: Bodmer II, Regius (L), Ephraemi (C), and Sangallensis (Δ). They were discovered by E.A. Button.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was <b>doubtful,</b> they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E
5|$|Cameron Rahles-Rahbula, {{competing}} at {{his fourth}} Winter Paralympics, was named as the Australian flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony. After being named flag bearer, Rahles-Rahbula had a skiing training accident {{that made his}} participation <b>doubtful.</b> He went on to carry the flag but withdrew from the Games on medical advice. At Opening Ceremony, the entire Australian team of nine athletes, coaches, medical staff and administration officials wore the black arm bands to remember Matthew Robinson, who had recently {{died as a result}} of a skiing accident. Ben Tudhope, the youngest competitor at the Games, carried the Australian flag at the Closing Ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{improved}} as a blocker in {{his second}} season with the Eagles. At the start of training camp in 1992, Davis vowed to refuse all requests for interviews by the media in an attempt to focus on getting better. In the season-opener against the New Orleans Saints, Davis helped the Eagles lead the NFC in rushing for the week with 186yards. Against the Washington Redskins in week seven on October 18, 1992, he suffered a knee sprain after quarterback Randall Cunningham ran into him. He was listed as <b>doubtful</b> before the following game against the Phoenix Cardinals, and did not play in the game. He was listed as <b>doubtful</b> again before the game against the Dallas Cowboys in week nine. Otho Davis, the team's head athletic trainer, said Davis was not working hard enough to rehabilitate his knee. Antone Davis was upgraded to questionable two days before the game, and started against the Cowboys on November 1. In the wild card playoff game against the Saints on January 3, 1993, Davis gave up a sack against Rickey Jackson, which caused a Cunningham fumble. Davis started in all 15 games he played during the regular season, and started in both of the team's playoff games. Pro Football Weekly rated Davis as the 26th-best offensive tackle in the league for the season.|$|E
5|$|Guest became {{acquainted with}} Fred Hopley, who had {{recently}} been practising in Bulawayo. He informed Guest that a solicitor in Bulawayo, Louis Champion, wanted someone to take over his practice for six months while he was away on a shooting trip. Guest's application was accepted by return of post and {{he was asked to}} report early in July 1910. Champion's practice, as Deputy Sheriff, consisted mainly of debt-collecting and lending money to <b>doubtful</b> borrowers at a high rate of interest.|$|E
5|$|Having won 15 out {{of their}} 18 ODIs leading up {{the start of the}} tournament, the {{defending}} champions Australia were deemed one of the favourites to reach the semi-finals. They had previously won the 1987 and 1999 tournaments. In contrast, some commentators considered it <b>doubtful</b> whether India would qualify for the Super Sixes stage. They had won the competition once, in 1983, but had recently lost an ODI series against West Indies at home, and were defeated heavily in their tour of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted. Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; a miracle in a Manx chronicle {{may or may not}} have Domhnall as its subject; and a <b>doubtful</b> charter surviving from a similarly late era was allegedly issued by him.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, {{when he was}} eighteen, Monteux {{married a}} fellow student, the pianist Victoria Barrière. With her he played the {{complete}} Beethoven violin sonatas in public. Neither family approved of the marriage; although the Monteux family were not religious, both they and the Roman Catholic Barrières were <b>doubtful</b> about an inter-religious marriage; furthermore, both families thought the couple too young to marry. There were {{a son and a}} daughter from the union.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained <b>doubtful</b> it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very <b>doubtful)</b> stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the <b>Doubtful</b> Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge {{that he ought to}} look away. The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of the}} few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. It is a common and {{abundant}} species in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it grows saprobically, feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various oak species. First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a <b>doubtful</b> species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E
5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} <b>doubtful</b> {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are <b>doubtful</b> of the version of Theophanes Continuatus. It {{would have been very}} unusual for a former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a thematic strategos, and there is reason to doubt the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an—otherwise unknown—daughter in marriage.|$|E
5|$|Numerous globes {{purported to}} have been owned by Hitler exist {{throughout}} the world, although the authenticity of many of them is <b>doubtful.</b> There are {{a total of three}} in Berlin, one at a geographical institute, another at the Marcher Museum, and the third at the German Historical Museum. Another two reside in public collections in Munich. Many of the globes show Germany with a bullet hole or simply wiped out, an act committed out of contempt by either Soviet or American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Of the 7,402 {{species of}} {{flowering}} plants {{occurring in the}} Western Ghats, 5,588 species are native or indigenous and 376 are exotics naturalised and 1,438 species are cultivated or planted as ornamentals. Among the indigenous species, 2,253 species are endemic to India and of them, 1,273 species are exclusively confined to the Western Ghats. Apart from 593 confirmed subspecies and varieties; 66 species, 5 subspecies and 14 varieties of <b>doubtful</b> occurrence are also reported and therefore amounting 8,080 taxa of flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he stood some chance of recovery, but were <b>doubtful</b> that he would ever be able to play football again.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Muḥammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians {{in order to establish}} a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is <b>doubtful.</b> According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E
5|$|Suspicions soon arose that Bogdan-Pitești {{had become}} a veritable agent of influence. According to Zambaccian, it was Bogdan-Pitești who {{actually}} dropped a hint that his support for Germany was a lucrative employment. Through various notes in scattered diaries, most {{of which have been}} lost, Caragiale reputedly accused Bogdan-Pitești taking Germany's money to promote her interests in Romania, and to assist her foreign propaganda effort. Such assessments, like Caragiale's allegation that Bogdan-Pitești was not knowledgeable in art, reflected conflicts between the two figures, and their overall reliability remains <b>doubtful.</b> It is however possible that Caragiale himself borrowed, and never returned, some 10,000 lei, siphoned out of the German propaganda funds by Bogdan-Pitești.|$|E
5|$|The Augustan History {{contains}} {{details of}} Zenobia's early life, although their credibility is <b>doubtful.</b> According to Augustan History, the queen's hobby {{as a child}} was hunting. Apparently not a commoner, she would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. According to the Augustan History, {{in addition to her}} Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, Zenobia was reportedly fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. Around age 14 (c. 255) she became the second wife of Odaenathus, the ras (lord) of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} a lengthy production period, taking {{over a year}} for the casting to be completed and another year and three months for editing. Burshtein, who was <b>doubtful</b> as to how much of the process would be completed, took a step-by-step approach, focusing first on the writing, then on accumulating enough funding for the project, followed by the filming and editing. Burshtein became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to direct a film intended for wide distribution. The film premiered at the 69th Venice Film Festival on 1 September 2012 and was later released in the United States on 24 May 2013.|$|E
