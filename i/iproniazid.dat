2500|$|After the {{discovery}} of monoamine oxidase (MAO), numerous studies were conducted to determine the biological importance of monoamines.

50|$|Isoniazid, <b>iproniazid,</b> hydralazine, and {{phenelzine}} are medications whose molecules contain hydrazine-like structures.|$|E
50|$|Isoniazid, {{along with}} <b>iproniazid</b> - a related drug - {{were among the}} first drugs to be {{referred}} to as antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iproniazid</b> is {{no longer}} used because it caused an {{unacceptable}} incidence in jaundice. Nevertheless related agents such as phenelzine and isocarboxazid {{are still on the}} market.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, <b>iproniazid,</b> an antimycobacterial agent, was {{discovered}} to have psychoactive properties while researched {{as a possible}} treatment for tuberculosis. Researchers noted that patients given <b>iproniazid</b> became cheerful, more optimistic, and more physically active. Soon after its development, <b>iproniazid</b> and related substances were shown to slow enzymatic breakdown of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine via inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase. For this reason, this class of drugs became known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or MAOIs. During this time development of distinctively different antidepressant agents was also researched. Imipramine became the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). Imipramine was found to affect numerous neurotransmitter systems and to block reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin from the synapse, therefore increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters. Use of MAOIs and TCAs gave major advances in treatment of depression but their use was limited by unpleasant side effects and significant safety and toxicity issues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iproniazid,</b> an {{inhibitor}} of MAO, {{was noted}} to elevate mood in depressed {{patients in the}} early 1950s, and soon thereafter was shown to {{lead to an increase}} in NA and 5-HT.|$|E
5000|$|The {{so-called}} golden era also {{covers the}} discovery of the first monoamine oxidase inhibitor, <b>iproniazid</b> (Marsilid), which is hydrazine based. Like imipramine, this also was used in the treatment of depression.|$|E
50|$|MAOIs {{started off}} {{due to the}} serendipitous {{discovery}} that <b>iproniazid</b> was a potent MAO inhibitor (MAOI). Originally intended {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis, in 1952, iproniazid's antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that the depressed patients given <b>iproniazid</b> experienced a relief of their depression. Subsequent in vitro work led to the discovery that it inhibited MAO and eventually to the monoamine theory of depression. MAOIs became widely used as antidepressants in the early 1950s. The discovery of the 2 isoenzymes of MAO has {{led to the development of}} selective MAOIs that may have a more favorable side-effect profile.|$|E

50|$|<b>Iproniazid</b> (Marsilid, Rivivol, Euphozid, Iprazid, Ipronid, Ipronin) is a non-selective, {{irreversible}} {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor (MAOI) of the hydrazine class. It was discontinued {{in most of}} the world in the 1960s, but remained in use in France until fairly recently.|$|E

50|$|Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, {{the company}} was early on known for {{producing}} various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and {{is a leader in}} this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, <b>iproniazid,</b> was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. <b>Iproniazid,</b> however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.|$|E
50|$|Tranylcypromine was {{originally}} developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although {{it was first}} synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like isoniazid and <b>iproniazid,</b> a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>iproniazid</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{antidepressants}} ever marketed, amphetamine (marketed as Benzedrine from 1935, for [...] "mild depression", amid other indications) predates it; and frankincense has been marketed traditionally for millennia for, among other things, altering mood, although it was not until 2012 that one of the components of its smoke was found to have antidepressant effects in mice.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iproniazid</b> was {{the result}} of a failed {{medicinal}} chemistry attempt to improve on the anti-tubercular activity of isoniazid. It was first given to patients suffering from tuberculosis where a surprising but wholly unexpected improvement in mood was noticed. Nathan Kline coined the term [...] "psychic energizer" [...] to account for this effect and posited that they be used in the treatment of depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iproniazid</b> was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} treatment of tuberculosis, but in 1952, its antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that patients given isoniazid became inappropriately happy. Subsequently N-isopropyl addition led to development as an antidepressant and was approved for use in 1958. It was withdrawn a few years later in 1961 due to a high incidence of hepatitis, and was replaced by less hepatotoxic drugs such as phenelzine and isocarboxazid.|$|E

50|$|Encouraged by {{his success}} with this tranquilizer, Kline {{investigated}} {{the properties of}} antidepressants. Within a year, patients in psychiatric centers throughout the US were receiving antidepressant medication. In 1964, Kline earned his second Lasker Award {{for the study of}} the introduction and use of <b>iproniazid,</b> a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, in the treatment of severe depression. This successful use of drugs for two major categories of psychiatric illness led to the release of thousands who were able to rejoin society. Kline's work has been acknowledged as a major factor in opening a new era in psychiatry: psychopharmacology.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Schildkraut's {{catecholamine}} {{hypothesis was}} published, Coppen proposed that 5-HT, rather than NA, {{was the more}} important neurotransmitter in depression. This was based on similar evidence to that which produced the NA theory as reserpine, imipramine, and <b>iproniazid</b> affect the 5-HT system, {{in addition to the}} noradrenergic system. It was also supported by work demonstrating that if catecholamine levels were depleted by up to 20% but 5-HT neurotransmission remained unaltered there was no sedation in animals. Alongside this, the main observation promoting the 5-HT theory was that administration of a MAOI in conjunction with tryptophan (precursor of 5-HT) elevated mood in control patients and potentiated the antidepressant effect of MAOI. Set against this, combination of an MAOI with DOPA did not produce a therapeutic benefit.|$|E

50|$|Sigmund Freud {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} the biological causes of mental illness {{and its relationship to}} evident behavioral factors. His belief in biological factors lead to the concept that certain drugs, such as cocaine, had an antidepressant functionality. In the 1950s the first modern antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs were developed: chlorpromazine (Thorazine), {{which was one of the}} first widely used antipsychotic medications to be developed, and <b>iproniazid,</b> which was one of the first antidepressants developed. The research on some of these drugs helped to formulate the monoamine and catecholamine theories, which alluded to the fact that chemical imbalances provide the basis for mental health disorders. New research points to the concept of neuronal plasticity, specifically mentioning that mental health disorders may involve a neurophysiological problem that inhibits neuronal plasticity.|$|E
5000|$|Whitaker {{begins by}} {{reviewing}} {{the discovery of}} antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. These were discovered as side effects during research for antihistamines (specifically promethazine), gram negative antibiotics (specifically mephenesin) and the anti-tuberculosis agents isoniazid and <b>iproniazid</b> respectively. The psychiatric mechanisms of action of these drugs were not known {{at the time and}} these were initially called major tranquilizers (now typical antipsychotics) due to their induction of [...] "euphoric quietude"; minor tranquilizers (now benzodiazepines) and psychic energizers (now antidepressants) due to patients [...] "dancing in the wards." [...] These compounds were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry bolstered by the 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment, giving physicians monopolistic prescribing rights thus aligning the interests of physicians and pharmaceutical companies. This also followed the industry's development of [...] "magic bullets" [...] that treat people with, for example, diabetes, which according to Whitaker provided an analogy to sell the idea of these drugs to the public. It was not until many years later, after the mechanisms of these drugs were determined, that the serotonergic hypothesis of depression and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia were developed to fall in line with the drug's mechanisms. According to Whitaker's analysis of the primary literature, lower levels of serotonin and higher levels of dopamine [...] "have proved to be true in patients WITH prior exposure to antidepressants or antipsychotics (ie as homeostatic mechanisms) but NOT in patients without prior exposure." ...|$|E
