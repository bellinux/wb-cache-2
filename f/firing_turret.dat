50|$|Flushed Away {{is based}} around {{platform}} gameplay, with the player controlling {{the two main}} characters from the film and guiding them through hazard-filled environments. Environments and enemies are based on those in the film, although several areas and creatures not seen in the film are also included. Interspersed throughout the game are mini-game sequences involving shooting enemies with a golf-ball <b>firing</b> <b>turret,</b> and taking control of a boat in a chase sequence. Some multiplayer minigames are also included, based around puzzle and shoot-'em-up mechanics.|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} hammer {{can only}} be fired in one direction; namely, whichever direction the K*bot happens to be facing, since adjusting the K*bot’s position before firing a weapon is strictly prohibited. However, turret hammers exploit a loophole in the rules which allows users to adjust the positioning of their weaponry before <b>firing.</b> <b>Turret</b> hammers are therefore built on a fully rotating platform atop the K*bot, allowing them to be rotated to face an opponent before the hammer is fired, virtually guaranteeing a hit (and therefore a point) every time an opponent’s K*bot comes within striking range.|$|E

50|$|Her main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen Obukhovskii 12 in Pattern 1907 52-calibre guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed {{the length of the}} ship.

5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super <b>firing</b> <b>turrets</b> offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super <b>firing</b> <b>turrets</b> could not <b>fire</b> while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of turrets distributed over the length of the ship. This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends of the ship since the turrets were not concentrated {{at the end of the}} ship, increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes, improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put in the middle of all the machinery, which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|R
50|$|In the game's first level, {{the player}} is given {{military}} training, and learns {{how to control}} vehicles and <b>fire</b> <b>turrets</b> and vehicular weaponry. At {{the end of the}} level, the next Martian cylinder arrives, and the invasion begins wholesale. Throughout the game, the player must take control of various vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and use them strategically to fight their way through Martian settlements, free humans from Martian farms, protect human cities and villages, and carry out various other missions in aid of the resistance.|$|R

50|$|The British {{retreated to}} a small stockade, 50 yd square with 12 ft loopholed high stone walls and <b>firing</b> <b>turrets</b> at each corner, where 8 Europeans, dozens of mixed-race colonial administrators, and 500 Nigerian Hausas with six small field guns and four Maxim guns defended themselves. The British {{detained}} several high-ranking leaders in the fort. The stockade was besieged and the telegraph wires cut. A rescue party of 700 arrived in June, but many sick men in the fort could not be evacuated. The healthier men escaped, including Hodgson {{and his wife and}} 100 Hausas, and meeting up with the rescue party, managed to avoid the 12,000 Ashanti warriors and make it back to the coast.|$|R
500|$|At first, Oldenburg was too {{far away}} to {{effectively}} engage any British ships. Shortly before 18:30, the German line came across the British destroyers [...] and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement. Naval historian John Campbell states that [...] "Thüringen and Helgoland, and possibly Oldenburg and Posen, <b>fired</b> <b>turret</b> guns", as well as secondary weapons, at Nestor. The ship was destroyed by several large explosions and sank at 18:35; most of her crew was rescued by German torpedo boats. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought [...] came into range; she was the first major warship Oldenburg could engage. She fired her 30.5cm guns briefly during the 180-degree turn ordered by Scheer to disengage from the British fleet. Oldenburg claimed to have straddled Warspite once, though her gunners had difficulty discerning the British battleship in the growing haze.|$|R

5000|$|The Schlastas {{nevertheless}} {{remained a}} force to be reckoned with. Their aircraft remained highly agile two-seat fighters fitted with rear <b>firing</b> gun <b>turrets</b> and were no easy target for an Entente fighter pilot. The Junkers J.I in particular acquired a reputation for being almost impossible to shoot down. Schlastas made substantial contributions towards the success of the Kaiserschlacht, the German Spring Offensive of 1918 and fought numerous defensive actions until the end of the war.|$|R

50|$|Although the ZSU-57-2 had {{the highest}} {{firepower}} among production SPAAGs of its time, the anti-aircraft fire efficiency of a battery of four vehicles was even {{lower than that of}} a battery of six towed 57 mm S-60 anti-aircraft guns controlled by the PUAZO-6 anti-aircraft artillery director with the SON-9 fire control radar or later by the RPK-1 Vaza radar. It became obvious that the hit probability on a jet aircraft of the era was very low using only determination of target speed by aircraft type and determination of distance to the target by eye or by rangefinder; the ZSU-57-2 was designed to defend tank units against NATO attack aircraft flying at subsonic speeds, but it entered service ten years too late. Aircraft technology had improved to the point that a SPAAG required a much higher rate of <b>fire,</b> <b>turret</b> traverse speeds of 50-100° per second and a fully automatic radar-controlled fire control system. Works No. 174 started a modernization programme for the ZSU-57-2 in parallel with the beginning of its serial production in 1957, but this programme was rejected due to the development of new radar-guided SPAAGs armed with small-bore autocannons and another tracked chassis.|$|R
500|$|Turrets 2 and 3 had optical {{rangefinders}} and ballistics computers. [...] (The rangefinders are {{the boxes}} on the turret's rear corners). If in a surface action the GFCSs were damaged, the Turret Officer {{could turn the}} Auto-Local rotary switch to Local and continue the action using the <b>turret's</b> <b>fire</b> control equipment.|$|R
50|$|Gunnery trials {{carried out}} with the 105 mm gun were very successful. These trials {{included}} firing the gun at all angles of elevation and <b>firing</b> with the <b>turret</b> traversed 90 degrees to the vehicle’s centerline, the results of both being satisfactory. Mobility and firepower trials were carried out in late 1988 in Egypt.|$|R
50|$|All flying fortresses float at one altitude. Turrets are {{controlled}} with the mouse {{and can be}} fired at wanted direction after clicking on position that is in its <b>firing</b> range.

50|$|In {{the age of}} sail, {{when the}} range of {{effective}} fire was a thousand or twelve hundred yards and guns could only be trained over a small arc because they were fired out of ports, concentration could only be effected by bringing {{a larger number of}} ships into close action with a smaller. By the early 20th century, when gunfire was effective at 7,000 yards or more, and when guns <b>fired</b> from <b>turrets</b> and barbettes had a far wider sweep, concentration could be effected from a distance. The power to effect it had to be sought by a judicious choice of position.|$|R

At the bow and stern the belt was only 2.5 ft high above the waterline. 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads were provided to protect the bases of the turrets and the machinery spaces from raking <b>fire.</b> Each <b>turret</b> was protected by 5.5 in armor plates, although the total thickness around the gun ports was 11 in.

50|$|The {{development}} of the torpedo meant that it became necessary to engage an enemy at ranges outside torpedo range. This in turn meant that the old system whereby a gunlayer in each <b>turret</b> pointed and <b>fired</b> the <b>turret</b> guns independently {{could no longer be}} expected to achieve a significant hit rate on an opposing ship. Scott was instrumental in encouraging the development and installation of director firing, a system whereby the guns were all pointed, elevated and fired from a single point, usually {{at the top of the}} foremast. By firing all the guns simultaneously it was possible to observe the simultaneous splashes produced and correct the aim visually.|$|R
50|$|The game {{also has}} many traits taken from another Nippon Ichi game, Makai Kingdom, using a large variety of its monster classes (most food monsters, Apples, Corn, Carrots, along with Spectres, Brush monsters, and Lucky Statues; Gourmet Monsters appear as one boss as well), {{and many of}} its vehicles, {{including}} a large, slow, yet powerful tank called Gear Metal YAY, a parody of Metal Gear Solid, a machine gun <b>firing</b> pogo <b>turret,</b> and a self-automated levitation machine. Asagi, who made her Debut in Makai Kingdom, plays a large role in the game's Alternate mode, though she has appeared in every Nippon Ichi game past this debut.|$|R
5|$|Fragile Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat.
