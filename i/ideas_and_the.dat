5|$|It was {{followed}} by almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major conflict occurred until the Crimean War. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included {{the formation of the}} Holy Alliance of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic <b>ideas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reshaping of the former Holy Roman Empire into a German Confederation increasingly marked by the political dominance of Prussia. The bicentenary of Waterloo has prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios {{so that the}} structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E

5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
5|$|The nation enjoyed great {{international}} prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire, and it had become an emerging power within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces. The combination of republican <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dissemination of Positivism among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Saint John's School of Alberta (SJSA) was a {{small private}} boys' {{boarding}} school in Stony Plain, Alberta, Canada which operated from 1967 to 2008, the last of three such schools founded on conservative Anglican <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> notion that children were not challenged by present-day society.

25|$|Ruzek, who interviewed {{founders of}} Transpersonal {{psychology}}, {{as well as}} historians of American psychology, found that the field had made little impact on the larger field of psychology in America.

25|$|Colonial empires {{were the}} product of the European Age of Discovery from the 15th century.

25|$|McDonnell founded J.S. McDonnell & Associates in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1926. His {{idea was}} to produce a {{personal}} aircraft for family use.

25|$|Writing is {{powerful}} {{in a different}} way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> institutions that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas {{over a long period}} of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using mnemonic tools.|$|E

25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E
