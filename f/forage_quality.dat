2500|$|According to the IPCC's TAR, [...] "The {{importance}} {{of climate change}} impacts on grain and <b>forage</b> <b>quality</b> emerges from new research. For rice, the amylose content of the grain—a major determinant of cooking quality—is increased under elevated CO2" [...] (Conroy et al., 1994). Cooked rice grain from plants grown in high- environments would be firmer than that from today's plants. However, concentrations of iron and zinc, which are important for human nutrition, would be lower (Seneweera and Conroy, 1997). Moreover, the protein content of the grain decreases under combined increases of temperature and CO2 (Ziska et al., 1997). Studies using FACE have shown that increases in CO2 lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain {{the same amount of}} protein.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} several months of pregnancy, the {{nutritional}} requirements do not increase significantly since {{the rate of growth}} of the fetus is very slow. [...] However, during this time, the mare may be provided supplemental vitamins and minerals, particularly if <b>forage</b> <b>quality</b> is questionable. [...] During the last 3–4 months of gestation, rapid growth of the fetus increases the mare's nutritional requirements. Energy requirements during these last few months, and during {{the first few months of}} lactation are similar to those of a horse in full training. [...] Trace minerals such as copper are extremely important, particularly during the tenth month of pregnancy, for proper skeletal formation. Many feeds designed for pregnant and lactating mares provide the careful balance required of increased protein, increased calories through extra fat as well as vitamins and minerals. [...] Overfeeding the pregnant mare, particularly during early gestation, should be avoided, as excess weight may contribute to difficulties foaling or fetal/foal related problems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHabitat {{manipulations}} {{through the}} use of fire or mechanical treatments are often used to combat woody plant encroachment and increase foraging opportunities for wildlife and livestock. This creates spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality that large herbivores should respond to in ways predicted by ideal free distribution theory. We monitored free-ranging bison to test whether, (1) manipulated habitats offer higher <b>quality</b> <b>forage</b> than habitats in undisturbed rangeland, (2) bison respond through changes in herd composition or activity to differences in habitat quality, and (3) burned and mechanically treated habitats offer similar <b>forage</b> <b>qualities.</b> We found that habitat types burned ∼ 10 years ago continue to produce higher <b>quality</b> <b>forage</b> as evidenced by bison fecal N concentration (14. 4 gkg− 1 dry mass) than open (10. 5 gkg− 1), closed (10. 6 gkg− 1), or mechanically manipulated habitats (11. 7 gkg− 1). Bison herd composition and activity did not vary across habitat types within seasons, despite some between-season variation in overall group composition with sexual segregation being most evident before mid-summer. For semi-arid rangelands encroached with woody vegetation (e. g. piñon–juniper in the western USA) our evidence from free-ranging bison indicates that burning results in higher <b>quality</b> <b>forage</b> than occurs in both mechanically manipulated and undisturbed habitats. Bison roam widely from water, sample available vegetation continuously, and are long-lived gregarious animals that learn to exploit the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in their large home ranges. Bison also have very similar diets to cattle and so, where bison and cattle are allowed to comingle, we suggest the foraging parameters of free-ranging bison are effective ecological indicators of rangeland quality for both bison and cattle...|$|R

50|$|Mule {{deer are}} ruminants, meaning they employ a {{nutrient}} acquisition strategy of fermenting plant material before digesting it. Deer consuming high-fiber, low-starch diets require less food than those consuming high-starch, low-fiber diets. Rumination time also increases when deer consume high-fiber, low-starch diets {{which allows for}} increased nutrient acquisition due to greater length of fermentation. Because some of the subspecies of mule deer are migratory, they encounter variable habitats and <b>forage</b> <b>quality</b> throughout the year. Forages consumed in the summer are higher in digestible components (i.e. proteins, starches, sugars, and hemicellulose) than those consumed in the winter. The average gross energy content of the consumed forage material is 4.5 kcal/g. Due to fluctuations in <b>forage</b> <b>quality</b> and availability, mule deer fat storage varies throughout the year, with the most fat stored in October, which is depleted throughout the winter to the lowest levels of fat storage in March. Changes in hormone levels are indications of physiological adjustments to {{the changes in the}} habitat. Total body fat {{is a measure of the}} individual’s energy reserves while thyroid hormone concentrations are a metric to determine the deer’s ability to utilize the fat reserves. Triiodothryionine (T3) hormone is directly involved with basal metabolic rate and thermoregulation.|$|E

50|$|Some {{changes in}} plant {{composition}} {{brought about by}} black-tailed prairie dogs may benefit livestock by encouraging an increase in plants more tolerant of grazing, such as needleleaf sedge (Carex duriuscula), sixweeks grass (Vulpia octoflora), and scarlet globemallow. Grazing by black-tailed prairie dogs may also improve the nutritional qualities of some plants. On a shortgrass prairie near Fort Collins, Colorado, plant species diversity was greater inside black-tailed prairie dog colonies than outside of colonies, and perennial grasses such as buffalo grass and forbs increased. While black-tailed prairie dog colonies at Wind Cave National Park typically had lower levels of plant biomass and were dominated by forbs, plants growing on prairie dog colonies had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations than plants in mixed-grass prairie outside colonies. Foraging by black-tailed prairie dogs does not significantly affect steer weights. While forage availability and use by cattle decreased in black-tailed prairie dog foraging areas, steer weight was not reduced significantly in either of two years of study at the USDA's Southern Great Plains Experimental Range near Woodward, Oklahoma.

50|$|Evidence {{from the}} lower Hudson Valley of New York shows that megafaunal populations {{collapsed}} many centuries {{in advance of the}} extinction event. At four localities (Otisville, Hyde Park, Binnewater Pond, and Pawelski Farm), the onset of the megafaunal population decline predates the Younger Dryas (at 12.9 cal ka BP). However, extinct megafauna (e.g., Castoroides) are securely dated to the very latest Pleistocene in nearby localities, indicating that population collapse preceded the actual extinction event. The timing of the population decline is of particular interest in that it predates a number of possible extinction mechanisms, including Younger Dryas climate change, the arrival of Clovis people in North America, and the proposed extraterrestrial impact event. Sporormiella records from a sediment core recovered from Appleman Lake, Indiana show a pronounced decline in megafaunal populations during the Bølling-Allerød interstadial from 14.8 to 13.7 cal ka BP. Once again, this decline precedes the extinction for many taxa, indicating a population collapse well before the extinction event. A Nutrient decelerating model suggests that as <b>forage</b> <b>quality</b> declines, herbivores must preferentially rely on those species with the highest nitrogen concentrations. Preferential feeding on plants with higher nitrogen concentrations tends to reduce plant litter quality, further limiting nitrogen availability in the soil. Over time, these feedback mechanisms decrease nitrogen availability, resulting in reduced forage production, decreased nitrogen concentrations, and reduced mammalian herbivore biomass.|$|E
