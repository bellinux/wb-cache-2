Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

We both loved that song {{and we both}} {{thought it would be}} great for Weezer, and for my voice, and it’d be great to do like a rock version of it with more of an alternative aesthetic. And you know, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E

I believe you should keep your {{troubles}} to yourself. That's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts... reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way.

500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> sing. If I tried to control it, it would be pretty false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E

Molly opens the closet looking for the {{dictionary}} and is promptly buried in Fibber's [...] "stuff" [...] ("arranged in there <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> want it"). Cleaning out the closet becomes the show's plot, inventorying much of the contents along the way: a photo album, a rusty horseshoe, a ten-foot pole. After repacking the closet, Fibber realizes the dictionary has been put away too — and he opens the closet again, causing an avalanche. This episode also features a cameo by Gracie Allen, running for president on the Surprise Party ticket.
