Many other jurisdictions were added, based on subsequent damage reports, and by September 22, 99 jurisdictions were eligible for disaster assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided hurricane-related bulletins, including safety tips and the method for removing hazardous materials. By 12days after the passage of the hurricane, FEMA distributed more than 6.3million lbs. (2.9million kg) of ice and [...] of water to areas affected by Isabel. Disaster Recovery Centers, which contain information on the aftermath process, were opened in eight locations and received more than 1,850 inquiries. More than 350 FEMA inspectors visited homes to verify damages caused by Isabel, {{and by the end of}} September 2003 about 12,000 inspections were completed. In response to the power outages, FEMA installed 28 generators at disaster-affected critical public facilities to support life-sustaining community needs. By about four months after the hurricane, 93,139 individuals in the designated areas applied for disaster assistance, while 20,417people visited Disaster Recovery Centers throughout the state. The Small Business Administration approved more than 3,000 low-interest disaster loans from homes and businesses, with the value of the loans totaling $74million (2003USD; $87million 2008USD). The government provided $105million (2003USD; $123million 2008USD) for debris removal, emergency protective services, and permanent work, and approved about $25.9million (2003USD; $30.3million 2008USD) for life-sustaining needs such as water, ice, and generators at critical public facilities.

All estimates included the cost of antiretroviral drugs and laboratory tests, but many excluded the cost of inpatient care, treatment of opportunistic infections, and/or clinic infrastructure. Antiretroviral drugs comprised an average of one third of the cost of treatment in South Africa and one half to three quarters of the cost in other countries. Conclusions: There is very little empirical information available about the cost of providing antiretroviral therapy in non-research settings in Africa. Methods for estimating costs are inconsistent, and many estimates combine data drawn from disparate sources. Cost analysis should become a routine part of operational research on the treatment rollout in Africa...|$|E

40|$|The {{discussed}} {{topic of}} this thesis is obligatory local {{public utility services}} in the municipality of Jezersko. The initial chapters present the theoretical basics and further chapters describe the actual method of the individual obligatory service provision in detail. At greater length the related legal regulations are presented both on the national and local level and available infrastructure. Emphasis is laid on non-conformities related to individual regulations and actions are suggested for the areas for which I believe they would be sensible or necessary. The aim of this thesis is {{the assessment of the}} obligatory public service provision method as assisting support to the mayor, the municipal council and to the communal administration in the municipality of Jezersko. In relation to the concerns of the public {{as well as of the}} responsible parties about the <b>eligible</b> <b>cost</b> level paid both by the users and from the municipality budget, and to the fact that some activities are conducted by the public organisation, the aim is to find the best possible answer to the issue about whether the service provision reorganisation would reduce these costs, and whether to employ, directly or indirectly, the residents of Jezersko and keep at least the same level of services. During the review of business flow and its results in this thesis I have compared the method of service provision and service costs with established legal and technical methods and principles as well as with forms of solutions in some other municipalities in Slovenia. The conclusions provided in individual chapters and summarised at the end do not suggest large reorganizational approaches to the current proceedings, but include suggestions to the conducting of actions for the legal conformity assurance and business rationality increase...|$|E

Further reuse of this document can be made, provided the source is acknowledged. This work was made available {{with the help of the}} Publications Office of the European Union, Copyright and Legal Issues Section. Malta introduced the first renewable energy scheme in 2006, which promoted the use of Photovoltaic technology on a small scale. Most of the funding available was directed at improving the energy efficiency of appliances and housing. In 2010, the focus has moved on towards larger support for the preferred choice in renewable energy technology, namely photovoltaics, as Malta struggles to work towards achieving its 2020 renewable energy targets. There has been a relatively strong reliance on solar energy, with a very small attempt to introduce wind turbines, the use of biofuels in industry and no use of geothermal energy. While the expectation was that wind energy would play a major part in the national landscape of renewables, technological and regulatory hurdles faced resulted in this technology not featuring on any substantial scale in the residential sector the industrial sector in Malta. The policy in Malta is reflective of EU policy, and justification for intervention in the provision of renewable energy is strong. The implementation of such policy, however, is still in its infancy. Malta obtains ERDF and Cohesion funds under the Convergence Objective, under which it can obtain a maximum EU co-financing rate of 85 % of the total <b>eligible</b> <b>cost</b> of projects. This is complemented by national co-financing. Regional differences in such support exist between the two larger islands, Malta (Main Island) and Gozo. However, this is not specific to renewable energy projects but pertains to interventions in general, as the country had at one point committed 10 % of EU funding to the island of Gozo. Moreover, Gozo is designated to become an Eco-Island over the next years, with a specific budget line out of national resources devoted specifically to this purpose, which may impact upon rates of support applicable to renewable energy projects in the Island Region. Real estate market differentiation for energy efficient housing is almost non-existent, with very few signs of any references to this in the property marketN/...|$|E
