25|$|On December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern {{accompanied}} Gödel to his U.S. citizenship exam, {{where they}} acted as witnesses. Gödel had confided <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{he had discovered}} an inconsistency in the U.S. Constitution that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. Fortunately, the judge {{turned out to be}} Phillip Forman, who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gödel if he thought a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U.S. Gödel then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut Gödel off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{privatization}} program, {{which had}} been started already in 1990, was initially criticized by the newly elected parliamentary majority, but soon continued. In a chaotic process, the laws governing privatization were reviewed and changed constantly, but still had loopholes <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> allowed well-connected individuals and financial groups to assume control of government property at fire-sale prices. The second stage of privatization started in July 1995 with Seimas adopting the new Law on Privatization of Government and Municipal Property. The new law attempted to eliminate many of the weaknesses in the privatization process – assets could now be sold only for cash, discounts for employees were eliminated and equal participation rights were granted to local and foreign investors. However, the new law {{did not meet the}} expectations and the privatization process remained inefficient and prone to corruption.|$|E
25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E

500|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{developed}} by Bullfrog Productions under Peter Molyneux, who wrote the game design, testbed, and the computer players and assistant. In an interview, Molyneux explained that {{he came up with}} the ideas for Dungeon Keeper while sitting in a traffic jam, and become so engrossed <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> when the traffic had moved, he did not notice. Bullfrog's chairman Les Edgar stated that the intention was to use the Dungeons & Dragons theme with [...] "slightly weird Bullfrog humour". Programmers Simon and Dene Carter also said Dungeon Keeper is a parody. Dungeon Keeper is a simulation game because Molyneux viewed the villain's duty as a management exercise.|$|E
500|$|Bizet's early one-act opera Le docteur Miracle {{provides}} the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, [...] "many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation". Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements {{in many of}} his earliest works: [...] "gain and again we light upon some touch or other <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved." [...] Until Carmen, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.|$|E
50|$|Out of artistically applied objects {{there are}} many reliquaries preserved. They were adored and {{believed}} to have magical powers of healing.

500|$|... "Vitamin D" [...] was {{nominated}} for the best [...] "Comedy Series Episode" [...] award at the 2010 PRISM Awards. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times noted that she preferred the boys' performance to the girls', commenting: [...] "Their number had the same heart-soaring power as [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...]" [...] Malcom enjoyed Sue's character development in the episode, claiming that, [...] "In less skilled hands, there’s no doubt Sue would be an over-the-top disaster. But thanks to the incomparable Jane Lynch, I can’t {{wait to see what}} trouble the character stirs up next." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV also enjoyed the boys' performance more than the girls', and gave the episode a mostly positive review, writing that it moved the series' storylines to [...] "a whole new level". She felt, however, that the episode [...] "didn't have nearly enough singing". Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that: [...] "So much happened in this hour that the musical numbers, though enjoyable, were almost an afterthought." [...] Bierly favoured the girls' performance, and praised Morrison's acting, commenting: [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes.

500|$|In {{addition}} to exploration, combat is another major element to the gameplay, and the player must fight the various monsters that appear. In {{contrast to the}} more naïve everyman protagonists of previous games, combat in Homecoming takes into account Alex's experience as a soldier. The player is able to perform light and heavy attacks, or mix them to perform combinations, and may also perform a variety of finishing moves {{to ensure that the}} monsters are dead, a gameplay mechanic first featured in a rudimentary form in [...] Attacking enemies also leaves wounds <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> match the motion carried out by Alex in inflicting the attack. In terms of controlling Alex, the player may also perform new maneuvers such as targeting the enemy before attacking them, dodging enemy attacks, and performing counter-attacks. As well as melee weapons, pistols, rifles and shotguns are available as firearms, which can be upgraded to stronger versions later in the game: firearm handling is also rendered in a more realistic manner, with Alex having to shoulder long guns and suffering aim effects like recoil. In {{addition to}} the changes in combat, and unlike previous entries in the series, the player is also able to fully control and rotate the camera as they choose; one analog stick controls player movement, and the other controls the camera.|$|E
500|$|By June 2012, the Russo {{brothers}} entered {{negotiations to}} direct the sequel, and Samuel L. Jackson was confirmed to return as S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury. Feige sought out the Russos after watching the genre-parodying season 2 finale of Community which they directed, and for the additional ideas they brought to the initial story pitch. Joe Russo detailed that since the intent was for a political thriller, [...] "all the great political thrillers have very current issues <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> reflect the anxiety of the audience." [...] Thus the brothers opted to include references to drone warfare, targeted killing and global surveillance. Joe even noted how during principal photography, the issues became more topical due to the disclosure of several National Security Agency surveillance-related documents. At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, {{it was announced that}} the official title for the sequel was Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and that the Russo brothers would direct the film. After signing on to direct, the Russo brothers met with Ed Brubaker to learn more about where the Winter Soldier character came from, his thinking and the themes behind the character. In July 2012, Anthony Mackie entered negotiations to star as Falcon alongside Chris Evans in the sequel. Sebastian Stan was also confirmed to be reprising his role as James Barnes. By August 2012, Anna Kendrick, Felicity Jones, and Imogen Poots were being considered front-runners for {{a leading role in the}} film.|$|E

500|$|Emma's {{relationship}} with glee club coach Will Schuester {{is an integral}} part of her character. They have had an on and off relationship since the show's first season. Television critics have responded extremely well to the pairing between the two. Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly said of the episode [...] "Vitamin D": [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There’s a softness and a longing <b>in</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I’m always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches." [...] Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship in the episode Sectionals. Natalie Abrams of TV Guide noted that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Eric Goldman of IGN has deemed their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about". Dan Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude when Will finds Emma's empty office, and having him then question whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN commented of the following episode: [...] " [...] I would have liked to at least see Shue and Emma as a couple for a few episodes, rather than such a quick split. It felt rushed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff added: [...] "I loved Emma's eruption to Will about how Sue Sylvester must have cheated and the kids deserved to win." [...] Robert Canning said of the Britney Spears oriented episode: [...] "The true focus of the episode was Will dealing with his lack of spontaneity. This stood as a contrast to the impulsiveness of Emma's new boyfriend, sexy dentist Carl played by the somehow always charming John Stamos. There's a fun love triangle building here which should only get better as Will becomes less of an insecure whiner." ...|$|E
