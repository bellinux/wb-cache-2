40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} the main parameters of pilot dose ignition: injection pressure, injection advance angle and injector opening time on the combustion process in a dual fuel diesel engine. The study continues the research conducted at the Department of Mechatronics of the University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, on optimisation of dual fuel self-ignition engines with CNG as the main fuel dose. The results presented in the paper were obtained with a single-cylinder engine HATZ 1 B 40, adapted to methane combustion.

40|$|Abstract Background Research on Genomic {{medicine}} {{has suggested that}} the exposure of patients to early life risk factors may induce the development of chronic diseases in adulthood, as the presence of premature risk factors can influence gene expression. The large number of scientific papers published in this research area makes it difficult for the healthcare professional to keep up with individual results and to establish association between them. Therefore, in our work we aim at building a computational system that will offer an innovative approach that alerts health professionals about human development problems such as cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Methods We built a computational system called Chronic Illness Surveillance System (CISS), which retrieves scientific studies that establish associations (conceptual relationships) between chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity) and the risk factors described on clinical records. To evaluate our approach, we submitted ten queries to CISS as well as to three other search engines (Google™, Google Scholar™ and Pubmed®;) — the queries were composed of terms and expressions from a list of risk factors provided by specialists. Results CISS retrieved a higher number of closely related (+) and somewhat related (+/-) documents, and a smaller number of unrelated (-) and almost unrelated (-/+) documents, in comparison with the three other systems. The results from the Friedman’s test carried out with the post-hoc Holm procedure (95 % confidence) for our system (control) versus the results for the three other <b>engines</b> <b>indicate</b> that our <b>system</b> had the best performance in three of the categories (+), (-) and (+/-). This is an important result, since these are the most relevant categories for our users.
