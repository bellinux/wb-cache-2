30|$|A way to {{circumvent}} {{this problem is}} to add a constant term related to the residual rate (Strachan and Neeway 2014). A complete model of glass dissolution had been developed, the GRAAL model (Frugier et al. 2008). This model considers an instantaneous hydration (i.e., alteration) of the glass. As soon {{as a part of}} the glass is altered, the increase of silica aqueous concentration triggers the formation of the gel. The gel limits the transport of water from the solution to the glass (diffusion barrier); the alteration rate consequently decreases. The precipitation of secondary phases (which influence the thickness of the gel via silicium mass balance) is accounted for. But GRAAL is a reactive transport model working at the scale of the <b>glass</b> <b>grain.</b> It is currently not possible to embed this reactive transport model into another reactive transport model working at the scale of the hydrothermal system.|$|E

As other objects in the plasma, these dust grains charge to potencial close to the potencial of the plasmas (in this case, interplanetary plasma). In the universe, the photoelectric charging dust grain dominantes all other charging processes. In general, the resulting charge of dust grain is given by a balance of all processes, which haven't been mostly jet theoretically described. In our laboratory, we are simulating space conditions and measure resulting charge and his changes on a single separated dust grain. This work is partly focused to UV source application and to finishing its electronics, and partly on test measurements and model calculations, connected with newly built experiment (e. g., to estimate effects of backgound currents, surfaces, and the geometry of the dust trap electrodes).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemical and {{mechanical}} weathering textures on siliciclastic grains have provided important information concerning depositional processes and environments, yet understanding {{is limited by}} the multicycle origin of most sedimentary deposits. Sea <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> sampled from a beach in Port Allen, Kauai, Hawaii, were analyzed for mechanical and chemical weathering features using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As a result of a proximal dumping-ground source, the sea glass offers a unique opportunity to study first-cycle grain weathering processes in a moderate- to high-energy shoreline environment. Grain-size analysis indicates that the largest grains are located behind natural barriers, such as outcrops and boulders. The best-sorted samples are from the lower to middle foreshore environment, whereas moderately sorted deposits are located closer to the backshore where storm waves predominate. Although there is no preferred distribution of different-colored sea <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> on the beach, non-frosted grains predominate over frosted varieties, suggesting constant input of fresh material. Grain surface textures can be divided into mechanically dominated and chemically dominated weathering groups. Evidence of mechanical weathering is provided by conchoidal fractures, crescentic gouges, and straight grooves, whereas chemical weathering is indicated by c-shaped cracks, halite (salt) and silica precipitation, and solution pits. Combinations of these features demonstrate that both weathering processes work together to degrade the grains. XPS depth profiling of individual grains indicates that chemical weathering occurs at different grain depths, with leaching of sodium from the glass surfaces. Thi...|$|R

In this study, the way {{the energy of}} alpha particles, emitted by a typical HLW glass, is deposited in water at the glass/water interface is investigated, {{with the aim of}} better characterizing the dose deposition at the glass/water interface during water-induced leaching mechanisms. A simplified chemical composition was considered for the nuclear glass under study, wherein the dose rate is about 140 Gy/h. The MCNPX calculation code was used to calculate alpha dose rate and alpha particle flux profiles at the glass/water interface in different systems: a single <b>glass</b> <b>grain</b> in water, a glass powder in water and a water-filled ideal crack in a glass package. Dose rate decreases within glass and in water as distance {{to the center of the}} grain increases. A general model has been proposed to fit a dose rate profile in water and in glass from values for dose rate in glass bulk, alpha range in water and linear energy transfer considerations. The glass powder simulation showed that there was systematic overlapping of radiation fields for neighboring glass grains, but the water dose rate always remained lower than the bulk value. Finally, for typical ideal cracks in a glass matrix, an overlapping of irradiation fields was observed while the crack aperture was lower than twice the alpha range in water. This led to significant values for the alpha dose rate within the crack volume, as long as the aperture remained lower than 60 lm...|$|E
40|$|Issue: It is {{very simple}} to fuse {{recycled}} container glass to make tiles and relief plaques. However, information on raw material characteristics, temperature profiles, and operational issues has not been widely disseminated. Best Practice: At temperatures considerably below melting, particles of metal, ceramics, or glass begin to bond through a process called sintering. Sintering of soda-lime glass begins at about 1250 ° F. Sintering {{can be used to}} create solid glass objects by heating glass particles to above the sintering point and holding at that temperature until a dense body forms. The basic steps are described below: 1) Obtain a mold that will withstand temperatures of at least 1600 °F. For instructions on casting permanent molds, see Permanent Molds for Fusing Glass Best Practice. Coat the mold with a release. Commercial “shelf paints ” are available. A mixture of 40 % kaolin and 60 % alumina hydrate also works well. 2) Fill the mold with glass pieces. Glass of any size can be used. However, the most consistent success has been obtained with glass that has been crushed to a uniform shape and screened to a size 16 mesh and finer. There is a trade-off here between <b>glass</b> <b>grain</b> size and cleanliness. It is easier to obtain a glassy, translucent product with larger grain sizes, but smaller grain sizes minimize contamination. 3) Fire the kiln to fusing temperatures. For green or amber container glass, the following schedule is a place to start: 500 °F/hour to 1100 °F (organic contamination should be gone by this point) 500 °F/hour to 1600 °F (or go as fast as the kiln will rise) soak 5 minutes at 1600 °F (this is the critical time & temp – experiment) Natural cooling to 1020 °F Soak 15 minutes at 1020 °F (may need longer soak for thick or uneven pieces) 70 °F/hour to 950 °F Cool 300 °F/hour to 250 °F Open kiln to cool to ambient Each kiln acts differently. The maximum temperature that works best in a particular kiln may be anywhere from 1500 to 1600 °F. Fusing can also be done in cone kilns. Fire at maximum and try cone 010, 011, 012, and 013.

30|$|The {{complete}} {{alteration of}} hyaloclastites is {{possible because of}} high initial water/rock ratio {{which is due to}} high initial connected porosity and high reactivity of small <b>glass</b> <b>grains.</b> Even if all the initial amount of protolith reacts with water, the available porosity does not noticeably change; the alteration can consequently proceed. This process is fast (from a few hours to a few years) compared to the lifetime of a hydrothermal system (hundreds to thousands years).

This study highlights the fact that in any water–rock interaction study, consideration of dissolution or precipitation kinetics requires a good knowledge of the morphology of the minerals. The role of the specific surface area appears to be much more important than that of the kinetic rate constant.|$|R

The effect of calcite content in the body mixture, of the particle size distribution of glass and of the firing temperature was investigated. In the case of calcite-rich mixtures with glass, increased expansion may take place during firing, at temperatures slightly higher than 700 degrees C. This effect is attributed to the entrapment of released gases, mainly CO 2. Sintering starts at lower temperatures for the samples with glass, whereas, a second shrinkage zone was observed for temperatures approaching 1000 degrees C.

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} succession drilled at Sites 840 and 841 on the Tonga forearc {{allows the}} sedimentary {{evolution of the}} active margin to be reconstructed since shortly after the initiation of subduction during the mid Eocene. Sedimentation {{has been dominated by}} submarine fan deposits, principally volcaniclastic turbidites and mass-flows derived from the volcanic arc. Volcaniclastic sedimentation occurred against a background of pelagic nannofossil sedimentation. A number of upward-fining cycles are recognized and are correlated to regional tectonic events, such as the rifting of the Lau Basin at 5. 6 Ma. Episodes of sedimentation dating from 16. 0 and 10. 0 Ma also correlate well with major falls in eustatic sea level and may be at least partially caused by the resulting enhanced erosion of the arc edifice. The early stages of rifting of the Lau Basin are marked by the formation of a brief hiatus at Site 840 (Horizon A), probably a result of the uplift of the Tonga Platform. Controversy exists as to the degree and timing of the uplift of Site 840 before Lau Basin rifting, with estimates ranging from 2500 to 300 m. Structural information favors a lower value. Breakup of the Tonga Arc during rifting resulted in deposition of dacite-dominated, volcaniclastic mass flows, probably reflecting a maximum in arc volcanism at this time. A pelagic interval at Site 840 suggests that no volcanic arc was present adjacent to the Tonga Platform from 5. 0 to 3. 0 Ma. This represents the time between separation of the Lau Ridge from the Tonga Platform and the start of activity on the Tofua Arc at 3. 0 Ma. The sedimentary successions at both sites provide a record of the arc volcanism despite the reworked nature of the deposits. Probe analyses of volcanic <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> from Site 840 indicate a consistent low-K tholeiite chemistry from 7. 0 Ma to the present, possibly reflecting sediment sourcing from a single volcanic center over long periods of time. Trace and rare-earth-element (REE) analyses of basaltic <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> indicate that thinning of the arc lithosphere had begun by 7. 0 Ma and was the principle cause of a progressive depletion of the high-field-strength (HFSE), REE, and large-ion-lithophile (LILE) elements within the arc magmas before rifting. Magmatic underplating of the Tofua Arc has reversed this trend since that time. Increasing fluid flux from the subducting slab since basin rifting has caused a progressive enrichment in LILEs. Subduction erosion of the underside of the forearc lithosphere has caused continuous subsidence and tilting toward the trench since 37. 0 Ma. Enhanced subsidence occurred during rifting of the South Fiji and Lau basins. Collision of the Louisville Ridge with the trench has caused no change {{in the nature of the}} sedimentation, but it may have been responsible for up to 300 m of uplift at Site 840...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere, {{we report}} on the {{mobility}} of metals at the early stage of CO 2 injection into basalt, before significant precipitation of secondary minerals. Short-lived pulses (50 - 100 hours) of CO 2 -charged water were injected into a high pressure column flow reactor filled with basaltic <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> at 22 °C, 8 MPa of total pressure and a velocity of 0. 4 cm/min. The residence time of the water within the column ranged from 8 to 10 hours. The column was conditioned with pure water, resulting in alkaline outflow (pH ∼ 9). The pH of the inlet CO 2 -charged water was ∼ 3. 2, and the lowest pH measured in the column was 4. 5, after less than 10 hours of water/rock interaction. The dissolved metal concentrations and metals relative mobility increased dramatically during the CO 2 -pulses; more than 100 times for Sr, Fe, Al, Ca, Ba, Mn, and Mg. Of these elements, all but Al can bind with CO 2 to form carbonate minerals. Only the dissolved Al, Fe, Mn and Cr concentrations exceeded allowable drinking water limits. After the CO 2 -pulses, all of the elemental concentrations decreased close-to or even below what was measured during the conditioning of the column. The pH never reached ∼ 9 which was the initial pH before CO 2 -pulses...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of fabrication techniques that make possible the use of Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) Tapes for the construction of three-dimensional meso (intermediate) scale electro mechanical systems. We brought together technologies from the packaging, silicon and ceramics industries to develop a photolithographic technique for LTCC tapes. To that end, it was necessary to investigate and define an appropriate heat preprocess that we called partially sintering. Jet Vapor Etching is another patterning technique developed during this research effort. It has the advantage of being more directional than wet etching and therefore vias with high aspect ratio can be patterned. A jet of atomized solvent impinges {{on the surface of the}} LTCC tape dissolving the organic binder of the tape and mechanically removing the alumina and <b>glass</b> <b>grains.</b> When the vertical dimension is introduced, sagging problems appear; however, we solved these problems by using sacrificial materials and the appropriate atmosphere and firing profile. We also experimentally found the processing parameters for the photoformables LTCC tapes and showed that the diffusion model is a good candidate to model transport of light in the ceramic. The firing of photoformable LTCC is problematic because of non-uniform drying but it was resolved by constrain lamination. The discovery of the exfoliation phenomenon played an essential role in the development of a high temperature pressure sensor. ...|$|R

In the presented study, the new energy absorber based on expanded <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> was subjected to the high strain rate loading using the Split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus (SHPB) and to the blast load as a part of the sandwich structure. The influence of the binder amount on the attenuating properties of the material was evaluated. The dynamic response of 6 rectangular sandwich panel constructions (with different core designs) under blast loading was investigated. The objectives were to analyse the panels in terms of deformation and blast resistance and to determine the effect of different core set-ups on blast resistance enhancement of the entire structure. 5 types of core configurations, with almost identical areal density, were prepared and subjected to the blast wave generated by the detonation of 100 g of TNT equivalent explosive from the 100 mm distance. Overall blast resistance of the panel was determined using the certified methodology M-T 0 -B VTÚO 10 / 09 based on evaluation of the tension strain curves recorded by strain gages fixed at the back steel plate of the sandwich. The image analysis was used to quantify the damage of the concrete slabs. The best results were achieved in the case of stepwise graded core with decreasing grain size from the blast load epicentre...|$|R

Only at 116. 55 mbsf was a thin layer of tephra found, linked to an explosive eruption McMurdo volcanic rocks exhibit larger abundances at depths above 62 mbsf, in correspondence with the onset of volcanic activity in the McMurdo Sound area. From 62 mbsf {{to the bottom of the}} core, McMurdo volcanics are less abundant and probably issued from some centres in the McMurdo Sound region. However, available data do not allow the exclusion of wind transport from some eruptive centres active in north Victoria Land at the beginning of the Miocene Epoch...|$|R

30|$|Wettability is an {{important}} factor in terms of flow distribution and the amount of oil left behind in a petroleum reservoir after primary, secondary, and tertiary recovery processes. In fact, most alkaline flooding operations are aimed at wettability reversal. Therefore, a good understanding of how wettability, and other relevant factors (e.g., fluid saturation and porosity), affects displacement efficiency and fluid distribution at the pore-scale can lead to successful predictions of flow properties at the macroscale. In this study, pore-scale two-phase fluid flow in a synthetic mixed-wet granular media was investigated using X-ray microCT. Analysis of residual fluid structures in granular media composed of a mixture of glass and plastic beads (ranging from 0.4 to 0.6  mm in diameter) showed that the number of trapped water blobs was 2.4 times greater than that of oil, whereas most of the blobs were between 0.0001 and 0.001  mm 3 in size (i.e., 100 times smaller than in the case of uniform wettability), and were smaller than the mean pore volume (0.03  mm 3). The ratio of surface area to blob volume showed a slight tendency of water blobs to wet a higher surface area of the grains than oil blobs, for blob volumes larger than the mean pore size; this phenomenon can be attributed to stronger wetting affinity of the <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> to the water phase than that of the plastic grains to the oil phase. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the distance between residual oil and water blobs to each solid surface confirms preferential wetting affinity of oil and water to plastic and glass surfaces, respectively.|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{bathymetry}} and seafloor sampling {{have been}} used to characterize the 1891 submarine eruption of the Pantelleria volcanic complex. This submarine eruption has been documented mainly by historical reports, describing basaltic scoria bombs floating on the sea surface (i. e., lava balloons). In this study, the 1891 eruptive vent has been identified as a small cone (volume of ∼ 700, 000 m 3) rising ∼ 90 m from 350 m w. d., and located within a newly discovered submarine volcanic field covering a wide area offshore from the NW coast of Pantelleria; recently, Kelly et al. (2012) confirmed this location by a multibeam and ROV survey. Pyroclasts from the 1891 eruption crop out directly on the seafloor and are fresh scoria clasts (i. e., small bombs, bomb fragments, and lapilli) and glass ash-sized grains; both have been characterized in their morphology, textures, and geochemistry. The distinctive vesicularity and crystallization characteristics displayed by the scoriaceous pyroclasts reflect modes of degassing in both syn and posteruptive regimes; these characteristics, along with the distribution of deposits suggest for the strongest eruptive phase of the 1891 eruption a style analogous to Hawaiian fountaining. <b>Glass</b> <b>grains</b> from a buoyant plume were dispersed northward from the vent, up to distances of 1. 5 km, redirected by the Levantine Intermediate Water. The identification of the 1891 submarine eruptive vent offshore Pantelleria, as well as the features of erupted pyroclasts improve our knowledge of submarine explosive eruptions that occur at shallow-intermediate depths and, among these, of the rare eruptions producing lava balloons. © 2014.

40|$|Two main {{types of}} glassy fragmental rocks formed along the Proto-Macquarie Spreading Ridge: (i) hyaloclastite breccia; and (ii) pillow-fragment breccia. Examples now exposed on Macquarie Island, Southern Ocean, were largely sourced from {{proximal}} pillow lavas. In each of seven samples examined, hyaloclasts (basaltic <b>glass</b> <b>grains)</b> have a narrow major- and trace-element geochemical range, consistent with derivation of each sample {{from a single}} volcanic eruption event. Moreover, every sample analysed within the one stratigraphic section (at three sites) displays distinctive major- and trace-element geochemistry compared {{with the other two}} sections. This suggests that hyaloclasts at each site represent discrete magma batches. A single source for these glassy fragmental rocks contrasts with the dominant fault-scarp-derived polymict sedimentary rocks on Macquarie Island. We suggest that the hyaloclasts analysed in this study were deposited in small basins between the slopes of growing pillow cones along the mid-ocean ridge. The geochemical analyses presented here encompass (weakly) fractionated (e. g. Bauer Bay) to near-primitive (e. g. Pyramid Peak) compositions. All samples presented here lie within the range of the enriched- to normal-MORB suites previously reported for the island that include the least fractionated MORB melts known globally. The interpretation of geochemically distinct magma batches over the small area of the island suggests very limited magma mixing consistent with an immature or waning magmatic system. We relate these geochemical characteristics to: (i) volcanism near a very long offset transform; and (ii) genesis of magmas during the waning stages of slow seafloor spreading within a very narrow (< 50 km-wide) spreading corridor. 13 page(s...|$|R
