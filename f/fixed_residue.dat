Six main water treatment plants (Alto do Céu, Botafogo, Caixa d'água, Gurjaú, Suape and Tapacurá) were selected from the Metropolitan Region of Recife, managed by Companhia Pernambucana de Saneamento. Nine samples were collected in the eleven month period in the discharge of the sludge from the decanters. These samples were characterized physico-chemically, based on the methodology of the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (2012).

40|$|Background: Combinatorial {{methods for}} the {{production}} of molecular libraries are an important source of ligand diversity for chemical biology. Synthetic methods focus on the production of small molecules that must traverse the cell membrane to elicit a response. Genetic methods enable intracellular ligand production, but products must typically be large molecules in order to withstand cellular catabolism. Here we describe an intein-based approach to biosynthesis of backbone cyclic peptide libraries that combines the strengths of synthetic and genetic methods. Results: Through site-directed mutagenesis we show that the DnaE intein from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is very promiscuous with respect to peptide substrate composition, and can generate cyclic products ranging from four to nine amino acids. Libraries with five variable amino acids and either one or four <b>fixed</b> <b>residues</b> were prepared, yielding between 107 and 108 transformants. The majority of randomly selected clones from each library gave cyclic products. Conclusions: We have developed a versatile method for producing intracellular libraries of small, stable cyclic peptides. Genetic encoding enables facile manipulation of vast numbers of compounds, while low molecular weight ensures ready pharmacophore identification. The demonstrated flexibility of the method towards both peptide length and composition makes it a valuable addition to existing methods for generating ligand diversity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe high {{aromatic}} {{content of the}} deep and narrow active-site gorge of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a remarkable feature of this enzyme. Here, we analyze conformational flexibility of the side chains of the 14 conserved aromatic residues in the active-site gorge of Torpedo californica AChE based on the 47 three-dimensional crystal structures available for the native enzyme, and for its complexes and conjugates, and on a 20 -ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory of the native enzyme. The degree of flexibility of these 14 aromatic side chains is diverse. Although the side-chain conformations of F 330 and W 279 are both very flexible, the side-chain conformations of F 120, W 233, W 432, Y 70, Y 121, F 288, F 290 and F 331 appear to be <b>fixed.</b> <b>Residues</b> located on, or adjacent to, the Ω-loop (C 67 –C 94), namely W 84, Y 130, Y 442, and Y 334, display different flexibilities in the MD simulations and in the crystal structures. An important outcome of our study is {{that the majority of}} the side-chain conformations observed in the 47 Torpedo californica AChE crystal structures are faithfully reproduced by the MD simulation on the native enzyme. Thus, the protein can assume these conformations even in the absence of the ligand that permitted their experimental detection. These observations are pertinent to structure-based drug design...|$|R
40|$|The {{active site}} of {{activated}} Factor IX (FIXa) and related blood-coagulation enzymes {{is surrounded by}} a number of highly variable surface loops, which contribute to the characteristic substrate specificity of each individual enzyme. <b>FIX</b> <b>residue</b> Lys(316) is located in one of these loops and mutation of this residue to Glu is associated with haemophilia B. In the present study we investigated the functional role of Lys(316) in human FIXa by analysing the purified and activated FIX mutants FIXa-K 316 E and FIXa-K 316 A. FIXa-K 316 E was indistinguishable from normal FIXa in binding the competitive active-site inhibitor p-aminobenzamidine. In addition, substitution of Glu for Lys(316) had no significant effect on the reactivity towards various synthetic tripeptide substrates. Inhibition by the macromolecular inhibitor antithrombin was only slightly reduced for both FIXa mutants (less than 2 -fold). In contrast, proteolytic activity of FIXa-K 316 E towards the natural substrate Factor X (FX) was virtually lacking, while the Lys(316) to Ala mutation resulted in a more than 10 -fold reduction in FX activation. Thus residue Lys(316) {{plays a key role in}} FIXa activity towards FX. The requirement for Lys at position 316 for FX activation was also evident in the presence of the cofactor activated Factor VIII, although to a lesser extent than in its absence. These data demonstrate that Lys(316) specifically determines the reactivity of FIXa towards its natural substrate FX, but not to synthetic peptide substrates or antithrombin...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{distribution}} of the complex sum-of-digits function sq with basis q = −a ± i, a ∈ Z + for Gaussian primes p. Inspired by a recent result of Mauduit and Rivat [16] for the real sum-of-digits function, we here get uniform distribution modulo 1 of the sequence (αsq(p)) provided α ∈ R Q and q is prime with a ≥ 28. We also determine the order of magnitude of the number of Gaussian primes whose sum-of-digits evaluation lies in some <b>fixed</b> <b>residue</b> class mod m. 1 Preliminaries and Notation Let q = −a ± i (choose a sign) with a ∈ Z + and denote Q = |q | 2 = a 2 + 1. Then every z ∈ Z[i] has a unique finite representation ∑λ− 1 z = εjq j, j= 0 where εj ∈ N = 0, 1, [...] ., Q − 1 are the digits in the digital expansion and ελ− 1 ̸ = 0 (see [11, 12]). Denote by sq(n) = ∑λ− 1 j= 0 εj the sum-of-digits function in Z[i]. The aim of the present paper is to study {{the distribution of}} sq(p) in arithmetic progressions, where p runs through the Gaussian primes. The corresponding question for the real sum-of-digits function, posed by Gelfond [2] in a paper of 1968, has recently been answered by Mauduit and Rivat [16]. We resort to the method used in their paper, coupled with some known facts and techniques for sq(n), to get our distribution results. As a drawback, here we have to assume that the base q is prime. On our way we encounter a two-dimensional exponential sum over a disk, which is both linear in the real and imaginary part of the variable (Lemma 5. 1). By the similarity to the circle problem the saving here cannot be too large, this – in the end – makes it impossible to cover general composite q. With much more effort one probably may cope with bases q whose smallest prime factor is not less than |q | α, for some number 0 < α < 1 (see [9]). In this paper, however, we restrict our estimates to the prime q case. By our reasoning we additionally have to assume a ≥ 28. For later reference se...|$|E

The x-ray structure of porcine fIXa described here shows the atomic {{origins of the}} disease, while the spatial distribution of mutation sites suggests a structural model for factor X activation by phospholipid-bound fIXa and cofactor VIIIa. The 3. 0 -A-resolution diffraction data clearly show the structures of the serine proteinase module and the two preceding epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like modules; the N-terminal Gla module is partially disordered. The catalytic module, with covalent inhibitor D-Phe- 1 I-Pro- 2 I-Arg- 3 I chloromethyl ketone, most closely resembles fXa but differs significantly at several positions. Particularly noteworthy is the strained conformation of Glu- 388, a residue strictly conserved in known fIXa sequences but conserved as Gly among other trypsin-like serine proteinases. Flexibility apparent in electron density together with modeling studies suggests that this may cause incomplete active site formation, even after zymogen, and hence the low catalytic activity of fIXa. The principal axes of the oblong EGF-like domains define an angle of 110 degrees, stabilized by a strictly conserved and fIX-specific interdomain salt bridge. The disorder of the Gla module, whose hydrophobic helix is apparent in electron density, {{can be attributed to}} the absence of calcium in the crystals; we have modeled the Gla module in its calcium form by using prothrombin fragment 1.
