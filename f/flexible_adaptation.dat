It was strongly inspired by ordoliberalism, social democratic ideas, and the tradition of Catholic social teaching or, more generally, Christian ethics. The social market economy refrains from attempts to plan and guide production, the workforce, or sales, but it does support planned efforts to influence the economy through the organic means of a comprehensive economic policy coupled with <b>flexible</b> <b>adaptation</b> to market studies. Effectively combining monetary, credit, trade, tax, customs, investment, and social policies, as well as other measures, this type of economic policy creates an economy that serves the welfare and needs of the entire population, thereby fulfilling its ultimate goal.|$|E

50|$|The Himalayan {{rabbit and}} the Siamese cat are {{examples}} of artificial selection on heterotopy, developed by breeders incidentally long before the concept was understood. The current theory is that people selected for stereotypical phenotypic patterns (dark extremities) that happened to be repeatedly produced given a typical temperature.

The common human breeding cultures that breed the rabbits and cats tended to themselves favor the pattern, in a way closely mimicking {{the way that the}} underlying genetics that form <b>flexible</b> <b>adaptations</b> can be selected for based on the phenotype they typically produce in an assumed environment in natural selection.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{adapting}} heterogeneous software components that present mismatching interaction behaviour {{is one of}} the crucial problems in Component-Based Software Engineering. A promising approach to solve this problem is based on an adaptation methodology relying on extending component interfaces with protocol information which describes their interaction behaviour, and using a high-level notation to express the intended connection between component interfaces. The adaptor specification defines a component-in-the-middle capable of making two components interact successfully, according to certain constraints. The aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute to setting a theoretical foundation for software adaptation following this approach. A formal analysis of adaptor specifications is presented, and their usage to feature different forms of <b>flexible</b> <b>adaptations</b> is illustrated...|$|R

30|$|Modern {{broadband}} wireless systems must support multimedia {{services of a}} wide range of data rates with reasonable complexity, <b>flexible</b> multi-rate <b>adaptation,</b> and efficient multi-user multiplexing and detection. Broadband access has been evolving through the years, starting from 3 G and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) to Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) [1] and Long Term Evolution (LTE). These are examples of next generation systems that provide higher performance data transmission, and improve end-user experience for web access, file download/upload, voice over IP and streaming services. HSPA+ and LTE are based on shared-channel transmission, so the key features for an efficient communication system are to maximize throughput, improve coverage, decrease latency and enhance user experience by sharing channel resources between users, providing <b>flexible</b> link <b>adaptation,</b> better coverage, increased throughput and easy multi-user multiplexing.|$|R

To identify neural mechanisms which characterize schizophrenia patients independent of differences in learning strategies and working memory performance, computational models of learning processes and neuronal connectivity were applied. Two main findings are reported: blunted ventral striatal activation during <b>flexible</b> behavioural <b>adaptation</b> and reduced working memory dependent prefrontal-parietal connectivity. The latter result points towards a potential intermediate phenotype of the disorder.

30|$|The CR {{paradigm}} [6] {{has been}} conceived in a brain-empowered manner {{to address the}} spectrum underutilization problem and provide spectrum-agile communications, following a methodology that mimics the human behavior and by extension the evolutionary processes of physical, biological, and other systems that exhibit social structure and cognition [7].

Above all, CRs {{can be used to}} alleviate problems emerging in cyber-physical systems combining wireless infrastructures and online social networks, e.g., to provide on-the-fly traffic offloading of the cellular infrastructure, thus expediting data transfers and reducing delays (LTE advanced) in crowded locations.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to begin to develop a new model for understanding men’s issues in counseling which included increased recognition of diversity, consideration of both internal and external influences, and the concept of multiple masculinities. Participants in the study included 6 African-American and 6 Caucasian men between the ages of 19 and 92 years and representing both low and high incomes. The researcher interviewed each of the men 3 times in a process of theory development based on the Grounded Theory Method proposed by Corbin and Strauss (1990). Results of the study included the development of a new model for conceptualizing men’s issues in counseling. According to this grounded model, men are adaptable in their expression of masculinities.

40|$|The present studies {{explored}} {{the role of}} the medial striatum in learning when taskcontingencies change. Experiment 1 examined whether the medial striatum is involved in place reversal learning. Testing occurred in a modified cross-maze across two consecutive sessions. Injections of the local anesthetic, bupivacaine, into the medial striatum, did not impair place acquisition, but impaired place reversal learning. The reversal-learning deficit was due to an inability to maintain the new choice pattern following the initial shift. Experiment 2 determined whether changes in acetylcholine (ACh) output occur during the acquisition or reversal learning of a place discrimination. Extracellular ACh output from the medial striatum was assessed in samples collected at 6 -min intervals using in vivo microdialysis during behavioral testing. ACh output did not change from basal levels during place acquisition. During reversal learning, ACh output significantly increased as rats began to learn the new choice pattern, and returned to near basal levels as a rat reliably executed the new place strategy. The present results suggest that the medial striatum may be critical for <b>flexible</b> <b>adaptations</b> involving spatial information, and that ACh actions in this area enable the shifting of choice patterns when environmental conditions change...|$|R

Recognizing changes in shape, especially in a visually-dominant organism, can assist in dealing with these reef structure changes and prey availability loss. I examined the ability of two stomatopod species: Haptosquilla trispinosa and Pseudosquilla ciliata to learn to distinguish between a circle and a square, using simple food conditioning techniques for 30 days and 15 days, respectively, including a priming period of 10 days per group. Both H. trispinosa and P. ciliata groups were conditioned to the circle. Each group had four individuals. H. trispinosa’s total number of responses decreased over time, {{with an increase in}} correct responses and decrease in incorrect responses. This trend indicates the presence of shape discrimination learning as well as test learning. P. ciliata had a higher percentage of correct responses across all time blocks in comparison to H. trispinosa due to their differing predator tactics. P. ciliata are spearers, ambush predators that rely on quick information intake to surprise prey, while H. trispinosa are smashers, foraging predators that depend on repetitive impacting motions to stun/ kill prey. More behavioral studies need to be conducted to assess the stomatopod’s ability to cope with current environmental conditions, but there is clear visual discriminatory learning capability in this organism that can assist in <b>flexible</b> <b>adaptations...</b>|$|R
