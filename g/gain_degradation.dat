40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Electron and neutron {{irradiation}} effects in InGaP/GaAs single heterojunction bipolar transistors are investigated in this thesis. Devices with different emitter sizes and grown by two different growth techniques were examined. Based on {{the physics of}} heterojunction bipolar transistors and concepts of radiation damage mechanisms, the irradiation effects were analyzed. The devices were subjected to electron and {{neutron irradiation}} and were electrically characterized before and after irradiation. Under electron irradiation these devices were quite robust up to a fluence of 6. 69 x 10 ^ 15 e/cm^ 2. However, a more careful analysis showed a slight gain improvement at a low base current and a small <b>gain</b> <b>degradation</b> at higher base currents. The gain increase at small base currents and low fluence {{is believed to be}} caused by the ionization damage in the polyimide passivation layer. The <b>gain</b> <b>degradation</b> at higher fluence and high base currents is due to the displacement damage in the emitter-base junction region. In the case of neutron irradiation the major effects were (1) the decrease of collector current or equivalently the common-emitter DC current gain reduction and (2) the collector-emitter offset voltage shift. At low fluence of neutron irradiation, a small gain increase is observed at low base currents which is caused by the suppression of the base current due to ionization effect. At higher fluence, <b>gain</b> <b>degradation</b> is observed whose magnitude depends upon the nature and fluence of the irradiation particle. This degradation is caused by the displacement damage in the SCR leading to the current <b>gain</b> <b>degradation</b> at all base currents. In addition to the <b>gain</b> <b>degradation,</b> neutron irradiation causes a shift of the collector-emitter offset voltage, which is caused by the displacement damage in the base-collector region...|$|E
