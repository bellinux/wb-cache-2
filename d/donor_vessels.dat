40|$|Each year, {{hundreds}} of thousands of patients undergo coronary artery bypass surgery in the United States. 1 Approximately one third of these patients do not have suitable autologous <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> due to disease progression or previous harvest. The aim of vascular tissue engineering is to develop a suitable alternative source for these bypass grafts. In addition, engineered vascular tissue may prove valuable as living vascular models to study cardiovascular diseases.

His recurrent disease was treated with radical pelvic exenteration with formation of an end colostomy and urinary ileal conduit. A post-operative pelvic collection necessitated incisional drainage via the perineum.

40|$|Background: Sometimes the {{superficial}} temporal artery (STA) {{is not available}} for an extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass procedure. An alternative vessel for an EC-IC bypass is the posterior auricular artery (PAA) if it extends to the temporoparietal area with a diameter large enough.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{addition}} to prosthetic rehabilitation, maxillary defects {{can also be}} surgically reconstructed. Soft-tissue reconstruction employs a radial forearm or latissimus dorsi muscle flap, while bony reconstruction can be achieved using a fibula, iliac crest, or scapular flap. Reconstruction using a scapular flap is further divided into two subgroups: the traditional scapular flap with the circumflex scapular artery as the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> and the scapular angle flap with the angular artery originating from the thoracodorsal artery as the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on four patients who underwent successful reconstruction with a free scapular angle flap between 2009 and 2011, following maxillary resection due to malignancy. RESULTS: Vertical positioning of the scapular angle flap enables reconstruction of the facial contour, whereas its horizontal alignment and microvascular anastomosis makes a bony reconstruction of the hard palate possible. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility, low rate of donor site morbidity {{and shape of the}} scapular angle flap [...] which resembles that of the hard palate [...] render it ideal for plastic reconstruction.

40|$|During {{the time}} of tissue repair that ensues {{subsequent}} to tissue injury, blood vessel wall fibronectin increases concomitantly with endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. However, {{the source of this}} blood vessel fibronectin had not been delineated. In this report we have demonstrated that microvascular fibronectin is produced in situ by the proliferating vessels surrounding excisional wounds. This finding was established by extirpating 3 mm of skin from the center of a well- healed rat xenograph on the flanks of immunosuppressed mice, harvesting the injured skin sites at various stages during the healing process, and staining the specimens with reciprocal species-specific anti- fibronectin. The proliferating <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> that surrounded the wounded graft had increased fluorescence staining with FITC conjugated mouse anti-rat fibronectin and no staining with rat anti-mouse fibronectin.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of CTO is a complex procedure carrying the risk of complications that are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. The complications can be classified as coronary (such as coronary occlusion, perforation, device embolization, or entrapment); cardiac non-coronary (such as periprocedural myocardial infarction); extra cardiac (such as vascular access complications, systemic embolization, contrast-induced nephropathy, and radiation-induced injury). Further, certain complications (such as <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> dissection or thrombosis) are unique to CTOâ€“PCI.

40|$|Introduction. Live donors, {{extended}} donor criteria, and {{the maximum}} usage of organs with anatomical variants {{are some of}} the mechanisms used {{to increase the number of}} organs available. Case. We present the case of a kidney transplant, in which the organ had an iatrogenic injury to a lower pole arterial branch during retrieval. The donor was a 35 -year-old male (DCD, Maastricht III). The right kidney was accepted; it had three veins in a single cava patch and three renal arteries, the main artery with aorta patch that is 8 [*]cm long. A small lower pole artery was sectioned during retrieval surgery at approximately 1 [*]cm from its origin as well as a third small mid-lower pole artery. The lower pole damaged artery was reconstructed using tubularised aorta patch to a total length of 5 [*]cm. No additional <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> had been sent. After construction of the tubulised aorta, E-E anastomosis to the damaged polar artery was done with interrupted 7 - 0 Prolene sutures. Conclusion. While the waiting list for a kidney continues to rise and we continue to have organ shortness, vascular retrieval injury should not be an absolute contraindication for transplant...|$|E
40|$|Small airway {{fibrosis}} (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) is {{the primary}} obstacle to long-term survival following lung transplantation. Here, we show the importance of functional microvasculature {{in the prevention of}} epithelial loss and fibrosis due to rejection and for the first time, relate allograft microvascular injury and loss of tissue perfusion to immunotherapy-resistant rejection. To explore the role of alloimmune rejection and airway ischemia in the development of fibroproliferation, we used a murine orthotopic tracheal transplant model. We determined that transplants were reperfused by connection of recipient vessels to <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> at the surgical anastomosis site. Microcirculation through the newly formed vascular anastomoses appeared partially dependent on VEGFR 2 and CXCR 2 pathways. In the absence of immunosuppression, the microvasculature in rejecting allografts exhibited vascular complement deposition, diminished endothelial CD 31 expression, and absent perfusion prior to the onset of fibroproliferation. Rejecting grafts with extensive endothelial cell injury were refractory to immunotherapy. After early microvascular loss, neovascularization was eventually observed in the membranous trachea, indicating a reestablishment of graft perfusion in established fibrosis. One implication {{of this study is that}} bronchial artery revascularization at the time of lung transplantation may decrease the risk of subsequent airway fibrosis...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{coronary}} artery bypass surgery was performed in the United States on May 2, 1960, at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Bronx Municipal Hospital Center by {{a team led by}} Robert H.

In this technique the vessels are held together with circumferential ligatures over an inserted metal ring. The internal mammary artery was used as the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> and was anastomosed to the right {{coronary artery}}. The actual anastomosis with the Rosenbach ring took fifteen seconds and did not require cardiopulmonary bypass. The disadvantage of using the internal mammary artery was that, at autopsy nine months later, the anastomosis was open, but an atheromatous plaque had occluded the origin of the internal mammary that was used for the bypass.|$|R
40|$|Transplant-associated {{arteriosclerosis}} {{remains an}} obstacle to long-term graft survival. To determine the contribution to transplant arteriosclerosis of MHC and adhesion molecules from cells of the donor vasculature, we allografted carotid artery loops from six mutant mouse strains into immunocompetent CBA/CaJ recipients. The donor mice were deficient in either MHC I molecules or MHC II molecules, both MHC I and MHC II molecules, the adhesion molecule P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, or both P-selectin and ICAM- 1. Donor arteries in which ICAM- 1, MHC II, or both MHC I and MHC II were absent showed reductions in neointima formation of 52 %, 33 %, and 38 %, respectively, due primarily {{to a reduction in}} smooth muscle cell (SMC) accumulation. In P-selectinâ€“deficient donor arteries, neointima formation did not differ from that in controls. In donor arteries lacking both P-selectin and ICAM- 1, the size of the neointima was similar to that in those lacking ICAM- 1 alone. In contrast, neointima formation increased by 52 % in MHC Iâ€“deficient donor arteries. The number of CD 4 -positive T cells increased by 2. 8 -fold in MHC Iâ€“deficient arteries, and that of Î±-actinâ€“positive SMCs by twofold. These observations indicate that ICAM- 1 and MHC II molecules expressed in the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> wall may promote transplant-associated arteriosclerosis. MHC I molecules expressed in the donor may have a protective effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Squamous cell carcinomos {{may arise}} from chronic ulcerating wounds in scars, most {{commonly}} postburn scars. Tumour growth usually takes place over months to years. Localization on the scalp is a relatively rare condition. Case presentation This report presents {{the case of a}} 63 -year-old man with chronic ulceration of a postburn scar of the scalp due to an electrical burn 58 years ago. Sudden tumour growth started within weeks and on presentation already had extended through the skull into frontal cortex. After radical tumour resection, defect was covered with a free radial forearm flap. Local recurrence occurred 6 weeks later. Subsequent wide excision including discard of the flap and preservation of the radial vessels was followed by transfer of a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap, using the radial vessels of the first flap as recipient vessels. The patient received radiotherapy post-operatively. There were no problems with flap survivals or wound healing. Due to rapidly growing recurrence the patient died 2 months later. Conclusion Explosive SCC tumour growth might occur in post-burn scars after more than 50 years. As a treatment option the use of sequential free flap connections might serve in repeated extensive tumour resections, especially in the scalp region, where suitable <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> are often located in distance to the defect. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a 57 -year-old male patient who {{presented}} with squamous cell carcinoma on his mouth floor with cervical and mandibular metastases. Wide glossectomy with intergonial mandibular ostectomy, and sequential reconstruction using fibular osteomyocutaneous free flap were planned. When the anastomosis between the peroneal artery of the fibular free flap and the right lingual artery was performed, no venous flow was observed at the vena comitans. Then re-anastomosis followed by topical application of papaverine and lidocaine was attempted. However, the blood supply was not recovered. Warm saline irrigation over 30 minutes was also useless. Microvascular thromboses of <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> were clinically suspected, so a solution of 100, 000 units of urokinase was infused once through a 26 -gauge angiocatheter inserted into the recipient artery just at the arterial anastomotic site, until the solution gushed out through the flap vena comitans. Immediately after the application of urokinase, arterial flow and venous return were restored. There were no complications during the follow-up period of 11 months. We believe that vibrating injuries from the reciprocating saw during osteotomies and flap insetting might be the cause of microvascular thromboses. The use of urokinase may provide a viable option for the treatment of suspicious intraoperative arterial thrombosis...|$|E
40|$|Endothelial cell {{integrity}} (coverage and quality) {{of large}} <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> {{is important because}} these vessels are used for vascular reconstructions in solid-organ transplantation. Disruption of the endothelial cell monolayer will initiate blood coagulation and may lead to thrombosis of large vessels, often resulting {{in the loss of}} the transplanted organ. Iliac arteries and veins, removed from 10 heart-beating multi-organ donors {{at the end of the}} donor procedure. were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy at three different rime points of preservation. Endothelial cell coverage and quality were determined immediately after removal from the donor, after 10 h (time of transplantation) and 7 d storage in 'University of Wisconsin' cold preservation solution (UW). Endothelial cell coverage decreased during the preservation of arteries, but was maintained in veins. Storage of the veins for 7 d in plastic bags showed a decreased endothelial cell coverage compared to storage in glass vials. Early removal of the blood vessels and proper storage, free floating and in clean UW, may improve maintenance of the endothelial cell integrity. These findings may be important in order to reduce the risk of thrombosis and, consequently, organ failure after transplantation. Furthermore, vessels with maintained endothelial cell integrity after 7 d may be used for in vitro research...|$|E
40|$|Backgroundâ€”Endothelial {{regeneration}} and angiogenesis in the intima of the {{arterial wall}} are key {{events in the}} pathogenesis of transplantation arteriosclerosis. The traditional hypothesis that damaged endothelial cells are replaced by remaining cells of the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> has been challenged by recent observations, but the cell origins of large arteries and microvessels are still not well established. Methods and Resultsâ€”Aortic segments were allografted between Balb/c and TIE 2 -LacZ (C 57 BL/ 6) mice expressing -galactosidase (gal) in endothelial cells. -gal cells in TIE 2 -LacZ vessels grafted to Balb/c mice completely disappeared, whereas the positive cells found in Balb/c aorta allografted into TIE 2 -LacZ mice 4 weeks after surgery indicated a host origin. En face analysis of allograft vessels displayed a unique distribution of -gal cells on the surface at 3 days, 1 week, and 4 weeks. Interestingly, 3519 % -gal cells were found in arterial segments allografted into chimeric mice with TIE 2 -LacZ bone marrows. Furthermore, endothelial cells of microvessels within allografts had a -gal staining in the media at 1 week and in the neointimal lesions and adventitia at 4 weeks. Allograft studies in chimeric mice demonstrated that -gal cells of microvessels in transplant arteriosclerosis were derived from bone marrow progenitors.

40|$|The {{superficial}} temporal artery (STA) {{is frequently}} used as <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> in extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery. Current techniques typically {{rely on a}} Doppler vascular probe to identify the STA trajectory prior to the skin incision; however, this step can be time consuming and difficult when the arterial course is tortuous. We tested an alternative neuronavigation-based technique for locating the STA. In this method, preoperative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) {{was used to determine}} STA outlines that were then projected and traced onto the skin. The neuronavigation-based technique was applied to eight STA dissections. The accuracy of this method was evaluated by comparing the navigation-based STA course with the doppler-based one and the actual STA course intraoperatively. STA trajectory was determined before surgery by using three imaging techniques: CTA (3 cases), three-dimensional (3 D) contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MRA (4 cases), and/or 3 D time-of-flight MRA (5 cases). In all cases, the neuronavigation-based STA position was confirmed with the Doppler vascular probe before skin incision and corresponded to the actual vessel position intraoperatively. As long as the skin is not mobilized during preoperative image acquisition and surgery, this neuronavigation-based approach is a valid method to identify STA course. During the preoperative planning process, the STA trajectory should be analyzed from its origin {{at the level of the}} foramen spinosum to avoid mistaking nearby venous structures as the STA.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) {{accumulation}} {{in the inner}} layer of the vessel wall is a key event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in vein grafts, but {{the origin of the}} cells in these lesions has yet to be shown. Herein, we use animal models of vein grafts in transgenic mice to clearly identify the sources of SMCs in atherosclerosis. Vena cava segments were isografted to carotid arteries between four types of transgenic mice, including SM-LacZ expressing ï¿½-galactosidase (ï¿½-gal) in vascular SMCs, SM-LacZ/apoEï¿½/ ï¿½, ROSA 26 expressing ï¿½-gal in all tissues, and wild-type mice. ï¿½-galâ€“positive cells were observed in neointimal and atherosclerotic lesions of all vein segments grafted between LacZ transgenic and wild-type mice. Double staining for ï¿½-gal and cell nuclei revealed that about 40 % of SMCs originated from hosts and 60 % from the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel.</b> This was confirmed by double labeling of the Y-chromosome and ï¿½-actin in the lesions of sex-mismatched vein grafts. The possibility that bone marrow cells were the source of SMCs in grafts was eliminated by the absence of ï¿½-gal staining in atherosclerotic lesions of chimeric mice. Furthermore, vein SMCs of SM-LacZ mice did not express ï¿½-gal in situ, but did so when these cells appeared in atherosclerotic lesions in vivo, suggesting that hemodynamic forces may be crucial for SMC differentiation. Thus, we provide the first evidence of SMC origins in the atherosclerotic lesions of vein grafts, which will be essential for providing insight into new types of therapy for the disease.

Although this technology could conceivably address certain inherent problems of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures, this potential has not been explored to date. We evaluate the usefulness of an augmented reality-based setup, which could help in harvesting <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> through their precise localization in real-time, in performing tailored craniotomies, and in identifying preoperatively selected recipient vessels for the purpose of anastomosis. Methods: Our method was applied to three patients suffering from Moya-Moya disease who underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomoses, and to one patient who underwent an occipital artery-to-posteroinferior cerebellar artery bypass due to a dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Patients' heads, skulls and extracranial and intracranial vessels were preoperatively segmented from 3 -dimensional image data sets (3 -dimensional digital subtraction angiography, angio-magnetic resonance imaging, angio-computed tomography), and injected intraoperatively into the operating microscope's eyepiece for image guidance. Results: In each case, the described setup helped in precisely localizing donor and recipient vessels, and in tailoring craniotomies to the injected images. Conclusions: The presented system based on augmented reality can optimize the workflow of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures, by providing essential anatomical information, entirely integrated to the surgical field, and can help to perform minimally invasive procedures...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Superficial {{temporal}} artery-to-middle {{cerebral artery}} (STA-MCA) bypass remains an essential tool for managing complex cerebrovascular conditions. A crucial surgical step is {{the identification and}} safe dissection of the bypass donor artery. If the frontal branch of the STA is used, a curvilinear fronto-temporal scalp flap generally allows for a clean dissection from {{the underside of the}} scalp flap. This dissection is sometimes tedious, since the frontal branch is not always easily visible and due to variability of its anatomy. With this article, we report on the feasibility and effectiveness of a simple indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) -assisted technique for the identification of the STA branches from the underside of a fronto-temporal scalp flap in bypass surgery. METHODS The technique is based on the analysis of the difference in timing of filling of scalp vessels illuminated via ICG-VA from the underside of a scalp flap. Three illustrative cases are reported. RESULTS ICG-VA permitted the correct identification and safe dissection of the <b>donor</b> <b>vessels</b> (STA branches) in all three patients. There were no complications due to the ICG-VA. CONCLUSIONS This technique allows reliable visualization of the STA and its branches at once before microsurgical dissection. The information provided by ICG-VA enables precise mapping and preparation of the STA. The simplicity and safety of this technique make it an effective tool for intraoperative identification of the STA and its branches...|$|E

RECENT FINDINGS: The most recognized indications for angular branch-based osteomuscular free flaps are class II (especially in association with zygomaticomaxillary buttress and/or floor of the orbit removal) and class III defects according to the Okay classification. Defects involving clearance of the orbital content have also been reconstructed in this manner. One of the most important drawbacks of this technique (i. e., need for intraoperative patient repositioning) is no longer considered an issue, and evidence has been provided that harvesting of angular branch-based scapular flaps may be routinely performed in a supine position. Three-dimensional morphologic similarity of the tip of the scapula with the native hard palate and other maxillary structures makes flap fabrication easy and practical, with at least two (horizontal and vertical) most commonly used flap orientations applied to reconstruct different defects. SUMMARY: Angular branch-based osteomuscular scapular free flaps represent a major advance in palatomaxillary reconstruction: their versatility, long pedicle with large caliber <b>donor</b> <b>vessels,</b> morphologic similarity with maxillary bony structures, and limited donor-site morbidity compare favorably with those of other osteomuscular and osteomusculocutaneous free flaps described for such challenging reconstructive purposes...|$|E
40|$|The Excimer Laser Assisted Non-Occlusive Anastomoses (ELANA) {{technique}} {{is used to}} create anastomoses between major arteries in the brain while avoiding the dangerous temporary occlusion of the cerebral blood ow. This decreases the risk of complica ons due to hypoxia of the brain, but the surgery is long and requires a highly skilled vascular neurosurgeon. A er over 500 ELANA surgeries at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) the current clinical success rate is approximately 80 %. Non-successful surgery can lead to severe complica ons or even death. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} op mize the technique. In our research we aimed to improve the design of the ELANA toolkit in order to increase the laboratory success percentage, which was 88 % in previous studies. Problem analysis revealed that the main cause for failure of the procedure is improper contact of the catheter with the recieving artery during lasering. We researched alterna ve designs which included di erent cu ng techniques, adding posi onal feedback and fool proo ng the setup to reduce the dependency on the skillset of the surgeon. The addi on of a balloon to the catheter which holds the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> results in increased stability and makes ELANA less dependable on the opera ng surgeon. The success rate in a pilot study with the new design on 20 rabbit arteries and 20 human great saphenous vein (GSV) vessels was 100 %. This is a promising result, especially as all tests were carried out by non-medical personnel. Further tes ng is recommended to validate these ndings and prove superiority and safety.

40|$|Inflammation is a {{key factor}} in the {{development}} of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. It is promoted through the inflammasome, a molecular machine that produces IL (interleukin) - 1 Î² in response to cholesterol crystal accumulation in macrophages. The CARD 8 (caspase recruitment domain 8) protein modulates this process by suppressing caspase 1 and the transcription factor NF-ÎºB (nuclear factor ÎºB). The expression of CARD 8 mRNA was examined in atherosclerotic vascular tissue and the impact on MI (myocardial infarction) of a polymorphism in the CARD 8 gene determined. CARD 8 mRNA was analysed by microarray of human atherosclerotic tissue and compared with transplant donor arterial tissue. Microarray analysis was performed for proximal genes associated with the rs 2043211 locus in plaque. The CARD 8 rs 2043211 polymorphism was analysed by genotyping of two Swedish MI cohorts, FIA (First Myocardial Infarction in Northern Sweden) and SCARF (Stockholm Coronary Atherosclerosis Risk Factor). The CRP (C-reactive protein) level was measured in both cohorts, but the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 Î², IL- 18, TNF (tumour necrosis factor) and MCP- 1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein) were measured in sera available from the SCARF cohort. CARD 8 mRNA was highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques compared with the expression in transplant <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> (P< 0. 00001). The minor allele was associated with lower expression of CARD 8 in the plaques, suggesting that CARD 8 may promote inflammation. Carriers of the minor allele of the rs 2043211 polymorphism also displayed lower circulating CRP and lower levels of the pro-atherosclerotic chemokine MCP- 1. However, no significant association could be detected between this polymorphism and MI in the two cohorts. Genetic alterations in the CARD 8 gene therefore seem to be of limited importance for the development of MI...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} the efficacy and durability of supraceliac aortorenal bypass grafting for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery disease. Methods: Retrospective {{review of a}} 10 -year, single-institution experience. Results: Seventeen patients underwent 27 bypass procedures (seven unilateral, 10 bilateral) for atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension. The patients' mean age was 62. 7 Â± 8. 8 years. Diffuse aortoiliac and visceral atherosclerosis was confirmed on arteriogram; most (88 %) celiac axis branches and all infrarenal aortas and common iliac arteries were found unsuitable {{for use as a}} <b>donor</b> <b>vessel.</b> Twenty-six bypass procedures (96 %) were performed with autologous vein grafts. Seventeen bypass procedures (63 %) were performed during partial aortic occlusion. There were no operative deaths or early occlusions. Postoperative complications occurred in four patients (24 %). The mean duration of follow-up was 28 Â± 19 months (range, 2 to 69 months). By life table analysis, the 5 -year primary patency and assisted primary patency rates were 95 % and 100 %, respectively. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 180 Â± 38 mm Hg to 135 Â± 20 mm Hg (p = 0. 0003), and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased from 96 Â± 16 mm Hg to 77 Â± 9 mm Hg (p = 0. 0002). The number of antihypertensive medications decreased from 2. 8 Â± 1. 2 to 1. 4 Â± 1. 0 (p = 0. 002). Significant improvement in serum creatinine level was seen among patients with preoperative renal insufficiency. Hypertension was cured in 29 %, improved in 53 %, and unchanged in 18 %. During late follow-up, only four patients (24 %) required subsequent aortic reconstruction. Conclusion: Supraceliac aortorenal bypass grafting is a safe and durable alternative for renal artery revascularization. This technique should be considered in patients who have diffuse infrarenal aortoiliac and visceral artery occlusive disease and require renal revascularization procedures...|$|R
