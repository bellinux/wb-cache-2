40|$|Shock {{ignition}} is a laser direct-drive {{inertial confinement}} fusion (ICF) scheme {{in which the}} stages of compression and hot spot formation are partly separated. The fuel is first imploded at a lower velocity than in conventional ICF, reducing the threats due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI). Close to stagnation, an intense laser spike drives a strong converging shock, which contributes to hot spot formation. This paper starts with {{a brief overview of}} theoretical studies, target design and experimental results on shock ignition. The second part of the paper illustrates original work aiming at the design of robust targets and computation of the relevant gain curves. Following Chang et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 135002 (2010) ] a safety factor for high gain, IFT* (analogous to the ignition threshold factor ITF [Clark et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056305 (2008) ]), is evaluated by means of parametric one-dimensional simulations with artificially reduced reactivity. SI designs scaled as in Atzeni et al. [New J. Phys. 15, 045004 (2013) ] are found to have nearly the same ITF*. For a given target, such ITF* increases with <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity</b> and laser spike power. A gain curve with a prescribed ITF* can then be simply generated by upscaling a reference target with that value of ITF*. An interesting option is scaling in size by reducing the <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity</b> to keep the ratio of <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity</b> to self-ignition velocity constant. At given total laser energy, targets with higher ITF* are driven to higher <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity</b> and achieve somewhat lower gain. However, 1 D gain higher than 100 is achieved at (incident) energy below 1 MJ, <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity</b> below 300 km/s, and peak incident power below 400 TW. Two-dimensional simulations of mispositioned targets show that targets with higher ITF* indeed tolerate larger displacements...|$|E

40|$|Essential {{ingredients}} of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) are fuel compression to very high density and hot spot ignition. In the conventional approach to ICF both fuel compression and hot spot formation {{are produced by}} the implosion ofa suitable target driven by a time-tailored pulse of laser light or X-rays. This scheme requires an <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity</b> of 350 - 400 km/s. In advanced ignition schemes, instead,the stages of compression and hot spot heating are separated.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{magnetic}} field within a fusion target {{is now known as}} Magnetized Target Fusion in the US and as MAGO (Magnitnoye Obzhatiye, or magnetic compression) in Russia. In contrast to direct, hydrodynamic compression of initially ambient-temperature fuel (e. g., ICF), MTF involves two steps: (a) formation of a warm, magnetized, wall-confined plasma of intermediate density within a fusion target prior to implosion; (b) subsequent quasi-adiabatic compression and heating of the plasma by imploding the confining wall, or pusher. In many ways, MTF can be considered a marriage between the more mature MFE and ICF approaches, and this marriage potentially eliminates some of the hurdles encountered in the other approaches. When compared to ICF, MTF requires lower <b>implosion</b> <b>velocity,</b> lower initial density, significantly lower radial convergence, and larger targets, all of which lead to substantially reduced driver intensity, power, and symmetry requirements. When compared to MFE, MTF does not require a vacuum separating the plasma from the wall, and, in fact, complete magnetic confinement, even if possible, may not be desirable. The higher density of MTF and much shorter confinement times should make magnetized plasma formation a much less difficult step than in MFE.

Moreover, since there will inevitably be uncertainties in the initial character and implosion dynamics of any given capsule, all of which can contribute to the eventual hot spot perturbation, quantifying the robustness of that capsule against a range of parameter variations is an important consideration in the capsule design.

The shell preheat caused by hot electrons generated by two-plasmon-decay instability was reduced by using Si-doped ablators. The measured compressibility of planar plastic targets driven with high-compression shaped pulses agrees well with one-dimensional simulations at these intensities.

40|$|Shock ignition, a {{new concept}} for igniting {{thermonuclear}} fuel, offers {{the potential for a}} near-term test of high gain inertial confinement fusion on the National Ignition Facility at less than 1 MJ drive energy and without the need for new laser hardware. In shock ignition, compressed fusion fuel is separately ignited by a strong spherically-converging shock and, because capsule <b>implosion</b> <b>velocities</b> are significantly lower than those required for conventional hotpot ignition, simulations indicate that high fusion energy gains of ∼ 60 may be achievable on NIF at laser drive energies around ∼ 0. 5 MJ, extending to ∼ 100 at 1 MJ. Because of the simple all- DT or DT/CH target designs, their in-flight robustness, the potential need for only 1 D SSD beam smoothing, minimal early-time LPI preheat issues, and employment of day- 1 laser hardware, these targets may be easier to field on NIF than a conventional (polar) direct drive hotspot ignition target. Like fast ignition, shock ignition has the potential for high fusion yields at low drive energy, but requires only a single laser with less demanding timing and spatial focusing requirements. Of course, conventional symmetry and stability constraints will apply, thus a key immediate step for shock ignition on NIF is to demonstrate the adequacy of low-mode uniformity and shock symmetry in the polar drive configuration. Shock ignition offers the prospects for high-gain targets that may lead to smaller, more economic fusion power reactors and a cheaper fusion energy development path...|$|R
40|$|Atlas {{will be a}} high-energy (36 MJ stored), {{high-power}} ({approximately} 10 TW) {{pulsed power}} driver for high energy-density experiments, {{with an emphasis on}} hydrodynamics. Scheduled for completion in late 1999, Atlas is designed to produce currents in the 40 - 50 MA range with a quarter-cycle time of 4 - 5 {mu}s. It will drive implosions of heavy liners (typically 50 g) with <b>implosion</b> <b>velocities</b> exceeding 20 mm/{mu}s. Under these conditions very high pressures and magnetic fields are produced. Shock pressures in the 50 Mbar range and pressures exceeding 10 Mbar in an adiabatic compression will be possible. By performing flux compression of a seed field, axial magnetic fields in the 2000 T range may be achieved. A variety of concepts have been identified for the first experimental campaigns on Atlas. These experiments include Rayleigh-Taylor instability studies, convergent (e. g., Bell-Plesset type) instability studies, material strength experiments at very high strain and strain rate, hydrodynamic flows in 3 -dimensional geometries, equation of state measurements along the hugoniot and adiabats, transport and shock propagation in dense strongly-coupled plasmas, and atomic and condensed matter studies employing ultra-high magnetic fields. Experimental configurations, associated physics issues, and diagnostic strategies are all under investigation as the design of the Atlas facility proceeds. Near-term proof-of-principle experiments employing the smaller Pegasus II capacitor bank have been identified, and several of these experiments have not been performed. This paper discusses a number of recent Pegasus II experiments and identifies several areas of research presently planned on Atlas...|$|R
40|$|Direct-drive {{inertial}} conﬁnement {{thermonuclear fusion}} consists in illuminating {{a shell of}} cryogenic Deuterium and Tritium (DT) mixture with many intense beams of laser light. Capsule is composed of DT gassurrounded by cryogenic DT as combustible fuel. Basic rules are used to deﬁne shell geometry from aspect ratio, fuel mass and layers densities. We deﬁne baseline designs using two aspect ratio (A= 3 and A= 5) who complete HiPER baseline design (A= 7. 7). Aspect ratio is deﬁned as the ratio of ice DT shell inner radius over DT shell thickness. Low aspect ratio improves hydrodynamics stabilities of imploding shell. Laser impulsion shape and ablator thickness are initially deﬁned by using Lindl (1995) pressure ablation and mass ablation formulae for direct-drive using CH layer as ablator. In ﬂight adiabat parameter is close to one during implosion. Velocitie simplosions chosen are between 260 km/s and 365 km/s. More than thousand calculations are realized for each aspect ratio in order to optimize the laser pulse shape. Calculations are performed using the one-dimensional version of the Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamics FCI 2. We choose <b>implosion</b> <b>velocities</b> for each initial aspect ratio, and we compute scaled-target family curves for each one to ﬁnd self-ignition threshold. Then, we pick points on each curves that potentially product high thermonuclear gain and compute shock ignition {{in the context of}} Laser MegaJoule. This systematic analyze reveals many working points which complete previous studies ´allowing to highlight baseline designs, according to laser intensity and energy, combustible mass and initial aspect ratio to be relevant for Laser MegaJoule...|$|R
