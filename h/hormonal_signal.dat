50|$|Hormone {{cells are}} {{typically}} of a specialized cell type, residing {{within a particular}} endocrine gland, such as the thyroid gland, ovaries, and testes. Hormones exit their cell of origin via exocytosis or another means of membrane transport. The hierarchical model is an oversimplification of the hormonal signaling process. Cellular recipients of a particular <b>hormonal</b> <b>signal</b> {{may be one of}} several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues, as is the case for insulin, which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that {{nutrient}} availability controls plant development. Moreover, plant development is finely tuned by a myriad of <b>hormonal</b> <b>signals.</b> Thus, it is not surprising to see increasing evidence of coordination between nutritional and <b>hormonal</b> <b>signaling.</b> In this opinion article, we discuss how nitrogen <b>signals</b> control the <b>hormonal</b> status of plants and how <b>hormonal</b> <b>signals</b> interplay with nitrogen nutrition. We further expand the discussion to include other nutrient-hormone pairs. We propose that nutrition and growth are linked by a multi-level, feed-forward cycle that regulates plant growth, development and metabolism via dedicated signaling pathways that mediate nutrient and hormonal regulation. We believe this model will provide a useful concept for past and future research in this field...|$|R

50|$|Among invertebrates, the {{nematode}} Pristionchus pacificus has one morph that primarily {{feeds on}} bacteria {{and a second}} morph that produces large teeth, enabling it to feed on other nematodes, including competitors for bacterial food.

40|$|During their sessile mode of life, plants need {{to endure}} {{variations}} {{in their environment}} such as a drastic variability in the nutrient concentration in soil solution. It is almost trivial to say that such fluctuations in the soil modify plant growth, development and phase transitions. However, the signaling pathways underlying the connections between nitrogen related <b>signaling</b> and <b>hormonal</b> <b>signaling</b> controlling growth are still poorly documented. This review is meant to present how nitrate/nitrogen controls hormonal pathways. Furthermore, it is very interesting to highlight the increasing evidence that the <b>hormonal</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways themselves seem to feed back control of the nitrate/nitrogen transport and assimilation to adapt nutrition to growth. This thus defines a feed-forward cycle that finely coordinates plant growth and nutrition...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, Earl Sutherland and Theodore Rall {{discovered}} that cyclic AMP (the second messenger in signal transduction) was a responsible for activating enzymes in the cell, and that cyclic AMP is produced only when hormones (the first messengers) bind {{on the cell}} surface. Cyclic AMP is formed from ATP by the enzymes adenylyl cyclase. In 1970 Martin Rodbell found that hormones did not directly influence cyclic AMP, but there existed other molecules, the third messengers. Rodbell {{discovered that}} cyclic AMP is activiated when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is released from the cell membrane. He, however, {{did not know how}} the GTP molecules were produced. Gilman pursued the mystery in the signalling process. He found that in lymphoma (cancer) cells, hormones lost their activity to activate adenylyl cyclase, thereby losing their ability to produce cyclic AMP. This was due to loss of proteins in these cancer cells. When he introduced the missing protein from normal cells into the cancer cells, normal hormone action was produced. This showed that the missing membrane protein was responsible for mediating <b>hormonal</b> <b>signal</b> to cyclic AMP by producing GTP. His findings were published in a series of papers between 1977 and 1979. In 1980, he succeeded in identifying and isolating the new protein, which he named G protein, as it specifically bind GTP molecules.|$|E

40|$|A carotenoid-derived <b>hormonal</b> <b>signal</b> that {{inhibits}} shoot branching {{in plants}} has long escaped identification. Strigolactones are compounds {{thought to be}} derived from carotenoids and are known to trigger the germination of parasitic plant seeds and stimulate symbiotic fungi. Here we present evidence that carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 shoot branching mutants of pea are strigolactone deficient and that strigolactone application restores the wild-type branching phenotype to ccd 8 mutants. Moreover, we show that other branching mutants previously characterized as lacking a response to the branching inhibition signal also lack strigolactone response, and are not deficient in strigolactones. These responses are conserved in Arabidopsis. In agreement with the expected properties of the <b>hormonal</b> <b>signal,</b> exogenous strigolactone can be transported in shoots and act at low concentrations. We suggest that endogenous strigolactones or related compounds inhibit shoot branching in plants. Furthermore, ccd 8 mutants demonstrate the diverse effects of strigolactones in shoot branching, mycorrhizal symbiosis and parasitic weed interaction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractModels of β-adrenergic signal {{transduction}} in {{red blood cell}} membranes frequently assume {{that at least one}} of the membrane-bound components is laterally mobile and distributes the <b>hormonal</b> <b>signal</b> in the membrane plane. However, direct measurements reveal that protein lateral mobility in the red cell membrane is severely restricted. Furthermore, the spectrin-actin skeleton compartmentalizes the cytoplasmic face of the red cell membrane into a regular array of small elementary areas.

40|$|Experiments {{with several}} Arabidopsis thaliana mutants have {{revealed}} {{a web of}} interactions between <b>hormonal</b> <b>signaling.</b> Here, we show that the Arabidopsis mutant radical-induced cell death 1 (rcd 1), although hypersensitive to apoplastic superoxide and ozone, is more resistant to chloroplastic superoxide formation, exhibits reduced sensitivity to abscisic acid, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate, and has altered expression of several hormonally regulated genes. Furthermore, rcd 1 has higher stomatal conductance than the wild type. The rcd 1 - 1 mutation was mapped to the gene At 1 g 32230 where it disrupts an intron splice site resulting in a truncated protein. RCD 1 belongs to the (ADP-ribosyl) transferase domain-containing subfamily of the WWE protein-protein interaction domain protein family. The results suggest that RCD 1 could act as an integrative node in <b>hormonal</b> <b>signaling</b> and in the regulation of several stress-responsive genes...|$|R
