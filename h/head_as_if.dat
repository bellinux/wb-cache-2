25|$|Because of {{consumer}} demand, the cassette has remained influential on design, {{more than a}} decade after its decline as a media mainstay. As the Compact Disc grew in popularity, cassette-shaped audio adapters were developed to provide an economical and clear way to obtain CD functionality in vehicles equipped with cassette decks. A portable CD player would have its analog line-out connected to the adapter, which in turn fed the signal {{to the head of the}} cassette deck. These adapters continue to function with MP3 players and smartphones, and generally are more reliable than the FM transmitters that must be used to adapt CD players and digital audio players to car stereo systems. Digital audio players shaped as cassettes have also become available, which can be inserted into any cassette player and communicate with the <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were normal cassettes.|$|E
25|$|Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman {{noticed that}} dogs often {{demonstrate}} obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans. Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{is not only}} specific only to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors. Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have. Hallucinating and attacking the air around their <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were a bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs. Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of behaviors that are considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe {{compiled}} {{his list}} of most annoying TV characters. Jenny came second on the list and he stated: [...] "Wow. The gods of narcissism blessed Jenny bigtime. She was just too, too self-centered. She sucked {{the life out of}} everyone who crossed her path." [...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the [...] "profundity of Jenny's annoying effect", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good." [...] Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped [...] "(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just to fuck with Jenny's <b>head.</b> <b>As</b> <b>if</b> Jenny's head needed the encouragement".|$|E

Rodman wrote that Ciara [...] "takes her own advice to 'put some snap into it'." [...] About.com writer Bill Lamb named {{it one of}} the album's best, and wrote that it [...] "lands somewhere between Ciara's {{contemporary}} classic '1, 2 Step' and Missy Elliott's own 'Lose Control'." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now considered it the album's strongest track and noted Ciara and Elliott's [...] "trademark chemistry". IGN's Finn White wrote that the song [...] "will make all the bad girls sweat on the dance floor". In his review of Fantasy Ride, Marrio Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] is a [...] "dance-floor corker", and noted that [...] "Work" [...] is [...] "similarly club-ready", referring both songs to as [...] "ultra-catchy". Regarding [...] "Work", Tarradell wrote, [...] "The rapid-fire 'work, work, work' refrain will bond to your <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> with Krazy Glue." [...] Writing for Metro Weekly, Doug Rule called the song an [...] "instant classic" [...] and referred it to as a [...] "sequel of sorts to Elliott's marvelous 2002 hit 'Work It'." [...] A writer from Rap-Up named the song one of the album's top tracks.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1981 {{incident}} {{described by}} Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as [...] "one {{of the most}} undignified incidents in Test history", Dennis Lillee and Pakistani batsman Javed Miandad clashed after the two collided with {{each other on the}} pitch. After colliding, Lillee turned and kicked Miandad from behind; Miandad lifted his bat above his <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to strike Lillee and Lillee backed off.

2500|$|SCDS-related autophony differs {{greatly in}} quality and {{range from the}} more common form which results from an open, or patulous Eustachian tube through which sufferers of this {{disorder}} {{hear the sound of}} their own voice and breathing. In contrast, patients with SCDS-related autophony report hearing their own voice as a disturbingly loud and distorted [...] "kazoo-like" [...] sound deep inside the <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> relayed through [...] "a cracked loudspeaker." [...] Additionally they may hear the creaking and cracking of joints, the sound of their footsteps when walking or running, their heartbeat and the sound of chewing and other digestive noises. Some sufferers of this condition experience such a high level of conductive hyperacusis that a tuning fork placed on the ankle will be heard in the affected ear. The bizarre phenomenon of being able to hear the sound of the eyeballs moving in their sockets (e.g. when reading in a quiet room) [...] "like sandpaper on wood" [...] {{is one of the more}} distinctive features of this condition and is almost exclusively associated with SCDS.|$|E

2500|$|Bodenheimer (1979, pp 299–300) {{believes}} that the narrator {{is interested in the}} psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. Matus (2007, pp.35–43) also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of [...] "interiority" [...] (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' [...] "trance of passion". The phrase [...] "as if" [...] appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration (O'Farrell, 1997, p 16): [...] "Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 11) and [...] " [...] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical" [...] (chapter 19). The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: [...] "As if she felt his look, she turned to him" [...] (chapter 22); [...] "He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it" [...] (chapter 28), and [...] "She lifted up her <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown" [...] (chapter 39). Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins (Matus, 2007, p 40): [...] " ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart" [...] (chapter 39).|$|E
