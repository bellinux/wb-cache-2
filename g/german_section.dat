5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's <b>German</b> <b>section,</b> Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|Strong became Head of the <b>German</b> <b>Section</b> at MI14 in August 1939, {{shortly before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. He commanded the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1941, before becoming Brigadier General Staff (BGS) for Intelligence at Home Forces in 1942. In March 1943, Strong was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G-2) at General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ). He attended the Italian peace negotiations. In May 1944 he joined Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and played a leading part in the negotiations for the unconditional surrender of Germany in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's <b>German</b> <b>section</b> was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{dissolution}} of the MThB, the trainsets went to the successor company Thurbo and were operated on the Seehas <b>German</b> <b>section</b> by Thurbo's German subsidiary EuroThurbo and later SBB GmbH. In 2006, nine Stadler FLIRT (RABe 526 651-659) took over the Seehas service. Thurbo subsequently sold the four trainsets plus the two extra driving trailers to SBB. They worked as RBDe 561 171-174/AB 30-35 671–674/Bt 29-35 971–976 in the S-Bahn Luzern system, partly over BLS tracks, for some time and have now been withdrawn. One motor car and two driving trailers were sold, the rest was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Generally, Von Steuben Day {{takes place}} in September in many cities {{throughout}} the United States. It is often considered the German-American event of the year. Participants march, dance, wear German costumes and play German music, and the event is attended by millions of people. The German-American Steuben Parade is held annually in September in New York City. It {{is one of the}} largest parades in the city and is traditionally followed by an Oktoberfest in Central Park as well as celebrations in Yorkville, Manhattan, a <b>German</b> <b>section</b> of New York City. The German-American Steuben Parade has been taking place since 1958. Chicago also hosts a von Steuben Day parade, which is featured in the U.S. film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Philadelphia hosts a smaller Steuben Parade in the Northeast section of the city. Steubenville, Ohio, has the recreated Fort Steuben, named after the Baron.|$|E

25|$|On 29 August 1916, Hindenburg and Ludendorff {{had been}} {{appointed}} to the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL supreme army command) of the German army, after the sacking of Falkenhayn, who had commanded the armies of Germany since September 1914. The new commanders, who {{became known as the}} Third OHL, had spent two years in command of Ober Ost, the <b>German</b> <b>section</b> of the Eastern Front. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had demanded reinforcements from Falkenhayn to fight a decisive campaign against Russia and intrigued against Falkenhayn over his refusals. Falkenhayn held that decisive military victory against Russia was impossible and that the Western Front was the main theatre of the war. Soon after taking over from Falkenhayn, Hindenburg and Ludendorff {{had no choice but to}} recognise the wisdom of Falkenhayn's judgement that the Western Front was decisive, despite the crisis in the east caused by the Brusilov Offensive (4 June – 20 September) and the Rumanian declaration of war on 28 August.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of reach}} of its parish, the church {{deteriorated}} year by year. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, it became obvious from the West Berlin side of the Havel that the building was in substantial danger. The tin surface of the roof had become fragmented. Some edges of the nave were settled by plants. Some people in West Berlin started a campaign to stop the decay of the church. A great deal of the merit for the preservation of the building is due to Richard von Weizsäcker, at that time Mayor of West Berlin. By protracted negotiations with the responsible Protestant church body, the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg and the authorities of the GDR and through the promise of sharing the costs, he won the agreement of the East <b>German</b> <b>section</b> of Berlin-Brandenburg's Protestant church to organize the restoration of the exterior of the building. At the beginning of the works in 1984, the sculptures of the Twelve Apostles were saved and stored. Other wooden furnishings, such as the twelve corbels and the gallery, still in evidence in pictures taken in 1981, were lost.|$|E
500|$|During the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939, key Cipher Bureau {{personnel}} were evacuated southeast and—after the Soviets invaded eastern Poland on 17 September—into Romania, {{on the way}} destroying their cryptological equipment and documentation. [...] Eventually, crossing Yugoslavia and still-neutral Italy, they reached France. [...] Some personnel of the Cipher Bureau's <b>German</b> <b>section</b> {{who had worked with}} Enigma, and most of the workers at the AVA Radio Company that had built Enigma doubles and cryptologic equipment for the <b>German</b> <b>section,</b> remained in Poland. Some were interrogated by the Gestapo, but no one gave away the secret of Polish mastery of Enigma decryption.|$|E
25|$|The Saltash to St <b>Germans</b> <b>section</b> was {{by-passed}} by a deviation somewhat inland, {{and this}} deviation was opened for goods trains on 23 March 1908 and for passenger trains on 19 May; the former route section was then closed and abandoned. This left only the Royal Albert Bridge {{as the only}} single line section on the main line to Truro (Penwithers Junction). The Falmouth branch was never doubled.|$|R

500|$|On 15 July 1928 {{the first}} German machine-enciphered {{messages}} were broadcast by German military radio stations. [...] Polish monitoring stations began intercepting them, and cryptologists in the Polish Cipher Bureau's <b>German</b> <b>section</b> {{were instructed to}} try to read them. [...] The effort was fruitless, however, and was eventually abandoned. [...] There remained very slight evidence of the effort, {{in the form of}} a few densely written-over sheets of paper and the commercial-model Enigma machine. On 15 January 1929 Major Gwido Langer, after a tour of duty as chief of staff of the 1st Legion Infantry Division, became chief of the Radio-Intelligence Office, and subsequently of the Cipher Bureau. The Bureau's deputy chief, and the chief of its <b>German</b> <b>section</b> (BS-4), was Captain Maksymilian Ciężki.|$|E
500|$|Until 1937 the Cipher Bureau's <b>German</b> <b>section,</b> BS-4, {{had been}} {{housed in the}} Polish General Staff {{building}} — the stately 18th-century [...] "Saxon Palace" [...] — in Warsaw. That year BS-4 moved into specially constructed new facilities in the Kabaty Woods near Pyry, south of Warsaw.

In April 1941, he assumed command of the [...] 4th/5th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers, part of the 52nd (Lowland) Division.

His death in the line of duty, while seeking to help a fellow reporter, {{had a significant impact on}} the German media and German public opinion. Scotland's death reinforced the image of the conflict as a real war where no rules were obeyed. Spurred on by his death, Munich-based journalists established the [...] "Journalists help Journalists" [...] (...) association in 1993 to help reporters the way Scotland had intended when he was killed. Scotland's death also provided the impetus to establish <b>German</b> <b>section</b> of Reporters Without Borders in 1994.|$|E
500|$|In 1937 Rejewski, {{along with}} the <b>German</b> <b>section</b> of the Cipher Bureau, {{transferred}} to a secret facility near Pyry in the Kabaty Woods south of Warsaw. On 15 September 1938, the Germans introduced new rules for enciphering message keys (a new [...] "indicator procedure"), making the Poles' earlier techniques obsolete. The Polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques. One was Rejewski's , an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas, which solved the daily keys within about two hours. Six bombas were built and were ready for use by mid-November 1938. The bomba exploited {{the fact that the}} plugboard connections did not affect all the letters; therefore, when another change to German operating procedure occurred on 1 January 1939, increasing the number of plugboard connections, the usefulness of the bombas was greatly reduced. The British bombe, the main tool that would be used to break Enigma messages during World War II, would be named after, and likely inspired by, the Polish bomba, though the cryptologic methods embodied in the two machines were different.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to criticism for journals, Chorley wrote voluminously on literature and art.

His masterpiece was Thirty Years' Musical Recollections (1862), which covers, year-by-year, the opera seasons of European operas in London between 1830 and 1859. [...] In the work, he blames the autocratic manager of Her Majesty's Theatre, Benjamin Lumley, for a decline in the quality of performances there. [...] On the other hand, he praises the efforts of Giulia Grisi, Mario and Michael Costa, together with a group of journalists (including himself), for successfully creating the Royal Italian Opera at Covent Garden in 1847.
