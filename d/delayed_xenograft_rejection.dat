Yet 1993 he acted as a junior operator of the former Baxter Novacor Company for the wearable artificial heart system Novacor and researched at last as a proctor of JarvikHeart in cooperation with Robert Jarvik developing a new miniaturized “valve axial pump”. Supported by the Bavarian Research Foundation (Bayerische Forschungsstiftung, grant 219/96) together with his research team as a consultant of cardiac surgery he investigated the xenogeneic transplantation of multi-transgenic pig hearts as a possible future organ replacement therapy in man since 1997. Since 2004 he worked within the scope of a Transregio Research Group FOR 535 of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) and since 2012 as a principal investigator (PI) for the sector of xenogeneic heart transplantation of the Transregio Research Collaborative Research Centre 127 (Transregio-Sonderforschungbereich SFB 127) with the speaker Bruno Reichart in the Walter-Brendel-Center of experimental medicine (WBex). Cardiac xenotransplantation (from pig to man), which was studied by Brenner and Reichart since 1997, has reached a preclinical status despite of a higher immunological complexity than allotransplantation due to preexisting and new-built antibodies against whole organs. Using a patented combination (EP 1181034 B1, EP 1980263A1, US 8,435,520 B2) consisting of transgenic organs/cells and immunoadsorption (elimination of antibodies from the recipient) and a special combination of immunosuppressive drugs hyperacute and <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> should be prevented and long-term survival of a xenograft should be enabled and realized. In times of massively increasing shortage of donor organs and yet major problems with artificial hearts (cable connections, batteries, strokes and infections) this makes xenotransplantation highly interesting in the area of organ/cell transplantation. By using an almost unlimited source of porcine organs (heart, kidney, lung, cornea, (liver rather improbably) and cells (pig islet cells) against diabetes, nigrostriatal brain cells against Morbus Parkinson, stem cells, bone/-marrow, skin etc.) not only in Europe, but also worldwide many people could be helped with animal cells or with the replacement of a whole organ. In view of 45 original papers, over 110 national and international oral presentations, two highly prized international research awards and as an advising tutor of 20 postdocs and postgraduates (for example [...] ) Brenner did pioneer work and substantially contributed to the scientific progress of the LMU, especially due to his know-how in the area of xenotransplantation and mechanical circulatory support systems. Brenner can be classified as an international expert for mechanical and “biological” heart replacement, wherefore he also owns patents (for example [...] ). In his teaching activity since 2004 Brenner was involved in the introduction of the practical MECUM student educational program of the LMU oriented to the Harvard-University concept. Since 2007 he was the responsible organizing associate lecturer for the compartment of cardiac surgery of the LMU and since 2011 deputy speaker of the cardiovascular educational block of the new medical student education system Modul 23 of the LMU. As the leader of the cardiac surgical advanced training program he organized about 400 specialist and scientific qualification performances mostly as from the Bayerische Landesärztekammer certificated Monday education for consultant training and professional development since 2003. [...] Novel research focuses and interests of Brenner are miniaturized artificial hearts in heart valves (in cooperation with Robert Jarvik), inhibition of aging enzymes, cryonic, energy and environment technology (e.g. e-mobility), essential oils as well as ebola.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Our {{objectives}} were to study <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> {{and the effectiveness}} of pretransplantation total lymphoid irradiation combined with immunosuppression on rejection in a pig-to-baboon cardiac xenograft model. Methods: Baboons were treated with pretransplantation total lymphoid irradiation, cyclosporine A (INN: ciclosporin), and methotrexate. Orthotopic pig-to-baboon cardiac transplantations were performed after depletion of circulating xenoreactive natural antibody by pretransplantation donor organ hemoperfusion. Tissue samples were collected for immunologic and immunopathologic evaluation. Results: Pig cardiac xenografts survived more than 18 and 19 days without evidence of hyperacute rejection. Immunologic analysis of serum samples demonstrated that circulating xenoreactive natural antibody levels did not return to pretransplantation levels. The production of xenoreactive natural antibodies from the recipient's splenocytes was inhibited completely. Histologic examination of xenografts showed the feature of acute vascular rejection. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated infiltration of cardiac xenografts by large numbers of macrophages, small numbers of natural killer cells, and a few T cells. The infiltrating macrophages also showed expression of interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor. Diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G, C 1 Q, C 3, and fibrin on xenograft vasculature was observed. Interleukin- 2 expression was not found in rejected cardiac xenografts. Xenograft endothelial cells also showed evidence of activation (expression of cytokines interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor). Conclusions: This study demonstrates prolonged discordant cardiac xenograft survival and <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> in a pig-to-baboon model. The <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> is mediated by both humoral and cellular mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Whereas the {{involvement}} of elicited xenoantibodies in <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> is currently being substantiated, this study focuses {{on the role of}} the preformed fraction of xenoantibodies. Methods: To check the influence of the latter, we combined pretransplant complement inactivation (cobra venom factor) and antibody reduction (plasmapheresis) in a guinea pig–to–rat heart transplant model. Results: Antibody reduction on plasmapheresis before xenografting did not prolong delayed xenorejection in decomplemented rats, although the immunohistologic pattern lacked the immunoglobulin deposits along endothelial walls found in xenografts of merely decomplemented recipients. Astonishingly, plasmapheresis, if carried out 2 days before transplantation, almost tripled xenograft survival, although preformed antibody levels were completely restored and even rebounding at the time of grafting. The pattern and number of infiltrating cells did not differ in dependence of the timing of plasmapheresis nor did the proliferative response of lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte reaction differ. However, plasmapheresis led to a retarded decrease of the mononuclear cell tumor necrosis factor α secretory potential, which correlated well with a diminished immunohistologic staining of tumor necrosis factor α secreted by graft-infiltrating mononuclear cells. Conclusion: These findings argue against a pivotal role of preformed xenoantibodies in the pathomechanistic process of <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> and challenge the therapeutic strategy to reduce preformed xenoantibody levels before xenotransplantation in complement-inactivated recipients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When hyperacute rejection, {{involving}} natural xenoreactive antibodies (XAb) and/or complement (C), can be prevented, xenografts (Xgs) undergo <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> {{associated with}} a progressive mononuclear cell infiltration. We have previously shown that XAb formation can be totally suppressed in leflunomide (LF) -treated, T-deficient nude rats receiving hamster hearts. Hence, this model was well-suited to study a role played by other factors, e. g., natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages (Mphi). The relative contribution of Mphi to <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> was investigated. METHODS: In addition to LF (20 mg/kg/ 24 hr p. o.), anti-asialoGM- 1 serum (1 mg/ 48 hr i. v.) and N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 mg/kg/ 24 hr i. v.) were given. Graft-infiltrating cells, deposition of cytokines (interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), IgM and C, and expression of endothelial cell (EC) P- and E-selectins were investigated by immunohistochemistry. In some cases, rat rTNF-alpha or anti-TNF-alpha antibodies were injected intravenously. RESULTS: Xgs rejected after 3 days by LF-treated rats showed an absence of IgM, C, and T cells, but the infiltration of NK cells and Mphi, together {{with the presence of}} IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Addition of NK cell depletion resulted in a significantly prolonged survival of Xgs (6 days; P< 0. 001) in which NK cells and IFN-gamma had disappeared, but Mphi were still prominent. Additional blockade of Mphi nitric oxide (NO) with L-NAME further prolonged Xg survival (11 days; P< 0. 001). In these rejected Xgs, Mphi, TNF-alpha, and EC expression of P- and E-selectins was still found, together with platelet thrombi, neutrophil-EC adhesion, and vessel intima lesions. The role of TNF-alpha in initiating this Xg rejection was further demonstrated by the acceleration of Xg rejection after injection of rTNF-alpha and by a synergism between L-NAME and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies in hampering the acceleration of Xg rejection seen after transfer of sensitized Mphi. CONCLUSION: In the absence of XAb, T cells, and NK cells, Mphi can still reject Xgs. Both NO-dependent and NO-independent mechanisms are involved. In the latter case, Mphi-derived, TNF-alpha-associated EC activation may play a role. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The use {{of animals}} as donors of {{tissues and organs}} for xenotransplantations may help in meeting the {{increasing}} demand for organs for human transplantations. Clinical studies indicate that the domestic pig best satisfies the criteria of organ suitability for xenotransplantation. However, the considerable phylogenetic distance between humans and the pig causes tremendous immunological problems after transplantation, thus genetic modifications need to be introduced to the porcine genome, {{with the aim of}} reducing xenotransplant immunogenicity. Advances in genetic engineering have facilitated the incorporation of human genes regulating the complement into the porcine genome, knockout of the gene encoding the formation of the Gal antigen (a 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase) or modifica-tion of surface proteins in donor cells. The next step is two-fold. Firstly, to inhibit processes of cell-mediated xenograft rejection, involving natural killer cells and macrophages. Secondly, to inhibit rejection caused by the incompatibility of proteins participating in the regulation of the coagulation system, which leads to a disruption of the equilibrium in pro- and anti-coagulant activity. Only a simultaneous incorporation of several gene constructs will make it pos-sible to produce multitransgenic animals whose organs, when transplanted to human recipients, would be resistant to hyperacute and <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection...</b>|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{generation}} of pigs lacking Galalpha 1, 3 Gal (alphaGal) or overexpressing human regulators of complement has largely overcome the barrier of hyperacute xenograft rejection. Nevertheless, <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> remains a major hurdle, including humoral responses against nonalphaGal epitopes, and cellular innate immune responses. This review addresses the early {{interactions between the}} porcine endothelium and human natural killer cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages. RECENT FINDINGS: Whether human leukocyte recruitment to, and lysis of, porcine endothelial cells includes direct recognition of alphaGal remains a matter of debate. Although the human natural killer receptor natural killerRP 1 A may directly recognize alphaGal, several studies did not reveal significant differences regarding adhesion, transmigration, and cytotoxicity using porcine endothelial cells expressing or lacking alphaGal. The strong human monocyte response against pig cells partly relies on the inability of porcine ligands to ligate inhibitory human receptors, such as SIRPalpha. Strategies to overcome cellular innate immune responses include transgenic expression in porcine cells of human ligands for inhibitory receptors, together with species-specific blocking of porcine ligands mediating human leukocyte interactions. SUMMARY: Cellular human innate immune responses are increasingly recognized as barriers to successful pig-to-human xenotransplantation, and only a detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved {{will allow us to}} overcome this barrier...|$|E
40|$|Acute or even hyperacute humoral graft rejection, {{mediated}} by classical pathway complement activation, occurs in allo- and xenotransplantation due to preformed anti-graft antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations can prevent complement-mediated tissue injury and <b>delay</b> hyperacute <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection.</b> It {{is known that}} IgM-enriched IVIg (IVIgM) has a higher capacity to block complement than IVIgG. Different IVIgs were therefore tested for specificity of complement inhibition and effect on anti-bacterial activity of human serum. IVIgM-I (Pentaglobin), 12 % IgM), IVIgM-II (IgM-fraction of IVIgM-I, 60 % IgM), and three different IVIgG (all > 95 % IgG) were used. The known complement inhibitor dextran sulfate was used as control. Hemolytic assays were performed to analyze pathway-specificity of complement inhibition. Effects of IVIg on complement deposition on pig cells and Escherichia coli were assessed by flow cytometry and cytotoxicity as well as bactericidal assays. Complement inhibition by IVIgM was specific for the classical pathway, with IC 50 values of 0. 8 mg/ml for IVIgM-II and 1. 7 mg/ml for IVIgM-I in the CH 50 assay. Only minimal inhibition of the lectin pathway was seen with IVIgM-II (IC 50 15. 5 mg/ml); no alternative pathway inhibition was observed. IVIgG did not inhibit complement in any hemolytic assay. Classical pathway complement inhibition by IVIgM was confirmed in an in vitro xenotransplantation model with PK 15 cells. In contrast, IVIgM did not inhibit (mainly alternative pathway mediated) killing of E. coli by human serum. In conclusion, IgM-enriched IVIg is a specific inhibitor of the classical complement pathway, leaving the alternative pathway intact, which is an important natural anti-bacterial defense, especially for immunosuppressed patients...|$|R

40|$|Hyperacute rejection, {{mediated}} by natural anti-Galalpha 1, 3 Galbeta 1, 4 GlcNAc (alphaGal) antibodies and the classically activated complement pathway, {{was identified as}} the first major barrier {{to the survival of}} porcine organs in humans. Subsequently, discordant pig-to-nonhuman primate and concordant rodent models revealed key roles for T and B lymphocytes in the second form of rejection, acute vascular rejection (AVR) or <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> (DXR). As significant progress was made in strategies to circumvent or suppress xenoreactivity of the adaptive immune system, it became clear that, apart from natural antibodies, other innate immune system elements actively participate in AVR/DXR and represent a barrier to xenograft acceptance that may be particularly difficult to overcome. Observations in pig-to-primate and semi-discordant and concordant rodent models indicate that Natural Killer (NK) cells play a more prominent role in xenograft than in allograft rejection. Several mechanisms through which human NK cells recognize porcine endothelial cells have been elucidated and these appear to be more diverse than those involved in NK cell alloreactivity. Further, it has been demonstrated that human macrophages and neutrophils can directly recognize pig derived cells and can mediate direct xenograft damage. Here, we review the recent progress in the understanding of the xenoreactivity of the natural immune system, focussing on preclinical pig-to-(non) human primate systems, and discuss the proposed strategies to overcome these barriers. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background, Hamster hearts transplanted into {{untreated}} rats undergo <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> (DXR). This acute {{inflammatory response}} {{is associated with}} the deposition of anti-graft antibodies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) M isotype in the vasculature. We have previously shown that these antibodies are generated in a T cell-independent manner. In this study, we tested whether the generation of anti-graft IgM antibodies is involved in the pathogenesis of DXR. in addition, we tested whether the suppression of this antibody response mould overcome DXR. Methods. Hamster hearts were transplanted into rats treated with an anti-mu monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to deplete circulating IgM or with an isotype-matched control mAb recognizing the dinitrophenyl epitope. T cell immunosuppression was achieved with cyclosporin A (CsA). Results. Depletion of circulating IgM by anti-mu mAb inhibited DXR, whereas the control mAb had no effect on DXR. In anti-mu-treated rats, xenografts were rejected 5 - 7 days after transplantation through a T cell-dependent mechanism associated with the generation of antibodies of the IgG isotype. Combination of anti-mu with CsA suppressed the anti-graft IgM and IgG response and resulted in long-term xenograft survival (> 50 days). Xenograft long term survival occurred despite the return of anti-graft IgM antibodies to the circulation, a phenomenon referred to as accommodation. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that the pathogenesis of DXR can be initiated by anti-graft antibodies of the IgM isotype, which are generated in a T-cell independent manner. In addition, we show that under T cell immunosuppression, specific depletion of this IgM response by anti-mu mAb administration results in xenograft long-term survival and accommodation...|$|E

Transfected cells were > 95 % positive for human E 5 'N/There was a massive increase in E 5 'N activity in transfected pig EC lysates and intact cells using extracellu~ar AMP as the substrate. Adenosine production from the breakdown of ATP was also significantly higher in transfected cells, proving E 5 'N to be the rate-limiting enzyme in adenosine production by pig EC. Incubation of transfected cells with AMP showed a time-dependent induction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl- 2 mediated via AI receptors, and subsequent protection of these cells from hydrogen peroxide-mediated apoptosis through AI receptors. Human natural killer (NK) cells were significantly less cytotoxic towards transfected than non-transfected pig EC. This effect was abrogated by an inhibitor of E 5 'N and mimicked by prior incubation of NK cells with adenosine. Supernatants from transfected cells also significantly inhibited platelet aggregation and expression of E 5 'N attenuated platelet adhesion to EC compared to nontransfected cells. However, transfection with E 5 'N did not protect cells from antibody and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Functional expression of human E 5 'N in pig EC provided significant protection from apoptosis, NK cell-mediated lysis and platelet adhesion and aggregation, the main mechanisms of xenograft r~jection once hyperacute rejection has been overcome.

The aims of the present experimental studies were to provide {{a better understanding of the}} rejection mechanisms and give new clues for prevention of xenorejection, thereby hopefully contributing to the development of clinical xenotransplantation. Guinea pig hearts transplanted into rats undergo hyperacute rejection (HAR) within a few minute& C 6 rats can not form the membrane attack complex. Guinea pig hearts transplanted into such rats are not hyperacutely rejected, but instead undergo <b>delayed</b> <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> (DXR) within 1 - 2 days. This model thus gives us the opportunity to study the later phases of discordant vascularized xenograft rejection. In Paper 1, we studied the effects of deoxyspergualin (DSG), cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK 506) on the survival of guinea pig hearts in C 6 - rats. Our results showed that DSG moderately prolonged xenograft survival, while CsA and FK 506 had no effect. DSG also significantly reduced serum xenoreactive IgM levels. At rejection, xenografts were markedly infiltrated by macrophages, regardless of the therapy used. We concluded that the beneficial effect of DSG was probably related to suppression of induced xenoreactive antibodies (XAb) and that strategies targeting macrophages and XAb may help to overcome DXR. In Paper 11, Lip-C 12 MDP (liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate) was used to deplete recipient macrophages. We found that LiP-C 12 MDP in combination with DSG led to significant prolongation of guinea pig heart survival in C 6 - rats compared to DSG or Lip-C 12 MDP alone. The importance of macrophages was also shown in Paper III, where depletion of macrophages dramatically prolonged porcine islet xenograft survival in streptozotocin-diabetic mice, 26 ± 3. 8 days in the macrophage-depleted group versus 8 ± 1. 2 days in untreated controls. Taken together, our observations suggest that strategies targeting macrophages prolong xenograft survival. In Paper IV, we showed that the removal of preformed antibodies by plasma exchange and suppression of induced antibodies by DSG increased survival of guinea pig hearts to 6. 9 ± 1. 1 days versus 2. 8 ± 0. 5 days in untreated C 6 - rats. As graft survival was longer, the number of T-cells in the graft increased significantly. This finding suggests that when DXR is prevented by reduction of XAb and macrophage depletion, the cellular infiltrate resembles that seen in allografts. In Paper V, we found that CsA resulted in long-term graft survival in the mouse-to-C 6 rat heart transplant model, indicating that if complement-mediated injury is prevented, suppression of T-cells is sufficient for long-term graft survival in this concordant model. In summary, our results show that methods targeting macrophages and XAb prolong discordant vascularized xenograft survival. Control of macrophages is important also in discordant islet xenograffing. The complexity of xenorejection makes it unlikely that any single therapy will be effective. Instead, recipient immunosuppression combined with strategies reducing graft inummogeneicity and improving graft resistance to the rejection response seem to be needed...|$|E

In this study, we investigate the rejection of mouse peripheral nerve xenografts in rats. Severe intragraft mononuclear cell infiltration, graft distension, and necrosis were detected in the recipients as early as 2 weeks after mouse nerve xenotransplantation. The number of axons in xenografts reduced progressively and became almost undetectable at week 8. However, mouse nerve xenotransplantation only led to a transient and moderate increase {{in the production of}} Th 1 cytokines, including IL- 2, IFN-&#x 03 B 3;, and TNF-&#x 03 B 1;.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{success of}} {{clinical}} transplantation {{has led to}} a large discrepancy between donor organ availability and demand; considerable pressure exists to develop an alternative source of organs. The use of animal organs for donation is a possible solution that is not yet clinically applicable. METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature review was performed based on a Medline search to find articles on xenotransplantation. Keywords included hyperacute, acute vascular, <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> combined with concordant and discordant. Additional references cited in these articles from journals not included in Medline were obtained from the British Library. Limited information on unpublished, preliminary work has been included from sources known to the authors, based on their research work in the field. One hundred and forty-six references and four personal communications have been included in this review article. CONCLUSION: A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> is developing rapidly. Strategies to abrogate hyperacute rejection have proved successful, but control of antibody-driven acute vascular rejection has not yet been achieved. The safety and viability of xenotransplantation as a therapeutic modality are still unproven...|$|R
40|$|Although hyperacute {{rejection}} of discordant xenogeneic grafts can be prevented, baboon or human anti-pig cellular response {{may lead to}} acute <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection.</b> Among the immune cellular actors participating in such a <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> are both T and natural killer (NK) cells. In the pre-clinical model of pig-to-baboon discordant xenograft, there is however, a lack of specific immunological therapeutic agent, in particular antibaboon T-cell monoclonal antibodies do not exist. We therefore developed a rat anti-CD 2 monoclonal antibody (LO-CD 2 b) that recognizes both baboon and human CD 2 + cells. In this study, we show that in vitro LO-CD 2 b inhibits a pig-to-baboon mixed lymphocyte reaction, the direct cytotoxicity of baboon peripheral blood lymphocytes to pig aortic endothelial cells, {{as well as the}} baboon NK activity against K 562 cell line. In vivo, LO-CD 2 b produces a strong depletion of all peripheral CD 2 + cells including NK CD 2 + cells. In summary, LO-CD 2 b represents an important immunological tool {{that can be used in}} the preclinical model of discordant pig-to-baboon vascularized xenograft...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} extend the range of {{investigations}} on sponge incompatibility reactions, xenografts were performed underwater between three marine species: the ramose sponge Axinella polypoides and the two encrusting sponges Crambe crambe and Hemimycale columella. The rejection processes were followed using light, transmission electron, and scanning electron microscopy. In both combinations observed—Axinella/Crambe and Axinella/Hemimycale—the xenografts show disorganization of the superficial tissues during {{the first days of}} contact and development afterward of a necrotic reaction. The rejection process is characterized by 1) rapidity, strength, and reciprocity of reaction; 2) tissue necrosis of great depth; and 3) restriction of the response to the zone of the contact. Control of reaction specificity was achieved by contact of sponges with some inert materials (PVC foam, glass, cork, and granite). This resulted in various nonnecrotic reactions. The diversity of these reactions, together with the <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> processes, demonstrates new aspects of discriminative sponge capabilities. Alternative explanations of acute <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection,</b> involving either killer cells or cytotoxic substances from endogenous or exogenous origin, are discussed.

40|$|Xenotransplantation holds {{promise to}} solve the ever {{increasing}} shortage of donor organs for allotransplantation. In the last 2 decades, major {{progress has been made}} in understanding the immunobiology of pig-into-(non) human primate transplantation and today we are on the threshold of the first clinical trials. Hyperacute rejection, which is mediated by pre-existing anti-alphaGal xenoreactive antibodies, can in non-human primates be overcome by complement- and/or antibody-modifying interventions. A major step forward was the development of genetically engineered pigs, either transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins or deficient in the alpha 1, 3 -galactosyltranferase enzyme. However, several other immunologic and nonimmunologic hurdles remain. Acute vascular <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> is mediated by humoral and cellular mechanisms. Elicited xenoreactive antibodies play a key role. In addition to providing B cell help, xenoreactive T cells may directly contribute to <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection.</b> Long-term survival of porcine kidney- and heart xenografts in non-human primates has been obtained but required severe T and B cell immunosuppression. Induction of xenotolerance, e. g. through mixed hematopoietic chimerism, may represent the preferred approach, but although proof of principle has been delivered in rodents, induction of pig-to-non-human primate chimerism remains problematic. Finally, it is now clear that innate immune cells, in particular macrophages and natural killer cells, can mediate xenograft destruction, the determinants of which are being elucidated. Chronic <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> is not well understood, but recent studies indicate that non-immunological problems, such as incompatibilities between human procoagulant and pig anticoagulant components may play an important role. Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the currently known obstacles to xenografting: immune and non-immune problems are discussed, as well as the possible strategies that are under development to overcome these hurdles.

40|$|An in vivo {{model system}} to {{understand}} the mechanism of <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection</b> was established using human peripheral blood leukocyte-reconstituted SCID (hu-PBL-SCID) mice. Human xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNA), of IgM and IgG subtypes, capable of binding to pig aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were detected in the sera of hu-PBL-SCID by ELISA and flowcytometric methods. Western blot analysis of PAEC lysates showed that IgM and IgG XNA from hu-PBL-SCID recognized xenoantigens with similar molecular mass as those recognized by XNA from normal human serum (NHS). This result demonstrated that hu-PBL-SCID contained XNA representing the same repertoire {{as that of the}} NHS. XNA from NHS and hu-PBL-SCID were also able to induce intracellular Ca 2 + signals in cultured PAEC several fold above the basal level. This result revealed their functional similarity and demonstrated {{for the first time that}} XNA in the absence of C can activate PAEC, which may lead to the pathology of <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection.</b> In vivo, PAEC transplanted under the kidney capsule of hu-PBL-SCID mice showed deposition of human IgM and mouse C.

The hormone release from the mixed syngeneic-allogeneic grafts was similar to that from pure syngeneic islet grafts.

When perfusing the mixed islet graft after completed rejection of the concordant xenogeneic rat islets (6 wk after implantation), the insulin release from the remaining syngeneic mouse islets was identical to that of control grafts.

Transfer of human membrane-associated complement regulators to donor organs has been suggested as one strategy to interfere with complement-mediated hyperacute <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection.</b> Pigs are discussed as potential organ donors. We therefore investigated a putative protective function of the membrane-bound complement inhibitor CD 59 in a pig-to-human in vitro model of hyperacute <b>xenograft</b> <b>rejection.</b> Aortic porcine endothelial cells were transfected with human CD 59 cDNA. Expression of human CD 59 was demonstrated by cytofluorimetric and RNA analysis. Removal of CD 59 from the cell surface by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) demonstrated its production as a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored protein. Functional activity of the transfected CD 59 was tested by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay for complement-mediated lysis. Porcine endothelial cells expressing human CD 59 were significantly protected from lysis by human serum complement compared with CD 59 - cells. The protective effect was abolished by preincubating the cells with anti-CD 59 antibodies or PI-PLC.
