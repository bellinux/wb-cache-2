5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some <b>dealers</b> to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car <b>dealers</b> the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile <b>Dealers</b> Association (NADS), <b>dealers</b> on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose <b>dealers</b> tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of <b>dealers</b> are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E
5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist <b>dealers.</b> Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and <b>dealers</b> like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and <b>dealers</b> who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions record 268 {{different}} occupations in {{the city}} of Rome, and 85 in Pompeii. Professional associations or trade guilds (collegia) are attested {{for a wide range of}} occupations, including fishermen (piscatores), salt merchants (salinatores), olive oil <b>dealers</b> (olivarii), entertainers (scaenici), cattle <b>dealers</b> (pecuarii), goldsmiths (aurifices), teamsters (asinarii or muliones), and stonecutters (lapidarii). These are sometimes quite specialized: one collegium at Rome was strictly limited to craftsmen who worked in ivory and citrus wood.|$|E
50|$|To play, the <b>dealer</b> {{gives one}} card to the {{receiver}} and one to the <b>dealer.</b> The receiver may choose to exchange cards with the <b>dealer,</b> unless the <b>dealer</b> has a king, in which case no exchange occurs. Then, the <b>dealer</b> may choose to exchange with the top card of the deck, unless the top card is a king, in which case no exchange occurs. In {{the case of the}} <b>dealer</b> and receiver having same ranked cards, the <b>dealer</b> is the winner.|$|R

If the <b>dealer</b> cut exactly, the <b>dealer</b> gets 100 points for his/her team; if the <b>dealer</b> is + or - one card, the <b>dealer</b> gets 50 points for his/her team.|$|R
5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of <b>dealers</b> have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some <b>dealers</b> assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support <b>dealers</b> selling PEVs.|$|E

5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car <b>dealers</b> are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car <b>dealers</b> selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from <b>dealers</b> than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, for the <b>dealer,</b> {{the cost}} of laying-off, a loss to the <b>dealer,</b> is the <b>dealer’s</b> primary {{variable}} cost and {{is built into the}} <b>dealer’s</b> spread. The range of the <b>dealer’s</b> price, therefore, according to Treynor’s conclusions, can be anywhere between 30-40% of the security’s value all without any valuation changes from the VBT to compensate for {{the cost of}} laying-off.|$|R

Meanwhile, several drug <b>dealers</b> receive anonymous phone calls about {{the whereabouts of}} their competitors; they are told that {{they are at the}} same diner. Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug <b>dealers</b> arrive in pairs as the man attempts {{to gain access to the}} files.

5|$|In 2009, the North American market {{accounted}} for over 10% of the company's net sales. Nokian Tyres has a tyre subsidiary based in LaVergne, Tennessee (USA). In that market, Nokian Tyres sell only to independent <b>dealers,</b> {{some of whom}} use the tyre products to fill in gaps in their product lines instead of an exclusive or majority share. This results in some <b>dealers</b> being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E
50|$|The initial <b>dealer</b> {{is chosen}} by any common method, {{although}} {{it should be}} remembered that in Canasta there is no privilege or advantage to being the <b>dealer.</b> The deal then rotates clockwise after every hand. The <b>dealer</b> shuffles the pack, the player to the <b>dealer's</b> right cuts, and the <b>dealer</b> deals out 2 hands of 11 cards to each player.|$|R
5000|$|... 4. The {{player to}} whom the <b>dealer</b> handed the cards then deals the first hand of cards for the round. If the <b>dealer</b> cut exactly, the <b>dealer</b> gets 100 points; if the <b>dealer</b> is + or - one card, the <b>dealer</b> gets 50 points. If the <b>dealer</b> found any Jokers or Wild 2’s {{at the bottom of}} the deck, these are counted as part of his/her first hand of a total of 11 cards. (Example: If three players and the <b>dealer</b> found two Jokers/Wild 2’s in the bottom three cards, the deal of the first hand of 11 cards {{consists}} of 11 cards each for the two non-dealers and 9 cards for the <b>dealer.</b> If the cut from the bottom of the original deck was exactly 11+11+9+1, or 32 cards, then the <b>dealer</b> gets 100 base points; if either 31 or 33 cards, the <b>dealer</b> was off one card and gets 50 base points.).|$|R
50|$|Pok Deng {{supports}} two to seventeen players, {{including the}} <b>dealer,</b> but {{is recommended for}} three to nine players. To begin, players designate a <b>dealer.</b> One person may remain the <b>dealer</b> for several rounds or players can agree to switch off being <b>dealer.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Dealer</b> Trade-in Price or {{wholesale}} price {{is the price}} you should expect to receive from a <b>dealer</b> if you trade in a car. This is also the price that a <b>dealer</b> will typically pay for a car at a <b>dealer</b> wholesale auction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dealer</b> {{takes his}} or her turn last. If the <b>dealer</b> has pok, those cards are turned face-up and all players' hands are {{compared}} to the <b>dealer's.</b> If the <b>dealer</b> does not have pok, before deciding to draw a card, the <b>dealer</b> may reveal select players' hands and compare them to {{his or her}} own and make the payouts. Then the <b>dealer</b> may draw a card and then compare the rest of the players' hands {{to his or her}} own.|$|R
5000|$|All call {{bets are}} {{considered}} courtesy bets and are only placed if the <b>dealer</b> {{has time to}} change and place the bets. The bet is considered taken only if the <b>dealer</b> and the inspector <b>dealer</b> has repeated the bet. If the <b>dealer</b> does not take the bet, they will announce [...] "no bet". To argue with the <b>dealer</b> about which bets have been taken is considered extremely impolite and will most likely render a warning from the inspector <b>dealer</b> or pit boss.|$|R

5|$|After {{spending}} $40million {{marketing the}} Classic to first-time buyers, Apple had difficulty meeting the high demand. Apple doubled its manufacturing space in 1990 by expanding its Singapore and Cork, Ireland factories, where the Classic was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, {{was used to}} speed delivery. The shortage caused concern among <b>dealers,</b> who blamed Apple's poor business planning.|$|E
5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art <b>dealers</b> organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through <b>dealers,</b> or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E
2500|$|Once all {{the players}} have {{completed}} their hands, it is the <b>dealer’s</b> turn. The <b>dealer</b> hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received Blackjacks. The <b>dealer</b> must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At most tables the <b>dealer</b> also hits on a [...] "soft" [...] 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the <b>dealer,</b> or getting a blackjack without the <b>dealer</b> getting a blackjack. If the player and <b>dealer</b> have the same total (not counting blackjacks), {{this is called a}} [...] "push", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the <b>dealer</b> wins.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>dealer</b> {{is chosen}} at random and the turn to deal passes {{to the right}} after each hand. The <b>dealer</b> shuffles the cards and the player at the <b>dealer's</b> left cuts. The <b>dealer</b> then gives 7 (seven) cards to each player, one at a time, {{beginning}} with the player to <b>dealer's</b> right, circling around counter clockwise (until each player has received seven cards) and ending with the <b>dealer.</b> The next card dealt from deck is turned face up, and its suit becomes trumps.|$|R
50|$|The players {{play with}} the <b>dealer</b> and not among each other. So if your Ox cannot beat the <b>dealer's</b> Ox, the <b>dealer</b> will deduct the number of pts the <b>dealer's</b> Ox worths from you and add to his/her total. Vice-Versa. If both own Five Dukes, it's a tie.|$|R
5|$|At one time, Bond Street {{was best}} known for top-end art <b>dealers</b> and antique shops that were {{clustered}} around the London office of Sotheby's auction house, which has been at Nos.34–35 Bond Street since 1917, and the Fine Art Society, founded in 1876. The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby's is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around 1600 BC. It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London.|$|E

5|$|Attendees {{under the}} age of {{majority}} are commonly allowed to attend with a notarized parental permission slip or accompanied by an adult. Eurofurence is one exception, only admitting those above 18. Underage attendees are usually given a distinctive badge to allow staff and <b>dealers</b> to restrict access to mature content. Government-issued photo ID is usually required.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} on the dice game, Chinchirorin, this game was crafted by Ōtsuki, one of Kaiji's fellow inmates in the underground labor camp.
