25|$|Another price {{explosion}} for tantalum in 2000/2001 {{forced the}} development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002. Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum and serves as valve metal generating an oxide layer during anodic oxidation. Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{the availability of the}} base metal in the late 1960s which led to development and implementation of niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.|$|E
25|$|Colon's {{self-confidence}} is remarkable. He had {{a strong}} regard for right and justice. Firmly, though respectfully, he reproved Rabbi Israel Bruna, the foremost German talmudist of his time, for overstepping the bounds of his authority. Responsum No. 4, addressed to the congregation of Regensburg, is highly important. A number of Jews of that community having been falsely accused, and a sum of money having to be raised for their ransom, the surrounding places and neighboring communities refused to contribute, at least insofar as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> paying a fixed tax instead of making voluntary contributions. Colon decided that the communities in question could not refuse to pay their share, since the same false accusation might be made against them also, and if the accused in this case were proved innocent and ransomed, they would then be safe from danger.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{subsequent}} campaign ended abruptly {{in southern}} Romania's invasion by the Central Powers (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to Iași, they appointed Tzigara-Samurcaș a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part. He stayed behind in Bucharest {{and met with}} August von Mackensen, head of the occupation forces. As {{a result of this}} encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of collaboration with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Petre P. Carp. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple Lupu Kostaki. Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: [...] "Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness." [...] Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed. Maiorescu himself explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> principle: [...] "Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to.
