30|$|There are {{a number}} of imaging {{appearance}} changes that present following TACE. On CT, portions of the tumour that retain and accumulate <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> are necrotic and appear as non-enhancing foci while enhancing foci indicate viable tissue that may require additional treatment [55]. Kim et al. evaluated the value of the unenhanced phase in assessing HCC after TACE and found that the use of the unenhanced phase could improve the detection of viable tumour tissue with viable HCC appearing hyperattenuating or isoattenuating on the hepatic arterial phase and hypoattenuating on the unenhanced phase [56]. However, accumulation of <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> may generate considerable beam-hardening artefacts on CT that are not present on MRI [57]. In cases where there is a significant amount of <b>iodised</b> <b>oil,</b> MR imaging plays a vital role because of the artefact that appears on CT, resulting in difficulty detecting tumours using this modality [57]. On MRI, necrotic tissue will not demonstrate contrast enhancement while residual tumours will appear as hyperintense lesions [58].|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{detection}} of hepatocellular cancers (HCC) {{is a major}} role of preoperative imaging in patients with end stage liver disease being considered for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).  Aims—To assess the sensitivity of <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> computed tomography (IOCT).  Patients and methods—A prospective evaluation in 50 consecutive patients undergoing OLT included ultrasound scan, contrast enhanced CT, angiography (with intra-arterial injection of <b>iodised</b> <b>oil),</b> and a second CT (IOCT) 10 days later. Following transplantation the explant liver was serially sectioned for pathological evaluation. Soft tissue radiographs of the liver slices were used to match histological lesions with CT findings.  Results—Eleven patients were excluded due to protocol violations. Of the remaining 39, histological evaluation revealed no cancers in 33 explant livers, in keeping with negative preoperative imaging. Six explant livers contained 55 HCCs, 84 % of which were less than 1 cm in diameter. Pretransplant IOCT detected 3 / 6 patients with cancer (50 %) but only 7 % of cancerous lesions. Ultrasound, contrast CT, and angiography each detected 2 / 6 patients with cancer and 4 % of cancerous lesions.  Conclusion—IOCT is an insensitive method for the {{detection of}} small HCCs in livers with advanced cirrhosis but in this study was slightly superior to ultrasound, CT, and angiography. ...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} to improve iodine deficiency control programs. Goitre rates and cassava processing practices were compared in three Central African Republic (CAR) populations. Short-cuts in cassava processing were associated with elevated urinary thiocyanate and increased goitre rates, suggesting a goitrogenic effect in one population. While improved cassava processing may be beneficial, the priority is to correct the iodine deficiency. The use of the urinary iodine/tiocyanate ratio as indicator of goitrogenic effects was explored using data from Tanzania and CAR. As the ratio can be calculated in four mathematically different ways and has physiological shortcomings, its use is discouraged. Biannual <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> capsule (IOC) distribution in a Tanzanian population of 7 million during nine years was studied.

40|$|The {{effect of}} anthropometric status on the {{efficacy}} of an oral supplement of <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> (1 ml Lipiodol Ultrafluide, 490 mg I; Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) was examined in 8 – 10 -year-old schoolchildren (n 197) of Ntcheu, a severely I-deficient district of Malawi. The study was a controlled trial using the I concentration of casual urine samples to monitor the I status. The median urinary I concentration increased from 0 ? 15 mol/l at baseline (51 ? 3 % of children < 0 ? 16 mol/l, 89 ? 7 % < 0 ? 40 mol/l, 95 ? 7 % 0 ? 79 mol/l) to 0 ? 32 mol/l at 40 weeks (29 ? 1 % of the children < 0 ? 16 mol/l, 71 ? 0 % < 0 ? 40 mol/l, 96 ? 1 % < 0 ? 79 mol/l) while the total goitre prevalence fell from 63 % to 21 %. Variables of efficacy were estimated from a hyperbolic function describing the longitudinal pattern of urinary I excretion after the dose. The I retention and I elimination rate, and the periods of protection from mild (< 0 ? 79 mol/l) or moderate (< 0 ? 40 mol/l) I deficiency were obtained for groups of children with differing anthropometric status at baseline. Initial height-for-age and mid upper-arm circumference were not significantly related to efficacy. However, both the I retention and I elimination rate were reduced in children with lower initial weight-for-height. Children with lower skinfold thickness at baseline also had reduced I retention, which resulted in shorter protection periods from recurrent moderate and mild I deficiency. The efficacy of the oral iodised-oil supplement {{was not related to}} changes in anthropometric status during follow-up, nor was it related to the consumption of a food supplement of 1610 kJ immediately before the iodised-oil dose. Very low (< 0 ? 16 mol/l) urinary I concentration, and the presence of goitre at baseline were both associated with higher I retention and elimination rate. Children with goitre at baseline were found to have a prolonged duration of protection against recurrent moderate I deficiency. We conclude that in apparently healthy schoolchildren in I-deficient areas, general anthropometric status has a little influence on {{the efficacy of}} oral <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> for correcting I deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Ewes were {{injected}} intramuscularly with 1 ml <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> at mating {{or during}} the first two months of pregnancy to determine if marginal iodine deficiency contributed to the high mortality of newborn lambs in Victoria. Iodine treatment markedly increased milk iodine concentration of ewes. In nine of ten trials conducted in 1979 and 1980 at Ararat, Hamilton, Langi Kal Kal, Ruffy, Rutherglen and Trawalla, iodine supplementation of ewes had no effect on lamb survival, growth of lambs to weaning, and ewe wool production. At Trawalla in 1979 goitrous lambs were born to control ewes, and there was a marked difference in lamb survival between control and treated groups in one of two trials. In one of three years at Hamilton milk iodine concentrations of control ewes less than 80 pg/l indicated a marginal iodine deficiency and their newborn lambs had lower serum thyroxine concentrations than lambs of treated ewes, but {{there were no significant differences}} in birthweights and survival of newborn lambs between the groups. The trials indicated that iodine deficiency was not a major factor limiting the survival of newborn lambs and that widespread iodine supplementation of ewes would not produce any major shifts in productivity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Iodised</b> <b>oil</b> (lipiodol) {{administered}} via the {{hepatic artery}} localises selectively in primary liver cell cancers (hepatocellular carcinomas or HCCs) for prolonged periods {{and has been}} used as a vehicle for cytotoxic agents. Despite clinical use, the mechanism of lipiodol retention by tumours has remained unclear, embolisation of oil droplets in the tumour vasculature being the prevailing hypothesis. We have investigated the role of tumour and endothelial cells in lipiodol retention. Human liver tumour (Hep G 2) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture were exposed to lipiodol. Light microscopy using selective silver impregnation stains and transmission electron microscopy revealed lipiodol incorporation by both cell types, probably by pinocytosis. This was not associated with cellular injury in terms of cell lysis, cell replication or radio-labelled leucine uptake. Histological analysis of 24 HCCs either surgically resected or discovered incidentally at liver transplantation (with prior arterial injection of lipiodol) revealed vesicles of lipiodol in the cytoplasm of tumour cells and endothelial cells lining tumour vessels. Thus, lipiodol is likely to deliver cytotoxic agents directly into tumour cells and endothelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo. This may also apply to other lipids and to other human tumours. These findings have significant therapeutic implications...|$|E
40|$|Total Goitre Rate (TGR) among School {{children}} at endemic goitre areas in 4 provinces of Java island (West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java provinces) was studied in 1980 and 1987. A total of 26, 516 school children in 1980 and 14837 school children in 1987 from 113 villages of 14 sub-districts in 4 provinces were included for analysis. The {{age of the}} school children was ranging from 6 to 14 years old. The villages were not representative for either sub-district or province. It was found that TGR in 1980 was above 29 % in all provinces. In 1987, only TGR in Yogyakarta province decreased to the level regarded no longer a public health problem (TGR < 5 %) while TGR is still high in the other three provinces (West Java, Central Java and East Java). The category of severe endemic goitre (TGR- 30 %) was reduced in 1987 compared with the number in 1980 in all provices. Considering gender, it was found from the 1987 data that GR amongst girls was higher than amongst boys.

40|$|Change in The Goitre Prevalence among School Children 1990 - 1998. Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) is major nutritional {{problem in}} many part of Indonesia. <b>Iodised</b> <b>oil</b> distribution and salt iodination {{are the two}} programs to control IDD. Surveys to evaluate the impact of IDD control programs have been conducted three times in 1982, 1990 and 1998. Indicator used in the survey was Total Goitre Rate (TGR) amongst school children at sub-district level. This paper analysed data of three surveys for the same sub-district only. Fifty-nine sub-districts surveyed in 1980 and then resurveyed in 1988 and 1998 were analysed to observe {{the changes in the}} TGR over the time. The results showed that the mean TGR in 1980, 1988 and 1998 were 33. 1 %, 30. 3 % and 17. 7 % respectively. Overall percentage of sub-district with TGR less than 5 % in the 3 surveys was 0 %, 13. 6 % and 32. 2 % respectively. For Java-Bali region that represent the better development in communication infrastructure, the mean TGR in the 3 surveys were 31. 6 %, 25. 7 % and 9. 9 % respectively. Percentage of sub-district with TGR less than 5 %, for Java-Bali region, was 0 %, 16. 7 % and 44. 0 %. For outside Java-Bali region, the mean TGR were 33. 7 %, 32. 3 % and 21. 1 % respectively. Percentage of sub-district with TGR less than 5 %, for outside Java-Bali region, was 0 %, 12. 2 % and 26. 8 %. In 1998, about two-third of salt consumed by household contained adequate iodine (30 ppm). The relationship between TGR and percentage of salt with 30 ppm of iodine was fairly high (r= 0. 66).

40|$|Although Baltistan, north east Pakistan, is in {{a region}} of iodine {{deficiency}} disorders, the distribution of goitre within the district, according to age and sex, has not been clearly defined. To establish the prevalence of the condition and to measure the reported difference in prevalence {{in the north and}} south of the district thyroid size was assessed in new patients attending the Aman clinic, Khapalu, and outlying areas between April and September from 1981 to 1986. Samples of potable water collected from villages were analysed for iodine (as iodide) concentrations in Britain. Population weighted prevalences were: in the north in males 20. 4 %, in females 28. 1 % and in the south in males 13. 9 %, in females 21. 2 %. There was an overall deficiency of iodine in the water (mean iodine (as iodide) concentrations (north) 11. 0 nmol/l (1. 4 micrograms/l), (south) 11. 8 nmol/l (1. 5 micrograms/l) (95 % confidence interval - 0. 7 to 0. 9). The differences followed the Main Karakoram Thrust, suggesting a geological goitrogen in the north, which might be minerals containing ions such as BF 4 - and SO 3 F-, and molybdenite and calcium, which are present in rocks in Baltistan. A new hypothesis for the genesis of endemic goitre is proposed [...] that is, that continents on crustal plates drift across the earth and collide, one plate sliding under the other and melting, giving rise to characteristic mineral assemblages in the overlying rocks. As the minerals weather out they enter the diet of the local population, where in the presence of iodine deficiency they produce or enhance iodine deficiency disorders. Despite the current <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> campaign by the Pakistani government with Unicef a long term working iodisation programme is still urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|The Ukinga and Uwanji regions, {{located in}} the {{southern}} highlands of Tanzania, were studied for the degree of iodine deficiency and the incidence of goitre and hypothyroidism, respectively. A urinary iodine excretion as low as 17. 6 +/- 9. 3 micrograms/g creatinine was observed in Wangama village. The mean goitre prevalence in 27 villages in Uwanji ranged between 65 and 96 % (n = 3031 schoolchildren). Of 681 pregnant women from Ukinga 79. 6 % had goitre. The prevalence of cretinism as estimated on clinical criteria was 3 % in Magoye (Uwanji). A normal serum TSH (below 2. 1 mU/l) was observed in only 12 out of 66 school children before iodine prophylaxis, whereas the T 4 /TBG ratio was decreased in 36 of 63 cases. Blood spot TSH levels in newborn infants (n = 219) from mothers without iodine supplementation were above 12 mU/l in 45 %. In contrast, only 20. 3 % of the newborn (n = 118) had elevated blood spot TSH (p less than 0. 002) when the mothers had received an <b>iodised</b> <b>oil</b> injection during pregnancy. Most of the newborn (n = 18; 75 %) of the latter group with elevated TSH (n = 24) came from mothers who had received the iodine injection only 1 - 25 days before delivery. Maternal iodine prophylaxis in late pregnancy does not increase the rate of neonatal hypothyroidism. Conclusions: It has been confirmed that severe iodine deficiency resulting in endemic goitre, cretinism, and hypothyroidism is prevalent in the regions studied. Dried blood spot TSH determinations may serve as an index for the efficiency of iodine prophylaxis programmes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolisation, {{a procedure}} {{for the treatment}} of hepatocellular carcinoma, provokes a pronounced but transient increase in hepatic cytolysis parameters. A definite evaluation of the impairment of liver function after this treatment, performed by adequate techniques, is still lacking. AIMS: To assess and quantify the impairment of liver metabolic activity after arterial chemoembolisation in patients with cirrhosis. The variations of hepatic vein pressure gradient provoked by this procedure were evaluated. PATIENTS: 15 patients with cirrhosis (Child's class A and B) and hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: 17 transcatheter arterial chemoembolisations with epirubicin, <b>iodised</b> <b>oil,</b> and gelfoam were performed; liver function was assessed before, the following day, and after seven days measuring galactose elimination capacity; aminopyrine breath test was also performed in six patients before the procedure and seven days after. In 10 patients intrinsic hepatic clearance of indocyanine green and hepatic vein pressure gradient were measured by hepatic vein catheterisation before and 30 minutes after chemoembolisation. RESULTS: Intrinsic hepatic clearance of indocyanine green decreased significantly from (mean (SEM)) 355 (140) ml/min to 277 (98) ml/min after the procedure (p = 0. 0007). Galactose elimination capacity did not show significant changes, being 4. 00 (0. 90) mg/min/kg body weight at baseline, 4. 20 (0. 90) mg/min/kg body weight after one day, and 3. 95 (0. 87) mg/min/kg body weight seven days after chemoembolisation. Aminopyrine breath test was 2. 31 (1. 09) % and remained unchanged after treatment, being 2. 39 (2. 04) % at day 7. Baseline hepatic vein pressure gradient was 17. 0 (5. 5) mm Hg, and 14. 4 (3. 7) mm Hg 30 minutes after chemoembolisation (p = 0. 09). CONCLUSIONS: A single transcatheter chemoembolisation in cirrhotic patients was detected by galactose elimination capacity and aminopyrine breath test one and seven days after the procedure. Therefore it can be considered a safe therapeutic tool for hepatocellular carcinoma in Child's class A and B cirrhotic patients...|$|E

In a highland Tanzanian village, salt iodine content was highly variable compared to national standards. While school-children had adequate urinary iodine, women at delivery and newborns showed signs of in adequate iodine status. Salt iodine concentrations should be monitored during production and distribution down to household level, and iodine status assessed in all vulnerable groups before adjusting recommended salt iodization levels at production. WHO's 1994 change in palpation goitre definition considerably lowered specificity and increased measured goitre rates by 25 % in Tanzanian school-children compared to the previous system. Ultrasound estimation of thyroid volume under rugged field conditions requires considerable human and material resources yet had a precision only slightly better than palpation. In resource poor settings appropriately trained palpators using the 1960 WHO definition of goitre remain optimal for estimating thyroid size until precision and cost of ultrasound has improved.
