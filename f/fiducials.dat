Local <b>fiducials</b> are required for precise placement of fine pitched components, in the component placement stage.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{techniques are}} proposed for several {{different types of}} <b>fiducial</b> mark (FM) in this paper. This study proposes "traditional <b>fiducial</b> mark positioning", "concentric circles <b>fiducial</b> mark detection" and "straight lines intersection mark positioning" methods according to different mark patterns. For traditional <b>fiducial</b> mark positioning method, two processing methods are proposed, including automatic detection of "reference <b>fiducial</b> mark" and <b>fiducial</b> mark positioning. The concentric circles <b>fiducial</b> mark detects the center and edge lines of concentric circles in the image. The straight lines intersection mark detects the intersection point of horizontal and vertical edges of the object.

30|$|For drift {{correction}} in super-resolution localization microscopy, the spatial position of <b>fiducial</b> markers {{had to be}} particularly stable within the gel matrix for the whole acquisition time. We verified this by tracking the trajectory of single <b>fiducial</b> markers {{with respect to the}} trajectories of the other markers. For that purpose, the distance of a specific <b>fiducial</b> marker to the center of mass of the remaining <b>fiducial</b> markers was calculated. This procedure was repeated for every <b>fiducial</b> marker, and allowed us identifying and removing those that showed an independent movement with respect to the other <b>fiducial</b> markers.

50|$|For {{soft tissue}} tumors, a method known as {{fiducial}} tracking can be utilized. Small metal markers (<b>fiducials)</b> {{made out of}} gold for bio-compatibility and high density to give good contrast on X-ray images are surgically implanted in the patient. This is carried out by an interventional radiologist, or neurosurgeon. The placement of the <b>fiducials</b> is a critical step if the fiducial tracking is to be used. If the <b>fiducials</b> are {{too far from the}} location of the tumor, or are not sufficiently spread out from each other it will not be possible to accurately deliver the radiation. Once these markers have been placed, they are located on a CT scan and the image guidance system is programmed with their position. When X-ray camera images are taken, the location of the tumor relative to the <b>fiducials</b> is determined, and the radiation can be delivered to any part of the body. Thus the fiducial tracking does not require any bony anatomy to position the radiation. <b>Fiducials</b> are known however to migrate and this can limit the accuracy of the treatment if sufficient time is not allowed between implantation and treatment for the <b>fiducials</b> to stabilize.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesCyberKnife {{stereotactic}} body radiosurgery is {{a potentially}} curative option for medically inoperable Stage I lung cancer. <b>Fiducial</b> marker placement {{in or near}} the tumor is required. Transthoracic placement using computed tomography guidance has been associated with a high risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy offers a safer method of placing markers; however, previous studies using linear markers have shown at least a 10 % dislocation rate. We describe the use of coil-spring <b>fiducial</b> markers placed under moderate sedation in an outpatient bronchoscopy suite. MethodsA total of 52 consecutive nonoperative patients with isolated lung tumors underwent <b>fiducial</b> placement using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. Of the 52 patients, 4 received 17 linear <b>fiducial</b> markers, and 49 patients with 56 tumors received 217 coil-spring <b>fiducial</b> markers. The procedures were considered successful if the <b>fiducial</b> markers had been placed {{in or near the}} tumors and had remained in place without migration, allowing radiosurgery without the need for additional <b>fiducial</b> markers. ResultsA total of 234 <b>fiducial</b> markers were successfully deployed in 52 patients with 60 tumors (mean diameter 23. 7 mm). Of these 60 tumors, 35 (58 %) were adjacent to the pleura. At CyberKnife planning, 8 (47 %) of 17 linear <b>fiducial</b> markers and 215 (99 %) of 217 coil-spring <b>fiducial</b> markers (P = . 0001) were still in place. Of the 4 patients with linear <b>fiducial</b> markers, 2 required additional <b>fiducial</b> placements; none of the patients with coil <b>fiducial</b> markers required additional procedures. Three pneumothoraces (5. 8 %) occurred in peripheral lesions (2 were treated with a pig-tail chest tube and 1 with observation only). ConclusionsDeployment of coil spring <b>fiducial</b> markers using navigation bronchoscopy can safely be performed with the patient under moderate sedation with almost no migration and a 5. 8 % rate of pneumothorax...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a derivation for the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of image registration error using an isotropic <b>fiducial</b> mark.

A parameterization method of the <b>fiducial</b> profile is introduced which guarantees no aliasing effect when the <b>fiducial</b> mark is digitized with proper sampling rate and is band-limited. A method for computing the circular <b>fiducial</b> mark, based on minimization of the CRLB registration error, and subject to certain practical constrains is developed. Experimental results are used to show that the designed <b>fiducial</b> mark can provide very accurate registration results and that the registration accuracy is independent of its location...|$|R

50|$|Another {{technology}} of image guidance that the CyberKnife system can use {{is called the}} Synchrony system or Synchrony method. This method uses a combination of surgically placed internal <b>fiducials</b> (typically small gold markers, well visible in x-ray imaging), and light emitting optical fibers (LED markers) mounted on the patient skin. LED markers are tracked by an infrared tracking camera. Since the tumor is moving continuously, to continuously image its location using X-ray cameras would require prohibitive amounts of radiation to be delivered to the patient's skin. The Synchrony system overcomes this by periodically taking images of the internal <b>fiducials,</b> and computing a correlation model between {{the motion of the}} external LED markers and the internal <b>fiducials.</b> Time stamps from the two sensors (x-ray and infrared LED) are needed to synchronize the two data streams, hence the name Synchrony.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{of interest}} to visualize microscopic esophageal tumor extensions to improve tumor delineation for radiation therapy (RT) planning. <b>Fiducial</b> marker placement is a common method to ensure target localization during planning and treatment. Visualization of these <b>fiducial</b> markers on OCT permits integrating OCT and computed tomography (CT) images used for RT planning via image registration. We studied the visibility of 13 (eight types) commercially available solid and liquid <b>fiducial</b> markers in OCT images at different depths using dedicated esophageal phantoms and evaluated marker placement depth in clinical practice. We designed and fabricated dedicated esophageal phantoms, in which three layers mimic the anatomical wall structures of a healthy human esophagus. We successfully implanted 13 commercially available <b>fiducial</b> markers that varied in diameter and material property at depths between 0. 5 and 3. 0 mm. The resulting esophageal phantoms were imaged with OCT, and marker visibility was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using the contrast-to-background-noise ratio (CNR). The CNR {{was defined as the}} difference between the mean intensity of the <b>fiducial</b> markers and the mean intensity of the background divided by the standard deviation of the background intensity. To determine whether, in current clinical practice, the implanted <b>fiducial</b> markers are within the OCT visualization range (up to 3. 0 mm depth), we retrospectively measured the distance of 19 <b>fiducial</b> markers to the esophageal lumen on CT scans of 16 esophageal cancer patients. In the esophageal phantoms, all the included <b>fiducial</b> markers were visible on OCT at all investigated depths. Solid <b>fiducial</b> markers were better visible on OCT than liquid <b>fiducial</b> markers with a 1. 74 -fold higher CNR. Although <b>fiducial</b> marker identification per type and size was slightly easier for superficially implanted <b>fiducial</b> markers, we observed no difference in the ability of OCT to visualize the markers over the investigated depth range. Retrospective distance measurements of 19 <b>fiducial</b> markers on the CT scan of esophageal cancer patients showed that 84 % (distance from the closest border of the marker to the lumen) and 53 % (distance {{from the center of the}} marker to the lumen) of the <b>fiducial</b> markers were located within the OCT visualization range of up to 3. 0 mm. We studied the visibility of eight types of commercially available <b>fiducial</b> markers at different depths on OCT using dedicated esophageal phantoms. All tested <b>fiducial</b> markers were visible at depths ≤ 3. 0 mm and most, but not all, clinically implanted markers were at a depth accessible to OCT.

40|$|R. A. Fisher’s <b>fiducial</b> {{inference}} {{has been}} the subject of many discussions and controversies ever since he introduced the idea during the 1930 ’s. The idea experienced a bumpy ride, to say the least, during its early years and one can safely say that it eventually fell into disfavor among mainstream statisticians. However, it appears to have made a resurgence recently under the label of generalized inference. In this new guise <b>fiducial</b> inference has proved to be a useful tool for deriving statistical procedures for problems where frequentist methods with good properties were previously unavailable. Therefore we believe that the <b>fiducial</b> argument of R. A. Fisher deserves a fresh look from a new angle. In this paper we first generalize Fisher’s <b>fiducial</b> argument and obtain a <b>fiducial</b> recipe applicable in virtually any situation. We demonstrate this <b>fiducial</b> recipe on many examples of varying complexity.

Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of percutaneous <b>fiducial</b> marker implantation of hepatic malignancies under sonographic guidance for CyberKnife radiation therapy. Materials and Methods: From April 2009 to November 2011, we retrospectively reviewed 30 percutaneous <b>fiducial</b> marker implantations in 30 patients with hepatic tumors. All patients underwent percutaneous <b>fiducial</b> marker implantation under sonographic guidance. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this technique were analyzed on immediate follow-up unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and 1 -week follow-up contrast-enhanced CT. The efficacy of this technique was defined as implantation enabling adequate treatment planning and CT simulation. Results: All 30 patients (100 %) had successful <b>fiducial</b> marker implantation under sonographic guidance. The mean number of <b>fiducial</b> markers implanted per patient was 4. 30 (range: 4 - 6 seeds). There was one minor complication (3. 33 %, 1 / 30).

40|$|Abstract—Fiducial {{images are}} a common method for {{supporting}} vision-based tracking in augmented reality systems. This paper addresses the question: {{what is the best}} <b>fiducial?</b> A set of criteria that are desirable in an optically tracked <b>fiducial</b> are presented and a new <b>fiducial</b> image set is designed that meets these criteria. The images in this set utilize a square blackborder pattern with a 15 % border width and an interior image that supports orientation determination and unique identification. The interior image is constructed from orthogonal DCT basis images chosen to minimize the probability of misidentification and to be robust to noise and occlusion. We describe how this image can be integrated into an AR software system such as ARToolKit. The most relevant examples to this conference are the ARToolKit markers, square <b>fiducial</b> images with a fixed, black band exterior surrounding a unique image interior [1]. Figure 1 is an example ARToolKit <b>fiducial.</b> The outer black band allows for location of a candidate <b>fiducial</b> in a captured image and the interior image allows for identification of the candidate from a set of expected images.

Recently, 2 D and 3 D images have been used by plastic surgeons for evaluating surgical outcomes. Distances between different <b>fiducial</b> points are frequently used as quantitative measures for characterizing breast morphology. <b>Fiducial</b> points can be directly marked on subjects for direct anthropometry, or can be manually marked on images. This paper introduces novel algorithms to automate the identification of <b>fiducial</b> points in 3 D images. Automating the process will make measurements of breast morphology more reliable, reducing the inter- and intra-observer bias. Algorithms to identify three <b>fiducial</b> points, the nipples, sternal notch, and umbilicus, are described. The algorithms used for localization of these <b>fiducial</b> points are formulated using a combination of surface curvature and 2 D color information. Comparison of the 3 D coordinates of automatically detected <b>fiducial</b> points and those identified manually, and geodesic distances between the <b>fiducial</b> points are used to validate algorithm performance.
