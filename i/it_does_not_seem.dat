5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she is {{passed by a}} man riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> likely {{that they are a}} common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark {{is found}} off {{southern}} India and Sri Lanka, {{as well as}} from southern China and Taiwan to Java and Borneo. It may also occur in the Philippines and the Red Sea, though specimens from these regions need to be compared taxonomically with those from its confirmed range. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be very common naturally. This species inhabits continental and insular shelves from inshore waters to at least a depth of , and usually swims close to the sea floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{strange that}} {{she turned to}} me without anger, that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> seek to release her arm. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> strange that her look had in it a {{gentleness}} as she spoke.|$|R

5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persian forces put up stout resistance, {{the heavily}} {{armoured}} Greek hoplites again proved themselves superior in combat, and eventually routed the Persian troops, who fled to their camp. The Ionian Greek contingents in the Persian army defected, and {{the camp was}} assailed {{and a large number}} of Persians slaughtered. The Persian ships were then captured and burned. The complete destruction of the Persian navy, along with the destruction of Mardonius's army at Plataea (allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale), decisively ended the invasion of Greece. After Plataea and Mycale, the allied Greeks would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Mycale was in every sense a decisive victory, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or even the Greek defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals {{with a little help}} from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{designated}} equestrian trails {{within the}} wilderness. While mountain bike usage {{is currently a}} matter of debate as the CPSLMP is updated, and not specifically prohibited, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> likely that it will be allowed.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{so when he}} saw it in proof at {{the office}} later, and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> so when he got it in the paper. He had not slept well; he was excited by several things; by the use Ricker had made of his work, and by the hopes of {{advancement}} which this use quickened in him. He was not ashamed of it; he was very proud of it; and he wondered at its symmetry and force, as he read and read it again.|$|R
25|$|Although relaxin's main {{cellular}} {{action in}} pregnancy is to remodel collagen by biosynthesis (thus facilitating the changes of connective tissue) <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to generate musculoskeletal problems.

25|$|However, as Thomas {{states the}} {{rational}} model {{provides a good}} perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.|$|E
25|$|A role of CKIε {{has also}} been seen in humans related to Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome, in which {{individuals}} have a much shorter period than the typical human. In this case, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be a mutation of the CKIε protein itself, but instead in the binding site for phosphorylation of the PER2 protein.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, Chenin blanc {{has also}} been {{frequently}} confused with other grape varieties with whom <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have a close genetic relationship.

25|$|From two to {{four years}} of age {{children}} find themselves using symbols to represent physical models of the world around them.

25|$|The new Chippewa Lab {{was set up}} in {{the middle}} of the 6600 project, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have delayed the project. After the 6600 shipped, the successor CDC 7600 system was the next product to be developed in Chippewa Falls, offering peak computational speeds of ten times the 6600. The failed follow-on to the 7600, the CDC 8600, was the project that finally ended his run of successes at CDC in 1972.|$|E

25|$|Dietary {{factors such}} as spice consumption, were {{hypothesized}} to cause ulcers {{until late in the}} 20th century, but {{have been shown to be}} of relatively minor importance. Caffeine and coffee, also commonly thought to cause or exacerbate ulcers, appear to have little effect. Similarly, while studies have found that alcohol consumption increases risk when associated with H. pylori infection, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to independently increase risk. Even when coupled with H. pylori infection, the increase is modest in comparison to the primary risk factor.|$|E
25|$|The European {{discovery}} of Vieques is sometimes credited to Christopher Columbus, who landed in Puerto Rico in 1493. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be certain}} whether Columbus personally visited Vieques, {{but in any case}} the island was soon claimed by the Spanish. During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Taíno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Taíno population was decimated, and its people either killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|The body {{is able to}} {{substantially}} {{reduce the}} amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of iron overload. Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the liver, the heart and other metabolically active organs.|$|E
