5|$|The {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675. The {{population grew}} in the summers {{with the arrival of}} migratory <b>fishermen.</b> <b>In</b> 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> six {{families}} living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, the species {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research {{has been carried out}} on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1950s, <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> Iceland {{requested}} {{assistance from}} the government to remove Killer Whales from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance. As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, rockets and depth charges.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{hurricane}} had {{moved away from}} the coast, airports quickly re-opened. Simultaneously, <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> Playa Azul protested that their livelihood was endangered due to fishing bans caused by the chemical spill; consequently, in Lázaro Cárdenas, 28people were arrested while warrants for 526 others' arrest were issued for disturbing peace and blocking highways. This sparked protests from two environmental group as a well a group of Mexican artists. Also, the fisherman demanded a $1million compensation. Within a week after the storm, additional rains had moved into the area, leading to further damage and eight fatalities.|$|E

5|$|The canals were nationalised in 1948, {{and long-distance}} {{commercial}} traffic {{had all but}} ended by 1958. In 1963, the British Waterways Board was formed and the canal ceased to be operated by railway interests {{for the first time}} in over 100 years. It was designated as a cruising waterway in the Transport Act 1968, with potential for leisure use, and since then, it has been enjoyed by recreational boaters, by walkers and by <b>fishermen.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, the Chester Canal Heritage Trust was formed and has worked to promote the canal and its heritage. Responsibility for the canal passed from British Waterways to the newly formed Canal & River Trust in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Madagascar, the cyclone produced {{high winds}} and heavy rainfall. The highest rainfall was a 24‑hour total of , {{and the highest}} wind gust was , both of which observed in Toliara. Many <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> the area {{were not aware of}} the storm's approach, and several of them died as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same general area, causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39people, injured 104, and left 214people missing as of February25, 2005. Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database. The storms damaged 5,792buildings, and there were 32,191people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483hectares (11,078acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|On June16, the Central Weather Bureau issued sea {{and land}} {{warnings}} in Taiwan as Soudelor was anticipated to produce torrential rains, gale-force winds, and rough seas. All <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> the area were urged {{to return to}} port {{before the onset of}} the typhoon. As the typhoon tracked near Taiwan, the Japan Meteorological Agency began advising residents in Okinawa to closely monitor the storm. One of the major airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways, cancelled 66 domestic flights the same day, stranding an estimated 6,000 people. During the storm, 257domestic flights were canceled, and train and ferry service was canceled. In Nagasaki Prefecture, 732schools were closed during the storm. Hundreds of people voluntarily evacuated in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E
5|$|The Negombo Tamil dialect {{is used by}} bilingual <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> the Negombo area, who {{otherwise}} identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala. The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, {{while at the same}} time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a dialect of old Tamil around 9th century CE. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were {{a close-knit}} group of mainly Danish artists who {{gathered}} each summer {{from the late}} 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own family life and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), {{who was born in}} Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, {{he became one of the}} central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community.|$|E

5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, {{and do not}} carry citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia to take up citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior ministry officials who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted. A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to interior ministry officials, or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold citizenship reported of interior ministry officials confiscating their citizenship papers. As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian citizenship. Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior ministry officials would confront Vietnamese <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese <b>fishermen</b> <b>in</b> the South China Sea {{received}} 24hours {{of warning}} from the National Hydrometerological Forecast Center before Chanchu approached the area, {{less time than}} other agencies in the region. At one point, Chanchu was forecast to become a strong typhoon and make landfall near Hong Kong. In response to the threat, officials at the Hong Kong Observatory, {{as well as in}} Macau, issued a standby signal to inform the public of the approaching typhoon. The HKO issued a warning signal number 3 on May17. In the territory, 60flights were canceled with another 14 delayed, beaches were closed, and ferry service was disrupted. Ahead of the storm, about 1million people evacuated from coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces to government warehouses, schools, tents, or the houses of relatives. In the former province, 62,000fishermen were ordered to return to port, while four flights were canceled at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Residents were advised to remain indoors, and workers reinforced billboards in anticipation of the strong winds. Rail and boat transport was stopped between Guangdong and Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait due to the typhoon. Schools were closed in Guangdong during the storm's passage, although they remained open in Fujian. In Shanghai, the speed limit of Donghai Bridge was halved because of strong winds.|$|E

5|$|The island {{seems to}} have been held, in {{association}} with the local manors of Uphill and Christon, by the Bek family, who granted it to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Although the mechanism is unclear, it next passed to the Berkeley family with Maurice de Berkeley, the second Baron Berkeley, holding it in 1315. The site was used again by warreners in the 14th and 15th centuries. They lived in one of the ruined priory buildings which was rebuilt. By 1453 the overlordship of the island was held by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, and in 1460 the advowson was exercised by Margaret Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. In the years following, the ownership of a variety of estates, including Norton Beauchamp, to which Steep Holm was attached, was disputed. In the 16th century Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset took over, and then lost, large estates including Brean, to which Steep Holm was allied. The Seymour descendants recovered the estates, owning them into the 17th century, although the only activity on Steep Holm {{seems to have}} been the employment of gull watchers and <b>fishermen.</b> <b>In</b> 1684 the Norton Beauchamp estate was sold to Edward Ryder. It appears to have been auctioned by decree of the Court of Chancery 11years later in 1695, possibly because of difficulties in maintaining sea defenses along the Somerset coast; however, this {{seems to have been}} disputed in the light of outstanding mortgages. In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker.|$|E
