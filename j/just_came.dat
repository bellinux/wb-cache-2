I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now.

500|$|Madonna {{had first}} {{performed}} [...] "Vogue" [...] at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, {{where she and}} her dancers were clad in 18th century-inspired fashions, inspired by Marie Antoinette.
