40|$|Conventionally, limestones {{have been}} used in passive mine water {{treatment}} systems. Limestones with the highest proportion of calcite are recommended since they have the greatest long-term alkalinity generating potential. Manganese is present in mine waters and needs to be removed in order to comply with environmental quality standards. This paper compares seven different Permian carbonate rocks, both limestone and dolomite, in their ability to promote manganese oxidation in real mine waters over an 8 -h period. The substrates are characterised using thermogravimetric analysis, X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. <b>Fluorescence</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> is used to monitor any changes in the dissolved organic matter concentration in the water as manganese is removed. We determine that there is no statistically significant correlation between manganese removal and the proportion of calcite or between manganese removal and substrate surface roughness. <b>Fluorescence</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> demonstrates that there is a distinct change in the observed spectra in the water during manganese removal. There is a positive and statistically significant correlation between manganese removal and the production of a tyrosine-like substance (up to 150 ppb in 8 h), which fluoresces at 270 &# 8211; 280 nm excitation wavelength and 300 &# 8211; 310 nm emission wavelength, suggesting that microbial activity {{is an important factor in}} promoting manganese removal within dolomite passive treatment systems.

Together with ligand L 3, the parent calix[4]arene substituted by a penta(tetra) thioethyleneglycol crown, the spectroscopic properties of the ligands were determined by means of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, showing that the ligands display modest but non-negligible intrinsic fluorescence properties (ϕfluo = 0. 023; 0. 026 and 0. 029 for L 1, L 2 and L 3 in CH 2 Cl 2, respectively). The X-ray crystal structures of ligand L 1, and of its synthetic precursor were determined and analyzed for their capacity to accommodate the incoming cationic species. The ligands were further investigated for their complexation properties of divalent cations such as Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Hg 2 + and Cd 2 + (under their nitrate salts) in 1 : 1 CH 3 CN/CH 2 Cl 2 solutions (I = 0. 01 M Et 4 NNO 3, T = 25. 0 (2) °C), in which the additions of cations were monitored by absorption and steady-state <b>fluorescence</b> <b>spectrophotometries.</b> The stoichiometries of the corresponding complexes were assessed by ESI-MS, while insights into the structures of the complexes in solution were obtained with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Cellular and mitochondrial structure and function, and the cell cycle, were analysed using light, electron and <b>fluorescence</b> microscopy, <b>spectrophotometry</b> and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was evaluated using biochemical and cytohistochemical methods. RESULTS Cells treated with Sr underwent massive vacuolization and cytosolic condensation, followed by cell death only in the prostate lines. Within minutes of adding Sr to prostate cells, it caused opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), which led to complete mitochondrial depolarization within 2 h, and to the appearance of small, pycnotic mitochondria. Release of cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo to the cytosol was detectable after 4 h of treatment, while caspase 9 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage occurred at 16 h, followed by appearance of a sub-G 1 peak and apoptosis at 24 h.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on the demineralization-induced changes in dentin autofluorescence. Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy (CLSM) images and fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of in vitro demineralized root surfaces and sound controls on the same tooth roots were compared. When observed in CLSM images, demineralized dentin, excited at 488 nm, gave an increased emission at 529 nm compared to sound dentin. The difference in fluorescence decreased deeper into the root, as the sound dentin underneath the lesion was reached. In contrast, when using <b>fluorescence</b> <b>spectrophotometry,</b> excitation around 460 and 488 nm yielded a lower emission around 520 nm for demineralized dentin than for sound dentin, but in a more pronounced peak. From excitation spectra for emission around 520 nm, it could be seen that in demineralized dentin the contribution of excitation between 480 and 520 nm was more important than in sound dentin. The recorded fluorescence in CLSM images was not affected by demineralization-caused changes in scattering and absorption properties, due to the small measurement volume. Thus, the increased fluorescence for demineralized dentin implies an increased quantum yield. In <b>fluorescence</b> <b>spectrophotometry,</b> where the measurement volume is large, changes in scattering and absorption do have an influence on the fluorescence signal. Then, increased absorption by non-fluorescing chromophores and increased re-absorption around the emission wavelength may compensate for the increase in quantum yield and absorption around the excitation wavelength by fluorophores...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} of [(&#x 03 B 7; 6 -p-cymene) Ru(ATSC) Cl]PF 6 (ATSC = 9 -anthraldehyde thiosemicarbazone) with human serum albumin was investigated at different temperatures using <b>fluorescence</b> and infrared <b>spectrophotometry.</b> The binding constant, K, for {{the reaction was}} determined using {{a number of different}} methods. Using a modified Stern-Volmer equation, K was determined to be 9. 09 &#x 00 D 7; 104, 12. 1 &#x 00 D 7; 104, and 13. 1 &#x 00 D 7; 104 &#x 2009;M&#x 2212; 1 at 293 &#x 2009;K, 298 &#x 2009;K, and 308 &#x 2009;K, respectively. A thermodynamic analysis showed that the reaction is spontaneous with &#x 0394;G being negative. The enthalpy of reaction &#x 0394;H= 16. 5 &#x 2009;kJ mol&#x 2212; 1 and the entropy of reaction &#x 0394;S= 152 &#x 2009;Jmol&#x 2212; 1 K&#x 2212; 1. The values of &#x 0394;H and &#x 0394;S suggest that hydrophobic forces are dominant in the mode of interaction and that the process is mostly entropy driven...|$|R
