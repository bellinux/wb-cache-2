5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Silk is an {{expensive}} material, and {{has been used for}} representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillows.|$|E

25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet.</b> In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news.|$|E

2500|$|Later when bladed wires were {{developed}} the pile loops were severed on {{withdrawal of the}} blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton. after this development the loom {{became known as the}} Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. the methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire ( [...] 2-shot) the Wilton Wilton cut-pile is sometime woven similarly ( [...] 2-shot) but more often with three picks of weft to each wire ( [...] 3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> backing.|$|E

2500|$|Very {{little is}} known with {{certainty}} about Stevin's life and {{what we know is}} mostly inferred from other recorded facts. [...] The exact birth date and the date and place of his death are uncertain. [...] It is assumed he was born in Bruges since he enrolled at Leiden University under the name Simon Stevinus Brugensis (meaning [...] "Simon Stevin from Bruges"). [...] His name is usually written as Stevin, but some documents regarding his father use the spelling Stevijn (pronunciation [...] ). [...] This is a normal spelling shift in 16th century Dutch. [...] He was born around the year 1548 to unmarried parents, Anthonis (Anton) Stevin and Catelyne van der Poort. [...] His father {{is believed to have been}} a cadet son of a mayor of Veurne and a member of the schuttersgilde (city militia) Sint-Barbara of Bruges. [...] While Simon's father was not mentioned in the book of burghers, the fact that he was a member of the militia allows a safe assumption that he was. Many other Stevins were later mentioned in the Poorterboeken (burgher registry books). Simon Stevin's mother Cathelijne (or Catelyne) was the daughter of a wealthy family from Ypres. [...] Her father Hubert was [...] a poorter of Bruges. [...] Simon's mother Cathelijne later married Joost Sayon who was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> and silk trade and a member of the schuttersgilde Sint-Sebastiaan. Through her marriage Cathelijne became a member of a family of Calvinists and Simon was likely brought up in the Calvinist faith.|$|E

40|$|Bedroom {{carpets and}} {{mattresses}} {{devoid of any}} reported or observed moisture damage or problems were analysed as sources of indoor fungal growth by determining the amount of CO 2 released from respiration by micro-organisms living in furnishings. Dust was extracted from <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> and mattresses using a Kirby G 5 vacuum cleaner. The basal respiration rate of the dust samples without moisture added was used to estimate base respiration rate and a substrate-induced respiration rate method was used to estimate the vitality of micro-organisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dust and to estimate the amount of living microbial biomass. Analysis of fungal species was performed by direct sprinkling of dust samples and stamping the filter collection papers directly onto a range of nutrient agars. Fungal differentiation revealed 18 species were living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> and 12 species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mattresses. Penicilliumspp., Aspergillus niger and Zygomycetes were dominant fungi. The relative abundances of fungal species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> were significantly correlated to <b>the</b> species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mattresses. The basal CO 2 respiration rate and the living microbial biomass from all samples {{was the same as}} several soil types including sandy loam soils, Para Brown Earth, Sandy Brown Earth and Brown Podzol. The rate of respiration showed that the fungal species detected were living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> furnishings, and were highly metabolically active. This revealed that bedroom carpets and mattresses in non-problem dwellings and without moisture damage can provide a habitat with enough moisture to support fungal growth despite the lack of an obvious moisture source...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: Several {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that the cerebellum has {{an important role in}} functions of higher order as a general mode of sequence detection, independently from the nature of the information. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether the cerebellum mediates the processing of navigational sequential information and to determine whether it is influenced by the modality of the stimuli presentation. Method: We tested 12 cerebellar patients and 12 healthy age-matched participants in 2 comparable navigational tasks (Walking Corsi Test and <b>the</b> Magic <b>Carpet)</b> requiring to memorizing a sequence of spatial locations. The two tasks differ each other for the modality of stimuli presentation: while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Walking Corsi Test the sequence is shown by an examiner that walks on <b>the</b> <b>carpet,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Magic <b>Carpet</b> it is shown by a computer that lights up <b>the</b> tiles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sequence. We hypothesize that different mental processes are implicated between the Walking Corsi Test and <b>the</b> Magic <b>Carpet.</b> Indeed, whereas watching the examiner, who performs the sequence on <b>the</b> <b>carpet,</b> allows <b>the</b> patient to simulate <b>the</b> action mentally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Walking Corsi Test, such simulation cannot be triggered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Magic <b>Carpet.</b> Results: Our results showed that cerebellar patients obtained scores significantly lower than controls subjects only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Magic <b>Carpet.</b> Conclusions: We interpreted the patients’ performance as a specific deficit in detecting and ordering single independent stimuli as a sequence, when the maintenance of stimulus-response associations is more demanding...|$|R
