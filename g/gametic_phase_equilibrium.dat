40|$|Grasshoppers {{have been}} much less studied than Drosophila {{when it comes to}} {{inversion}} polymorphisms, despite the occurrence of this rearrangement in several species of grasshoppers. In the present study, 354 males from a natural population of the New World species Trimerotropis pallidipennis, polymorphic for 6 pericentric inversions in 4 chromosome pairs, were sampled at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the adult life span. This sampling, along with the fact that generations in this grasshopper are annual and discrete, was done to detect differential adult male longevity among karyotypes and departures from formal null models, such as <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> These methods allow the detection of natural selection taking place in the wild. The comparison between age classes showed that some inversions were significantly more frequent in one sample, thus revealing the operation of natural selection. Gametic phase disequilibrium was detected in the sample of aged males but not in the sample of young ones. Furthermore, here we aim to detect the phenotypic targets of longevity selection by examining morphometric characters, in order to have a clearer idea of the relation between inversions and natural selection in this species. These results corroborate previous studies that suggested that the inversions are involved in natural selection, and an adaptive model has been proposed for the pattern of inversion frequencies throughout several populations at different altitudes and latitudes.

40|$|The {{population}} genetics of Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast pathogen, were analyzed in {{a center of}} rice diversity (the Uttar Pradesh hills of the Indian Himalayas) using multilocus and single-, or low-copy, DNA markers. Based on DNA fingerprinting with the multilocus probe MGR 586 and single-locus probes, 157 haplotypes clustered into 56 lineages (at >/= 70 % MGR 586 band similarity, each with unique single-locus profiles) and high diversity indices were detected among 458 isolates collected from 29 sites during 1992 - 1995. Most valleys sampled had distinct populations (73 % of the lineages were site specific) with some containing {{one or a few}} lineages, confirming the importance of clonal propagation, and others were very diverse. Widely distributed lineages suggested that migration occurs across the region and into the Indo-Gangetic plains. Repeated sampling at one site, Matli, (170 isolates, 1992 - 1995) yielded 19 lineages and diversity significantly greater than that reported from similar samples from Colombia and the Philippines. Analysis of allelic associations using pairwise comparisons and multilocus variance analysis failed to reject the hypothesis of <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The Matli population shifted from highly diverse in 1992 to almost complete dominance by one lineage in 1995. Such population dynamics are consistent with recombination followed by differential survival of clonal descendants of recombinant progeny. At another site, Ranichauri, population (n = 84) composition changed from 2 to 11 lineages over 2 yr and yielded additional evidence for equilibrium. Sexually fertile and hermaphrodite isolates of both mating types were recovered from rice in both Matli and Ranichauri. We demonstrate that Himalayan M. grisea populations are diverse and dynamic and conclude that the structure of some populations may be affected to some extent by sexual recombination...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The authors present ELB, an easy to {{programme}} and computationally fast algorithm for inferring <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> in population samples of multilocus genotypes. Phase updates {{are made on}} the basis of a window of neighbouring loci, and the window size varies according to the local level of linkage disequilibrium. Thus, ELB is particularly well suited to problems involving many loci and/or relatively large genomic regions, including those with variable recombination rate. The authors have simulated population samples of single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes with varying levels of recombination and marker density, and find that ELB provides better local estimation of <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> than the PHASE or HTYPER programs, while its global accuracy is broadly similar. The relative improvement in local accuracy increases both with increasing recombination and with increasing marker density. Short tandem repeat (STR, or microsatellite) simulation studies demonstrate ELB's superiority over PHASE both globally and locally. Missing data are handled by ELB; simulations show that phase recovery is virtually unaffected by up to 2 per cent of missing data, but that phase estimation is noticeably impaired beyond this amount. The authors also applied ELB to datasets obtained from random pairings of 42 human X chromosomes typed at 97 diallelic markers in a 200 kb low-recombination region. Once again, they found ELB to have consistently better local accuracy than PHASE or HTYPER, while its global accuracy was close to the best. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Reactive residue curve maps (RRCMs) {{are useful}} {{for the design of}} {{reactive}} distillation columns as a tool to establish feasible zones of reaction-separation. However, the calculation of an RRCM usually involves great computational effort due to the nonlinearity of the model equations and its iterative nature for the determination of reactive <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> In this study, a simplified method for the generation of RRCMs is presented. This method is based on the application of reaction-invariant composition variables and assumes that the <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> constants (i. e., the relative volatilities) are independent of the temperature. Specifically, the <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> constants are calculated using a suitable estimation of the bubble temperature obtained from pure-component boiling temperatures and the reaction-invariant composition of liquid phase. These assumptions avoid iterative <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> calculations for obtaining a good approximation of RRCMs. Several reactive systems are used to identify the capabilities and limitations of the proposed method. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the possibility of identifying a single model that {{will be able to}} accurately describe the <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in non-polymeric systems, which involve non-polar, polar and hydrogen bonding compounds. To this purpose the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) EoS, developed in this laboratory about 10 years ago, is examined in the correlation of <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in binary systems and prediction of multicomponent <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> from binary data. When possible the results of the CPA EoS are compared with those obtained from the PC-SAFT EoS. To account for dipolar or quadrupolar interactions, present when molecules such as acetone or carbon dioxide are involved, these molecules are treated using the concept of ""pseudo-association"", i. e. as being able to act as associating compounds. This approach renders CPA applicable to systems that involve polar compounds without the need of extra terms to account for polar and/or quadrupolar interactions. It is concluded that CPA, coupled with the ""pseudo-association"" approach for polar molecules, represents a model that is able to accurately describe the <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in a variety of binary systems involving non-polar, polar and hydrogen bonding compounds and provide satisfactory prediction of multicomponent <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium</b> from binary data. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract A {{number of}} rare variant {{statistical}} {{methods have been}} proposed for analysis of the impending wave of next-generation sequencing data. To date, there are few direct comparisons of these methods on real sequence data. Furthermore, {{there is a strong}} need for practical advice on the proper analytic strategies for rare variant analysis. We compare four recently proposed rare variant methods (combined multivariate and collapsing, weighted sum, proportion regression, and cumulative minor allele test) on simulated phenotype and next-generation sequencing data as part of Genetic Analysis Workshop 17. Overall, we find that all analyzed methods have serious practical limitations on identifying causal genes. Specifically, no method has more than a 5 % true discovery rate (percentage of truly causal genes among all those identified as significantly associated with the phenotype). Further exploration shows that all methods suffer from inflated false-positive error rates (chance that a noncausal gene will be identified as associated with the phenotype) because of population stratification and <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> disequilibrium between noncausal SNPs and causal SNPs. Furthermore, observed true-positive rates (chance that a truly causal gene will be identified as significantly associated with the phenotype) {{for each of the four}} methods was very low (< 19 %). The combination of larger than anticipated false-positive rates, low true-positive rates, and only about 1 % of all genes being causal yields poor discriminatory ability for all four methods. <b>Gametic</b> <b>phase</b> disequilibrium and population stratification are important areas for further research in the analysis of rare variant data. </p...|$|R

Its long-term pedigree data, together with extensive genetic sampling, have allowed the study {{of a range of}} questions in evolutionary biology and ecology. However, the availability of genetic markers has been limited. We here describe 191 new microsatellite loci, including 160 high-quality polymorphic autosomal, 7 Z-linked and 1 W-linked markers. We used these markers to construct a linkage map for song sparrows with a total sex-averaged map length of 1731 cM and covering 35 linkage groups, and hence, these markers cover most of the 38 – 40 chromosomes. Female and male map lengths did not differ significantly. We then bioinformatically mapped these loci to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome and found that linkage groups were conserved between song sparrows and zebra finches. Compared to the zebra finch, marker order within small linkage groups was well conserved, whereas the larger linkage groups showed some intrachromosomal rearrangements. Finally, we show that as expected, recombination frequency between linked loci explained the majority of variation in <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> disequilibrium.
