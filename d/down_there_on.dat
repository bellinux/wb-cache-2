500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols. He was <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the South Side, holding his own. I {{was scared to death}} of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly". He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E

500|$|The 2006 Westchester County tornado was {{the strongest}} and largest tornado {{in the history of}} Westchester County, New York. It touched <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> July12,2006 and {{traveled}} [...] into southwestern Connecticut during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30p.m.EDT (19:30UTC) on the shore of the Hudson River before becoming a waterspout and traveling [...] across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered Westchester County and struck the town of Sleepy Hollow at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost {{a quarter of a mile}} (400m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01p.m.EDT (20:01UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of Greenwich at 4:03p.m.EDT (20:03UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.|$|E
2500|$|Hood, who {{remained}} at his headquarters on Winstead Hill, was still {{convinced that he}} could pierce the Federal line. At about 7 p.m., he deployed the only division of Stephen D. Lee's corps that had arrived, commanded by Maj. Gen. Edward [...] "Allegheny" [...] Johnson, to assist Cheatham's effort. They moved north {{on the west side}} of the Columbia Turnpike and passed around Privet Knob, Cheatham's headquarters, but were unfamiliar with the terrain in the dark and Cheatham told Lee he had no staff officer left who could guide them. Both Bate and Cheatham warned Lee not to fire indiscriminately against the Federal works because Confederates were pinned <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the outside. Johnson's men lost their unit alignments in the dark and had significant difficulties attacking the works just to the west of the Carter House. They were repulsed after a single assault with heavy losses.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Another day, and at Niles {{there were}} three of us. Beyond Niles, {{in the middle of the}} highway, we found Wathope. The motor car had broken <b>down,</b> and <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> the rugs which they had spread on the ground, lay the bodies of his sister, his mother, and himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} nothing," [...] the officer said; [...] "but you might hear sounds <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> coming along <b>on</b> the water, before I do. I {{will go down}} to the water's edge, and listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe it's because Peter's got Chink {{blood in}} him," [...] had been Andrews' hypothesis. [...] "Deacon's Australian, you know, and they're daffy <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> colour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, {{you were}} right about that noise. It was a shot. The poor little chap's <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> {{the floor with a}} hole in him the size of my fist.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bradley's face darkened--then {{they were}} not among friends after all. [...] "There are ten of us <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> a German sub with small-arms and a gun," [...] he said quickly in English. [...] "It will be no trick {{to get away from}} these people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you mean}} to insinivate that 'twas I that made you fall?' said Jasper--'I, that was quietly walking up the stairs, when <b>down</b> <b>there</b> came <b>on</b> me a shower--not cats and dogs, but worserer, far worserer! Why, I'm kilt! my nose is flat as a pancake, I shan't recover my beauty all the evening for the great swells that are coming.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you funny fellow!" [...] said Almayer, banteringly. [...] "Well, come up. Don't make a noise, {{but come}} up. You'll catch a sunstroke <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and die <b>on</b> my {{doorstep}} perhaps. I don't want any tragedy here. Come on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ought both to have shaved {{before you}} put those things on," [...] Captain Holland said, as they muttered exclamations of pain. [...] "You see, cobbler's wax, or {{whatever}} it is, sticks to what little <b>down</b> <b>there</b> is <b>on</b> your cheeks and chin, and I don't wonder that it hurts horribly, pulling it off. If you had shaved first, {{you would not have}} felt any of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me {{your story}} now, my yellow lion. How was it all? Don't stand, sit right <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the transom. I'm a {{democratic}} sort of sea-king. Plump on the woolsack, I say, and spin the yarn. But hold; {{you want some}} grog first." ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo and Lucy {{hesitated a}} little, but they {{concluded}} {{to take their}} mother's advice at last, and went to Rollo's little library, and chose a book, and then {{went down to the}} back entry, and sat <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> a long cricket, and began to read.|$|E

60|$|The {{lanterns}} were dashed {{down and}} extinguished till but one remained, {{a red and}} wavering star. Hoarse voices shouted for light, for none knew friend from foe. It came; some one had fired the tapestries and the blaze ran up them to the roof. Then fearing lest they should be roasted, the Abbot's folk gave way and fled to the farther door, followed by their foes. Here it was {{that most of them}} fell, for they jammed in the doorway and were cut <b>down</b> <b>there</b> are <b>on</b> the stair beyond.|$|R
6000|$|Fifty {{yards or}} more {{down the slope}} we met. I showed him a great splotch of blood on a flat stone. [...] "We'll find him not far down," [...] I said. So we slid and crawled, and held to brush and rocks, {{following}} that bloody trail until {{we came to a}} ledge. From there I espied the bear lodged against a manzanita bush. He lay on his back, all four paws extended, and he was motionless. R.C. and I sat <b>down</b> right <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the ledge.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child, it's {{perfectly}} simple. This earl {{of yours}} {{has taken the}} thing off to his castle, like a brigand.

6000|$|The princess softly persisted, and he said: [...] "She {{lives in}} the East. In Chicago. It's too far off to find her. It takes five days to get <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> a cattle train, {{and then you have}} to look her up in a directory, and then trail her down. I couldn't find her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use, Lou," [...] he {{said under}} his breath. [...] "You must despise {{me for being}} a drivelling fool, but I have neither eyes nor ears now. I would give all I have {{in the world to}} lie <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the floor now before you and to kiss the soles of your feet." ...|$|E
60|$|We sat <b>down</b> together, <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the grass, and the revulsion {{of feeling}} {{was so great}} that really I think we cried with joy. We had escaped from that awful dungeon, which was so near to {{becoming}} our grave. Surely some merciful Power guided our footsteps to the jackal hole, for that is what it must have been, at the termination of the tunnel. And see, yonder on the mountains the dawn we had never thought to look upon again was blushing rosy red.|$|R
60|$|He gave Dryfoos his hand, {{and pushed}} aside the {{papers on the}} corner of March's desk, and sat <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> and went <b>on</b> briskly with the {{nonsense}} he could always talk while he was waiting for another to develop any matter of business; he told March afterward that he scented business in the air as soon as he came into the room where he and Dryfoos were sitting.|$|R
50|$|Tyson {{travelled}} {{much about}} Australia, but eventually made his principal home at Felton {{station on the}} Darling <b>Downs.</b> He died <b>there</b> <b>on</b> 4 December 1898.

6000|$|... 'No, sir--unless we {{go there}} to change horses, which I thought to do. The direct road is {{straight}} on. Havenpool lies about three miles <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the left.

60|$|Full {{five minutes}} Keith stood with those {{sheets of paper}} in his hand, while the clock ticked, the wind moaned {{a little in the}} trees outside, the flames licked the logs with the quiet click and ruffle of their intense far-away life <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the hearth. Then he roused himself, and sat down to read the whole again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that is {{more than}} I can tell. Since, however, we had already {{determined}} that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep." ...|$|E
50|$|The Antiques Roadshow {{arrives in}} Oakham, so Marlene {{attempts}} {{to find something to}} take down to have valued. Boycie can see the truth though, he knows that she only wants to go <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to get <b>on</b> telly.

Meanwhile, Tyler and his girlfriend make progress and the rest of Oakham attempt to find something to take down and have valued. Guest starring Fiona Bruce.|$|R
60|$|Beyond lay a {{few small}} fields, and then a bit of open ground {{scattered}} with gorse and thorn bushes, and much broken by ups and <b>downs.</b> <b>There,</b> one afternoon <b>on</b> a big stone was seated Steadfast Kenton, a boy of fourteen, sturdy, perhaps loutish, with an honest ruddy face under his leathern cap, a coarse smock frock and stout gaiters. He was watching the fifteen sheep and lambs, the old goose and gander and their nine children, the three cows, eight pigs, and the old donkey which got their living there.|$|R
60|$|On I stumbled, I {{scarcely}} know how. Twice I fell, once I {{turned up}} the bisecting passage, but fortunately found out my mistake in time. For twenty minutes or more I crept along, till at last {{it occurred to me}} that I must have passed the little stair by which I had descended. So, utterly exhausted, and nearly frightened to death, I sank <b>down</b> at length <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the stone flooring, and sank into oblivion.|$|R
