25|$|The Los Angeles {{flood of}} 1938 {{was one of}} the largest floods in the history of Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside Counties in {{southern}} California. The flood was caused by two Pacific storms that swept across the Los Angeles Basin in February-March 1938 and generated almost one year's worth of precipitation <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Between 113–115 people were killed by the flooding. The Los Angeles, San Gabriel and Santa Ana Rivers burst their banks, inundating much of the coastal plain, the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys, and the Inland Empire. Flood control structures spared parts of Los Angeles County from destruction, while Orange and Riverside Counties experienced more damage.|$|E
25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E

500|$|The {{passage of}} a {{tropical}} cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening. [...] Additional cooling may {{come in the form}} of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an [...] "aggressive act" [...] that shows no {{consideration}} for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get {{through the rest of the}} month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given – [...] "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" [...] encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.|$|E

2500|$|Five {{days after}} the jungle primary, on November 2, 1979, Fitzmorris filed suit against Lambert. He claimed that he, not Lambert, {{deserved}} the general election position to challenge Treen. Should the court declare Lambert {{the winner of the}} second spot, Fitzmorris requested nullification of the primary results. [...] "I do not understand how <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> I could have lost over 2,000 votes, while Mr. Lambert gains as many," [...] said Fitzmorris. The suit listed thousands of alleged acts of election fraud and irregularities in twenty parishes. To win the suit, Fitzmorris had to prove that there enough votes cast under questionable circumstances {{to make a difference in}} the total. Fitzmorris declared that he believed [...] "in miracles" [...] and expressed confidence that the election could be re-staged, or the results nullified.|$|E
2500|$|In the Stanford prison study, by Philip Zimbardo, a {{simulated}} exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the [...] "guards" [...] became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued {{to be an}} important demonstration {{of the power of the}} immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits. However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour, and that the participants' personality influenced their reactions in a variety of ways, including how long they chose to remain in the study. One of the most concerted empirical revisitations of the themes raised by Zimbardo came with the 2002 BBC prison study.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{a release}} to {{manufacturing}} (RTM) build {{is the final}} version of code shipped to retailers and other distributors, the purpose of a pre-RTM build is to eliminate any last [...] "show-stopper" [...] bugs that may prevent the code from responsibly being shipped to customers, as well as anything else that consumers may find annoying. Thus, it is unlikely that any major new features will be introduced; instead, work will focus on Vista's [...] "fit-and-finish". <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> developers had managed to drop Vista's bug count from over 2470 on September 22 to just over 1400 by the time RC2 shipped in early October. However, they still had a way to go before Vista was ready to RTM. Microsoft's internal processes required Vista's bug count to drop to 500 or fewer before the product could go into escrow for RTM. For most of these builds, only 32-bit versions were released.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{grassroots}} fundraising, Howard Dean {{was able}} to raise millions more than the previous DNC Chairman {{at the same point}} after the 2000 election. The year after his election, Dean had raised the most money by any DNC Chairman in a similar post election period. This was especially apparent when the Federal Election Commission reported that the DNC had raised roughly $86.3 million {{in the first six months}} of 2005, an increase of over 50% on the amount raised during the same period of 2003. In comparison, the RNC fundraising activities represented a gain of only 2%. Additional attempts to capitalize on this trend was the introduction of [...] "Democracy Bonds," [...] a program under which small donors would give a set amount every month. Although it only reached over 31,000 donors by May 2006, far off-pace from the stated goal of 1 million by 2008, it nonetheless contributed to a new small-donor funding philosophy of the DNC. Dean continued to further develop online fundraising at the DNC. Just one month before Election Day 2006, he became the first to introduce the concept of a [...] "grassroots match," [...] where donors to the DNC pledged to match the first donation made by a new contributor. The DNC stated that the resulting flood of contributions led to 10,000 first-time donors <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
