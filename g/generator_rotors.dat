50|$|The doubly-fed <b>generator</b> <b>rotors</b> are {{typically}} wound with 2 to 3 {{times the number}} of turns of the stator. This means that the rotor voltages will be higher and currents respectively lower. Thus in the typical ± 30% operational speed range around the synchronous speed, the rated current of the converter is accordingly lower which leads to a lower cost of the converter. The drawback is that controlled operation outside the operational speed range is impossible because of the higher than rated rotor voltage. Further, the voltage transients due to the grid disturbances (three- and two-phase voltage dips, especially) will also be magnified. In order to prevent high rotor voltages - and high currents resulting from these voltages - from destroying the IGBTs and diodes of the converter, a protection circuit (called crowbar) is used.|$|E

Prediction of dominance of either dynamic phenomenon in a particular system can be determined by taking into account the relative sizes of the values of its reduced admittance matrix...|$|E
