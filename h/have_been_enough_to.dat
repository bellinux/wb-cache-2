5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hamlin {{was a light}} sleeper. The {{crackle of}} {{underbrush}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> disturb him. The voice was his; the click was the cocking of his revolver.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{argued that}} since a single vague {{accusation}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep a detainee imprisoned, if one assumed his case was typical, it was reasonable {{to believe that}} many other detainees the reviews determined were illegal combatants may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> just as questionable.|$|R
5|$|On {{their way}} home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for {{the night at the}} country estate of the Palmers, who live five and a half miles away from Willoughby's estate. Marianne cannot resist going to see the estate; she becomes gravely ill {{trekking}} up a hill in a torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make him happy.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|In June 1997, {{two months}} before the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe {{required}} an appendix operation, which caused him to miss two weeks of training. Upon reaching Japan, Thorpe placed fourth in his heat of the 200m freestyle with a new personal best time of 1min 51.46s. Thorpe's time was not enough to qualify for the final, but earned him selection in the 4×200m freestyle relay team. Along with teammates Michael Klim, Ian van der Wal and Hackett, Thorpe claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe was fifth at the 300m mark, but fought back to claim silver in the 400m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3min 49.64s. His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win silver at the Atlanta Olympics. In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in Brisbane for the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth. Thorpe gained selection for the world championships by finishing fourth and second in the 200m and 400m freestyle respectively. He set new personal bests in both events.|$|E
60|$|The {{fragment}} of a log {{fell on the}} ashes and the fire gave a dying spurt. Darkness succeeded the sudden glow. The fire was out.

30|$|Formerly, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{shown that}} {{combining}} techniques allows efficient classification of single and simultaneous disturbances, and more, {{the usage of}} the second- and fourth-order HOS features, for a specific lag chosen from Fisher’s discriminant ratio (FDR) criterion, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> deal {{with the majority of}} the disturbances considered [24].|$|R
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Schmitt was a {{significant}} blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, {{he was the most}} experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the sieges at Kehl and Hünigen, the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winterthur and Zürich. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement, Franz von Weyrother. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at Hohenlinden in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and possessor of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> turn that defeat into a victory, but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was considered one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.|$|E
25|$|The Central Bank of Ireland {{failed to}} spot Madoff's {{gigantic}} fraud, {{when he started}} using Irish funds and had to supply large amounts of information which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> enable Irish regulators to uncover the fraud much earlier than late 2008 when he was finally arrested in New York.|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{the lion}} rose, {{and as he}} rose, a twig snapped beneath one of his great, padded paws.

25|$|A {{more serious}} charge made against Chivington {{was that if}} he had hurried to {{reinforce}} Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.|$|E

Some sing instead The Women's Dayenu, a feminist variant of Dayenu, by Michele Landsberg.|$|E
25|$|Toronto is {{situated}} by Lake Ontario and a lake breeze often develops during the day. This wind brings cooler {{air at the}} surface and causes a marine temperature inversion which could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep the rotation aloft. To {{the west of the}} city, there is the Niagara Escarpment, reaching 1,500 feet above sea level, while the shores of Lake Ontario are just 250 feet ASL. This drop could equally have cut off the rotation from the surface.|$|E
500|$|Weatherill did {{not accept}} Whatton's defence.

25|$|In the mid-1960s, Donnelly {{decided to}} call for an {{alliance}} between the Labour Party and the Liberal Party. He also joined with another Labour MP, Woodrow Wyatt, to publicly oppose the Labour Party policy of nationalising the Steel industry; given the narrow majority which Wilson's government had in its first term, their opposition would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> vote down the plan, and any moves had to be postponed until after the 1966 election gave a landslide majority.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{assumption}} that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only within matter, was very problematic as shown by the Hammar experiment (1935). Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy metal pipe plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the evidence should not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> convict him, and that the summing up of the judge, John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, was prejudicial. On 20 May 1946, The Sentinel published a final piece of evidence {{not included in the}} trial, found by Mrs E. Smith, widow of the former coroner for South West London; it was a prescription for opium written in Palmer's handwriting, on the reverse of which was a chemist's bill for 10d worth of strychnine and opium.|$|E

25|$|Ennis won {{a bronze}} medal for England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia with a {{personal}} best score of 6,269points, improving her previous best total by more than 350points. Her high jump of 1.91metres would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> take the individual event gold medal. She achieved personal bests in the high jump, the 200m and the javelin.

25|$|While the {{buildings}} were designed to support enormous static loads, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the sections above the floors where the collapses initiated. Structural systems respond very differently to static and dynamic loads, and since {{the motion of the}} falling portion began as a free fall through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or 10feet), the structure beneath them was unable to stop the collapses once they began. Indeed, a fall of only half a meter (about 20inches) would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> release the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.|$|E

The two highest scoring candidates in each poll (who would hypothetically go through to the second round of voting) are highlighted, except for the Centro Nacional de Consultoría poll of Jan 17–Feb 7, 2014, where Santos' score of 51% would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win in the first round.|$|E
