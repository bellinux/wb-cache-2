5|$|The first {{international}} crisis Harrison faced arose from disputed <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> on the Alaskan coast. Canada claimed fishing and sealing rights around {{many of the}} Aleutian Islands, in violation of U.S. law. As a result, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships. In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings {{by the state}} and federal courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights.</b> In {{the event that the}} court would decide that the hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E

5|$|The Menominee Indian Tribe {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights.</b> In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E

5|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Louis F. Claiborne, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General.

Claiborne also argued that whatever regulatory rights which were held {{by the federal government}} were transferred to the state of Wisconsin by the termination act.|$|E

5|$|Sparked by the 1848 Whitman Massacre, {{a number}} of violent battles were fought between American {{settlers}} and the region's natives. The subsequent Indian Wars, especially the Yakima War, decimated the native population and removed much land from native control. As years progressed, the right of natives to fish along the Columbia became the central issue of contention with the states, commercial fishers, and private property owners. The US Supreme Court upheld <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> in landmark cases in 1905 and 1918, {{as well as the}} 1974 case United States v. Washington, commonly called the Boldt Decision.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> {{and drew the}} same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game.

5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>rights.</b> The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe had a right to assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E
5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E
5|$|Within ten years, {{another case}} arose, which dealt with <b>fishing</b> <b>rights</b> at Celilo Falls, a {{traditional}} Indian fishing location. Two brothers, Lineas and Audubon Winans, owned property {{on both sides}} of the Columbia River and obtained licenses from the state of Washington to operate four fish wheels. The wheels prevented a significant number of salmon from passing the location. Additionally, the Winans prohibited anyone, whether an Indian with treaty rights or otherwise, from crossing their land to get to the falls.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperSeto Inland Sea plays a {{significant}} role in Japanese coastal fisheries. The successful development coastal community based fishery management contributes in sustainable fisheries.

Fishermen comply rule and regulation settled by them, bottom up not top down. Participation from fishermen in adopting fishery management plan is the key factor. There can be transaction costs involve in adopting the Fisheries Coordination Scheme. Nevertheless this can be paid off by the long run benefit from the greater resource abundance and the optimum utilization of the available fishery resources. Fishermen can equally participate in community fishery management through being member of corresponding fishery cooperative. They have the common goal of optimum utilization fishery resource. The <b>fishing</b> <b>right</b> granted to fishery cooperative is fairly distributed among the members, transparently. System of election at each step supports this factor of equity.

This is mainly due to the granted <b>fishing</b> <b>right,</b> equity in right sharing system, and effective coordination among stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|In Swedish law, {{there is}} a strong {{protection}} for fish conservation applicable to land parcelling as a result of which fishing is divided. The provisions regarding the split of fishing, as found in FBL 3 : 8, represents a strong public interest and is legally binding for the <b>fishing</b> <b>right</b> holder. In short, this means that a <b>fish</b> <b>right</b> bounded to property may not be divided by land parcelling in a manner that cause problem of any significance for fish conservation. Lantmäteriet in its role as authority shall examine whether the division of fishing causes problems for fish conservation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how the authority interprets and applies FBL 3 : 8 when dividing fishing. To investigate this, a survey and interview survey was handed out to the authority. The result shows that the number of fish dividing cases differ between surveyors which affects how common they handle FBL 3 : 8. The study also showed that about every third fish case had not an investigation to FBL 3 : 8. The application of FBL 3 : 8 differs by province, but also between every single surveyor. In some areas the surveyors are very restrictive and in some other areas they find dividing of fishing acceptable in certain special situations.

Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case.

5|$|As river {{development}} {{continued in}} the 20thcentury, each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam, beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938.
