50|$|When Carroll came to Missouri, {{he complained}} of itchy legs, and was {{convinced}} that {{he was suffering from}} an allergy. After he was examined by several specialists, they came up with a considerably more serious diagnosis—liver disease. It was ultimately determined that Carroll would possibly need a liver transplant, but not for at least 20 years after his diagnosis and most likely after the end of any potential professional basketball career. His illness was revealed several weeks before the 2009 NBA <b>draft.</b> <b>At</b> 1:30 a.m. <b>on</b> July 5, 2007, Carroll was shot in the ankle during a domestic dispute at a nightclub in Columbia, Missouri.|$|R

50|$|Following {{religious}} riots {{which began}} at Perth, the Protestant Lords {{had taken up}} arms against Mary of Guise and the French troops that supported her rule in Scotland. The Lords occupied Edinburgh in June 1559, taking Holyroodhouse and seizing the coining equipment from the Scottish Mint. News came that Henry II of France had died, which cheered John Knox who supposed this might halt further French intervention. However, a Catholic army approached from Dunbar, and the Captain of Edinburgh Castle, Lord Erskine, declared for the Queen Regent. The French troops moved into Leith, which surrendered without resistance, {{in part due to}} the persuasion of Robert Logan of Restalrig. The Lords of the Congregation marshalled themselves at Craigengalt. Under these circumstances, they were compelled to seek terms and withdraw from Edinburgh, rather than fight a battle they could not win. The resultant articles of truce were <b>drafted</b> <b>at</b> Leith Links <b>on</b> 24 July 1559.|$|R
