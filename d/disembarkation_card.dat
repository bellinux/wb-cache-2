50|$|In early 2007, {{news of a}} Singaporean woman being {{jailed for}} failing to have her {{passport}} stamped when entering Malaysia threw the spotlight on the unusual clearance procedures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Singaporeans that their passports would not be stamped when departing for Malaysia by train, instead stamping a <b>disembarkation</b> <b>card,</b> {{which had to be}} retained until departure from Malaysia. The entry records were also entered into a computer system. Even then, this arrangement continued to present problems for some commuters.|$|E
5000|$|An arrival card, {{also known}} as an {{incoming}} passenger card, landing card or <b>disembarkation</b> <b>card,</b> is a legal document used by immigration authorities of many countries to obtain information about incoming passenger not provided by the passenger's passport (such as health, criminal record, {{where they will be}} staying, purpose of the visit, etc.) and to provide a record of a personâ€™s entry into the country. [...] The card may also provide information on health and character requirements for non-citizens entering the country. [...] Some countries require an arrival card for each incoming passenger, while others require one card per family unit, and some only require an arrival card for non-citizens only.|$|E
50|$|Two {{accompanying}} {{elements of}} hassle free travel are {{the use of}} common embarkation and <b>disembarkation</b> <b>cards</b> (E/D Cards), i.e. the forms which all persons entering member states are required to complete (commonly referred to as immigration forms/cards), {{and the establishment of}} common lines at ports of entry for citizens, residents and CARICOM nationals. These lines are in place in all member mtates apart from The Bahamas. In The Bahamas, people entering the country are free to use any line.|$|R
50|$|CARIPASS offers {{access to}} either the {{automatic}} immigration gate or the designated CARIPASS immigration lane. Random immigration compliance checks {{continue to be a}} policy practiced by immigration officials in all states, and this system is expected to reflect this international norm. In CARICOM, all travelers are still required to complete an Embarkation / <b>Disembarkation</b> (E/D) <b>card.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Between 1998 and 2011, {{foreigners who}} entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared {{electronically}} without their passports being stamped. The change {{was due to}} the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at Tanjong Pagar railway station in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to Woodlands Train Checkpoint near the actual Malaysia-Singapore border but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreigners were given <b>disembarkation</b> <b>cards</b> stamped with [...] "KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura" [...] and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the Johor Bahru railway station, where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreigners entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.|$|R
