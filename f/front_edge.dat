5|$|Termites are {{relatively}} poor fliers and are readily blown downwind in wind speeds {{of less than}} 2km/h, shedding their wings soon after landing at an acceptable site, where they mate and attempt to form a nest in damp timber or earth. Wings of most termites have three heavy veins along the basal part of the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the forewing and the crossveins near the wing tip are angled, making trapezoidal cells. Although subterranean termite wings have just two major veins along the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the forewing and the cross veins towards the wingtip are perpendicular to these veins, making square and rectangular cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading {{can be used to}} virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|Collector Heinrich Fischer had {{originally}} labeled a partial foot, from the Solnhofen area, {{as belonging to}} Compsognathus longipes. Though this identification was rejected by Wilhelm Barnim Dames in 1884, Friedrich von Huene nevertheless in 1925 provisionally referred the specimen to Compsognathus. However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus. These were not identical to those of C. longipes, having serrations on the <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> but were because of general similarities in form referred to a Compsognathus sp.|$|E
50|$|For all bachelor's degrees (e.g. BA, BSc, etc.) and {{integrated}} Masters (e.g. MPharm, MEng etc.) a black gown is worn, ending 12 inches (30 cm) from the ground. For all other master's degrees except MPhil (e.g. MSc, MBA), a black gown is worn, ending 8 inches (20 cm) from the ground, while for MPhil the gown {{is the same}} but also has facings of white silk 2.5 inches (6 cm) in width. For Doctoral degrees (e.g. PhD), the Doctor's black robe (a black Panama gown) is worn; the Doctor's robe has <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> and sleeves in white silk. The Chancellor's robe is of black silk with <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> and fringes of pale gold, while the Principal/Vice-Chancellor's gown is the same but with <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> and fringes in white. For higher doctorates (including honorary doctorate), the robe is scarlet with white <b>front</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|R

5|$|The third design, by George Ivatt, {{initially}} was Type 'C1' {{and it was}} paired with the three locomotives Nos. 6253–6255. It was partially riveted and resembled a Type 'A' at its front end and a Type 'B' at the rear. The design was quickly followed by Type 'C2', which differed from the 'C1' in {{that it had a}} lower <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> and was fitted with Timken roller bearings. Only two 'C2's were built and they were coupled to the last two of the class, Nos. 6256 and 6257.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is {{about as long as}} the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
500|$|Whittington {{interpreted}} as gills some markings {{on the upper}} surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate [...] "blades" [...] attached along the <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> that he {{interpreted as}} internal channels connecting the gills to {{the interior of the}} body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the [...] "gills" [...] and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.|$|R
50|$|Three minor Dalek {{variants}} {{appear in}} the film. Some Daleks are fitted with a two-jawed mechanical claw instead of a plunger, some have integrally moulded collars with reversed angles on the <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> and one is seen with a cutting torch instead of a telescopic arm.|$|R
50|$|The {{pigmentation}} of narwhals is a mottled pattern, with blackish-brown markings over a white background. They are darkest when {{born and}} become whiter with age; white patches develop on the navel and genital slit at sexual maturity. Old males may be almost pure white. Narwhals {{do not have}} a dorsal fin, possibly an evolutionary adaptation to swimming easily under ice. Their neck vertebrae are jointed, like those of land mammals, instead of being fused together as in most whales. Both these characteristics are shared by the beluga whale. The tail flukes of female narwhals have <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> that are swept back, and those of males have <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> that are more concave and lack a sweep-back. This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing drag caused by the tusk.|$|R
5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E

25|$|Lapels are {{the folded}} flaps of cloth {{on the front}} of a jacket or coat, and are most {{commonly}} found on formal clothing and suit jackets. Usually they are formed by folding over the <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric {{around the back of the}} neck.|$|R
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this hole is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E
5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, {{more than a quarter of}} the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 study {{established}} eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies {{in which}} Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the frontal bone make contact, the depression {{in which the}} supratemporal fenestra, a skull roof opening, was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion {{of the first and}} second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger.
