40|$|The {{temperature}} {{effect on}} current gain is presented for GalnP/GaAs heterojunction and heterostructure-emitter bipolar transistors (HBT's and HEBT's). Experimental {{results showed that}} the current gain of the HEBT increases with the increase of temperature in the temperature range of 25 - 125 °C and decreases slightly at temperatures above 150 °C. The smaller the collector current, the larger is the positive differential temperature coefficient. At high current levels, the current gain dependence on temperature is significantly reduced. On the other hand, a large negative coefficient is observed in the HBT in all current range. This finding indicates that the HEBT is a better candidate than the HBT for power devices. © 1999 IEEE Publisher <b>Item</b> <b>Identifier</b> S 0018 - 9383 (99) 00257 - 9. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} group testing model for items {{characterized}} by marker random variables. An item is defined {{to be good}} (bad) if its marker is below (above) a given threshold. The items can be tested in groups; {{the goal is to}} obtain a prespecified number of <b>good</b> <b>items</b> by testing them in optimally sized groups. Besides this group size, the controller has to select a threshold value for the group marker sums, and the target number of groups which by the tests are classified to consist only of <b>good</b> <b>items.</b> These decision variables have to be chosen so as to minimize a cost function, which is a linear combination of the expected number of group tests and an expected penalty for missing the desired number of <b>good</b> <b>items,</b> subject to constraints on the probabilities of misclassifications. We study two models of this kind: the first one is based on an infinite population size, while the second one is a two-stage model for a finite number of available items. All cost functionals are derived in closed form and bounds and approximations are also given. In several examples the dependence of the cost function on the decision variables is studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} years, {{there have been}} several {{improvements}} in lossless image compression. All the recently proposed state-of-the-art lossless Image compressors can be roughly divided into two categories: single and double-pass compressors. Linear prediction is rarely used in the first category, while TMW [7], a state-of-the-art double-pass image compressor, relies on linear prediction for its performance. We propose a single-pass adaptive algorithm that uses context classification and multiple linear predictors, locally optimized on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Locality is also exploited in the entropy coding of the prediction error. The results we obtained on a test set of several standard images are encouraging. On the average, our ALPC obtains a compression ratio comparable to CALIC [20] while improving on some images. © 2000 IEEE Publisher <b>item</b> <b>Identifier</b> S 0018 - 9219 (00) 09992 - 8...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{complexity and}} dynamics of logistic processes is creating significant new {{challenges for the}} management of goods transport. This is leading to increased requirements for the routing of goods and transport vehicles in order to adapt to the dynamics of the changing logistics environment. Current practice of vehicle and goods routing is based on centralised planning and control. This approach is now rapidly becoming too inflexible and complex for maintaining efficient goods transport. In this paper we introduce a novel routing process which implements distributed decision making among transport vehicles, <b>goods</b> <b>items,</b> and other entities in a logistic transport network. The proposed approach enables packages (<b>goods</b> <b>items)</b> and transport vehicles to find their routes autonomously whilst reacting to dynamic changes in their environment. I...|$|R

40|$|A {{new theory}} is {{developed}} {{in this paper}} to explain the collapse of current gain in multifinger power AlGaAs/GaAs Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBT's). The reasons behind this unwanted phenomenon are fully clarified using a simple model to investigate the thermoelectrical interaction between the fingers. The existence of multivalue equilibrium points in model's constitutive equations is shown to be the necessary condition for the collapse of current gain to appear. For a N finger device,Y different patterns of collapse exist. The criterion to select the global stable pattern is given. The method {{has been used to}} predict the collapse in AlGaAs/GaAs HBT's and the agreement is excellent. The method also predicts that the collapse can happen far earlier than is normally expected in multifinger highpower devices. The influence of ballasting resistance and thermal resistance is also investigated. © 1996 IEEE Publisher <b>Item</b> <b>Identifier</b> S 00189383 (96) 07709 X...|$|R
