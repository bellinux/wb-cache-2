5|$|The {{great spotted cuckoo}} (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
50|$|Mammalian fauna {{includes}} wolves, bears, wild boars, foxes, hares, badgers and <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> some {{of which}} are declared rare and endangered in Serbia.|$|R
50|$|In October 2008, 21 {{species of}} mammals were {{recorded}} on the island. They included, in Belgrade rarely seen, otters, nutrias, weasels and <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rare mammals in {{the park}} include stoats (Mustela erminea), {{mountain}} hares (Lepus timidus), <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes martes) and European snow voles (Microtus nivalis), as well as wolves (coming from Roya valley) and wildcats (Felis silvestris).|$|R
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{the eastern}} gray {{squirrel}} is not regulated by natural predators, {{other than the}} <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> which is generally absent from England and Wales. This has aided its rapid population growth and {{has led to the}} species being classed as a pest. Measures are being devised to reduce its numbers, including one plan for celebrity television chefs to promote the idea of eating the squirrels. In areas where relict populations of red squirrels survive, such as the islands of Anglesey and Brownsea, programs exist to eradicate gray squirrels in an effort to allow red squirrel populations to recover.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} part of the range, which is also the highest one, is protected by the Pirin National Park, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Pirin is noted for its rich flora and fauna, {{as well as for the}} presence of a number of relict species. Much of the area is forested, with some of the best preserved conifer woods in Bulgaria, holding important populations of the Balkan endemic species Macedonian pine, Bosnian pine and Bulgarian fir. Animals include many species of high conservation value, such as brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> wild boar, red deer, roe deer, chamois, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebrate}} fauna of Pirin {{consists of}} 229 species. The mammal species are 45 and include brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois. The {{total number of}} bird species is 159, including three relicts— boreal owl, white-backed woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, {{and a number of}} birds of pray, such as lesser spotted eagle, booted eagle, golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, saker falcon, peregrine falcon, etc. There are 11 reptile, 8 amphibian and 6 fish species. The number of invertebrate species discovered so far is 2091 but they remain poorly studied and are expected to rise to 4500.|$|E
50|$|The Rodope montane mixed {{forests are}} {{sanctuary}} {{to a number}} of endangered mammal species, such as brown bears, wolves, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> <b>European</b> otters, wildcats and chamois. More common large mammals include roe deer, wild boars and foxes.|$|R
50|$|Their {{habitats}} {{are usually}} well-wooded areas. <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> usually {{make their own}} dens in hollow trees or scrub-covered fields. Martens are the only mustelids with semi-retractable claws. This enables them to lead more arboreal lifestyles, such as climbing or running on tree branches, although they are also relatively quick runners on the ground. They are mainly active at night and dusk. They have small rounded, highly sensitive ears and sharp teeth adapted for eating small mammals, birds, insects, frogs, and carrion. They have also been known to eat berries, birds' eggs, meat, nuts and honey. <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> are territorial animals that mark their range by depositing feces (called 'scats') in prominent locations. These scats are black and twisted and can be confused {{with those of the}} fox, except that they reputedly have a floral odor.|$|R
50|$|The town is mountainous, {{with the}} Piatra Mare {{mountains}} to the north, the Bucegi {{mountains to the}} southwest and the Postăvarul Massif to the northwest. The woods around Predeal have a rich and diversified fauna, including {{a high number of}} wild boars, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> bears, foxes, gray wolves, deer, squirrels, rabbits, badgers and heather cocks.|$|R
25|$|Rila Monastery Nature Park is {{inhabited}} by 202 vertebrate species. There are 52 species of mammals. The number of bats species is 15, or 50% {{of the diversity}} in Bulgaria and 45% in Europe. There are 20 species of small mammals: 9 Insectivora, 1 Lagomorpha and 13 Rodentia. Of them the European snow vole is a relict. The large mammals include 13 Carnivora and 4 Artiodactyla species. The most typical mammals in the park are the grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, brown bear, European badger, European polecat, European otter, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> beech marten, wildcat, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 235 {{vertebrate}} {{species were}} identified {{within the boundaries}} of the park, of which 200 are threatened or under protection. These include three species of bat under pressure (of the eight that exist): greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Mediterranean horseshoe bat (Rhinoloplus euryale). Other species of particular importance: the Iberian shrew (Sorex granarius), the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes martes), the wildcat (Felis silvestris), the gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica) and the snub-nosed viper (Vipera latastei). A few of the local species are protected by the Bern Convention. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) whose habitat is restricted and marginal in continental Portugal, is another species that is common to the park. After four centuries absent from Portuguese territory, its population began to be recorded in 1985-1986, in Viana do Castelo. There were also registered sightings in Albergaria, Lamas de Mouro and Serra da Paneda, while comparable encounters in Spain were identified across the border. Roe deer, which are a symbol of the park are encountered in prolific quantity, along the margins of the park, where they find shelter and food.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E
50|$|In Russia, the sable's {{distribution}} is largely {{the result of}} mass reintroductions involving 19,000 animals from 1940 to 1965. Their range extends northward to the limit of trees, and extends southward to 55-60° latitude in western Siberia, and 42° in the mountainous areas of eastern Asia. Their western distribution encompasses the Ural mountains, where they are sympatric with <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b> They are also found on Sakhalin.|$|R
50|$|Stelvio National Park {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of {{wildlife}} including chamois, alpine ibex, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, red foxes, stoats, least weasels, red squirrels, alpine marmots, mountain hares, Eurasian badgers, beech <b>martens,</b> <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens,</b> <b>European</b> mole, hazel grouse, lammergeiers, ravens, carrion crow, great spotted woodpeckers, black woodpeckers, buzzards, nutcrackers, Eurasian dotterels, rock partridges, western capercaillies, Eurasian eagle-owls and golden eagles.|$|R
50|$|The {{environment}} of the metropolitan city varies with altitude in both temperature and precipitation. In the municipality of Pula, for example, the coastal plain has an annual average rainfall of about 450 mm, while the mountains (Is Cannoneris, about 800 meters above sea level) have more than 1200 mm. The forests are populated by Sardinian deer (Cervus elaphus corsicanus), now saved from near-extinction, the fallow deer, reintroduced after its extinction from the area, wild boars, foxes, and <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The park {{is home to}} {{many species}} of mammal {{characteristic}} to northern Sweden, in particular the Eurasian lynx (...) and the brown bear (...) , considered endangered in the country. Besides these two species, one can find the red fox (...) , the European badger (...) , the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> (...) , the moose (...) , the Eurasian beaver (...) , the grey seal (...) , and the muskrat (...) [...] One can also find small mammals, such as the Eurasian red squirrel (...) , the American mink (...) and the stoat (...) [...] The territory of the lynx is much more vast than the park itself, which is therefore not sufficient to protect these animals. Indeed, the population of lynx {{in the region is}} decreasing, probably because of habitat fragmentation as a result of European route E4.|$|E
2500|$|The park is host to {{many species}} of mammals. The most {{widespread}} are the moose, the roe deer, the mountain hare, the red fox, and the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> Since the 1980s, one can also see Eurasian beaver near the islands of Torrön and Ängsön as well as near Gysinge. In 2008, it was similarly found that the wild boar was wont to settle the park. More rarely, one sees also the wood lemming in the north part of the park. Four species of mammals present in the park are considered endangered in Sweden. Thus, the Eurasian lynx [...] can be observed regularly around Öbyhalvön, Tinäset and Gärdsvekarna, alongside brown bears and gray wolves, although these are less frequent. The three other endangered species are the European otter that one can see near the rapids, and two species of bats, the pond bat, very rare in Sweden) and the common noctule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> {{is known}} {{to live on the}} island.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} preyed upon {{occasionally}} by golden eagles, red foxes, wolves and wildcats, humans {{are the largest}} threat to <b>pine</b> <b>martens.</b> They are vulnerable from conflict with humans, arising from predator control for other species, or following predation of livestock {{and the use of}} inhabited buildings for denning. Martens may also be affected by woodland loss. Persecution (illegal poisoning and shooting) by gamekeepers, loss of habitat leading to fragmentation, and other human disturbance have caused a considerable decline in the <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> population. They are also prized for their very fine fur in some areas. In the United Kingdom, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> and their dens are offered full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.|$|R
50|$|Mammalian predators {{known to}} take {{capercaillie}} include Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and gray wolf (Canis lupus), although they prefer slightly larger prey. Meanwhile, <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes martes), beech martens (Martes foina), brown bears (Ursus arctos), wild boars (Sus scrofa) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) take mostly eggs and chicks but can attack adults if {{they manage to}} ambush the often weary birds. In Sweden, western capercaillies are the primary prey of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). Large numbers are taken by northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), including adults but usually young ones, and Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) will occasionally pick off a capercaillie of any age or size; they normally prefer mammalian foods. White-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) {{are more likely to}} take water birds than upland-type birds but have been recorded preying on capercaillie around the White Sea.|$|R
50|$|The large predators include brown bears, wolves, and wolverines. Ten {{mustelid}} species {{make the}} reserve their home, from the largest, the wolverine, to the least weasel, {{as well as}} the ermine, the American and <b>European</b> mink, the <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> the sable, and the Siberian weasel.|$|R
50|$|Other species {{found in}} the park include foxes, badgers, and the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Burren {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{breeding}} areas in Ireland of the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b>|$|E

40|$|Especially in {{urbanized}} landscapes, habitat {{fragmentation and}} {{increasing numbers of}} infrastructural features may limit genetic exchange among wildlife populations. Yet, whether this results in genetic differentiation among individuals in different habitat fragments will depend on both the species studied and {{the composition of the}} landscape. <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes martes) show clear spatial structure at a Europe-wide scale, but whether gene flow among habitat patches can be maintained at a more local scale in intensively urbanized areas remained unclear. Here, we analysed genotypic data from 270 <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> sampled from locations scattered across the Netherlands, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Using Bayesian clustering models we show that most likely maximum two large subpopulations exist in the Netherlands. We observed relatively low levels of genetic differentiation and genetic evidence of regular long-distance dispersal by juveniles that must have crossed one or multiple major highways. Our results suggest that genetic exchange among Dutch <b>pine</b> <b>martens</b> has, until 2010, not been impacted severely by the countries’ dense infrastructural network. Furthermore this species seems to have maintained its genetic diversity despite a recent demographic bottleneck. These conclusions support the idea that the effects of habitat fragmentation may strongly differ between (groups of) species, and that prioritization and optimization of management decisions thus requires direct study of the targeted species...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the "forest-specialist" <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> Martes martes {{has been}} {{reported}} to also occur also in largely fragmented, lowland landscapes of north-western Italy. The colonization of such an apparently unsuitable area provided the opportunity for investigating <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> ecological requirements and predicting its potential south- and eastwards expansion. We collected available <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> occurrence data in the flood plain of the River Po (N Italy) and relate them to 11 environmental variables by developing nine Species Distribution Models. To account for inter-model variability we used average ensemble predictions (EP). EP predicted a total of 482 suitable patches (8. 31 % of the total study area) for the <b>pine</b> <b>marten.</b> The main factors driving <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> occurrence in the western River Po plain were the distance from watercourses and the distance from woods. EP suggested that the <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> may further expand in the western lowland, whilst the negligible residual wood cover of large areas in the central and eastern plain makes the habitat unsuitable for the <b>pine</b> <b>marten,</b> except for some riparian corridors and the pine wood patches bordering the Adriatic coast.

Because of its shorter limbs, the beech marten's manner of locomotion differs from that of the pine marten; the beech marten moves by creeping in a polecat-like manner, whereas the <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> and sable move by bounds. The weight load per 1 cm2 of the supporting surface of the beech marten's foot (30.9 gm) is double that of the <b>pine</b> <b>marten</b> (15.2 gm), thus it is obliged to avoid snowy regions.|$|R
