5|$|Triton and Nereid are unusual <b>irregular</b> {{satellites}} {{and are thus}} treated separately from the other five <b>irregular</b> Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer <b>irregular</b> satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known <b>irregular</b> moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost {{an order of magnitude}} larger than all other known <b>irregular</b> moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known <b>irregular</b> moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the most}} eccentric orbits of any known <b>irregular</b> satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly perfect circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known <b>irregular</b> satellite.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine <b>irregular</b> moons, which orbit it at a {{distance}} much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the <b>irregular</b> moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those <b>irregular</b> moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|<b>Irregular</b> {{galaxies are}} chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About {{a quarter of}} all galaxies are <b>irregular,</b> and the {{peculiar}} shapes of such galaxies {{may be the result of}} gravitational interaction.|$|E

5|$|The HDF galaxies {{contained}} a considerably {{larger proportion of}} disturbed and <b>irregular</b> galaxies than the local universe; galaxy collisions and mergers were {{more common in the}} young universe as it was much smaller than today.

5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly <b>irregular</b> outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when its wings are closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, and <b>irregular</b> outer margins to the wings.|$|E
5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small <b>irregular</b> moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. <b>Irregular</b> moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes entire tribal {{armies of}} <b>irregulars</b> {{were brought in}} from {{internal}} native or neighboring cultures, especially ones that still had an active hunting tradition to provide the basic training of <b>irregulars.</b> The regulars would only provide the core military in the major battles; <b>irregulars</b> would provide all other combat duties.|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>irregulars</b> can {{excel at}} many other combat duties besides main-line combat, such as scouting, skirmishing, harassing, pursuing, rear-guard actions, cutting supply, sabotage, raids, ambushes and {{underground}} resistance. Experienced <b>irregulars</b> often surpass the regular army in these functions. By avoiding formal battles, <b>irregulars</b> have sometimes harassed high quality armies to destruction.|$|R

50|$|On 22 November 1880 Ottoman forces under {{command of}} Dervish Pasha crossed river Bojana near village Klezna and near Šas lake came to small unit of Albanian <b>irregulars</b> that blocked the road. The Ottomans first fired their guns into air, {{wounding}} several <b>irregulars</b> by wandering bullets who fired {{back and the}} battle began. During the night Albanian <b>irregulars</b> received reinforcements of 500 men. According to works of Montenegrin king Nikola I Petrović, Albanian <b>irregulars</b> fled as soon as Ottomans entered Ulcinj district, with public statements claiming {{that they did not}} surrender Ulcinj without a battle.|$|R

These militia forces played an important role again incontrolling ingress-egress to Anatolia and providing safe passage of volunteers and army officerswho will join the National Movement. These militia forces and battalions were in close relationswith National Movement during their action and later with Ankara Government.

5|$|In {{order of}} their {{distance}} from the planet, the <b>irregular</b> moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso, a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects.

5|$|Inward of Triton {{are seven}} small regular satellites, {{all of which}} have {{prograde}} orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among Neptune's rings. The largest of them is Proteus. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer <b>irregular</b> satellites other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an <b>irregular</b> satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. The two outermost Neptunian <b>irregular</b> satellites, Psamathe and Neso, have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.|$|E
