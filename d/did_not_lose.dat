5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E

5|$|The 1948 Australia {{team that}} toured England {{has become known}} as The Invincibles, because they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a single game.

After defeating the Hudson Valley Quickstrike Lady Blues 4–0 in the championship semi-final in which Holiday scored a goal in the 65th minute, the Pali Blues clinched the championship title in a 2–1 defeat of the Washington Freedom Reserves on August 7, 2009.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2006, the {{organisation}} declared a ceasefire, and conversations between Batasuna, ETA and the Basque and Spanish governments started. Peace talks ended in December, when ETA broke the truce {{with a massive}} car bomb at the Madrid-Barajas Airport. ETA officially ended the ceasefire in 2007 and resumed its attacks around Spain. At the same time, dozens of members were arrested by Spanish and French police. Despite that, {{the organisation}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> the capacity of carrying out attacks.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a {{match at}} Anfield during the 1893–94, 1970–71, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1987–88, and 2008–09 seasons. They won all their home games during the 1893–94 season. Liverpool's longest unbeaten streak at home {{extended}} from January 1978 to January 1981, a period encompassing 85 games, in which Liverpool scored 212 goals and conceded 35. Liverpool's worst losing streak at Anfield is three games. This has occurred {{three times in}} the club's history to date (1899–1900, 1906–07 and 1908–09 seasons).|$|E
5|$|In the African American {{section of}} the city, where most {{dwellings}} were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> either their walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling down the streets. During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while the building itself was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E

5|$|Promotional {{activities}} halted after G-Dragon {{tested positive}} for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
5|$|The next year, England {{completed}} another Grand Slam and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> that year, {{including a}} victory over the Springboks. In the lead up to the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, England completed another Grand Slam – their third in five years. In the World Cup, England defeated Argentina, Italy and Samoa in pool play and then defeated Australia 25–22 in their quarter-final. England's semi-final was dominated by the All Blacks and featured four tries, now worth five points each, by Jonah Lomu; England lost 45–29. They then lost the third/fourth place play-off match against France.|$|E
5|$|Wigan Warriors {{moved to}} the stadium a month after it opened, once they had played their final home game of the 1999 regular season at Central Park, which had been the club's home since 1902. After their former ground was sold, the {{possibility}} of ground sharing with Bolton Wanderers F.C. at the Reebok Stadium (now Macron Stadium) was presented, but the new stadium in Wigan was chosen instead. Their first game there was a play-off match against Castleford Tigers, which they lost, on 19 September. The Warriors <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a competitive match at the stadium in 2001.|$|E

5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1989, the Giants entered the 1990 season as a Super Bowl favorite, though most {{believed}} they stood little chance of stopping the 49ers. The Giants began {{the season with a}} 27–20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, then won their next nine games before losing a rematch to Philadelphia 31–13 in Week 12. The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and to the Bills at home in the regular season before defeating both teams in playoff rematches. In the Week 15 game against Buffalo, starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot. He was replaced by Hostetler, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a game. The Giants' defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (211), and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers in the regular season. After the season, six Giants were selected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's 30-game unbeaten streak {{during the}} 1920–21 season stood as a Football League record for 83 years {{until it was}} surpassed by Arsenal, who {{completed}} the entire season without losing in the 2003–04 campaign. After the defeat to Bradford City on 28 August 1920, Burnley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> another match at Turf Moor until 11 February 1922, when they were beaten 1–2 by Blackburn Rovers. In the same match, the halfback line of Tommy Boyle, George Halley and Billy Watson—used in 25 first-team games during 1920–21—was seen for the final time, having played {{together for the first}} time in September 1913. The majority of the championship-winning team remained intact going into the 1921–22 season, although players such as David Taylor and Walter Weaver found themselves less involved in first-team matches.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E

5|$|Recently, however, {{scholars}} such as David Christian and Constantine Zuckerman {{have suggested}} that the Schechter Letter's account is corroborated by various other Russian chronicles, and suggests a struggle within the early Rus' polity between factions loyal to Oleg and to the Rurikid Igor, a struggle that Oleg ultimately lost. Zuckerman posited that the early chronology of the Rus' had to be re-determined in light of these sources. Among Zuckerman's beliefs and those of others who have analyzed these sources are that the Khazars <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> Kiev until the early 10th century (rather than 882, the traditional date), that Igor was not Rurik's son but rather a more distant descendant, and that Oleg did not immediately follow Rurik, but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary Varangian lord and his documented successors.|$|E
5|$|Returning to ECCW, Juggernaut {{defeated}} Moondog Manson on February 9, 2001 {{to win the}} ECCW Hardcore Championship.

In 2002, he defeated former Extreme Championship Wrestling World Heavyweight Champion Tommy Dreamer. In 2005, he won his sixth and final NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship by defeating Scotty Mac. He held the belt until January 27, 2006, when he dropped it to Sweet Daddy Devastation. Later that year, he teamed with TJ Wilson to win the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship. They <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> the belts, but {{they were forced to}} vacate the title when Wilson left the promotion to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment. Meanwhile, he continued to wrestle overseas, competing in such countries as India, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei.|$|E
