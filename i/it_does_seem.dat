5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E

25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesn’t need awareness, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E

25|$|In June 2004 {{the first}} {{performances}} for about 70 years {{took place in}} the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for {{more than a couple of}} hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed in the early part of the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove {{had been completely}} abandoned, {{one of the most}} violent conflicts between British forces and Australian Aborigines is alleged to have occurred. The facts of this event are still disputed by historians and the descendants of the Tasmanian Aborigines, however, it is alleged that on the morning of 3 May 1804, a food hunting party of approximately three hundred crested the heavily wooded hills above the Risdon Cove settlement, looking for kangaroo, in what is now considered {{to be part of the}} Oyster Bay tribe's traditional hunting grounds. It is supposed that both the Marine sentries, and the hunting party surprised each other. It is not clear how the engagement began, with differing accounts being given. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> that, feeling threatened by such an overwhelmingly large group, the Marines fired upon the Aborigines in an unprovoked attack. A convict by the name of Edward White claimed to have seen this. Armed with only spears and clubs, the Aboriginals were outdone by the firepower of the Marines who were armed with the Brown Bess smooth bore, muzzle loading musket, many of whom were experienced troops from conflicts in India and the Americas. It is claimed that between three and fifty of the Aboriginals were killed.|$|E
25|$|The Aleksandr Pushkin entered {{service in}} 1965 with the Baltic Shipping Company, {{one of the}} three {{principal}} Soviet passenger shipping companies (the other two being the Black Sea Shipping Company and the Far Eastern Shipping Company). Reports about her service in the Soviet fleet are fragmentary and conflicting. Most sources state she was used to inaugurate the Baltic Shipping Company's regular trans-Atlantic service between Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Leningrad, and later on used for cruising. Other sources give a more detailed, but somewhat conflicting, accounts. Philip Dawson's book The Liner - Retrospective & Renaissance gives the full route as Leningrad—Helsinki—Copenhagen—London (Tilbury)—Quebec City—Montreal, in addition to which the ship was used for cruising from Montreal to Saint Pierre and Miquelon, The Bahamas and Cuba during the summer months. According to the book, the ship carried just 36 passengers on her first transatlantic crossing. According to Cruisepage.com, she spent only the summer months on Leningrad—Montreal service, {{while the rest of the}} year she was used either on crossing from Leningrad to Havana, Cuba or cruising under charter to western companies. Fakta om Fartyg offers a somewhat different account, stating that the ship originally entered service as a cruise ship in 1965, only moving to the Leningrad—Montreal route in April 1966, then spending summers from 1967 until 1979 in Leningrad—Bremerhaven—Montreal route and the rest of the year cruising, and from 1979 exclusively on cruise traffic. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> likely the ship called in Helsinki and London on her transatlantic crossings, as according to an article in Helsingin Sanomat the Alexandr Pushkin was popular amongst Finnish passengers sailing to London and Canada; she was the only ship offering crossings from Finland to Canada and the only liner in Helsinki—London service at the time.|$|E

However <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> that Staunton was involved in more than his fair share of chess disputes. H. J. R. Murray suggested that these frequent wars of words may have originated from leading players' and commentators' jealousy over Staunton's unexpected rise to the top in the early 1840s, and from snobbish disdain about his humble and possibly illegitimate birth. Saidy and Lessing wrote that, [...] "He can hardly be blamed if the struggles and privations of his youth warped his character so that he became a jealous, suspicious, and vitriolic man." ...|$|E

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time.

Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E
500|$|Operation Ursula (named {{after the}} {{daughter}} of Karl Dönitz) saw a group of German U-boats active around the waters near Spain against the Spanish Republican Navy, under the overall command of Hermann Boehm (Konteradmiral since 1934, and Vizeadmiral since April 1, 1937) in Berlin. It began on 20 November 1936, with the movement of [...] and [...] from Wilhelmshaven. Any identification marks were obscured, and the whole mission was kept secret. They entered the Mediterranean {{on the night of}} 27–28 November, taking over from Italian submarine patrols. If damaged, they were to sail to La Maddelena, and enter under an Italian ensign. U-33 operated around Alicante, and U-34 around Cartagena. Difficulties in identifying legitimate targets and concerns about discovery limited their operations. The torpedoes they used also often malfunctioned. During their return to Wilhelmshaven in December, the Spanish Republican submarine C-3 was sunk; the Germans claimed this was due to a torpedo fired from U-34, although the Republicans' enquiry claimed its loss was due to an internal explosion. Their return marked the official end of Operation Ursula. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> that further submarines were sent in mid-1937, but details of the operation are not known; six (U-25, U-26, U-27, U-28, U-31 and U-35) are believed to have been involved. Five submarine commanders received the Spanish Cross in Bronze without Swords in 1939.|$|E
