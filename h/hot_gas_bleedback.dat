We find that the L_X-L_K {{relationship}} is steeper for field galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. The low <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content of field galaxies with L_K < L_star suggests that internal processes such as supernovae driven winds or AGN feedback expel <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> from low mass galaxies. Such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusters where the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confine outflowing material. In addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be able to accrete gas from the ambient medium. While there is a population of L_K < L_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos, some galaxies in these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid of <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> In these cases, the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos have likely been removed via ram pressure stripping.

In contrast, the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content of more isolated galaxies is largely a function of the mass of the galaxy, with more massive galaxies able to maintain their halos, while in lower mass systems the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> escapes in outflowing winds.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} operating performance for a novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method for air source heat pumps (ASHPs). Firstly, a description of both an experimental prototype ASHP unit where the novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method may be realized, and its operating modes are presented. This is followed by reporting an experimental set up for testing the defrosting performance of the prototype ASHP unit using the novel thermal energy storage (TES) based reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method. Finally, experimental results are presented and discussed. The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the defrosting time by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the compressor's suction pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method. In addition, when the TES based reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method was used, the mean indoor coil surface temperature during defrosting was about 25 K higher than that when the traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method was used. These results suggested that as compared to the use of the traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method, the use of the novel TES based defrosting method would enable a quicker space heating resumption, impacting less on indoor thermal environment due to defrosting.

We use various models for the <b>hot</b> halo <b>gas</b> to study how the expected SZE signals are affected by gas fraction, equation of state, halo concentration and cosmology. Comparing the model predictions with the sensitivities expected from the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck surveys shows that a SPT-like survey can provide stringent constraints on the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> properties for haloes with masses M 1013 h− 1 M.

40|$|The {{measured}} emission-weighted metal {{abundance of}} the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in early-type galaxies {{has been known}} to be lower than theoretical expectations for 20 years. In addition, both X-ray luminosity and metal abundance vary significantly among galaxies of similar optical luminosities. This suggests some missing factors in the galaxy evolution process, especially the metal enrichment process. With Chandra and XMM-Newton, we studied 32 early-type galaxies (kT ≲ 1 keV) covering a span of two orders of L_X, gas/L_K to investigate these missing factors. Contrary to previous studies that X-ray faint galaxies show extremely low Fe abundance (∼ 0. 1 Z_), nearly all galaxies in our sample show an Fe abundance at least 0. 3 Z_, although the measured Fe abundance difference between X-ray faint and X-ray bright galaxies remains remarkable. We investigated whether this dichotomy of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundances can be related to the dilution of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> by mixing with cold gas. With a subset of 24 galaxies in this sample, we find that there is virtually no correlation between <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundances and their atomic gas content, which disproves the scenario that the low metal abundance of X-ray faint galaxies might be a result of the dilution of the remaining <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> by pristine atomic gas. In contrast, we demonstrate a negative correlation between the measured <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundance and the ratio of molecular <b>gas</b> mass to <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> mass, although it is unclear what is responsible for this apparent anti-correlation.

However, the {{expected}} super-solar iron abundance of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> is not observed. Instead, X-ray observations often show decreasing iron abundance toward galactic central regions, where the Ia SN enrichment {{is expected to be the}} highest. We examine the cause of this missing iron problem by studying the enrichment process and its effect on X-ray abundance measurements of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> The evolution of Ia SN iron ejecta is simulated in the context of galaxy-wide <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> outflows, in both supersonic and subsonic cases, as may be expected for <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in galactic bulges or elliptical galaxies of intermediate masses. SN reverse-shock heated iron ejecta is typically found to have a very high temperature and low density, hence producing little X-ray emission. Such hot ejecta, driven by its large buoyancy, can quickly reach a substantially higher outward velocity than the ambient medium, which is dominated by mass loss from evolved stars. The ejecta is gradually and dynamically mixed with the medium at large galactic radii. The ejecta is also slowly diluted and cooled by insitu mass injection from evolved stars. These processes together naturally result in the observed positive gradient in the average radial iron abundance distribution of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> even if mass-weighted. This trend is in addition to the X-ray measurement bias that tends to underestimate the iron abundance for the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> with a temperature distribution.

40|$|Within protogalaxies, thermal {{instability}} {{leads to the}} formation of a population of cool fragments, confined by the pressure of residual <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> remains in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, at approximately the virial temperature of the dark matter halo. It is heated by compression and shock dissipation and is cooled by bremsstrahlung emission and conductive losses into the cool clouds. The cool fragments are photoionized and heated by the extragalactic UV background and nearby massive stars. The smallest clouds are evaporated due to conductive heat transfer from the <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> All are subject to disruption due to hydrodynamic instabilities. They also gain mass due to collisions and mergers and condensation from the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> due to conduction. The size distribution of the fragments in turn determines the rate and efficiency of star formation during the early phase of galactic evolution. We have performed one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the <b>hot</b> and cool <b>gas.</b> The cool clouds are assumed to follow a power-law size distribution, and fall into the galactic potential, subject to drag from the <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> The relative amounts of the <b>hot</b> and cool <b>gas</b> is determined by the processes discussed above, and star formation occurs at a rate sufficient to maintain the cool clouds at 10 $^ 4 $ K.
