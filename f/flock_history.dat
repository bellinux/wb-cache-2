40|$|Abstract. Concurrent {{infection}} with peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and pestivirus was diagnosed in stillborn twin lambs. With the <b>flock</b> <b>history,</b> {{the findings of}} epidermal syncytial cells and necrotizing bronchitis/bronchiolitis prompted testing for PPRV infection, and PPRV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the skin, lungs, kidneys, rumen, and thymus. Macroscopic anomalies that were typical of border disease included scoliosis, brachygnathism, prognathism, arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, and hairy fleece; pestiviral antigen was detected by IHC in the brain, liver, lungs, and kidneys. Tissues from both lambs were positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PPRV and pestivirus. To the authors’ knowledge, PPR has not been reported previously as a congenital infection or in combination with pestiviral infection.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{digitally}} archived on behalf of Meat & Livestock Australia Limited by the Sydney eScholarship Repository at the University of Sydney Library. Pooled faecal culture (PFC) has been proposed as a screening test for testing sheep populations {{as part of the}} NOJDP as it provides the potential for significant savings for the NOJDP compared with serological testing. Doubts having arisen about the specificity and robustness of the technique and its performance in areas of Australia outside New South Wales, it was deemed necessary to have the PFC undertaken in several laboratories, drawing samples from flocks from a variety of regions (in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland) with both positive and negative status. PFC testing was effectively performed in participating laboratories as indicated by ANQAP proficiency testing and the results of the field evaluation, including the testing of positive and negative controls. PFC was found to have the anticipated high sensitivity for detecting infected flocks with only one known infected flock with negative results in the trial.

40|$|Well {{known as}} the cause of {{necrotic}} enteritis, C. perfringens (CP) is now recognized as causing a spectrum of effects including subclinical infection, mild disease with focal intestinal necrosis, diarrhoeal illness and liver disease, as well as the classic form of acute fulminant necrotizing enteritis. The mild and subclinical forms of infection appear to be widespread, and, possibly increasing in incidence. Furthermore, bacterial enteritis is increasingly being recognized less as an invasion by pathogenic organisms per se and more as an expression of the normal process by which the intestinal bacterial population changes over time in response to changes in the intestinal environment. Such shifts in enteric bacterial populations have been referred to as dysbacteriosis. Management of the microbial ecology of the intestinal tract is therefore an important element of preventing disease, enhancing performance, and preventing foodborne illness. Diagnosis of emerging forms of bacterial enteritis including CP infection can be challenging and involves a comprehensive analysis of <b>flock</b> <b>history</b> and condemnation records, clinical signs, gross and histopathology, bacterial culture and empirical response to treatment, augmented by molecular techniques where available.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii infection in sheep and goat <b>flocks</b> with a <b>history</b> of abortion in different areas of Iran. One thousand and one hundred ovine and 180 caprine samples from 43 sheep and goat flocks in four counties located in the Northeast (Mashhad), Central (Isfahan), Western (Arak), and Southwest (Shiraz) Iran were collected randomly between March 2011 and April 2012. The CHEKIT Q fever ELISA kit was used to identify specific antibodies against C. burnetii in sheep and goats. The results showed that the overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii in sheep and goats was 19. 5 % and 27. 2 %, respectively. There was a significant difference in seropositivity between sheep and goats (P< 0. 05). Central Iran significantly had the highest prevalence among the studied areas, especially in goat coxiellosis (23. 8 % and 40. 8 % in sheep and goats, respectively). The lowest prevalence in sheep was 12. 8 % in Northeast Iran while in Western Iran C. burnetii antibodies were absent in goats. The higher prevalence of Q fever in Central Iran may be partly due to persistent favourable conditions to spread C. burnetii in this area including drought and dust storms that originated from neighbouring Iraq and Kuwait. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the relatively high prevalence of Q fever in sheep and goat <b>flocks</b> with a <b>history</b> of abortion. Therefore, Q fever could be responsible for considerable numbers of ovine and caprine abortions in Iran...|$|R

30|$|As {{the pigeon}} <b>flock</b> had a <b>history</b> of {{vaccination}} with lentogenic strain (LaSota), identification of cleavage motif similar to velogenic raises {{concerns for the}} type of vaccine used to vaccinate the flock and the need for post-vaccine evaluation. Substitution and subsequent mutations at fusion peptide, HR regions, trans-membrane domain and antigen neutralization sites could affect the fusion activity of NDVand, alteration in antigenic epitopes particularly those that are involved in virus attachment, could result in escape variants and subsequent vaccine failure (Cho et al. 2007; Umali et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015). Beside potential compromise in procedures used in vaccine storage and administration, the expected genetic distance between vaccine strains and the study isolate seems to be well-explained by Wang et al. (2015) through cross-HI assay. While evaluating the antigenic diversity of different strains through cross-HI assay, they reported a lower R-value (0.13 – 0.18) for interaction of PPMVs to LaSota than between PPMVs (VIa and VIb, 0.7) indicating an obvious antigenic difference with vaccine strain.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of natural toxicants and anthropogenic compounds on reproduction in food animals is significant in its economic impact, {{and the subject}} requires more research and further experimental substantiation. Confounding factors such as stress, nutritional status, season of the year, animal species involved, genetic variability, disease conditions, management factors, and so forth exacerbate the difficulty of making an accurate diagnosis and thereby may impede progress to improve reproductive performance on an individual operation. The interaction between the reproductive system and xenobiotics (reproductive toxicology) {{is a relatively new}} area of study and a subject of increasing interest, especially in the area of environmental exposures and potential work place toxicants affecting human health and reproduction. 1 Much of the experimental literature about this subject comes from rodent models designed to replicate human exposure; however, the extrapolation to food-producing animals is limited at best. The list of compounds in this article with known effects on reproductive function is extensive and represents most classes of chemicals in the environment; however, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Investigation of reproductive dysfunction, especially infertility, abortions, and teratogenesis, should center on a thorough examination of animal condition and health, management practices, and infectious agents while potential toxicants are sought. This method requires a systematic approach including individual animal and herd/ <b>flock</b> <b>history,</b> veterinary examination of individual animals, testing of blood, urine, feces, or tissues, gross and pathologic/histologic postmortem examination, and toxicologic screening of samples of feed and or tissue. In livestock production systems, these investigations are often limited by economics, and the extent of the battery of tests must be determined in consultation between the animal producer, veterinarian, and diagnostician. Reproductive dysfunction includes all facets of reproduction, and when such dysfunction occurs failure to conceive, abortion, stillbirths, and anomalous fetuses may result. Although the following discussion focuses on abnormal embryonic and fetal development (teratogenesis), many of the principles and methods outlined in this article may be used to investigate the other causes of reproductive dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|Control of scrapie, an ovine {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} or prion disorder, has been hampered {{by the lack of}} conventional antemortem diagnostic tests. Currently, scrapie is diagnosed by postmortem examination of the brain and lymphoid tissues for PrPSc, the protein marker for this group of disorders. For live, asymptomatic sheep, diagnosis using tonsil or third-eyelid lymphoid tissue biopsy and PrPSc assay has been described. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of third-eyelid testing for identification of infected flocks and individual infected sheep, 690 sheep from 22 flocks were sampled by third-eyelid lymphoid tissue biopsy and immunohistochemistry. Sheep were further evaluated for relative genetic susceptibility and potential contact exposure to scrapie. Third-eyelid testing yielded suitable samples for 80 % of the sheep tested, with a mean of 18. 1 lymphoid follicles (germinal centers) per histologic section. Three hundred eleven of the sheep were sampled through passive surveillance programs, in which only sheep with potential contact with an infected sheep at a lambing event were tested, regardless of their scrapie susceptibility genotype. In addition, 141 genetically susceptible sheep with no record of contact with an infected animal at a lambing event were sampled through a targeted active surveillance program. Ten PrPSc-positive sheep were identified through the passive surveillance program, and an additional three PrPSc-positive sheep, including two from <b>flocks</b> with no <b>history</b> of scrapie, were identified through the active surveillance program.

In Denmark, sock {{samples were collected}} from 10 parent flocks and 10 offspring flocks, according to the procedure currently used for the surveillance of Salmonella in the EU. Samples were enriched in McConkey broth and streaked on McConkey agar plates added with nalidixic acid (32 g/ml), ciprofloxacin (2 g/ml), ampicillin (32 g/ml), cefotaxime (2 g/ml) or ceftiofur (8 g/ml). The -glucuronidase test was performed for verification of presumptive E. coli. The same methods were used to analyse sock samples collected from 6 Italian broiler flocks. PCR with primers for the CTX-M-type extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBLs) was performed on cephalosporin-resistant isolates. While resistance to ampicillin and nalidixic acid was widespread in both countries, resistance to ciprofloxacin and cephalosporins was more common among Italian flocks. In Denmark, ciprofloxacin resistance was only detected in 1 parent <b>flock</b> without any <b>history</b> of quinolone usage {{and none of the}} flocks was positive for cephalosporin-resistant E. coli.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} epidemiological situation in chlamydial infections of sheep and goats and to study the pathogenicity of an “avirulent” enteric isolate of Chlamydia psittaci, serotype 1, which was originated from a <b>flock</b> with no <b>history</b> of abortion and of a representative abortifacient isolate (C. psittaci, serotype 1). The serological survey was conducted in the provincies of Kilkis and Halkidiki. In 20 % of sera and in 82 % of flocks & herds antibody titres were positive by complement fixation test (CFT). More sheep (29 %) than goats (13 %) were shown a seropositive reaction. This high rate of flocks & herds positivity did not always coincide with a history of abortions and could be due to an “enteric” chlamydia. The investigation of the role of an “avirulent” enteric isolate was made by the experimental infection of 18 pregnant ewes, which were penned separately in 3 groups. The ewes of the first group were inoculated with the enteric isolate and those of the second group were inoculated with an abortifacient isolate. The ewes of the third group were kept as controls. All ewes were inoculated by the oropharyngeal and intranasal route in 90 th day of pregnancy. As criteria of the pathogenicity of every isolate was taken the clinical observations, the isolation of chlamydia in embryonated eggs, the histopathology, the immunohistochemistry, the antigen detecting tests of LPS ELISA and Clearview and the evaluation of antibody titres by ELISA and CFT. In conclusion, both isolates were invasive to the placenta and foetuses. It was concluded, that the presence of positive antibody titres in flocks & herds could be due to enteric C. psittaci, serotype 1. Some of these isolates are potentially pathogenic. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Predicting {{the ability}} of rams to detect, mate and {{fertilise}} ewes in oestrus accurately is certainly difficult; however, tests based on clinical examinations have been performed to assess the overall potential capacity of rams to serve and impregnate ewes. Clinical examinations for breeding soundness evaluation were carried out in 897 Rasa Aragonesa (RA) rams from 35 flocks in North-Eastern (NE) Spain. Clinical examinations of head, trunk, limbs and genitals were performed in each ram. Blood samples were collected for a serological study of Brucella ovis. The sheep owners were surveyed regarding {{the characteristics of the}} <b>flock,</b> rams’ health <b>history</b> and the management of rams. The clinical alterations found were classified according to severity (mild or severe). Rams were classified as suitable (without lesions or with only mild lesions) or unsuitable (with severe lesions) for breeding depending on the results of the clinical examinations. Results The results showed that 60. 6 % of rams presented some type of alteration (mild: 43. 3 %; severe: 17. 3 %) in various body parts (genitalia: 31. 6 %; head and trunk: 37. 2 %; limbs: 15. 5 %), and that 16. 7 % of rams were classified as unsuitable breeders. The most common genital alterations were ulcerative posthitis (18. 7 %) followed by testicular lesions (5. 3 %). The highest prevalence of unsuitable breeders was found in the category of adult and aged rams (13. 8 % and 37. 4 %, respectively) and in the category of emaciated rams (33. 3 %). All rams examined were seronegative to Brucella ovis. The mean percentage of rams in flocks was 2. 8 % (min: 1. 6 %; max: 4. 6 %); nevertheless, this percentage dropped to 2. 5 % (min: 1. 4 %; max: 3. 7 %) and 2. 1 % (min: 0. 3 %; max: 3. 5 %) when only suitable or effective (suitable mature) rams were considered.

Eighty Angora goat kids were bought from 5 producers whose <b>flocks</b> had a <b>history</b> of swelling disease. These kids were kept in enclosures at Grootfontein Agricultural Development Institute near Middelburg (Eastern Cape) {{for the duration of the}} experiment. The animals received a combination of the following treatments: a) high protein vs normal protein diet; b) Ostertagia circumcincta infection or no O. circumcincta infection; c) coccidial infection or no coccidial infection. Data recorded included weekly body weight, weekly total plasma protein levels (TPP), weekly faecal egg counts, weekly coccidial oocyst counts and haematology at Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 16. The goats were also monitored daily for any clinical symptoms. There was no specific trend in any of the parameters measured among the different treatment groups at any stage during the experimental period. The goats were shorn during Week 10 of the experiment. On Monday 6 September 2004 (Week 12 of the study), 19 of the goats developed some subcutaneous oedema. The Saturday (4 September 2004) was rather hot (30 oC), followed by very cold rainy conditions (11 oC) on Sunday (5 September 2004). Twelve of the goats developed what can be described as little oedema, while 7 developed moderate oedema. The number of goats that developed oedema was fairly evenly distributed among the various treatment groups. As far as the specific treatments are concerned, more goats on the normal protein diet developed moderate oedema than the goats on the high protein diet. Body weights of goats that developed moderate oedema were lower throughout the experimental period than body weights of goats that developed little or no oedema, while TPP of goats that developed moderate oedema were lower from Week 5 of the study onwards. There were also no significant differences at any stage throughout the experimental period in faecal egg counts, faecal coccidial oocyst counts or any of the blood parameters between goats that developed moderate oedema, little oedema and those that did not develop any oedema. No goats developed full-blown swelling disease during the course of the experiment. It is possible that the treatments applied in this study are not inductive of the disease, or the effects of the treatments were not severe enough to induce swelling disease...|$|R
40|$|Ovine {{enzootic}} abortion (OEA) resulting from infection of {{sheep and goats}} with Chlamydophila abortus is of major economic importance worldwide. Over the last 50 years the serological diagnosis of infection has been based mainly on the complement fixation test (CFT), which lacks both sensitivity and specificity because of cross-reactive antibodies to other gram-negative bacteria, including another common chlamydial pathogen of sheep, Chlamydophila pecorum. In the present study, a series of overlapping recombinant antigens representing the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 of C. abortus was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a panel of 143 serum samples from sheep experimentally infected with C. abortus, from sheep clinically free of OEA, and from specific-pathogen-free lambs experimentally infected with different subtypes of C. pecorum. The results were compared to those obtained by CFT and another recently described test, an indirect ELISA (iELISA) with the recombinant OMP 91 B (rOMP 91 B) fragment (rOMP 91 B iELISA) (D. Longbottom, E. Psarrou, M. Livingstone, and E. Vretou, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 195 : 157 - 161, 2001). The rOMP 90 - 3 and rOMP 90 - 4 ELISAs were identified as being more sensitive and specific than CFT. Assays with both fragments were evaluated further with a panel of 294 field serum samples from <b>flocks</b> with documented <b>histories</b> of abortion, from flocks with no clinical histories of abortion but which had {{a high proportion of}} samples seropositive by CFT, and from animals with no histories of abortion but from which various C. pecorum subtypes had been isolated. ELISAs with both POMP 90 fragments outperformed CFT with serum samples from C. pecorum-infected animals, producing no false-positive results. However, the ELISA with the rOMP 90 - 4 fragment appeared to be more sensitive than the one with rOMP 90 - 3, as it identified more of the OEA-positive samples. The ELISA with the rOMP 90 - 4 fragment was also able to identify apparently healthy animals that were infected with an enteric strain of C. abortus in flocks that were probably infected with both enteric C. abortus and C. pecorum strains. The identification of animals infected with enteric C. abortus is extremely important in controlling the spread of OEA. Overall, the new rOMP 90 - 4 ELISA was found to be a more sensitive and specific test than CFT for differentiating animals infected with C. abortus from those infected with C. pecorum...|$|R

Tilmicosin (Provitil powder ® 30 mg/kg body weight) was used to limit MG infection in these flocks, and was given to birds for 3 successive days every 5 weeks for 4 months. 136 serum samples were collected from these flocks (16 - 18 samples per flock) before starting tilmicosin treatment and the same number of serum samples were collected following each three treatment course at 5 weeks interval. Mycoplasma gallisepticum ELISA was performed on these samples for the purpose of detecting MG antibodies in these flocks and analyzing data subsequently. The first and second course of tilmicosin treatment did not have any significant effect on MG ELISA results (GMT) (P> 0. 05), while after the third course, GMT had dropped significantly (P< 0. 05) in all tested flocks compared to results gained prior starting treatment with tilmicosin. The overall sero-prevalence of MG in broiler breeder chicken population involved in the study was 80. 43 % and 44. 09 % before and after completing medication with tilmicosin respectively, while the percentage of antibody positive chickens among flock samples ranged from 38. 88 - 100 % and 18. 75 - 56. 25 % before and after complete medication with tilmicosin respectively (P< 0. 05). Improvement in reproductive performances was observed (decreased mortality, increased feed intake and increased egg production and hatchability). The overall data presented here indicated that Provitil ® (30 mg/kg body weight for 3 successive days every 5 weeks for 4 months) is considered a highly effective therapeutic in MG control programs for broiler breeder chicken flocks, and has a net positive effect for the producer. Further studies are necessary to assesses economic losses due to MG and the cost benefit of countermeasures...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} had two objectives. The {{first was the}} isolation and the molecular characterization of strains of small ruminant Lentiviruses from mixed flocks of sheep and goats, {{as well as the}} comparison of a part of the gag gene which encodes the structural protein p 25 both among themselves and with the prototype strains. The second objective was the random recording and the comparison of the percentage of seropositive sheep and goats, in mixed <b>flocks</b> with a <b>history</b> of progressive pneumonia, as well as the investigation of the frequency of seropositive animals which were clinical healthy. For the first objective two mixed flocks of sheep and goats (from the region of Thessaloniki) with a history of progressive pneumonia in sheep were used. Three sheep with clinical symptoms of progressive pneumonia and three goats were selected from these flocks. These animals were both, serologically (Agar Gel Immunodifussion Test) and LTR-PCR (Long Terminal Repeat-Polymerase Chain Reaction in blood leukocytes) positive. For the isolation of the virus from each animal, monocytes from the peripheral blood were isolated and cocultivated with cell-cultures from choroid plexus of a healthy lamb. The cells were collected upon the appearance of the cytopathic effect. The total DNA was extracted for the detection of the proviral DNA. A PCR method was applied with a pair of primers for the gag gene of DNA provirus. The virus was isolated from all three sheep and only one goat. During isolation it was observed that the viral strains had different biological properties: The sheep strains had cause severe cpe, while nothing was observed in the goat strain. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the amplified proviral DNA were compared among the Greek strains and with the prototype strains K 1514, SA-OL, EV 1 and CAEV-CO in order to verify the degree of resemblance. It was observed that the sheep strains were similar compared among them (96 - 98 % in DNA and 99 - 98 % in aminoacids) and less similar compared with the goat strain (90 - 92 % in DNA and 95 - 96 % in aminoacids). It was also observed that there was greater degree of resemblance with the prototype sheep strains (K 1514, EV 1, SA-OL) than with the prototype goat strain CAEV-CO. For the second objective a serological examination (AGIDT) was done in 286 sheep and goats from 7 mixed flocks of N. Greece with a history of progressive pneumonia in their sheep population. Percentage comparison were made with respect to seropositivity and {{the presence or absence of}} clinical symptoms. It was observed that the seroprevalence in sheep was 49 % and the seroprevalence in goat was 60 %. It was also observed that 47 % of seropositive sheep were appeared as clinical healthy. The seropositive sheep appeared symptoms in 22 % while none seropositive goat appeared any symptoms. In addition, LTR-PCR was done directly in the peripheral blood leucocytes of 76 out of the 286 sheep and goats. The results of the AGIDT and the LTR-PCR methods were then compared so as to determine sensitivity of the two methods for the detection of infected animals. It was observed that, in agreement with other references the serological method was more sensitive than the LTR-PCR method (the sensitivity was 88 % for AGIDT and 79 % for LTR-PCR). ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} 2002 the {{incidence}} of a syndrome characterized by diarrhoea and subsequent stunting in broilers starting at six days of age has increased drastically in Germany. In the literature this disease complex is called malabsorption syndrome (MAS). A viral aetiology has been suspected because antimicrobial therapy was not successful. In the present study 68 samples of different organs from 17 broiler <b>flocks</b> with MAS <b>history</b> were investigated virologically. In 56 out of 68 samples reoviruses were isolated and identified by IIFT and electron microscopy. 9 selected samples of the original material, from which only reoviruses had been isolated, were also examined by electron microscopy. Following results were obtained: 4 x rotavirus, 1 x reovirus, 1 x rota- and reovirus, 1 x calicivirus with some rota- and reovirus particles and 1 x paramyxovirus-like particles. In one sample no any viruses were found. 24 reovirus isolates were selected and classified as enteric reovirus strains (ERS) or reovirus (“non-ERS”) using monoclonal antibodies. 16 isolates {{were found to be}} to ERS. For further characterization of selected isolates, morphology of cytopathic effect, size of plaques, results of plaquereduction tests and polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis of extracted RNA were compared. The obtained results did not allow a classification of the reovirus isolates in pathogenic and non-pathogenic. The pathogenicity in vivo of selected isolates was investigated in orally infected one day old SPF-broiler chickens. All birds of the group, which were infected with the ERS-prototype 238 / 98 (polish strain) died within six days p. i. and the described disease pattern was reproduced. This was not possible with the German ERS-field isolate 120 / 03 - 1 as well as the reovirus-prototype-strain S 1133. The German “non-ERS”-isolate 259 / 03 caused a significant reduction of body weight and clinical signs which did not correspond to those in the original flock. The examination of cloacal swabs for virus shedding at different ages showed that a shedding reduction correlated with the increase of antibody level. Histopathological examinations showed in group 238 / 98 mainly necrosis in liver, spleen and Bursa of Fabricius while in groups S 1133, 120 / 03 - 1, 120 / 03 - 1 (original material, AM) and 259 / 03 primarily myo- and epicarditis were seen. In addition in group 259 / 03 gastritis were observed. By immunohistochemistry {{at the end of the}} experiment virus antigen could be detected mainly in spleen, Bursa of Fabricius and caecum with caecal tonsils. In samples of organs from birds infected with the German ERS-field isolate 120 / 03 - 1, its original material 120 / 03 - 1 (AM) as well as the reovirus-prototype-strain S 1133 sporadically virus could be reisolated from caecum with caecal tonsils and spleen. In birds infected with the German “non-ERS”-isolate 259 / 03 neither virus could be reisolated nor virus antigen could be detected in any organ at the end of the experiment. From birds infected with the ERS-prototype 238 / 98 which died before or on day six p. i. virus could be reisolated from all organs and virus antigen could be detected in all organs except the brain. The results show that it was impossible to determine the pathogenicity of reovirus using in vitro methods used in this study without experimental infection in vivo. No correlation between sero-, elektrophero-and pathotype could be found in this study. The heterogeneity of the examined isolates makes it unlikely that MAS is a disease caused only by reoviruses. Furthermore it was shown that not all ERS isolates are pathogenic. The in vitro methods used in this study did not allow to identify a common marker of reoviruses causing MAS. According to available literature this is the first report on experimental infection with reovirus in SPF-broilers...|$|R
