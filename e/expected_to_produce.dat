5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|Although the European Space Agency's current Gaia {{mission was}} not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> good results for stars {{brighter}} than the approximately V=6 saturation limit of the mission's instruments, actual operation has shown good performance on objects to about magnitude +3. Forced observations of brighter stars mean that final results should be available for all bright stars and a parallax for Betelgeuse will be published {{an order of magnitude}} more accurate than currently available.|$|E
5|$|Out of the 2012 production, General Motors <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 10,000 Amperas {{for sale}} in Europe, 6,000 destined for Opel and 4,000 for Vauxhall in the UK. In addition, 2,000 Volts will be made {{available}} for the region. By early 2012 GM abandoned its sales target to deliver 45,000 Volts in the U.S and instead announced that production in 2012 will depend on demand. By March 2012 the Volt plant has a global production capacity of 60,000 vehicles per year.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Alex making landfall, the Brownsville, Texas National Weather Service {{issued a}} flood {{watch for the}} southernmost region of the state. The storm was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> heavy {{rainfall}} for up to 18hours, which {{had the potential to}} cause significant flooding in poor drainage areas, especially those flooded by Hurricane Dolly in 2008. Officials opened hurricane shelters, and voluntary evacuations were put into place for South Padre Island; at least 1,000 people sought shelter in Cameron and Hidalgo counties.|$|E
5|$|They {{are kind}} birds but the male Sebright may get {{protective}} around hens and may turn {{on its own}} owners like all roosters may do. And due to their light, flighty nature it might be best to keep them contained to a smaller, fenced off area. Sebrights often will live happily living amongst other breeds as well. Sebrights are not prolific egglayers and hens are only <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 60-80 creamy-white eggs each season.|$|E
5|$|While Ophelia {{was still}} {{impacting}} Newfoundland, forecasters in the United Kingdom warned residents that {{the remnants of}} the storm would bring unsettled weather to the nation within a few days. In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures reaching an all-time monthly record high of 86 °F (29.9 °C), the storm was expected to bring much cooler weather across the region. Strong winds and heavy rains were also anticipated, leading to the cancellation of ferry services. Plummeting temperatures in association with {{the remnants of the}} storm were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> snowfall across the United Kingdom as well. In Donegal the first snows of the season fell, leaving hundreds of residents without electricity.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the Australian company Wolf Minerals {{started to}} re-open Hemerdon Mine in Devon. It is the fourth-largest reserve of {{tungsten}} {{in the world}} and also <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 1,000 tonnes of tin annually.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Thailand {{produced}} 2.0 {{million tonnes}} of crude palm oil on roughly 626 thousand hectares. Thailand <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 11 million tonnes of fresh palm nuts in 2016, down {{from more than}} 12 million in 2015, the shortfall due to Thailand's drought.|$|R
50|$|The company <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 20 {{megawatts of}} the films at the plant in 2008 before ramping up to 40 megawatts of {{capacity}} in 2009 and 140 megawatts by 2010. This makes Global Solar the largest full-scale manufacturer of CIGS thin-film photovoltaics.|$|R
5|$|In December 1999, the Russian {{government}} outlined that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 {{estimated that the}} country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It looked as though the A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E
5|$|The SS was {{regarded}} as the NSDAP's elite unit. In keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, {{in the early days}} all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of Aryan ancestry back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800. Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the Nuremberg Laws. Other requirements were complete obedience to the Führer and a commitment to the German people and nation. Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria. Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS, since they were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.|$|E

25|$|A {{production}} {{version of}} the 16C Galibier concept, expected to be named the Royale, was originally scheduled to reach the market in 2013. In 2011, Bugatti postponed {{the release of the}} Royale to 2015 or later to refine the vehicle's design.

25|$|Rapidly {{decreasing}} photovoltaic prices put General Electric's planned {{factory in}} Colorado on hold, {{and led to}} the bankruptcy of Konarka Technologies, which had <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 1,000MW of solar modules per year by 2011, and Solyndra, which defaulted on a $535 million loan guarantee, prompting Republican members of the Energy and Commerce committee to vote to cease accepting new applications to the loan program.|$|E
25|$|The PhD and LL.D degrees {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} law degrees. The candidates to these degrees are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a thesis that will constitute a substantial and valuable contribution to legal scholarship. Since the doctoral programme is designed to train law teachers, having the opportunity to practice teaching skills is critical. The candidate is therefore given teaching assignments in addition to making presentations before the faculty community.|$|E
