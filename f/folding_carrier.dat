40|$|AbstractLimited {{proteolytic}} digestion of the uncoupling protein (UCP) with trypsin {{yielded a}} cleavage product only about 2 kDa {{smaller than the}} original UCP (33 kDa). This cleavage can be obtained with the solubilized isolated protein detergent micelle {{as well as in}} original brown adipose mitochondria. The cleavage site is identified by C-terminal sequence to be located near the C-terminus at lysine 292. This C-terminus, a 10 residue long peptide, is strongly hydrophilic and can be expected to be localized outside the membrane. In UCP this C-terminal stretch represents a structural difference to the similarly <b>folded</b> ADP/ATP <b>carrier</b> which does not form a corresponding cleavage product. Comparison of tryptic cleavage of UCP in mitochondria with differently broken outer membrane, in sonic particles of mitochondria, as well as in UCP proteoliposomes, indicate that the C-terminus is directed versus the cytosolic site of the membrane. Because of the easy susceptibility to trypsin, the cleavage site must be surface-exposed and the C-terminal section unusually mobile...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The aim of this research is to evaluate Fajans adsorption technique to deliver ⁶⁸Ga in a high concentration, low volume with minimal impurities including ⁶⁸Ge breakthrough and other metals. First carrier-free stock solutions and stock solutions containing three different concentrations of carrier were tested. Here the stock solution containing ⁶⁸Ge:Ge ratio of 1 : 20 K, 1 : 200 K, and 1 : 2 KK was represented as 20 K, 200 K and 2 KK fold carrier-added stock solution respectively. The optimized concentration level of carrier was utilized for further tests at four different pH values and two different buffers. The Fajans system was evaluated with two different adsorbents and two column bed sizes. In addition, we investigated a carrier-free with acetone added stock solution. The optimized conditions were determined to be that the 200 K <b>fold</b> <b>carrier</b> stock solution in NaOAc buffer at pH 5. 6 is the most suitable condition for 1. 0 ml BSi beads to obtain the highest ⁶⁸Ga yield (90 %) and the lowest ⁶⁸Ge breakthrough (0. 009 %) in the daughter product. At pH 5. 6 stock solutions, the optimized conditions for acetone added stock solution were determined to be 10 % acetone at NH 4 OAc buffer for 1. 0 ml BSi beads (92 % ⁶⁸Ga yield and 0. 04 % ⁶⁸Ge breakthrough) and 50 % acetone at NH 4 OAc buffer for 0. 2 ml BSi beads (82 % ⁶⁸Ga yield and 0. 03 % ⁶⁸Ge breakthrough). The addition of carrier germanium to the ⁶⁸Ge/⁶⁸Ga solution did help in decreasing the amount of ⁶⁸Ge detected in the wash and strip solutions. The progressive lowering of metals detected in the strip solutions collected from the BSi beads Fajans adsorption generator points towards a very workable separation system...|$|R

These properties can be reached in some parts of the materials. Finding the causes of these quality degradation and the signal loss are the main priorities of the exploration. The main problem is the quality of these materials, the inhomogenities are decreasing the detection capability. In this work we will study lux-amper characteristics and analyze photoconductivity maps to better our understanding how inhomogenities influence these parameters. Two main methods will be used, contactless and contact methods with Au applied as contact metal. These maps will be compared.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of medically relevant bisindole {{natural products}} rebeccamycin, staurosporine, and violacein {{from the common}} starting material L-tryptophan involves shared enzymatic transformations. However, the pathways diverge at two steps, each involving a reactive, bisindole intermediate. We have taken a structural approach to characterize the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for these divergence points in each pathway. One major difference between rebeccamycin and staurosporine is the oxidative state of the C- 7 carbon. The enzymes RebC and StaC (65 % sequence identity) control the oxidative outcome at the C- 7 position. Our work on the rebeccamycin biosynthetic enzyme RebC has enabled us to crystallographically 'trap' its putative substrate and to identify a likely enzymatic function for RebC in controlling {{the outcome of this}} key step in rebeccamycin biosynthesis. We have also used the structure of RebC with reduced flavin to probe the likely reaction cycle of a single round of flavin-based hydroxylation chemistry in RebC. Finally, the structure of RebC has allowed us to use a structure-based mutagenesis approach to install a higher affinity binding site for FAD in the RebC homologue StaC, which normally binds FAD weakly. The resulting protein possesses RebC-like properties. Another divergence point between these biosynthetic pathways is {{the presence or absence of}} the VioE enzyme, which diverts a reactive intermediate toward violacein precursor. Our structural studies on VioE have shown that this enzyme shares a <b>fold</b> with lipoprotein <b>carrier</b> proteins. A series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments on residues around a PEG molecule bound in the VioE structure have revealed the likely location of the active site in VioE. by Katherine Snoda Ryan.

40|$|The {{focus of}} our {{research}} is on designing a new architecture (RF front-end and digital) for processing multi GNSS signals in a single receiver chain. The motivation is to save in overhead cost (size, processing time and power consumption) of implementing multiple signal receivers side-by-side on-board Smartphones. This thesis documents the new multi-signal receiver architecture that we have designed. Based on this architecture, we have achieved/published eight novel contributions. Six of these implementations focus on multi GNSS signal receivers, and the last two are for multiplexing Bluetooth and GPS received signals in a single processing chain. We believe our work {{in terms of the}} new innovative and novel techniques achieved is a major contribution to the commercial world especially that of Smartphones. Savings in both silicon size and processing time will be highly beneficial to reduction of costs but more importantly for conserving the energy of the battery. We are proud that we have made this significant contribution to both industry and the scientific research and development arena. The first part of the work focus on the Two GNSS signal detection front-end approaches that were designed to explore the availability of the L 1 band of GPS, Galileo and GLONASS at an early stage. This is so that the receiver devotes appropriate resources to acquire them. The first approach was based on <b>folding</b> the <b>carrier</b> frequency of all the three GNSS signals with their harmonics to the First Nyquist Zone (FNZ), as depicted by the BandPass Sampling Receiver technique (BPSR). Consequently, there is a unique power distribution of these folded signals based on the actual present signals that can be detected to alert the digital processing parts to acquire it. Volterra Series model is used to estimate the existing power in the FNZ by extracting the kernels of these folded GNSS signals, if available. The second approach filters out the right-side lobe of the GLONASS signal and the left-side lobe of the Galileo signal, prior to the folding process in our BPSR implementation. This filtering is important to enable none overlapped folding of these two signals with the GPS signal in the FNZ. The simulation results show that adopting these two approaches can save much valuable acquisition processing time. Our Orthogonal BandPass Sampling Receiver and Orthogonal Complex BandPass Sampling Receiver are two methods designed to capture any two wireless signals simultaneously and use a single channel in the digital domain to process them, including tracking and decoding, concurrently. The novelty of the two receivers is centred on the Orthogonal Integrated Function (OIF) that continuously harmonies the two received signals to form a single orthogonal signal allowing the “tracking and decoding” to be carried out by a single digital channel. These receivers employ a Hilbert Transform for shifting one of the input signals by 90 -degrees. Then, the BPSR technique is used to fold back the two received signals to the same reference frequency in the FNZ. Results show that these designed methods also reduce the sampling frequency to a rate proportional to the maximum bandwidth, instead of the summation of bandwidths, of the input signals. Two combined GPS L 1 CA and L 2 C signal acquisition channels are designed based on applying the idea of the OIF to enhance the power consumption and the implementation complexity in the existing combination methods and also to enhance the acquisition sensitivity. This is achieved by removing the Doppler frequency of the two signals; our methods add the in-phase component of the L 2 C signal together with the in-phase component of the L 1 CA signal, which is then shifted by 90 -degree before adding it to the remaining components of these two signals, resulting in an orthogonal form of the combined signals. This orthogonal signal is then fed to our developed version of the parallel-code-phase-search engine. Our simulation results illustrate that the acquisition sensitivity of these signals is improved successfully by 5. 0 dB, which is necessary for acquiring weak signals in harsh environments. The last part of this work focuses on the tracking stage when specifically multiplexing Bluetooth and L 1 CA GPS signals in a single channel based on using the concept of the OIF, where the tracking channel can be shared between the two signals without losing the lock or degrading its performance. Two approaches are designed for integrating the two signals based on the mathematical analysis of the main function of the tracking channel, which the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). A mathematical model of a set of differential equations has been developed to evaluate the PLL when it used to track and demodulated two signals simultaneously. The simulation results proved that the implementation of our approaches has reduced by almost half the size and processing time...|$|R
