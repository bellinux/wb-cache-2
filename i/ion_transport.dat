40|$|AbstractThe light-activated proton-pumping {{bacteriorhodopsin}} and chloride ion-pumping halorhodopsin are compared. They {{belong to}} the family of retinal proteins, with 25 % amino acid sequence homology. Both proteins have seven α helices across the membrane, surrounding the retinal binding pocket. Photoexcitation of all-trans retinal leads to <b>ion</b> <b>transporting</b> photocycles, which exhibit great similarities in the two proteins, despite the differences in the <b>ion</b> <b>transported.</b> The spectra of the K, L, N and O intermediates, calculated using time-resolved spectroscopic measurements, are very similar in both proteins. The absorption kinetic measurements reveal that the chloride <b>ion</b> <b>transporting</b> photocycle of halorhodopsin does not have intermediate M characteristic for deprotonated Schiff base, and intermediate L dominates the process. Energetically the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin is driven mostly by the decrease of the entropic energy, while the photocycle of halorhodopsin is enthalpy-driven. The <b>ion</b> <b>transporting</b> steps were characterized by the electrogenicity of the intermediates, calculated from the photoinduced transient electric signal measurements. The function of both proteins could be described with the ‘local access’ model developed for bacteriorhodopsin. In the framework of this model it is easy to understand how bacteriorhodopsin can be converted into a chloride pump, and halorhodopsin into a proton pump, by changing the ion specificity with added ions or site-directed mutagenesis...|$|R

25|$|Biology Monte Carlo methods (BioMOCA) {{have been}} {{developed}} at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to simulate <b>ion</b> <b>transport</b> in an electrolyte environment through ion channels or nano-pores embedded in membranes. It is a 3-D particle-based Monte Carlo simulator for analyzing and studying the <b>ion</b> <b>transport</b> problem in ion channel systems or similar nanopores in wet/biological environments. The system simulated consists of a protein forming an ion channel (or an artificial nanopores like a Carbon Nano Tube, CNT), with a membrane (i.e. lipid bilayer) that separates two ion baths on either side. BioMOCA is based on two methodologies, namely the Boltzmann transport Monte Carlo (BTMC) and particle-particle-particle-mesh (P3M). The first one uses Monte Carlo method to solve the Boltzmann equation, while the later splits the electrostatic forces into short-range and long-range components.|$|E

40|$|Potassium {{permanganate}} {{is produced}} by the electro-oxidation of alkaline potassium manganate in a divided electrolytic cell. A filter press type flow electrolyzer has been designed, fabricated, and operated with perfluoro sulfonic acid based cation exchange membrane Nafion 417, precious metal/precious metal oxide coated titanium anode, and stainless steel cathode. Optimum process parameters are evaluated and reported. Performance characteristics of coated titanium anodes are compared with conventional nickel anodes, to fix the most suitable one for the job on hand. Anode materials have been electrochemically characterized by potentiodynamic studies in alkaline potassium manganate solution. Transport properties of the membrane Nafion 417 for K+ ions and water molecules are studied using a small membrane cell operating on batch mode.

25|$|In {{addition}} to having a diffusive effect on <b>ion</b> <b>transport,</b> water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, {{in a manner that}} is similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E
25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum. In {{order for the}} A subunit to reach its target, a disulfide bond between the A1 and A2 domain must be broken. This breakage is catalyzed by a protein disulfide isomerase {{that is in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of <b>ion</b> <b>transport</b> mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Genetically, linkage {{studies have}} {{identified}} 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes {{that are associated}} with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia. A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, <b>ion</b> <b>transport,</b> retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development.

25|$|BIND {{offers several}} “features” {{that many other}} {{proteomics}} databases do not include. The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional IUPAC nomenclature to help describe post-translational modifications that occur to amino acids. These modifications include: acetylation, formylation, methylation, palmitoylation, etc. {{the extension of the}} traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well. BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as OntoGlyphs. The OntoGlyphs were developed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and provide a link back to the original GO information. A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories, each one representing a specific function, binding specificity, or localization in the cell. There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total. There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information {{about the role of the}} molecule (e.g. cell physiology, <b>ion</b> <b>transport,</b> signaling). There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds (e.g. ligands, DNA, ions). The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell (e.g. nucleus, cytoskeleton). The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results. The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results. ProteoGlyphs are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains. The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains. Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the damage}} in CF is due to {{blockage}} of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions. These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick feces, etc. Several theories have been posited on how the defects in the protein and cellular function cause the clinical effects. The most current theory suggests that defective <b>ion</b> <b>transport</b> leads to dehydration in the airway epithelia, thickening mucus. In airway epithelial cells, the cilia exist in between the cell's apical surface and mucus in a layer known as airway surface liquid (ASL). The flow of ions from the cell and into this layer is determined by ion channels such as CFTR. CFTR not only allows chloride ions {{to be drawn from}} the cell and into the ASL, but it also regulates another channel called ENac, which allows sodium ions to leave the ASL and enter the respiratory epithelium. CFTR normally inhibits this channel, but if the CFTR is defective, then sodium flows freely from the ASL and into the cell. As water follows sodium, the depth of ASL will be depleted and the cilia will be left in the mucous layer. As cilia cannot effectively move in a thick, viscous environment, mucociliary clearance is deficient and a buildup of mucus occurs, clogging small airways. The accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs allows bacteria to hide from the body's immune system, causing repeated respiratory infections. The presence of the same CFTR proteins in pancreatic duct and skin cells also cause symptoms in these systems.|$|E
500|$|The <b>ion</b> <b>transport</b> system moves {{potassium}} {{across the}} cell membrane using two mechanisms. One is active and pumps sodium out of, and potassium into, the cell. The other is passive and allows potassium to leak {{out of the}} cell. Potassium and sodium cations influence fluid distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments by osmotic forces. The movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This ion pump uses ATP to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, creating an electrochemical gradient and electromotive force across the cell membrane. The highly selective potassium ion channels (which are tetramers) are crucial for hyperpolarization inside neurons after an action potential is triggered, to cite one example. The most recently discovered potassium ion channel is KirBac3.1, which makes {{a total of five}} potassium ion channels (KcsA, KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KvAP, and MthK) with a determined structure.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for {{life is the}} ability to uphold electro-chemical imbalance across biomembranes. Ion trans- porting enzymes, known as specific pumps, are re-sponsible for the <b>transport</b> of various <b>ions</b> across cell membranes to sustain the same. In all eukaryotes, the plasma membrane potential and secondary transport systems are maintained by the activity of P-type <b>ion</b> <b>transporting</b> enzymes, commonly known as ATPase membrane pumps. Malfunction of pumps leads to various cell disorders and subsequently diseases like cardiac problems, renal malfunctionings, diabetes, cataract, even cancer. Activities/functions of these pumps are regulated either by exogenous agents or by endogenous substances like proteins, peptides, hormones, etc., which are collectively known as mo- dulators. Some of these endogenous modulators may be useful for developing drugs depending on the na-ture of regulation. For more than last two decades, researchers across the globe are exploring the me- chanism of action of different endogenous modulators on these <b>ion</b> <b>transporting</b> enzymes with the aim of developing target-specific drugs.
