40|$|The {{occurrence}} of in vitro amino acid activity in bacterial strains associated with <b>fresh</b> <b>pork</b> <b>sausages</b> packaged in different atmospheres {{and kept in}} refrigeration was studied. The presence of biogenic amines in decarboxylase broth was confirmed by ion-exchange chromatography and {{by the presence of}} the corresponding decarboxylase genes by PCR. From the 93 lactic acid bacteria and 100 enterobacteria strains analysed, the decarboxylase medium underestimates the number of biogenic amine-producer strains. 28 % of the lactic acid bacteria produced tyramine and presented the tdc gene. All the tyramine-producer strains were molecularly identified as Carnobacterium divergens. Differences on the relative abundance of C. divergens were observed among the different packaging atmospheres assayed. After 28. days of storage, the presence of argon seems to inhibit C. divergens growth, while packing under vacuum seems to favour it. Among enterobacteria, putrescine was the amine more frequently produced (87 %), followed by cadaverine (85 %); agmatine and tyramine were only produced by 13 and 1 %, respectively, of the strains analysed. Packing under vacuum or in an atmosphere containing nitrogen seems to inhibit the growth of enterobacteria which produce simultaneously putrescine, cadaverine, and agmatine. Contrarily, over-wrapping or packing in an atmosphere containing argon seems to favour the growth of agmatine producer-enterobacteria. The production of putrescine and cadaverine was associated with the presence of the corresponding amino acid decarboxylase genes. The biogenic amine-producer strains were included {{in a wide range of}} enterobacterial species, including Kluyvera intermedia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Yersinia kristensenii, Serratia grimesii, Serratia ficaria, Yersinia rodhei, Providencia vermicola and Obesumbacterium proteus. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [55]- 67) Two preenrichment broths, universal (UP) and lactose (LB), two {{selective enrichment}} broths, tetrathionate brilliant green (TBG) incubated at 42 ?C, and selenite cystine (SC) incubated at 35 ?C, and 5 plating media: xylose lysine deoxycholate with 5 mg/Iiter of novobiocin (XLD-N), bismuth sulfite (BS), Hektoen enteric with 80 mg/Iiter of novobiocin (HE-N), double modified lysine iron agar (DMLIA) and brilliant green sulfa with 15 mg/Iiter of novobiocin (BGS- N), were evaluated {{to determine their}} efficacies for the recovery of salmonellae from 200 samples of naturally contaminated <b>fresh</b> chicken and <b>pork</b> <b>sausage.</b> UP has been investigated by other researchers for the simultaneous recovery of Listeria and Salmonella in food products to save time and expense instead of using separate preenrichment broths. In this study, Salmonella was undetected in 22 % of samples with LB and 27 % of samples with UP. These {{results suggest that the}} utilization of the two preenrichment broths, LB and UP, is warranted in the recovery of Salmonella from <b>fresh</b> chicken and <b>pork</b> <b>sausage.</b> Significantly more samples were positive for Salmonella when enriched in TBG at 42 ?C as compared to SC at 35 ?C (P< 0. 05). Salmonella was undetected in only 3 % of samples when SC was eliminated as an enrichment medium, suggesting that the benefit of using SC is questionable. The plating medium DMLIA has been recommended by the USDA as an alternative to XLD. Comparing the five plating media, salmonellae were recovered from 100 % of positive samples when the combination of XLD-N and BGS-N was utilized, whereas DMLIA and BS showed the lowest recovery rates. Of the methods tested, the best procedure for the recovery of salmonellae in <b>fresh</b> chicken and <b>pork</b> <b>sausage</b> includes preenrichment in both LB and UP, enrichment in TBG at 42 ?C, and plating with XLD-N and BGS-N.

The isolates were screened {{for their ability to}} influence the growth of Staphylococcus aureus strain 196 E by means of spot-plate tests on APT and nutrient agars at 25 C. The 438 cultures that influenced the growth of S. aureus were retested on spot plates at 15, 30, and 42 C. After elimination of replicates, the 143 remaining cultures were classified into species, genera, or groups, and 14 different cultures were tested for their influence on the growth of S. aureus in APT broth at 25 C. Over half of the effective cultures inhibited S. aureus and less than half were stimulatory. <b>Pork</b> <b>sausage</b> had the highest proportion of inhibitory cultures, and stewing beef had the lowest. APT agar was better than nutrient agar for screening, and incubation at 15 C gave more effector organisms than at 30 and 42 C. Most of the lactic acid bacteria were inhibitory, but other groups of bacteria contained more stimulatory cultures than inhibitory ones. The three Escherichia coli cultures were stimulatory, but most other Escherichia cultures were inhibitory. Aerobacter and Paracolobactrum isolates were mostly stimulatory. Cultures of other kinds of bacteria were more or less evenly distributed between inhibitory ones and stimulatory ones. Genera containing mostly inhibitory bacteria were Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus. Inhibitory species were E. freundii and E. intermedia. Tests with S. aureus in broth indicated that all cultures inhibitory according to spot plates were inhibitory in broth, but stimulation on spot plates did not always indicate the same phenomenon in broth...|$|R

Dessa forma, a redu????o desses aditivos na dieta representa prioridade pelos consumidores na busca de uma vida mais saud??vel, assim como, uma tend??ncia crescente da ind??stria de alimentos no desenvolvimento de produtos com r??tulos mais limpos, conhecidos como clean label. Nesse contexto, este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a funcionalidade do ??leo essencial de alecrim examinando sua capacidade antioxidante sobre as caracter??sticas de qualidade de uma lingui??a frescal su??na org??nica sob os aspectos f??sico-qu??micos, microbiol??gicos e sensoriais. Discutiu-se ainda, o consumo de carne su??na org??nica como alternativa ?? carne su??na convencional e os par??metros dos antioxidantes naturais e sint??ticos habitualmente utilizados na elabora????o de produtos c??rneos. A atividade antioxidante total (AAT) do ??leo essencial de alecrim org??nico extra??do de folhas frescas comparativamente ao ??leo extra??do de folhas secas foi avaliada {{in vitro}} atrav??s da atividade sequestrante de radical DPPH (2, 2 -difenil- 1 -picril-hidrazil). Foram produzidas quatro formula????es de lingui??a su??na org??nica: controle, isenta de quaisquer aditivos (Tc), aditivada com sais de cura (Tsc) e aditivadas com diferentes concentra????es de ??leo essencial de alecrim, 0, 01 (T 0, 01 %) e 0, 1 % (T 0, 1 %). As amostras foram armazenadas sob refrigera????o e submetidas ??s an??lises f??sico-qu??micas de atividade de ??gua, pH, subst??ncias reativas ao ??cido 2 -tiobarbit??rico (TBARS); microbiol??gicas, preconizadas na RDC 12 / 2001, bem como contagem total de bact??rias heterotr??ficas; e sensoriais, com os testes de aceita????o, inten????o de compra e prefer??ncia. Foi ainda realizada uma pesquisa de percep????o do consumidor. Os resultados mostraram que a pr??-secagem das folhas afetou negativamente a AAT do ??leo essencial, embora o teste estat??stico n??o tenha demonstrado signific??ncia. Avaliando o desempenho do ??leo essencial de alecrim em substitui????o aos aditivos tradicionalmente utilizados, observou-se que, ao longo dos dias de armazenamento das quatro amostras produzidas, a atividade de ??gua e o pH mantiveram-se est??veis e dentro da faixa aceit??vel para produtos c??rneos crus. Nos resultados referentes ?? oxida????o lip??dica, em valores de TBARS, o Tsc e o T 0, 1 % n??o diferiram no quinto e ??ltimo dia de an??lise. No teste de aceita????o, as lingui??as apresentaram boa aceita????o nos atributos apar??ncia, odor e cor. O sabor {{residual}} do alecrim foi bastante destacado na amostra com maior concentra????o de ??leo essencial (0, 1 %), sendo a amostra com menor concentra????o (0, 01 %) apontada como preferida (40, 63 %). A an??lise sensorial do produto atrav??s do teste de aceita????o corroborou a pesquisa de percep????o do consumidor sugerindo a formula????o com concentra????o de 0, 01 % de ??leo essencial de alecrim como a amostra preferida al??m de maior inten????o de compra. Conclui-se, ainda, que a demanda por produtos alimentares org??nicos ?? crescente, apontando uma atitude positiva com rela????o ?? compra de uma lingui??a frescal su??na org??nica com ??leo essencial de alecrim como antioxidante natural. The high synthetic additives ingestion in meat processed products {{has been associated}} {{to the development of}} some health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, so the reduction of these additives in a diet has to be prioritized by consumers seeking a healthier way of life as well as by industries considering the rising trend in developing products bearing clean labels. In this context, this study had the main objective of evaluate the functionality of rosemary essential oil, assessing its antioxidant capacity over quality features of an organic <b>fresh</b> <b>pork</b> <b>sausage,</b> concerning its physical-chemical, microbiological and sensorial aspects. The consumption of organic pork meat as well as the parameters of natural and synthetic antioxidants usually used in meat products production were also discussed. The total antioxidant activity (TAA) of rosemary essencial oil, extracted from fresh organic leaves in comparison with the one extracted from dry organic leaves was evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging activity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazyl). Four different organic <b>pork</b> <b>sausages</b> were formulated: control exempt of additives (Tc), with addition of curing salts (Tsc) and with addition of rosemary essential oil in different concentrations 0, 01 % (T 0, 01 %) e 0, 1 % (T 0, 1 %). The samples were stored under refrigeration and submitted to the following analysis: physical-chemical analysis of water activity, pH and 2 -tiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS); microbiological analysis as determined by RDC 12 / 2001, as well as total heterotrophic bacteria counting, and sensorial analysis such as acceptance purchase, intent and preference tests. A consumer perception test was also carried out. The results showed that the drying operation in rosemary organic leaves adversely affected the essential oil TAA even the statistical analysis did not show significance. Evaluating the performance of rosemary essencial oil substituting traditionally used additives, it was verified that, during storage period, for the four samples, water activity and pH remained stable and in acceptable range for raw meat products. Concerning lipid oxidation results in TBARS values, there were no statistical differences in Tc and T 0, 1 % in the fifth and last day of analysis. The four sausages were well accepted in its appearance, odor and color. Rosemary residual taste was strongly mentioned on the sample containing higher essential oil concentration (0, 1 %) and the sample containing lower concentration (0. 01 %) was chosen as the favorite one (40, 63 %). Product sensorial analysis, through acceptance test, has confirmed the consumer perception test suggesting the 0, 01 % rosemary essential oil sample as the favorite one and the leading to higher purchase intent. Furthermore, it was concluded that the demand for organic food is increasing, indicating a positive attitude toward the purchase of a <b>fresh</b> <b>pork</b> <b>sausage</b> with organic rosemary essential oil as a natural antioxidant...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the economic and}} demographic patterns of at-home pork consumption for representative individuals over 18 years {{of age in the}} United States. Three data sets purchased by the National Pork Board (NPB) are mined for this purpose: (1) National Eating Trends (NET) data from National Panel Diary (NPD) on individuals' intake and their demographic characteristics; (2) weekly retail prices for fresh meats and <b>fresh</b> <b>pork</b> cuts from FreshLook; and (3) weekly retail prices for processed pork products from A. C. Nielsen. Heckman sample selection models are used to find demographic, health, and attitudinal/lifestyle patterns of consumption of twelve <b>fresh</b> and processed <b>pork</b> products as well as beef, chicken, and seafood. In the fall, individuals have a higher probability of eating beef, chicken, pork tenderloin, and bacon, but a lower probability of eating fresh seafood, canned ham, and smoked ham relative to the spring. The New England region has the highest likelihood of eating <b>fresh</b> <b>pork,</b> beef, chicken, seafood, pork roasts, pork tenderloin, and pork hotdogs. Blacks, on average, eat more <b>fresh</b> and processed <b>pork,</b> chicken, <b>pork</b> <b>sausage,</b> bacon, and canned ham, but less beef relative to whites. Concern about serving food with fat is negatively related with the likelihood of eating processed pork, lunchmeat, ham, and bacon, but it is positively related with the likelihood of eating pork hotdogs. A three-stage selectivity-adjusted censored LA/AIDS model is developed and estimated to find demand-price relationships for: (1) <b>fresh</b> meats (<b>pork,</b> beef, chicken, and seafood) and (2) nine <b>fresh</b> and processed <b>pork</b> cuts. However, aggregate fresh meats are substitutes for each other in at-home market, but there are substantial complementarities between <b>pork</b> cuts. <b>Pork</b> <b>sausage</b> is the major competitor for the processed products, pork roasts and pork tenderloin, but a major complement for pork ribs. There is relatively week substitutability between pork and beef, and relatively strong substitutability between pork and chicken and between beef and chicken. This could suggest opportunities for some joint marketing efforts between pork and beef commodity interests.

40|$|In 2012 - 2013 Emilia-Romagna Region {{introduced}} a monitoring plan for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in foodstuff. Six hundred eighty-nine meat samples and 273 {{fruit and vegetable}} products were analyzed according to ISOTS 13136. Pre-enriched samples were tested by multiplex real time PCR targeting the virulence genes eae, stx 1 and stx 2. Stx 2 positive samples were investigated {{for the presence of}} serogroup O 104 associated gene. O 103, O 111, O 145, O 157, O 26 associated genes were tested on samples positive for stx in association with eae gene. Isolation of E. coli strains was attempted from samples positive for serogroup-associated genes. Thirtyfour meat products (4. 9 %) resulted positive for stx 1 and/or stx 2 genes and 46 (6. 7 %) for stx 1 and/or stx 2 genes in association with eae gene. Forty-five (6. 5 %) samples resulted positive at least at one serogroup. Serogroup O 103, O 104, O 111, O 145, O 157 and O 26 genes were detected respectively in 1. 3, 0. 3, 0. 1, 3. 9, 2. 9 and 2. 5 % samples; 0. 6 % samples resulted positive for STEC isolation (2 E. coli O 103 and 2 E. coli O 157).
