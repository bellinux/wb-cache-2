For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} intervention on the level and volatility of the <b>exchange</b> rate in Mexico and Turkey, two emerging countries that have floating <b>exchange</b> rate regimes. The paper finds mixed evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} intervention. In Mexico, foreign <b>exchange</b> sales have a small impact on the <b>exchange</b> rate level and raise short-term volatility, while in Turkey, intervention does not appear to affect the <b>exchange</b> rate level but reduces its shortterm volatility. In both cases, the findings are consistent with officially stated policy objectives, which aim to minimize the effect of intervention on the <b>exchange</b> rate, but cast doubt on claims that intervention is a useful tool for smoothing volatility. Although these findings cannot be generalized to other emerging markets, intervention''s apparently limited effectiveness highlights the need for central banks to use their scarce foreign reserves selectively and parsimoniously.

It applies several of the approaches to data for the United States as of 2006, illustrates that different approaches sometimes provide substantially different assessments, and asks which methodologies deserve the most weight in such situations. It argues that while it is generally desirable to consider the implications of several different approaches, since different approaches provide different types of perspectives, two of the methodologies seem particularly relevant for identifying threats to macroeconomic stability and growth. <b>Exchange</b> rate assessments;Purchasing power parity;Consumer goods;Economic models;exchange rates, <b>exchange</b> rate, real <b>exchange</b> rate, real <b>exchange</b> rates, foreign <b>exchange,</b> current account balance, <b>exchange</b> rate changes, nominal <b>exchange</b> rates, nominal <b>exchange</b> rate, foreign asset, net foreign asset, foreign liabilities, foreign assets, foreign asset position, capital flows, net foreign asset position, net foreign assets, real effective <b>exchange</b> rate, effective <b>exchange</b> rate, <b>exchange</b> rate realignment, fixed <b>exchange</b> rate, foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves, <b>exchange</b> reserves, real effective <b>exchange</b> rates, <b>exchange</b> rate theory, prevailing <b>exchange</b> rates, <b>exchange</b> rate appreciation, international competitiveness, current accounts, <b>exchange</b> rate determination, <b>exchange</b> rate economics, <b>exchange</b> rate movements, forward <b>exchange,</b> effective <b>exchange</b> rates, <b>exchange</b> rate index, <b>exchange</b> rate adjustment, forward <b>exchange</b> rates, real <b>exchange</b> rate movements, fixed <b>exchange</b> rate regime, fixed nominal <b>exchange</b> rate, <b>exchange</b> rate appreciations, prevailing <b>exchange</b> rate, international economic policy, market <b>exchange</b> rates, multilateral <b>exchange</b> rates, <b>exchange</b> rate volatility, international financial statistics, real <b>exchange</b> rate appreciations, <b>exchange</b> rate mechanism, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> rate regime, <b>exchange</b> rate dynamics, <b>exchange</b> rate change, average real <b>exchange</b> rate, real <b>exchange</b> rate appreciation, multilateral real <b>exchange</b> rate, international finance, fixed <b>exchange</b> rates, average <b>exchange</b> rates, constant real <b>exchange</b> rate, international financial, forward <b>exchange</b> rate, foreign investment, <b>exchange</b> transactions, currency units, <b>exchange</b> rate behavior, foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, trade restrictions, foreign <b>exchange</b> transactions...|$|R

This study assesses the historical durability and performance of alternative <b>exchange</b> rate regimes, with special focus on developing and emerging market countries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monthly database on de facto <b>exchange</b> rate regimes that covers all IMF members since 1990. Information from IMF country reports and other sources, including <b>exchange</b> rate data, is utilized to determine de facto <b>exchange</b> rate policies. Countries are categorized {{based on these}} policies using the IMF nomenclature adopted in 1999. This approach ensures the forward compatibility of the database. The database is then used to examine whether the "bipolar view" of <b>exchange</b> regimes holds with de facto regimes. It is found {{that the proportion of}} countries adopting "intermediate" regimes has indeed been shrinking in favor of greater flexibility or greater fixity, especially for countries more integrated with international markets. Analyses based on Markov chains of regime transitions, however, provide (mixed) evidence against the bipolar view. <b>Exchange</b> rates;exchange rate, intermediate regimes, <b>exchange</b> rate regimes, foreign <b>exchange,</b> capital mobility, currency unions, <b>exchange</b> rate regime, de facto <b>exchange</b> rate regimes, currency boards, <b>exchange</b> rate path, <b>exchange</b> rate policy, capital flows, <b>exchange</b> rate policies, classification of <b>exchange</b> rate, basket of currencies, multiple alternative <b>exchange</b> rate regimes, capital markets, <b>exchange</b> rate flexibility, alternative <b>exchange</b> rate, stable <b>exchange</b> rate, international capital markets, <b>exchange</b> rate movements, <b>exchange</b> rate stability, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, history of <b>exchange</b> rate, <b>exchange</b> rate data, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, nominal <b>exchange</b> rate, <b>exchange</b> rate volatility, <b>exchange</b> rate arrangements, real <b>exchange</b> rate, foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> rate targets, movements in currency pegs, international capital, <b>exchange</b> markets, intermediate <b>exchange</b> rate regimes, intermediate <b>exchange</b> rate, stable capital inflows, <b>exchange</b> rate mechanism, optimal <b>exchange</b> rate regime, adjustable peg, foreign <b>exchange</b> controls, speculative capital, <b>exchange</b> rate misalignments, currency convertibility, <b>exchange</b> rate anchors, <b>exchange</b> rate exposure, <b>exchange</b> rate behavior, <b>exchange</b> rate target, fluctuations in <b>exchange</b> rate variations, fixed <b>exchange</b> rate rigidity, foreign <b>exchange</b> transactions, fixed <b>exchange</b> rate, rigid <b>exchange</b> rate regimes, intermediate ? regimes, <b>exchange</b> transactions, <b>exchange</b> rate levels, <b>exchange</b> rate rule, fluctuation margins, <b>exchange</b> controls, parallel <b>exchange</b> rate depreciation...|$|R
