5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of fair trade and ethical {{marketing}} organizations employing different marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade coffee brands. Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative can spend the money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.|$|E

2500|$|The 4–4–2 diamond (also {{described}} as 4–1–2–1–2) staggers the midfield. The width {{in the team}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the full-backs pushing forward. The defensive midfielder is sometimes used as a deep lying playmaker, but needs to remain disciplined and protect the back four behind him. The central attacking midfielder is the creative player, responsible for picking up the ball, and distributing the ball wide to its full-backs or providing the two strikers with through balls. When out of possession, the midfield four must drop and assist the defense, while the two strikers must be free for the counter-attack. Its most famous example was Carlo Ancelotti's Milan, which won the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final and made Milan runners-up in 2005. Milan was obliged to adopt this formation so as to field talented central midfielder Andrea Pirlo, in a period when the position of offensive midfielder was occupied by Rui Costa and later Kaká. This tactic was gradually abandoned by Milan after Andriy Shevchenko's departure in 2006, progressively adopting a [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] formation. Real Madrid, under the management of Zinedine Zidane, are currently the most notable team which deploys this formation. In the 2017 Uefa Champions League final, Real Madrid used this formation and defeated Juventus by four goals to one. Cristiano Ronaldo {{was one of the}} two strikers which started and scored two goals, while Isco Alarcon played at central attacking midfielder, and Marcelo providing the width from left back. Real Madrid won both the Uefa Champions League and the Spanish La Liga during their 2016-2017 season using this formation, proving the effectiveness of the formation. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the most goals during the 2017 Champions League season, demonstrating the success of using two strikers with a central attacking midfielder behind them.|$|E
