5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 {{as it was}} felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones.

After identifying that the series were nonstationary, it was used the Cointegration approach, being estimated a Vector Error Correction Model (VEC Model). The results showed that both price and income elasticities are <b>inferiors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unit. The projections for period 2004 / 2008 indicate that the consumption of electricity should present superior taxes of growth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observed ones in the decade of 90.

Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genuine notes.|$|E
5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E

5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> men. <b>The</b> early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves <b>to</b> be <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> men. <b>The</b> Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|R

5|$|Nine {{vehicles}} were evaluated in the Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). The four primary vehicles {{included in the}} AOA were the M2A3 Bradley II, a modernized Stryker, an M2A3 Bradley variant used in Iraq, and a XM1230 Caiman Plus MRAP. The five secondary vehicles included two unnamed foreign-made platforms, the M1126 Stryker Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the M1A2 SEP TUSK Abrams, and a modernized M1 Abrams. Vehicles included the AOA were determined to be <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planned GCV.|$|E

The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although they cost about two-thirds as much.|$|E
5|$|The Alekseyev I-21 was a Soviet twin-engined jet fighter, {{built in}} the late 1940s. Two prototypes were {{constructed}} with the designation of I-211, of which one was converted into the I-215 with more powerful engines. A third aircraft was built to evaluate the bicycle landing gear arrangement for use in other aircraft. The fighter was not accepted for production as it was <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> swept-wing fighters like the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.|$|E
40|$|Joint {{exchange}} and raiding can emerge {{in a world}} of mutual raiding when the appropriated production is less valuable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> appropriator than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defender and the defense is not too <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> attack. <b>The</b> amounts of resources allocated to production and raiding and the amounts of goods exchanged reciprocally are determined endogenously. <b>The</b> model reduces <b>to</b> pure {{exchange and}} pure raiding as special cases. Pure exchange emerges when the usability of appropriation is sufficiently low. Pure raiding emerges if the defense is sufficiently <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> attack. <b>The</b> results of the model are intermediate between the results of the two extreme cases.

The Marcellus black slate was also quarried in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, for school slates used by students in 19th-century rural schools.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal}} of obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people.

5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When {{the last of his}} sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E

5|$|In either usage, most B movies {{represent}} a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more {{popular in the}} 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B movies were <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more handsomely budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.|$|E
5|$|Individually, {{each game}} in the series has been {{generally}} well received. In 1995, Dark Forces became LucasArts' highest sell-in with more than 300,000 copies accounted for at launch.

The only exceptions are the PlayStation version of Dark Forces, which was perceived to have graphical problems and the GameCube version of Jedi Outcast, which was seen as considerably <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PC and Xbox versions.|$|E
