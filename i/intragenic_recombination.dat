25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a primary immunodeficiency (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is revertant mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a reverse mutation or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination,</b> mitotic gene conversion, second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome.

50|$|The PGM1 gene is {{localized}} to {{the first}} chromosome, with its specific region being 1p31. The complete PGM1 gene spans over 65 kb and contains 11 exons, and the sites of the two mutations which form the molecular basis for the common PGM1 protein polymorphism lie in exons 4 and 8 and are 18 kb apart. Within this region there is a site of <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination.</b> There are two alternatively spliced first exons, one of which, exon 1A, is transcribed {{in a wide variety}} of cell types; the other, exon 1B, is transcribed in fast muscle tissue. Exon 1A is transcribed from a promoter that has the structural hallmarks of a housekeeping promoter but lies more than 35 kb upstream of exon 2. Exon 1B lies 6 kb upstream of exon 2 within the large first intron of the ubiquitously expressed PGM1 transcript. The fast-muscle form of PGM1 is characterized by 18 extra amino acid residues at its N-terminal end. Sequence comparisons show that exons 1A and 1B are structurally related and have arisen by duplication.|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{variation}} in the Adh region of the wild plant Arabidopsis thaliana was analyzed in 17 ecotypes sampled worldwide to investigate DNA polymorphism in natural plant populations. The investigated 2. 4 kb Adh region was divided into four blocks by <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombinations</b> between two parental sequence types that diverged 6. 3 million years (Myr) ago, if the nucleotide mutation rate μ = 10 − 9 is assumed. Within each block, dimorphism of segregating variations was observed with intermediate frequencies, which caused {{a substantial amount of}} nucleotide {{variation in}} A. thaliana at the species level. The first recombination introduced the divergent variation that resulted in dimorphism in this plant species ~ 3. 3 Myr ago, and three subsequent <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombinations</b> have occurred sporadically in ~ 1. 1 -Myr intervals. It was shown that there was only a limited number (six) of sequence types in this species and that no clear association was observed between sequence type and geographic origin. Taken together, these results suggest that A. thaliana has spread over the world only recently. It can be concluded that recombination {{played an important role in}} the evolutionary history of A. thaliana, especially through the generation of DNA polymorphism in the natural populations of this plant species...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} {{mechanisms that}} influence the evolution of bacterial transposons, DNA sequence variation was evaluated among homologs of insertion sequences IS 1, IS 3 and IS 30 from natural strains of Escherichia coli and related enteric bacteria. The nucleotide sequences within each class of IS were highly conserved among E. coli strains, over 99. 7 % similar to a consensus sequence. When compared to the range of nucleotide divergence among chromosomal genes, these data indicate high turnover and rapid movement of the transposons among clonal lineages of E. coli. In addition, length polymorphism among IS appears to be far less frequent than in eukaryotic transposons, indicating that nonfunctional elements comprise a smaller fraction of bacterial transposon populations than found in eukaryotes. IS present in other species of enteric bacteria are substantially divergent from E. coli elements, indicating that IS are mobilized among bacterial species at a reduced rate. However, homologs of IS 1 and IS 3 from diverse species provide evidence that recombination events and horizontal transfer of IS among species have both played major roles {{in the evolution of}} these elements. IS 3 elements from E. coli and Shigella show multiple, nested, <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombinations</b> with a distantly related transposon, and IS 1 homologs from diverse taxa reveal a mosaic structure indicative of multiple recombination and horizontal transfer events...|$|R

The species of Sordaria are similar morphologically, producing black perithecia containing asci with eight dark ascospores in a linear arrangement. These species share a number of characteristics that are advantageous for genetic studies. They all have a short life cycle, usually 7-12 days, and are easily grown in culture. Most species are self-fertile and each strain is isogenic. All kinds of mutants are easily induced and readily obtainable with particular ascospore color mutants. These visual mutants aid in tetrad analysis, especially in analysis of <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{account for}} high degrees of human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) diversity, a method is proposed for detecting <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> or gene conversion separately from parallel substitutions or convergent evolution. An application of the method to HLA protein sequences suggests that <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> played important roles in HLA-B and DPB 1, some in HLA-A and DRB 1, and least in HLA-C and DQB 1 diversity. However, the extent of diversity of these molecules does not necessarily correlate with the frequency of <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination,</b> supporting the view that (balancing) selection is a primary agent of HLA diversity and often leads to convergent evolution.

This is an unstable allele that undergoes somatic inactivation by <b>intragenic</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> to produce a true null allele. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for this mutation, as well as Pkd+/− mice, develop polycystic kidney and liver lesions that are indistinguishable from the human phenotype. In all cases, renal cysts arise from renal tubular cells that lose the capacity to produce Pkd 2 protein. Somatic loss of Pkd 2 expression is both necessary and sufficient for renal cyst formation in ADPKD, suggesting that PKD 2 occurs by a cellular recessive mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The cyanobacterial {{radiation}} {{consists of}} several lineages of phyletically (morphologically and genetically) related organisms. Several of these organisms show {{a striking resemblance}} to fossil counterparts. To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for stabilizing or homogenizing cyanobacterial characters, we compared the evolutionary rates and phylogenetic origins of the small-subunit rRNA-encoding DNA (16 S rDNA), the conserved gene rbcL (encoding d-ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase large subunit), and the less conserved gene rbcX. This survey includes four categories of phyletically related organisms: 16 strains of Microcystis, 6 strains of Tychonema, 10 strains of Planktothrix, and 12 strains of Nostoc. Both rbcL and rbcX can be regarded as neutrally evolving genes, with 95 to 100 % and 50 to 80 % synonymous nucleotide substitutions, respectively. There is generally low sequence divergence within the Microcystis, Tychonema, and Planktothrix categories both for rbcLX and 16 S rDNA. The Nostoc category, on the other hand, consists of three genetically clustered lineages for these loci. The 16 S rDNA and rbcLX phylogenies are not congruent for strains within the clustered groups. Furthermore, analysis of the phyletic structure for rbcLX indicates recombinational events between the informative sites within this locus. Thus, our results are best explained by a model involving both intergenic and <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombinations.</b> This evolutionary model explains the DNA sequence clustering for the modern species as a result of sequence homogenization (concerted evolution) caused by exchange of genetic material for neutrally evolving genes. The morphological clustering, on the other hand, is explained by structural and functional stability of these characters. We also suggest that exchange of genetic material for neutrally evolving genes may explain the apparent stability of cyanobacterial morphological characters, perhaps over billions of years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background HSV- 1 genome is {{a mosaic}} of recombinants. Clinical Herpes simplex virus - 1 (HSV 1) {{isolates}} were already genotyped as A, B and C types based on nucleotide variations at Unique Short (US) 4 (gG) and US 7 (gI) regions through phylogeny. Analysis of Glycoprotein C (gC) exon present on the Unique Long (UL) region had also revealed the existence of different genotypes. Glycoprotein C is mainly involved in initial viral attachment to heparan sulphate on host cell surface facilitating the virus's binding and penetration into cell. As the amount of heparan sulphate on the host cell surface varies according to the cell type, it is plausible that different genotypes bind differentially to cell types. Hence, this study was framed to determine the existence of novel genotypes/sub genotypes in the US or UL regions which could associate with clinical entities. Results All the twenty five isolates analyzed {{in this study were}} of genotype A as per their gG gene sequences. In case of gI gene, 16 out of 25 were found to be type A and the remaining nine were type B putative intergenic recombinants. <b>Intragenic</b> <b>recombinations</b> were also encountered in both the US genes, with gG possessing novel subgenotypes, arbitrarily designated A 1 and A 2. The 9 type B isolates of gI genes also branched out into 2 clades due to genetic variations. Glycoprotein C of UL region had two distinct genotypic clades α and β, whose topological distribution was significantly {{different from that of the}} US region. Neither the US nor UL regions, however, showed any preference among the genotypes to a specific anatomic site of infection. Even the non synonymous variations identified in the functional domain of gC, were not confined to a particular genotype/clinical entity. Conclusion The analyses of the US and UL regions of the HSV- 1 genome showed the existence of variegated genotypes in these two regions. In contrary to the documented literature, in which Asian strains were concluded as more conserved than European ones, our study showed the existence of a higher degree of variability among Indian strains. However, the identified novel genotypes and subgenotypes were not found associated with clinical entities. </p...|$|R

This study investigated the utility of a single copy gene, cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR), for resolving phylogenetic relationships at the sectional level within Eucalyptus. The monophyly of sections Exsertaria and Latoangulatae was explored, using section Maidenaria as an outgroup, and the impact of <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> on phylogenetic reconstruction examined. Phylogenetic analysis did not resolve monophyletic groups. Latoangulatae and Maidenaria were polyphyletic or paraphyletic. Exsertaria species formed a clade but included a single Latoangulatae species (E. major). Recombination analysis identified two <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> events that involved species from different sections, which have probably been facilitated by inter-sectional hybridisation. One of the events most likely occurred prior to speciation, with several Latoangulatae species having the recombinant allele. The other event may have occurred after speciation, since only one of two E. globulus samples possessed the recombinant allele. This is the first detailed report of <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> in both CCR and Eucalyptus, and between species of different sections of a plant genus.

Therefore, {{it is interesting to}} know whether the homologous proteins play a similar role in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Unequal sister chromatid recombination (USCR) was found to be increased in hop 1 and mek 1 single and double deletion mutants in assays for intrachromosomal recombination (ICR). Meiotic intergenic (crossover) and <b>intragenic</b> (conversion) <b>recombination</b> between homologous chromosomes was reduced. Double-strand break (DSB) levels were also lowered. Notably, deletion of hop 1 restored DSB repair in rad 50 S meiosis. This may indicate altered DSB repair kinetics in hop 1 and mek 1 deletion strains. A hypothesis is advanced proposing transient inhibition of DSB processing by Hop 1 and Mek 1 and thus providing more time for repair by interaction with the homologous chromosome. Loss of Hop 1 and Mek 1 would then result in faster repair and more interaction with the sister chromatid.

The strong effect of the locus, and the interest in ACE as a candidate gene for cardiovascular disorders, has led to extensive investigation of its relationship to the ACE phenotype, providing one of the most complete examples of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in humans. Resequencing of ACE followed by haplotype analysis in families of British and French origin has shown that the genetic variants that are primarily associated with the ACE trait map to an 18 kb interval flanked by two <b>intragenic,</b> ancestral <b>recombination</b> breakpoints. This critical interval contains dozens of ACE-associated variants in Caucasians, but identification of which of these directly influence ACE concentration is ambiguous because of the almost complete linkage disequilibrium in European populations. In a complementary sequencing and genotyping study of individuals from West African families, we show that this population has much greater haplotype diversity across the gene. Through analysis of the contrasting relationships of the trait phenotype with haplotypes that carry different allelic combinations from those observed in Caucasians, we demonstrate that (at least) two major intragenic sites within the critical interval and (at least) one minor promoter site are associated with the ACE quantitative trait through additive effects.

Sixteen of the mutations define 10 new complementation groups, bringing to 17 {{the number of}} genes identified {{to be involved in}} meiotic recombination. The mutations were grouped into three discrete classes depending on the severity of the recombination deficiency in crosses involving the ade 6 -M 26 recombination hotspot. Class I mutations caused at least a 1000 -fold reduction in M 26 -stimulated <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> at the ade 6 locus. Class II mutations reduced M 26 -stimulated recombination approximately 100 -fold. Class III mutations caused a 3 - 10 -fold reduction in either M 26 -stimulated or non-hotspot recombination. We obtained multiple alleles of class I and class II mutations, suggesting that we may be nearing saturation for mutations of this type. As a first step toward mapping, we used mitotic segregation to assign fourteen of the rec genes to chromosomes. Mutations in the six rec genes tested also caused a decrease in <b>intragenic</b> <b>recombination</b> at the ura 4 locus; five of these mutations also reduced intergenic recombination between the pro 2 and arg 3 genes. These results indicate that these multiple rec gene products are required for high level meiotic recombination throughout the S. pombe genome...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the identification, cloning and phenotypic analysis of SPO 14, a new gene required for meiosis and spore formation. Studies of strains carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation or a disruption/duplication allele indicate that spo 14 mutants have the unusual property {{of being able}} to return to mitotic division, even from the late stages of meiotic development. Early meiotic events, such as DNA replication and <b>intragenic</b> and intergenic <b>recombination,</b> occur normally. In contrast, later meiotic processes are defective in spo 14 mutants: the meiosis I division appears to be executed at slightly depressed levels, the meiosis II division is reduced more severely, and no spores are formed. Epistasis tests using mutants defective in recombination or reductional division support these findings. Based on these data, we suggest that the SPO 14 gene product is involved in the coordinate induction of late meiotic events and that this induction is responsible for the phenomenon of commitment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe PE and PPE (PE/PPE) multigene {{families}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are particularly GC-rich and share extensive homologous repetitive sequences. We hypothesized {{that they may}} undergo homologous recombination events, a mechanism rarely described in the natural evolution of mycobacteria. To test our hypothesis, we developed a specific oligonucleotide-based microarray targeting {{nearly all of the}} PE/PPE genes, aimed at detecting signals for homologous recombination. Such a microarray has never before been reported due to the multiplicity and highly repetitive and homologous nature of these sequences. Application of the microarray to a collection of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates (n = 33) representing prevalent spoligotype strain families in Tunisia allowed successful detection of six deleted genomic regions involving a total of two PE and seven PPE genes. Some of these deleted genes are known to be immunodominant or involved in virulence. The four precisely determined deletions were flanked by 400 - to 500 -bp stretches of nearly identical sequences lying mainly at the conserved N-terminal region of the PE/PPE genes. These highly homologous sequences thus serve as substrates to mediate both intergenic and <b>intragenic</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> events, indicating an important function in generating strain variation. Importantly, all recombination events yielded a new in-frame fusion chimeric gene. Hence, homologous recombination within and between PE/PPE genes likely increased their antigenic variability, which may have profound implications in pathogenicity and/or host adaptation. The finding of high prevalence (approximately 45 % and approximately 58 %) for {{at least two of the}} genomic deletions suggests that they likely confer advantageous biological attributes...|$|R
40|$|Mutants with {{enhanced}} spontaneous mutability (hsm) to canavanine resistance were {{induced by}} N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One bearing the hsm 3 - 1 mutation {{was used for}} this study. This mutation does not increase sensitivity to the lethal action of different mutagens. The hsm 3 - 1 mutation produces a mutator phenotype, enhancing the rates of spontaneous mutation to canavanine resistance and reversions of lys 1 - 1 and his 1 - 7. This mutation increases the rate of <b>intragenic</b> mitotic <b>recombination</b> at the ADE 2 gene. The ability of the hsm 3 mutant to correct DNA heteroduplex is reduced {{in comparison with the}} wild-type strain. All these phenotypes are similar to ones caused by pms 1, mlhl and msh 2 mutations. In contrast to these mutations, hsm 3 - 1 increases the frequency of ade mutations induced by 6 -HAP and UV light. Epistasis analysis of double mutants shows that the PMS 1 and HSM 3 genes control different mismatch repair systems. The HSM 3 gene maps to the right arm of chromosome II, 25 cM distal to the HIS 7 gene. Strains that bear a deleted open reading frame YBR 272 c have the genetic properties of the hsm 3 mutant. The HSM 3 product shows weak similarity to predicted products of the yeast MSH genes (homologs of the Escherichia coli mutS gene). The HSM 3 gene may {{be a member of the}} yeast MutS homolog family, but its function in DNA metabolism differs from the functions of other yeast MutS homologs...|$|R
