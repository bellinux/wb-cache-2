50|$|Arsenic is a n-type dopant. Its slower {{diffusion}} allows {{using it}} for <b>diffused</b> <b>junctions.</b> Used for buried layers. Has similar atomic radius to silicon, high concentrations can be achieved. Its diffusivity is about a tenth of phosphorus or boron, so is used where the dopant should stay in place during subsequent thermal processing. Useful for shallow diffusions where well-controlled abrupt boundary is desired. Preferred dopant in VLSI circuits. Preferred dopant in low resistivity ranges.|$|R
50|$|For the Group IV {{semiconductors}} such as diamond, silicon, germanium, silicon carbide, and silicon germanium, {{the most}} common dopants are acceptors from Group III or donors from Group V elements. Boron, arsenic, phosphorus, and occasionally gallium are used to dope silicon. Boron is the p-type dopant of choice for silicon integrated circuit production because it diffuses {{at a rate that}} makes junction depths easily controllable. Phosphorus is typically used for bulk-doping of silicon wafers, while arsenic is used to <b>diffuse</b> <b>junctions,</b> because it <b>diffuses</b> more slowly than phosphorus and is thus more controllable.|$|R

Thin tunnel dielectrics (6 - 12 Ã) are fabricated using methods adapted from IC processing. These serve as diffusion barriers and passivation layers. When combined with heavily doped polysilicon, they can form an ideal step junction with interface passivation, enabling low dark currents not possible with diffused emitters.

Four n+-p <b>diffused</b> <b>junction</b> cells, an early product of an InP development program, were flown. The voltage range of the data prohibits determination of the open-circuit voltage or the maximum power point. However, analysis of the 32 months of short-circuit current data reveals a slight increase, not the 4 percent decrease expected from radiation tolerance studies.

The activated hematite exhibited higher nanoelectric conductivity that was probed by a PeakForce TUNA AFM method.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to show whether or not pulsed excimer laser annealing (PELA) of ion-implanted junctions is a cost effective replacement for <b>diffused</b> <b>junctions</b> in fabricating crystalline silicon solar cells. The preliminary economic analysis completed shows {{that the use of}} PELA to fabricate both the front junction and back surface field (BSF) would cost approximately 35 cents per peak watt (Wp), compared to a cost of 15 cents/Wp for diffusion, aluminum BSF and an extra cleaning step in the baseline process. The cost advantage of the PELA process depends on improving the average cell efficiency from 14 % to 16 %, which would lower the overall cost of the module by about 15 cents/Wp. An optimized PELA process compatible with commercial production is to be developed, and increased cell efficiency with sufficient product for adequate statistical analysis demonstrated. An excimer laser annealing station was set-up and made operational. The first experiment used 248 nm radiation to anneal phosphorus implants in polished and texture-etched silicon...|$|R

The proposed approach includes the effects of bandgap narrowing, Fermi-Dirac statistics, built-in field due to impurity profile, and a finite surface recombination velocity at the emitter surface. It is demonstrated that the transparent-emitter model can predict experimental values of Voc observed on n(plus) -p thin <b>diffused</b> <b>junction</b> silicon solar cells made on low-resistivity (0. 1 ohm-cm) substrates.

Device performance over a temperature range of 77 K to 150 K is given. These detectors were designed to detect low-energy X-rays in the presence of minimum ionizing electrons. The successful application of silicon-diffused junction technology to X-ray detector fabrication may facilitate the development of other novel silicon X-ray detector designs...|$|E
40|$|MIS-IL {{solar cells}} are {{potentially}} low-cost devices, {{due to their}} simplicity and avoidance of the high-temperatures in their fabrication processing. In addition, inversion-layer (IL) solar cells are demonstrated to have higher collection efficiencies at short wavelengths. The spectral response of MIS-IL solar cells has been measured in the wavelength range 340 - 1100 nm. From these measurements, the external and internal quantum efficiencies have been determined. Also, a comparative study of the quantum efficiencies of inversion layer and <b>diffused</b> <b>junction</b> cells has been carried out. The IL cell has a higher collection-efficiency for carriers generated by ultra-violet light than the conventional p-n junction solar cell.

40|$|Deep level {{transient}} spectroscopy {{was used}} to monitor thermal annealing of trapping centers in electron irradiated n(+) p InP junctions grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, at temperatures ranging from 500 up to 650 K. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} behavior of the minority carrier (electron) traps EA (0. 24 eV), EC (0. 12 eV), and ED (0. 31 eV) which have received considerably less attention than the majority carrier (hole) traps H 3, H 4, and H 5, although this work does extend the annealing behavior of the hole traps to higher temperatures than previously reported. It is found that H 5 begins to anneal above 500 K and is completely removed by 630 K. The electron traps begin to anneal above 540 K and are reduced to about half intensity by 630 K. Although they each have slightly different annealing temperatures, EA, EC, and ED are all removed by 650 K. A new hole trap called H 3 '(0. 33 eV) grows as the other traps anneal and is the only trap remaining at 650 K.

A double a-Si:H/c-Si is deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition to sandwich the substrate, at the sunward surface to form the emitter and at the rear side to act as back surface field. High open-circuit current (625 mV) is obtained on flat p-type mc-Si, whereas commercial acidic surface treatment, commonly used in <b>diffused</b> <b>junction</b> mc-Si solar cell fabrication, requires a level of passivation which is not easily achievable using the very thin a-Si:H film needed in heterojunction technology.

40|$|Dividing the {{detector}} crystal into discrete pixels enables making an imaging detector, {{in which the}} charge collected by each pixel can be read separately. Even if {{the detector}} is not meant for imaging, patterns on the crystal surface {{may be used as}} guard structures that control and limit the flow of charges in the crystal. This has been exceedingly hard for the detector crystals having thick diffused layers. The paper reports a patterning method of the thick <b>diffused</b> <b>junctions</b> on CdTe. The patterning method of In-diffused pn-junction on CdTe chip is demonstrated by using a diamond blade. The patterning is done by removing material from the pn-junction side of the chip, so that the trenches penetrate the diffused layer. As the trenches extend deeper into the bulk than the junction, the regions separated by the trench are electrically isolated. Electrical characterization results are reported for the strips separated by trenches with various depths. The strip isolation is clearly seen in both measured leakage currents and inter-strip resistances. The paper also represents the first images of the pixelated CdTe chips bump bonded to the Medipix 2 readout chip. The images were taken with the Sr 90 source. The CdTe chips had 110 μm× 110 μm and 55 μm× 55 μm pixel grid spacing.
