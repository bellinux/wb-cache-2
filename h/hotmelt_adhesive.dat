40|$|The {{object of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is the analyze {{the impact of}} extremely low temperatures to the bonded joint of ABS furniture edges and PB. Temperature {{is one of the}} factors with a significant influence of strength of bonded joints, which has a major impact on the selection of a suitable adhesive. It should withstand extremely low and high temperatures and therefore should has adequate properties which are related to the conditions for transport logistics. Thesis deals with the strength of the bond furniture edges, which is subjected of cyclic thermal loading. The bond strength is tested by peeling ABS edges at 90 ° and by shear loading at 45 °. The research worked with available and commonly used materials (ABS and PB) and bonded joint was connected with <b>hotmelt</b> <b>adhesive</b> PUR. The results were statistically processed, interpreted in the text and graphically depicted. In the final part of the thesis was the issue comprehensively evaluated and conclusions were expressed...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} the {{development}} of conductive and mechanically improved adhesives, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were dispersed by melt mixing into a non-reactive polyolefine based <b>hotmelt</b> <b>adhesive.</b> The composite materials, containing 0. 5 to 5. 0 wt% multi-walled CNTs (MWNTs), showed electrical percolation at about 0. 75 wt%. Investigations of the mechanical properties using tensile tests resulted in a significant enhancement of Young's modulus up to 372 % and nearly doubling of tensile strength at 5. 0 wt%. Even if the hotmelt material is highly elastic compared to typical thermoplastic matrices, the melt mixing resulted in suitable CNT dispersion. The melt viscosity increased with CNT loading, however near the observed electrical percolation threshold the processability was not notably reduced. Most important, next to conductivity at low CNT loadings, also a significant enhancement in the shear strength of bonded joints of AlMg 3 up to values of 250 % of the pure hotmelt could be obtained. The property profile can be tailored with CNT concentration, indicating the suitability of CNT addition into these hotmelt adhesives...|$|E

40|$|Carton board {{packages}} are often closed with an adhesive. The adhesive joint thus formed has {{to meet the}} demands during the entire product life from converting to end-use. The adhesive joint has to be characterized if it is good or bad for the actual application. Today such characterization is done by manually peeling the joint, immediately after the adhesive application in the gluing machine. The manual peel test is a subjective test that is operator dependent. An operator needs long experience to be able to perform a manual peel test. Therefore, the packaging industry is interested in a test method that can objectively predict good or bad adhesive joints. The adhesive joints have been tested in the so-called Y-peel test arrangement. An advantage of the Y-peel test is that it gives an objective result from the force–elongation curve. Testing has been performed with carton boards of two different thicknesses. <b>Hotmelt</b> <b>adhesive</b> was used and the open time was varied in the glue applicator. It was found that the Y-peel test gives results in qualitative agreement with the manual peel test. Moreover, by evaluating the energy consumption (dissipative energy) during the Y-peel test it was possible to obtain not only a qualitative but also a quantitative assessment of the adhesive joint...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{adhesive}} bonds {{are more and}} more used in structural joints where mechanical performance is crucial. Currently, many different material types are combined in a sole product. Especially in applications where lightweight materials are used, adhesive bonded joints can offer distinct advantages over traditional joining techniques like welding, bolting and riveting. The possibility to join different material types and the ability to smoothen structural stress concentrations are very attractive from a mechanical-elastic point of view. A lot of research work has already been carried out in the field of adhesives. However, much of the documented work mainly focuses on the more fundamental physical-chemical properties of the different adhesive types, the substrate adhesion and theoretical models that describe the viscoelastic behaviour of adhesives. There are not many publications that discuss application driven research on elastic properties of adhesive joints, certainly not in the area of structural dynamics. There is a high number of environmental parameters that influence the elastic behaviour of an adhesive joint. Therefore, also the vibration behaviour of adhesively bonded structures is a process that is subjected to many uncertainties. This paper focusses on the joining of glass fibre reinforced polypropylene honeycomb sandwich panels by means of a <b>hotmelt</b> <b>adhesive</b> bond. The simple case of lap-joining two rectangular panels is considered. A first part discusses the adhesive type and bonding application. It thereby focusses on the estimation of elastic properties of the bonded zone. The second part estimates the impact of the uncertainty on bonding parameters on the resonant behaviour of the two joined honeycomb panels. As reference data, experimentally determined resonance frequencies and mode shapes under free boundary conditions are used. This part fully discusses how finite element modelling is used to estimate the bonding layer’s shear modulus. The third part discusses the influence of vibration frequency, temperature and amplitude on the bonding layer’s complex shear modulus. Various validation experiments are considered. Finally, the paper summarizes the research work and prospects to further application driven research. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{covers a}} {{recently}} completed research project in Germany aimed at {{using a new}} rapid adhesive bonding technology in wood panel construction for modular prefabricated houses, which is an increasingly popular way of building single-family houses in Central Europe. In general, the prefabricated panels are built up by planking a frame of woodensquare ribs with particleboards. Nailing or stapling has been the main joining technique so far. A new approach was established by applying an adhesive tape based on an adhesively coated metallic carrier inserted into the joint. By connecting it to an electric power supply and heating it {{within a short time}} to the melting point, the adhesive can wet the wood andcure in the compressed joint. Different thin metallic carriers made of sheets of steel, aluminum, and brass or expanded metal were used and combined with adhesives, such as polyurethane <b>hotmelts</b> (PUR), PUR <b>adhesive</b> dispersions, andco-polyamides. Because of the requirements for structural joining in the building industry, different European Standards, such as EN 15425 [EN 15425 : 2008, “Adhesives—One Component Polyurethane for Load Bearing Timber Structures—Classification and Performance Requirements,” CEN-CENELEC, Brussels, Belgium, 2008], and preparation according to EN 302 - 1 [EN 302 - 1 : 2013, “Adhesives for Load-Bearing Timber Structures—Test Methods—Part 1 : Determination of Longitudinal Tensile Shear Strength,” CEN-CENELEC, Brussels, Belgium, 2013], were discussed and implemented to find out whether a combination of squared timber, new tapes, and attached panel materials are sufficient ornot. In this paper, this new method and the material testing are introduced, from early screening for suitable adhesives to semi-sized panelspecimens {{in the context of the}} European Standards...|$|R
