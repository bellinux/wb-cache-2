40|$|Geometric and {{geographic}} data have special {{demands on the}} database query mechanism. To store and retrieve huge amounts of geo data, special spatial databases thus offer geometric column types and spatial indexes. Even though spatial databases are {{getting more and more}} available, spatial operations are not standardized, thus applications cannot easily switch between different databases. Moreover, spatial databases are not available for all platforms. Mobile device platforms, e. g., usually only support standard databases without any spatial extensions. Our approach is thus based on relational standard databases and we introduce a spatial add-on that translates geometric queries to standard SQL. It provides a new spatial index, the Extended Split Index, which is optimized for the add-on. It especially avoids any <b>index</b> <b>reorganization,</b> makes use of one-dimensional non-spatial indexes available in SQL databases and heavily reduces the number of candidates that have to undergo further geometric checks. We demonstrate the strength of our approach with a performance evaluation based on more than 200 000 geo objects...|$|E
40|$|Many location-based {{applications}} {{have arisen}} in various areas including mobile communications, traffic control and military {{command and control}} (C 2) systems. And {{one of the important}} research issue in these areas is tracking and managing moving objects through spatiotemporal indexing for the efficient location-based services. However, managing exact geometric location information is difficult to be achieved due to continual changes of moving objects. Traditionally spatiotemporal index structures focus on optimizing the node accesses during construction and massive updates that do not refer on-line movement updates. In this paper we propose an indexing framework for future location queries based on space partitioning and the dual transformation. Our method provides a constraint database approach for constructing indexes to improve the efficiency of spatiotemporal query answering. In addition, the performance enhancement is achieved by our cost-based dynamic management algorithm that determines the appropriate <b>index</b> <b>reorganization</b> probabilistically induced by various mobility models and query cost functions. This approach can be applied for the predictive range queries on moving object’s trajectories specifically in the mobile communication environments. We evaluate our method and compare the performance with the related spatiotemporal index structures in the simulated environments...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{operational}} or Live BI (Business Intelligence) that requires immediate syn-chronization between the operational source systems and the data warehouse infrastructure {{in order to achieve}} high up-to-dateness for analytical query re-sults. The high performance requirements imposed by many ad-hoc queries are typically addressed with read-optimized column stores and in-memory data management. However, Live BI additionally requires transactional and update-friendly in-memory indexing due to high update rates of propagated data. For ex-ample, in-memory indexing with prefix trees exhibits a well-balanced read/write performance because no <b>index</b> <b>reorganization</b> is required. The vision of this project is to use the underlying in-memory index struc-tures, in the form of prefix trees, for query processing as well. Prefix trees are used as intermediate results of a plan and thus, all database operations can benefit from the structure of the in-memory index by pruning working indices during query execution. While, this is advantageous in terms of the asymptotic time com-plexity of certain operations, major challenges arise at the same time. In this paper, we sketch our preliminary results. Efficient query processing over huge evolving data sets will enable a broader use of the consolidated enterprise data. Finally, this is a fundamental prereq-uisite for extending the scope of BI from strategic and dispositive levels to the operational level...|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen wide {{availability}} of solid-state drives (SSDs) in settings ranging from personal computing to enterprise storage. Their success over the hard disks is driven by performance considerations and cost savings. Besides SSDs based on flash memory, there have been ongoing efforts in developing other non-volatile memory technologies such as phase-change memory and MRAM. All these technologies enable what we refer to as random-access block devices. Unlike hard disks, these devices have fast random accesses; on the other hand, their writes are more expensive than their reads. In this work, we study how to optimize database and storage algorithms for the I/O characteristics of random-access block devices. Specifically, we tackle the following three problems. The first one is about permuting data out-of-core. While external merge sort is popular for implementing permutation on hard disks, it carries unnecessary overhead in storing and comparing keys. We propose more efficient algorithms for a useful class of permutations called Address-Digit Permutations on random-access block devices. The second problem is concurrency control for indexes on SSDs. Various indexes have been proposed for these devices, but to make such indexes practical, we must {{address the issue of}} concurrency control. We propose a novel indexing and concurrency control scheme which allows concurrent accesses during ongoing <b>index</b> <b>reorganizations,</b> and does so with minimal memory and block-level locking. The third problem concerns log-structured merge, a popular indexing technique well-suited to random-access block devices. We show how an intelligent partial merge policy, combined with a block-preserving merge procedure, can ­significantly lower write traffic while preserving other advantages of log-structured merge.

40|$|Evidence {{supports}} the intricate relationship between sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spindling and cognitive abilities {{in children and}} adults. Although sleep EEG changes during adolescence <b>index</b> fundamental brain <b>reorganization,</b> {{a detailed analysis of}} sleep spindling and the spindle-intelligence relationship was not yet provided for adolescents. Therefore, adolescent development of sleep spindle oscillations were studied in a home polysomnographic study focusing on the effects of chronological age and developmentally acquired overall mental efficiency (fluid IQ) with sex as a potential modulating factor. Subjects were 24 healthy adolescents (12 males) with an age range of 15 – 22 years (mean: 18 years) and fluid IQ of 91 – 126 (mean: 104. 12, Raven Progressive Matrices Test). Slow spindles (SSs) and fast spindles (FSs) were analyzed in 21 EEG derivations by using the individual adjustment method (IAM). A significant age-dependent increase in average FS density (r = 0. 57; p = 0. 005) was found. Moreover, fluid IQ correlated with FS density (r = 0. 43; p = 0. 04) and amplitude (r = 0. 41; p = 0. 049). The latter effects were entirely driven by particularly reliable FS-IQ correlations in females [r = 0. 80 (p = 0. 002) and r = 0. 67 (p = 0. 012), for density and amplitude, respectively]. Region-specific analyses revealed that these correlations peak in the fronto-central regions. The control of the age-dependence of FS measures and IQ scores did not considerably reduce the spindle-IQ correlations with respect to FS density. The only positive spindle-index of fluid IQ in males {{turned out to be the}} frequency of FSs (r = 0. 60, p = 0. 04). Increases in FS density during adolescence may index reshaped structural connectivity related to white matter maturation in the late developing human brain. The continued development over this age range of cognitive functions is indexed by specific measures of sleep spindling unraveling gender differences in adolescent brain maturation and perhaps cognitive strategy...|$|R
