5|$|For {{its entire}} length, White Deer Hole Creek {{runs along the}} north side of South White Deer Ridge, an east-west ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain form the {{northern}} edge of the creek valley. There are 24 unnamed tributaries {{on the south side of}} the creek, all flowing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> South White Deer Ridge, while there are only 11 tributaries on the north side, including Spring Creek.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current, useless locations. As men scrambled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to Ostend to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal {{was the last to}} leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all {{around the edge of the}} bailey wall. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the keep.|$|E

5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun to {{overflow}} at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhumation}} of Yagan's head eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating {{six feet}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the grave, then tunnelling horizontally {{to the location}} of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building {{at the top of}} the hill next to The Woodman public house with a pair of escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single, upwards only, escalator was provided to take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit {{at the top of the}} cutting.|$|E
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the plunger. Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E

5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrive at}} the planet and travel to an {{underground}} vault which had been ransacked. As {{they are about to}} leave, Worf discovers a secret chamber containing the sword. They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras who had hired the Lethean and wants the sword for the prestige of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit, they head into the adjoining cave system {{in order to try to}} get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons begin to be affected by the prestige of the sword. Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a cliff but refuses to let go of the sword. Worf grabs the other end of the sword, and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up.|$|E
