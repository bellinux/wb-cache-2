Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are metonyms for a swineherd, while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an oxherd and Shepherd (1279 onwards) means as <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> herder of sheep.|$|E

Commenting on his writing for trio and quartet, Taborn stated that [...] "I like multiple kinds of rhythmic things.

500|$|Indestructible did, however, receive criticism. IGN writer Jim Kaz {{proposes that}} vocalist David Draiman has an [...] "overly-forced" [...] vocal delivery. Kaz also finds, [...] "The tunes are largely similar {{in style and}} {{structure}} ... In essence, there's very little that stands out." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that the album already seems obsolete, [...] "There's just too much of the very recent past on Indestructible to move away from it. So in effect, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> bit dated ... already." [...] It is also suggested that, although possessing a reliably solid foundation, the album lacks a meaning behind its drive: [...] "They wind up sounding a little lost on Indestructible, stabbing their weapons without any reasons behind each parry," [...] says PopMatters writer Andrew Blackie.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic {{called the}} song a [...] "mid-tempo, strummy folk tune {{with a real}} catch-on falsetto melody," [...] giving its 7" [...] single a four-star review, {{summarizing}} that the release [...] "could be a lost single from a brilliant, obscure '60s psych-folk band while still sounding far ahead of its time." [...] Rolling Stone ranked it the [...] "most affecting" [...] song from Oh, Inverted World, describing it as [...] "a shuffling folk ballad with a spaghetti-western feel and a somber melody that could have come off an Elliott Smith album." [...] Pitchfork Media panned the song, deeming it an imitation of Simon & Garfunkel. The New York Times also covered the song, noting that [...] "It has an odd, slightly serpentine vocal melody (<b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> bit like an adapted madrigal), and the lyrics are absurd and somehow touching." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and it sounds very like you... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] has {{similarities}} to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's [...] "Turn Down for What" [...] (2013) with Madonna's vocals reminiscent of singer Miley Cyrus' autotuned rapping. The song has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning" [...] dubstep composition. It {{begins with the}} sound of acoustic guitar reminiscent of Avicii's single [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] (2012), as Madonna coos in the background, [...] "You're gonna love this", but quickly transitions into what critic Sasha Geffen calls [...] "past stadium-filling EDM" [...] and into [...] "a genre that more commonly fills the headphones of kids surfing obscure music blogs late at night. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> little like vaporwave". The track deviates from a traditional song structure and hook, instead featuring harsh cuts, synths and Madonna singing in a nasal tone. Minaj raps in the track, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like, [...] "I just wanna have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight", [...] "alternating between pitch-shifted shrieks of 'Who do you think you are??' and the sing-songy title taunt." [...] Regarding her profuse usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the song (along with another song [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] from Rebel Heart), Madonna defended her decision to Billboard, saying: ...|$|E

50|$|The dulcitone is a {{transposing}} {{instrument of}} the idiophone class; <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>an</b> octave higher than the standard (eight foot pitch) written pitch. It has a five octave written range from AA to a3 (sounding range from A to a4). And almost different than piano.|$|R

500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E

[...] "He reckons that if this trauma happened {{to you when you}} were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six.

2500|$|The album {{concludes with}} the love songs, [...] "Comfort You", [...] "Come Here My Love", and [...] "Country Fair"—the latter two {{employing}} the traditional Irish ballad style. [...] To Clinton Heylin, the songs also spoke to [...] "the {{healing power of}} love... here at last are songs that speak of {{what he can do}} for her, rather than concerned solely with his needs and wants." [...] Heylin comments on the song, [...] "Come Here My Love": [...] "This is no 'Autumn Song'. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> lot like a man learning how to love again." [...] Morrison spoke of [...] "Country Fair" [...] as having the same kind of feeling as [...] "And It Stoned Me", although that song was used to open the Moondance album, instead of as a kind of closure.|$|E
