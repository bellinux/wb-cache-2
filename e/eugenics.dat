5|$|In 1907, Indiana {{became the}} first state to adopt <b>eugenics</b> legislation, that allowed the {{involuntary}} sterilization of dangerous male criminals and the mentally defectives. It was never put in effect and in 1921 Indiana {{became the first}} state to rule such legislation unconstitutional when the Supreme Court of Indiana acted. A revised <b>eugenics</b> law was passed in 1927, and it remained in effect until 1974.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} <b>eugenics</b> policy, the Nazis {{believed}} that the disabled were a burden to society because they needed care and were considered an affront to their notion of a society composed of a perfect race. About 375,000 people were sterilized against their will due to their disabilities.|$|E

40|$|In modern Japanese history, <b>eugenic</b> {{ideas were}} {{manifested}} {{at their most}} extreme in sanatoria {{for the treatment of}} Hansen's Disease (leprosy). There, "There are no means to support children," and "it's a pity for the child" were given as reasons for the sterilization, abortion, and other <b>eugenic</b> surgeries that had long been performed on the patients. Putting peremptory, forced <b>eugenic</b> surgeries aside, I take as my topic the cases where patients themselves chose to accept (or {{had no choice but to}} accept) the <b>eugenic</b> surgeries. When faced with the serious decision of a <b>eugenic</b> surgery, what logic did patients use to manage their wavering feelings, and persuade themselves to have it done? In this article I read literary works written by former patients, examining the process through which they accepted the <b>eugenic</b> surgery and the course of their mind. After the war, the importance of the problem of <b>eugenic</b> surgery was often an important theme in patient literature. I believe these works of literature are an important resource for thinking about the above problem. 論文 Article...|$|R

5|$|Marshall was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Indiana's recently passed <b>eugenics</b> and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of <b>eugenics</b> laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship {{was the first in}} which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including personally laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{exists that}} the State of North Carolina’s <b>eugenic</b> {{sterilization}} program was genocidal {{insofar as it}} specifically targeted blacks. In this paper, we consider {{the extent to which}} this race-specific phenomena was consistent with a policy whereby state-sanctioned <b>eugenic</b> sterilization subsidized the effort monitoring of business firms to maximize worker effort and minimize wages and public assistance expenditures on a population outside of the employed labor force. To explore this practice we utilize data on <b>eugenic</b> sterilizations in the state of North Carolina between 1958 - 1968. Count data parameter estimates from a specification that conditions county-level <b>eugenic</b> sterilizations on measures of race-specific components of the surplus population reveals that the frequency of state-sanctioned sterilization increased with a county’s surplus black population. Our results are consistent with an obscene political economy and social policy whereby <b>eugenic</b> sterilizations emerged as a principal-agent equilibrium and were genocidal in a particular way—they were aimed at the economic breeding-out of an undesirable surplus black population...|$|R
5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life.

5|$|Himmler was a main {{architect}} of the Holocaust, using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education.

As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted {{with the principles of}} selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through <b>eugenics,</b> to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of the}} war.|$|E

40|$|In {{her essay}} on popular self-improvement {{literature}} from the 1930 s, particularly {{the writings of}} Walter B. Pitkin, Susan Currell points to the rhetorical overlaps between the personal and the political in the arenas of decline and recovery. She intertwines three narratives in her argument: Franklin Delano Roosevelt's personal struggle with polio, so resolutely overcome to establish his fitness for the presidency; the lessons Roosevelt and many other Americans learned from physical fitness guru Bernarr Macfadden, lessons that strongly pushed <b>eugenic</b> principles; and Pitkins personal <b>eugenic</b> beliefs and the ways that these infused his highly popular writings on self-improvement. In each of these narratives, the heavy emphasis on exterior environmental actions that one could perform for self-improvement seemed to overturn mainline <b>eugenic</b> emphases on the Mendelian genetics that was so prevalent in the 1920 s, {{to the extent that}} traditional <b>eugenic</b> principles of controlling heredity became hidden. Yet as Currell, Kline, and others throughout this volume argue, <b>eugenic</b> assumptions still ran deep, serving as the foundation on which environmental contexts were built. Each of these three men, in their respective areas, assumed an inherent genetic potential 'for themselves, for middle-class individuals, for the nation as a whole' that could only be brought forth through hard work and willpower. Currell's essay thus illuminates how fundamental <b>eugenic</b> beliefs became infused with and perhaps overshadowed by a heightened emphasis in the 1930 s on environmental influences as the means to stem decline and spur recovery and a return to overall personal and national <b>eugenic</b> fitness...|$|R

Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having {{lost contact with}} the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the <b>Eugenics</b> Wars.

5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the <b>eugenics</b> policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1928, Agârbiceanu, a {{recipient}} of the National Prize for Literature, headed the Cluj chapter of Astra and edited Transilvania. It was in this magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of <b>eugenics,</b> calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his participation was somewhat incongruous, but Agârbiceanu did not see a conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws. From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congresses and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries {{in places such as}} Aleșd.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the <b>eugenics</b> movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

He was seriously wounded in action near Rostov-on-Don in mid-1942, and was declared unfit for further active service. After recovery, he was transferred to the Race and Resettlement Office in Berlin. He also resumed his association with von Verschuer, who was at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and <b>Eugenics.</b> Mengele was promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) in April 1943.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by German and American examples, he {{successfully}} {{asked the}} council to construct a system of villas at Bexley, advocated the separate treatment of acute and chronic cases, and introduced parole-style rewards for 'industrious' patients. Like some of his earlier administrative innovations, villas became popular and inspired similar designs elsewhere. Stansfield also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, and as a consultant on nervous diseases to the Eastern Command. Although he was appointed a CBE in 1919 for his war work, historians have drawn attention to his scepticism about shell shock, his attitudes towards <b>eugenics</b> and heredity, and his potentially misogynistic views about medical officers marrying. He nonetheless married twice, settling with his first wife at a house in Wimbledon where he enjoyed tending to the gardens; after her death, he married a second time in 1929 {{and moved to a}} villa in Sanremo, Italy, where he lived out his retirement.|$|E
