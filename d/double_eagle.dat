5|$|The Saint-Gaudens <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> is a twenty-dollar gold coin, or <b>double</b> <b>eagle,</b> {{produced}} by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933. The coin is named after its designer, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It {{is considered by many}} to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{started to}} push for {{improvements}} to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign coins which could be changed under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for the <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> and eagle, though the <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief {{before it could be}} released as a circulating coin. Redesign of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} awards {{presented}} to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The {{player who has}} the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> win a large crystal bowl. For each eagle a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.|$|E
500|$|Large {{quantities}} of <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were melted in the 1930s {{by the government}} after they were called in under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although many of the <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> exported in bulk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were melted—records show that most sent to the United Kingdom were recoined into sovereigns—millions remained in banks. Large {{quantities of}} <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> {{were found in the}} vaults of European banks beginning in the 1940s, and were placed on the numismatic market. Many common and low-grade Liberty Head <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> have been sold as investments, valued based on their bullion content. Type I <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> have been recovered from shipwrecks, bringing many high-grade early specimens onto the market, with the romance of [...] "treasure coins" [...] increasing the public demand.|$|R
25|$|Coin {{experts in}} the numismatic world have {{advanced}} an argument that Switt could have legally obtained the 1933 coins when he was exchanging gold bullion for coins. Although the Mint records clearly show that no 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were issued, there were allegedly three weeks in March 1933 when new <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> could possibly have been legally obtained. The mint began striking <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> on March 15, and Roosevelt's executive order to ban them was not finalized until April 5. On March 6, 1933, the Secretary of the Treasury ordered the Director of the Mint to pay gold only under license issued by the Secretary, and the United States Mint cashier's daily statements do not reflect that any 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were paid out.|$|R
25|$|Gold eagles {{were issued}} for {{circulation}} by the United States Mint from 1795–1933, half eagles from 1795–1929, quarter eagles from 1796–1929, and <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> from 1850–1933, with occasional production gaps for each type. The diameter of eagles was 27mm, half eagles 21mm, quarter <b>eagles</b> 17mm, and <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> 34mm.|$|R
5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 {{expressed}} his {{dissatisfaction with the}} artistic state of American coins, and hoped to hire sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to beautify them. Saint-Gaudens, {{before his death in}} 1907, designed a new eagle and <b>double</b> <b>eagle,</b> which entered circulation that year; the cent, quarter eagle, and half eagle were redesigned by other artists and were released into circulation by 1909. That year, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed Barber to make pattern coins for new nickels. Most of these coins featured the first president, George Washington. However, the project was discontinued when Leach left office on November 1, 1909, to be replaced by Abram Andrew.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, due to {{perceived}} {{conflicts of interest}} limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from {{the management of the}} <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.|$|E
50|$|Gold eagles {{were issued}} for {{circulation}} by the United States Mint from 1795-1933, half eagles from 1795-1929, quarter eagles from 1796-1929, and <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> from 1850-1933, with occasional production gaps for each type. The diameter of eagles was 27 mm, half eagles 21 mm, quarter eagles 17 mm, and <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> 34 mm.|$|R
500|$|Many <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> {{were struck}} at San Francisco between 1877 and 1883. Beginning in 1881, mintage of <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> at Philadelphia was sharply curtailed. [...] For {{the seven years}} 1881–1887, only 4,521 were made at that mint for circulation, none being struck in 1882, 1883, and 1887. They were struck yearly in proof at Philadelphia: the 1883 (mintage 92), 1884 (71) and 1887 (121) are great rarities. The mintage of 2,325 at New Orleans in 1879, the only postwar strikings there, is unexplained—Breen {{suggested}} that the local mint superintendent might have anticipated a demand for the denomination. [...] <b>Double</b> <b>eagles</b> were unpopular in commerce in the South, as were <b>eagles.</b> Millions of <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were sent to Europe as payment in international transactions beginning in the 1880s, often in cloth bags containing 250 coins, {{for a total of}} $5,000 per bag.|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1970s (when President Nixon took the United States off the gold {{standard}} and President Ford signed legislation that again made it legal {{for the public to}} own gold bullion), any recovered 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle,</b> as gold bullion, was required to be melted. Therefore, while double eagles recovered prior to 1974 were melted down, any <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> recovered now can be spared this fate. Currently, {{with the exception of the}} one sold on July 30, 2002, 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> coins cannot be the legal possession of any member of the public, as they were never issued and hence remain the property of the United States government.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{high-grade}} San Francisco Type I <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> {{known today}} {{were taken from}} shipwrecks, where they had rested for over a century. [...] These ships included the SS Brother Jonathan, the SS Central America, and the SS Yankee Blade. Thousands of almost-pristine 1857 <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> struck at San Francisco (1857-S) went down with the Central America when it sank off the East Coast of the United States that September, as did some 435 people, including Captain William Herndon. [...] The cargo was salvaged beginning in the 1980s; once litigation over its ownership was settled, the pieces were marketed to the public. The Brother Jonathan, a luxurious paddle steamer en route from San Francisco north to Portland, sank in July 1865; few survived the wreck. [...] The thousands of <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> and other coins on board were salvaged beginning in 1996, and once litigation concluded, many mint state <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> came on the market.|$|R

25|$|The 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> is a United States 20-dollar gold coin. Although 445,500 {{specimens}} of this Saint-Gaudens <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> were minted in 1933, none were ever officially circulated {{and all but}} two were ordered melted down. However, 20 more {{are known to have}} been rescued from melting by being stolen, and found their way into the hands of collectors. 19 of these were subsequently recovered by the Secret Service, who destroyed nine of them, making this one of the world's rarest coins.|$|E

500|$|As {{it became}} clear in the 1940s that the {{withdrawal}} of gold coins in 1933 had left several late-date Saint-Gaudens <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> unexpectedly rare, collector interest grew in the denomination. The massive importation of <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> held overseas once Americans were allowed to own gold again in 1974 added to the supply, but according to numismatic writer and coin dealer Bowers, [...] "today they are of such wide popularity, fascination, and interest that the record prices achieved [...] seem like incredible bargains!" ...|$|R
25|$|According {{to various}} accounts, Israel Switt had many {{contacts}} and friends within the Philadelphia Mint, and reportedly {{had access to}} many points of the minting process. A secondary source reports that the Secret Service found that only one man, George McCann, {{had access to the}} coins at the time and served prison time for a similar embezzlement in 1940. Switt may have obtained the stolen 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> through a relationship with the head mint cashier. One theory is that McCann swapped previous year <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> for the 1933 specimens prior to melting, thus avoiding compromise of accounting books and inventory lists.|$|R

The ROV can be modified to double as a self-propelled variable depth sonar: the Mark II <b>Double</b> <b>Eagles</b> fitted to the French Navy's Tripartite class minehunters have been altered to carry a Thales TSM 2022 sonar, while a similar upgrade is to occur to the Mark III units being acquired for the Tripartites of the Royal Netherlands Navy.|$|R

25|$|The missing <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> was {{acquired}} by King Farouk of Egypt, who was a voracious collector of many things, including imperial Fabergé eggs, antique aspirin bottles, paperweights, postage stamps—and coins, {{of which he had}} a collection of over 8,500. In 1944 Farouk purchased a 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle,</b> and in strict adherence with the law, his ministers applied to the United States Treasury Department for an export license for the coin. Mistakenly, just days before the mint theft was discovered, the license was granted. The Treasury Department attempted to work through diplomatic channels to request the return of the coin from Egypt, but World War II delayed their efforts for several years. In 1952, King Farouk was deposed in a coup d'etat, and many of his possessions were made available for public auction (run by Sotheby's) – including the <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> coin. The United States government requested the return of the coin, and the Egyptian government stated that it would comply with the request. However, the coin disappeared and was not seen again in Egypt.|$|E

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>eagles</b> were {{routinely}} minted through 1933, although {{few of the}} very last years' coinages were released before the gold recall legislation of that year. Accordingly, these issues (when the U.S. Treasury permits individuals to own them) bring very high prices.|$|R
