5|$|Lafount first {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} in his father's <b>hardware</b> store in Logan, Utah, known as the Lafount <b>Hardware</b> Company, and then worked as its manager. He was in the <b>hardware</b> business for twelve years starting in 1903.|$|E
5|$|NeXT {{withdrew from}} the <b>hardware</b> {{business}} in 1993 and the company was renamed NeXT Software Inc; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell the <b>hardware</b> business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon. Canon later {{pulled out of the}} deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all <b>hardware</b> production. CEO of Sun Microsystems Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10million in 1993 and use NeXT software (OpenStep) in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create OpenStep which was NeXTSTEP without the Mach-based kernel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sword is}} {{reinforced}} {{with a special}} sleeve composed of a variation of <b>Hardware's</b> shell alloy. [...] As a result, the blade is highly flexible while retaining an extremely hard edge. Such qualities are necessary since the retractable sword would likely break due to the strain placed on it by <b>Hardware's</b> superhuman strength.|$|R

5|$|The {{circuit board}} of Radar Scope was {{restructured}} for Donkey Kong. The Radar Scope <b>hardware,</b> originally {{inspired by the}} Namco Galaxian <b>hardware,</b> was designed for {{a large number of}} enemies moving around at high speeds, which Donkey Kong did not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board. While the gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, the existing CPU, sound <b>hardware</b> and monitor were left intact. The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display and font are almost identical to Radar Scope, with palette differences. The Donkey Kong <b>hardware</b> had the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects used single sprites, the taller Pauline used two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong used six sprites.|$|E
5|$|The console has {{a number}} of {{internal}} features made available from its <b>hardware</b> and firmware components. The <b>hardware</b> allows for extendability (via expansion ports), while the firmware (and some software) can receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect24 service.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the <b>hardware,</b> without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The <b>hardware</b> let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the <b>hardware</b> was new.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Target {{started selling}} an Emeco 1006 {{imitation}} product supplied by Euro Style. The supplier said it planned {{to modify the}} chair's style to avoid a legal dispute over alleged trademark infringement. In October 2012, Emeco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Restoration <b>Hardware</b> for allegedly making unauthorized reproductions of the 1006 Navy chair. Restoration <b>Hardware</b> removed the chair from its website, stopped selling the chair, and reached an undisclosed settlement with Emeco.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps the shell’s most {{formidable}} {{feature is the}} programmable polymers integrated into its structure. [...] These polymers enable the shell to stretch and contract like human muscle, but with considerably greater force. Hence, the shell increases <b>Hardware's</b> natural strength to superhuman levels. Initially, the shell amplified Curtis’s strength {{so that he could}} lift (press) about 5 tons. However, <b>Hardware's</b> battle with the SYSTEMatic Mark III indicates that Curtis has significantly increased the shell's strength augmentation abilities.|$|R

5|$|Succeeding the SG-1000, the Master System was {{released}} {{as a direct}} competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the third generation of video game consoles. The NES used virtually the same <b>hardware</b> as the 1983 Famicom while the Master System was constructed with more up-to-date <b>hardware.</b> Despite improved <b>hardware,</b> it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil. Compared with its competition from Nintendo, the Master System's game library lacked a number of well-received titles, due to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity to the NES.|$|E

5|$|The console {{can monitor}} its {{internal}} temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating; alongside increasing fan speed, additional measures can be taken, including forcing the <b>hardware</b> {{to run in}} a lower power state—a feature that was not present on Xbox 360. Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance, but the setting would be intended {{as a last resort}} to prevent permanent <b>hardware</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can be {{understood}} as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling <b>hardware</b> costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer <b>hardware.</b> In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E
5|$|The {{specialized}} <b>hardware</b> of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU <b>hardware</b> is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying <b>hardware</b> architecture. With the addition of <b>hardware</b> optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.|$|E

5000|$|Kisschasy {{had some}} {{difficulty}} in recording Hymns for the Nonbeliever. The band said [...] "All the drums are there {{but all the}} <b>hardware's</b> gone and the <b>hardware's</b> the stuff that holds up each drum and holds the cymbals and everything like that. We waited another whole day, wasted two days {{just waiting for the}} stuff to come in. So we ended up just finding just things from around the studio like little poles and sandbags just to hold up the drums and we recorded the drums that way for the whole album." ...|$|R

25|$|Exokernels are a still-experimental {{approach}} to operating system design. They {{differ from the}} other types of kernels in that their functionality {{is limited to the}} protection and multiplexing of the raw <b>hardware,</b> providing no <b>hardware</b> abstractions on top of which to develop applications. This separation of <b>hardware</b> protection from <b>hardware</b> management enables application developers to determine how to make the most efficient use of the available <b>hardware</b> for each specific program.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to embOS, embOS-MPU offers memory protection {{by using the}} <b>hardware's</b> memory protection unit as well as additional software mechanisms to prevent one task from affecting {{the entirety of the}} system.|$|R
