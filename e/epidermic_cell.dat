It then becomes quite quiet, the cilia disappear, it assumes a spherical form, and surrounds itself with a distinct, though delicate, membranous coat. A protuberance then grows out {{from one side of the}} sphere, and rapidly increasing in length, assumes the character of a hypha. The latter penetrates into the substance of the potato plant, either by entering a stomate, or by boring through the wall of an <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell,</b> and ramifies, as a mycelium, in the substance of the plant, destroying the tissues with which it comes in contact. As these processes of multiplication take place very rapidly, millions of spores are soon set free from a single infested plant; and, from their minuteness, they are readily transported by the gentlest breeze. Since, again, the zoospores set free from each spore, in virtue of their powers of locomotion, swiftly disperse themselves over the surface, it is no wonder that the infection, once started, soon spreads from field to field, and extends its ravages over a whole country.|$|E

The species presents morphological, chemical and genetic variation. Two varieties are considered due external morphological differences: C. sylvestris var. sylvestris and var. lingua. There are difficulties in definition of these varieties. The objective of this work is to evaluate chemical and morpho-anatomical differences between C. sylvestris varieties that can be applied in their distinction for pharmaceutical or botanical purposes. Transverse and paradermic sections of leaves were prepared for morpho-anatomical, histochemical and quantitative microscopy (stomatal and palisade index) analyses. Diterpene profiles of the specimens were obtained by HPLC-DAD and TLC. Morpho-anatomical analyses demonstrated significant differences between the varieties only in paradermic sections: var. sylvestris - polygonal <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> walls and hypostomatic; var. lingua - rounded <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> walls and amphistomatic. No differences were observed for stomatal index; palisade index was found 2. 8 for var. lingua and 3. 9 for var. sylvestris. Chromatographic analyses confirmed previous results demonstrating that diterpene profile in varieties differs, with predominance of these metabolites in var. sylvestris.

30|$|Among these results, {{we found}} that SWCNTs had a greater {{toxicity}} {{compared to the other}} two nanomaterials. Besides chemical composition, other particle properties such as size and shape may also affect the addressed specific physicochemical and transport properties, with the possibility of negating amplification of the surface effects. Therefore, it is educible that the greatest damage caused by SWCNTs may come from mechanical injury and oxidative effect. It is likely that SWCNTs might penetrate the lung <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> into the cell nucleus through nucleopores and then destruct the cell structure. To combine the above two points, the toxicity of different nanoparticles may primarily be due to particle shape rather than chemical composition. However, since the available techniques are really scarce at present, it is rather difficult to inspect intracellular translocation of nanoparticles. Unfortunately, we cannot directly confirm the actual process from our data.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to verify, on whole plant level and during all the plant cycle, the hypothesis that nitrogen deficiency reduces root hydraulic conductivity through the water channels (aquaporins) activity, and that the plant reacts by changing root/shoot ratio. Root hydraulic conductivity, plant growth, root/shoot ratio and plant water status were assessed for durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), as influenced by nitrogen availability and HgCl 2 treatment. On both species during the plant cycle, nitrogen deficiency induced lower root hydraulic conductivity (- 49 and - 66 % respectively for barley and wheat) and lower plant growth. On wheat was also observed cycle delay, lower plant nitrogen content, but not lower leaf turgor pressure and <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> dimension. The lower plant growth was due to lower plant dimension and lower tillering. Root /shoot ratio was always higher for nitrogen stressed plants, whether on dry matter or on surface basis. This was due to lower effect of nitrogen stress on root growth than on shoot growth. On wheat HgCl 2 treatment determined lower plant growth, and more than nitrogen stress, cycle delay and higher root/shoot ratio. The mercury, also, induced leaf rolling, lower turgor pressure, lower NAR, higher root cell wall lignification and lower <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> number per surface unity. In nitrogen fertilized plants root hydraulic conductivity was always reduced by HgCl 2 treatment (- 61 and 38 %, respectively for wheat and barley), but in nitrogen unfertilized plants this effect was observed only during the first plant stages. This effect was higher during shooting and caryopsis formation, lower during tillering. It is concluded that barley and durum wheat react to nitrogen deficiency and HgCl 2 treatment by increasing the root/shoot ratio, to compensate water stress due to lower water root conductivity probably induced by lower aquaporin synthesis or inactivation. However, this compensation is not enough to keep a normal water status and this leads to lower plant growth. At the same time some doubts persist about mercury toxicity on other plant functions besides the aquaporin blockage...|$|E

These shows the important function of the activated lymphocyte which secretes chemical amboceptors or lymphokins. These lymphokins are responsible for the disposition of the elements which produce the histological image observed under the photonic or electronic microscope. The vascular permeability factor dilates the capillaries; the chemotactic factor draws the cells of the infiltrate to it; the factor inhibiting macrophage migration prevents the cells leaving the site of the reaction; the mitogenetic factor draws to itself the normal lymphocytes and ensures that some of them are transformed into lymphoblasts; the cytotoxicity of the activated lymphocytes results in changes in the <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell.</b> The presence of the macrophage is essential for the liberation of these chemical amboceptors. © 1973 Expansion Scientifique Française.

40|$|Lupinus is a legume {{with great}} agronomic {{potential}} {{due to the}} high protein content of its seeds and its positive effect on soil fertility. It is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen through {{the establishment of a}} symbiosis with soil bacteria of the genus Bradyrhizobium. The process is carried out in a special subclass of indeterminate nodules known as lupinoid nodules. The Bradyrhizobium-Lupinus symbiosis has particular characteristics, which makes it different from other Rhizobium-legume symbioses. The entry of the bacteria into the plant root occurs at the junction between the root hair base and the adjacent <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> and only sporadic “infection threads ” have been observed. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and aldehyde oxidase in infection and nodule morphogenesis have been reported {{for the first time in}} this symbiosis. The presence of nitric oxide synthase activity in plants has been detected for the first time, in roots and nodules of Lupinus albus. The unique lupin nodule cortical structure has contributed to the visualization and elucidation of the operational mechanisms of the oxygen diffusion barrier. Nodule senescence takes place in a similar way to that of determinate nodules, starting in the central area of the nodule. This symbiosis is especially resistant to abiotic stresses such as herbicides, nitrate, salinity and heavy metals. This unusual tolerance has permitted the use of inoculated lupin plants for the re-vegetation of degraded areas and as a pioneer plant to fight soil erosion and to reclaim eroded soils.

40|$|O murici (Byrsonima verbascifolia Rich, A. Juss.) pertence à família Malpighiaceae e apresenta ampla distribuição nas regiões do Cerrado brasileiro. Destaca-se pela grande variedade de espécies, elevado valor nutricional e medicinal, podendo ser utilizada na indústria de curtume. Porém, a propagação por meio de sementes do gênero Byrsonima esbarra em problemas como baixa taxa de germinação e lenta emergência das plântulas. Um mecanismo eficiente e que poderá contribuir na solução desse problema é a utilização de técnicas de propagação {{in vitro}}. Todavia, as plantas quando cultivadas in vitro crescem em condições diferentes das plantas cultivadas ex vitro ou in vivo e, freqüentemente, podem apresentar diferenças anatômicas, morfológicas e fisiológicas. Neste contexto, este trabalho teve como propósitos principais: caracterizar diferenças anatômicas e histoquímicas em folhas em função da condição de cultivo in vitro e in vivo; avaliar a calogênese em explantes foliares radiculares sob indução de BAP, 2, 4 -D ou TDZ; e identificar diferentes metabólitos secundários nos calos mediante análises fitoquímicas. Para tal, folhas de murici provenientes de cultivo in vitro e in vivo foram utilizadas para estudos anatômicos e histoquímicos. As estruturas foliares desenvolvidas in vivo diferiram das cultivadas in vitro em vários fatores, tais como: espessamento do parênquima clorofiliano, freqüência e ocorrência de estômatos, forma e tamanho das células não especializadas da epiderme e grau de desenvolvimento do sistema vascular. Os testes histoquímicos revelaram a presença de células isoladas no parênquima de preenchimento e algumas fibras internas aos feixes com compostos fenólicos. A coloração com Vanilina Clorídrica mostrou que esses compostos fenólicos são taninos. Os resultados demonstram que na ausência de reguladores de crescimento na composição do meio de cultura não houve formação de calos nos explantes foliares. Em explantes foliares cultivados sob ausênca de luz, o 2, 4 -D proporcionou os melhores resultados para meio MS acrescido de 1, 0 mg L- 1 desse regulador. Em explantes radiculares obteve-se calogênese em todos os tratamentos, incluindo o controle. O estudo fitoquímico indicou a presença de vários compostos, dentre eles, fenóis, taninos e triterpenóides. Os níveis de fenóis praticamente não diferiram em calos cultivados em meio com BAP. Porém, para o TDZ, observam-se os maiores níveis desses compostos sob irradiância de 150 µmol m- 2 s- 1 e período de 30 dias de cultivo. The murici (Byrsonima verbascifolia Rich, ex A. Juss) {{belongs to the}} family Malpighiaceae and is widely {{distributed}} in regions of the Brazilian Cerrados. It possesses a variety of species, high nutritional and medicinal value {{and can be used}} in the tanning industry. However, the sexual propagation of the species of the genus Byrsonima has been hampered by the low germination and seedling emergence rates. An alternative approach that could overcome such limitations is the use of in vitro propagation techniques. However, the plants grown under in vitro as compared to in vivo-grown counterparts may present anatomical, morphological and physiological differences. The present study aimed: 1. to characterize anatomical and hystochemical differences in leaves raised under in vitro an in vivo conditions; 2. to evaluate inductive callus conditions, as affected by 2, 4 -D, TDZ and BAP, for both leaf and root explants derived from in vitrogerminated seeds; 3. to identify different compounds in calli by means of phytochemical analyses. The leaves grown under in vitro and in vivo conditions had single-layered upper and lower epidermis, whose cells contained either phenolic compounds or mucilage. In vitro-grown plants posses amphistomatic leaves, presenting thin cuticle, highly sinuous abaxial <b>epidermic</b> <b>cell</b> walls, and adaxial epidermis with rectangular- shaped cell walls. Conversely, in vivo-grown leaves are hipostomatic, presenting thicker cuticle, walls of the epidermal cells winding least on the face and abaxial epidermal cells of the face adaxial with polygonal format. The later displayed thicker leaves, with more differentiated spongy parenchyma, well-developed vascular system, and the presence of fibers and crystals. Histochemical tests in in vivo- grown leaves detected phenolic compounds occurring in the mesophyll and fundamental parenchyma cells, and in some fibers of the vascular bundles. The staining with Vanilin Chloridric confirmed that these cells were tanniniferous. Regading callogenic responses, the MS medium lacking growth regulators did not induce callus in leaf-derived explants. However, MS-based medium supplemented with 2, 4 -D (1. 0 mg L- 1) provided the best callogenic induction when leaf explants were grown in the dark. When root explants were used, calli were formed in all tested treatments, including the control. The phytochemical analyses indicated the presence of various compounds, among them, phenols, tannins and triterpenoids. The levels of phenols hardly differ for calli grown in medium with BAP, whereas those calli differentiated in TDZ- supplemented medium presented the highest level of these compounds, moreover those raised under higher irradiance (150 mol m- 2 s- 1), after a 30 days period of culture...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of Liangxue Jiedu Decoction, a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine with the function of blood-cooling and detoxicating, in treating psoriasis in mice and to explore its mechanism. Methods: (1) Sixty mice were randomly divided into Liangxue Jiedu Decoction group, compound Indigo Naturalis capsule group, acitretin capsule group and normal saline group. Another 10 mice were selected as blank control. After 2 -week administration, mice were sacrificed to obtain samples. After hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, tail scales with granular layers were calculated by an optical microscope. (2) Except for ten mice in blank group, sixty female mice were injected intraperitoneally with diethylstilbestrol once daily. After 3 -day injection, mice were randomly divided into four groups and treated as above description. After 2 -week treatment, all mice were injected intraperitoneally with colchicine (2 mg/kg), and sacrificed 6 h after the injection. The mitotic rate in virginal epithelium was calculated after HE staining. Results: Compared with normal saline, Liangxue Jiedu Decoction could significantly inhibit the mitosis of mouse vaginal epithelium (P< 0. 01) and promote the formation of granular layers in mouse tail-scale epidermis (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: The mechanism of Liangxue Jiedu Decoction in treating psoriasis may be related to promoting granular cell growth and inhibiting proliferation of <b>epidermic</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
60|$|The neck is {{likewise}} lined throughout its whole length with transverse rows of long, thin, transparent hairs, having broad bulbous (fig. 30) bases, with similarly constructed sharp points. They arise from little projecting ridges, formed of rectangular <b>epidermic</b> <b>cells.</b> The hairs vary {{a little in}} length, but their points generally extend down to the row next below; so that if the neck is split open and laid flat, the inner surface resembles a paper of pins,--the hairs representing the pins, and the little transverse ridges representing the folds of paper through which the pins are thrust. These rows of hairs are indicated in the previous figure (29) by numerous transverse lines crossing the neck. The inside of the neck is [page 449] also studded with papillae; those in the lower part are spherical and formed of four cells, as in {{the lower part of}} the utricle; those in the upper part are formed of two cells, which are much elongated downwards beneath their points of attachment. These two-celled papillae apparently correspond with the bifid process in the upper part of the bladders of Utricularia. The narrow transverse orifice (o, fig. 29) is situated between the bases of the two spiral arms. No valve could be detected here, nor was any such structure seen by Dr. Warming. The lips of the orifice are armed with many short, thick, sharply pointed, somewhat incurved hairs or teeth.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the prognostic value of microscopic parameters of asymptomatic leaves of Clusia hilariana Schltdl. subjected to particulate deposition of iron (2. 14 mg cm- 2 day- 1) for 45 consecutive days. Samples of young and expanded leaves without symptoms were collected and subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The height of the epidermal cells on both surfaces of the leaf and {{the thickness of the}} hypodermis, the chlorophyll parenchyma, and the leaf blade were measured. Micromorphological injury occurred in the abaxial surface of young leaves and on both surfaces of expanded leaves. Erosion of the epicuticular wax and cuticle rupture were frequent on the adaxial surface, while on the abaxial surface of both leaves there was a loss of sinuosity on the anticlinal wall of the epidermal cells, stomatal deformity and obstruction. Micromorphometric alterations were seen in all leaf tissues except in the height of <b>epidermic</b> <b>cells,</b> probably due to the thick cuticle and prominent cuticular flanges. The highest difference in thickness of the leaf blade was seen in young leaves of plants subjected to SPMFe, indicating greater sensibility to particulate iron in comparison to the expanded leaves. The micromorphological and micromorphometric alterations in the leaf blade of Clusia hilariana Schltdl. showed the prognostic potential of these tools on the evaluation of impacts caused by the deposition of particulate matter, especially in the 'Restinga' natural vegetation, where the exposure is increasing due to the presence of iron ore industry in their surroundings...|$|R
40|$|Se {{describe}} la fase gametofítica del helecho Microgramma nitid con esporas de Veracruz, México (siembra promedio 40 esporas/ cm²). La morfogénesis se caracteriza por: germinación tipo Vittaria, un filamento inicial de seis células protálicas; gametofitos jóvenes espatulados que se transforman en gametofitos adultos cordiformes-alargados, con márgenes ondulados y tricomas unicelulares-capitados en los margenes y en las superficies; aparición de una célula meristemática obcónica apical, que es reemplazada rápidamente por un meristemo pluricelular. Los anteridios y arquegonios son del tipo usual de las Polypodiaceae s. str. El desarrollo protálico es del tipo Drynaria. Ocho meses después de la siembra apareció la primera hoja del esporofito; ésta es espatulada, con márgenes lisos y una hilera de células aclorofílicas, tricomas pluricelulares, bifurcados y estomas anomocíticos. Las células epidérmicas de la hoja del esporofito tienen paredes laterales onduladas en las superficies dorsal y ventral. The {{development of}} the gametophytic phase of Microgramma nitida is described based on spore samples that was obtained of fertil specimens gathered on Veracruz State, Mexico. The spore sowing density was 40 spores/cm 2; it is characterized by Vittaria-type germination of the spore, a germinal filament of six cells; young gametophytes are naked, spathulated and later are transformed in cordate-elongated adult gametophytes with wavy borders; marginal, superficial capitated, unicellular hairs; the meristematic cell is wedge-shaped and is quickly replaced by a pluricellular meristem. The antheridia and archegonia are of the usual Polypodiaceae s. str. type. Prothallial development is thus of the Drynaria-type. The first leaf of the sporophyte appeared eight months after spore sowing. The leaf is spathulated, with smooth borders and the margin has a row of cells without chlorophyll; bifurcated and pluricellular hairs; anomocytic stomata; the <b>epidermic</b> <b>cells</b> of the sporophyte have wavy walls on upper and lower surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Com o objetivo de conhecer meios, explantes, tecidos envolvidos e controle genético da regeneração {{in vitro}} a partir de plântulas de Eucalyptus grandis, dez progênies de polinização aberta da população base, origem Atherton localizada em Anhembi, estado de São Paulo foram utilizadas. Sementes de sete progênies foram germinadas in vitro. Após vinte dias de cultivo, cotilédones, segmentos proximais e distais dos hipocótilos foram inoculados em nove meios de cultura usando o meio basal de JADS em combinação com dois reguladores de crescimento (ANA e BAP). Após 14 semanas de cultivo, foram feitas avaliações da regeneração e histologia. Células do córtex estavam envolvidos na regeneração dos hipocótilos e as células subepidérmicas originaram calos e estes deram origem a brotos nos cotilédones. Todos os brotos formados tiveram conexão com o sistema {{vascular}} do tecido original. Foi verificado que o melhor tratamento, onde 41 % dos hipocótilos distais regeneraram, na combinação de ANA e BAP 0, 5 mg L- 1. Posteriormente, os segmentos distais dos hipocótilos das dez progênies foram inoculados naquele meio, houve diferenças significativas de regeneração entre as progênies (P< 0, 0001) com extremos de regeneração de 11 % a 60 % e com uma média de 37 %. A herdabilidade quanto ao caráter foi alta (h 2 m = 0, 94), indicando que houve um forte controle genético na regeneração in vitro dentro da população. Houve também alta variabilidade dentro da amostra estudada assim como um forte efeito materno sobre a regeneração. Aiming at better knowledge on tissue culture media, axplants, tissues involved and genetic control of in vitro regeneration of Eucalyptus grandis from seedlings, seeds from ten open pollinated progenies from the basic population, origin Atherton, located in Anhembi, São Paulo State (BR) were used. Initially, seeds from seven progenies were germinated in vitro. Twenty days after culture, cotyledons and, distal and proximal hypocotyls segments were inoculated in culture media using JADS basic medium with varius NAA + BAP combinations. After 14 weeks of culture, evaluations bud induction, regeneration, and histological analysis were done. Cortex cells {{were involved in}} hypocotyls direct regeneration and cotyledon <b>epidermic</b> <b>cells</b> gave rise to callus which in turn produced shoots. All shoots developed had connection to the original vascular system. It was verified that NAA + BAP at 0, 5 mgL- 1 concentration each was the best treatment, where 41 % of the distal hypocotyls regenerated. Distal hypocotyl segments from of seedlings of ten progenies were inoculated showing significant differences regeneration among progenies. Regeneration varied from 11 % to 60 % {{with a mean of}} 37 %; the heritability in relation to the character was (94, 0 2 = m h), indicating that there was a strong genetic control of the in vitro regeneration within the population. Also, there was a high variability within the samples studied as well as a strong maternal effect on the regeneration...|$|R

The development of low-input turfgrasses has been challenging for plant breeders. Turfgrasses typically lack resources for crop improvement {{that are common}} in other crops, such as a fully sequenced genome. New tools are needed to study turfgrass and decrease its environmental impact. Two approaches were developed and utilized in this project: investigating the rhizosphere associated with low-input turfgrasses and quantifying silica body deposition in various turfgrass species. Understanding how microorganisms associate with different species and cultivars of turfgrass may in the future provide researchers the ability to breed for turfgrass plants that form better mutualistic and beneficial relationships with soil microorganisms. In some plants, plant genotype {{seems to have a}} significant influence on shaping the microbial community structures. Previous research in Poaceae has shown that a plant genotype has the ability to influence the rhizosphere microbial community structure. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if turfgrass species affects soil microbial community structure and (2) identify differences in soil microbial community structure of turfgrasses based on nitrogen fertility regime. Rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples were taken from six species of turfgrass, prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), hard fescue (Festuca trachyphylla (Hackel) Krajina), colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.), as well as tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.) and DNA isolated from each sample was then amplicons were pair end sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at a read length of 2 x 150 base pairs. Data was analyzed using WinSCP, Putty and Mothur. Our results show that the rhizosphere community structure is influenced by location, fertility, and genotype. iii We also found that Thermodesulfobacteria and Thaumarchaeota are associated with fertilized turfgrass soils. Weed incidence, a measure of turf performance, was found to associate to the Actinobacteria, Verrumicrobia, and Bacteroidetes. Results from this research will inform turfgrass researchers about the impacts of turfgrass species and nitrogen fertility on soil microbial communities. The deposition of silicon into <b>epidermic</b> <b>cells</b> of grass species is thought to be an important mechanism that plants use to defend against pests and environmental stresses. Turfgrass cultivars within the same species exhibit different tolerances under traffic stress and some of these differences may be attributed to silica bodies. There are a number of techniques available to study the size, density and distribution pattern of silica bodies in grass leaves. None of those techniques, however, can provide a high-throughput and accurate analysis, especially for a great number of samples. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a high-throughput method that uses the fluorescence-emitting nature of silica bodies along with fluorescence microscopy and image software to investigate the size, density, and distribution patterns of these bodies in the perennial grass Koeleria macrantha. Dry ashing, followed by fluorescent microscopy, was utilized to image silica bodies in prairie junegrass. ImageJ was used to analyze the images for size, number and orientation. We found that dry-ashing and fluorescent microscopy can be combined with ImageJ to create a high throughput method to study silica bodies in turfgrass. Our results indicated that abaxial and adaxial deposition in turfgrasses are significantly different and that turfgrass genotypes showed significant differences in number of carbon inclusions and silica body deposition...|$|R
