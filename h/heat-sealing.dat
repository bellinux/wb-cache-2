5000|$|Åkerlund & Rausing {{produced}} {{all sorts}} of paper packaging for dry staple groceries, but Rausing was determined {{to find a way}} to pre-package liquids like milk and cream, and spent large sums on developing a viable package. The goal was to provide optimal food safety, hygiene and distribution efficiency using a minimum amount of material, according to the subsequently famous credo that a package should [...] "save more than it costs". The new package had to be sufficiently cheap to be able to compete with loose milk, meaning that a minimum of material waste and a maximum of production efficiency needed to be obtained.In 1943, the Åkerlund & Rausing lab started to work on developing the milk carton, and, in 1944, came up with the idea of constructing a tetrahedron-shaped package out of a tube of paper. The idea was simple but efficient, making optimal use of the material involved. After some initial hesitation, Rausing understood the potential of the package and filed for a patent on 27 March 1944. The rest of the 1940s were spent developing viable packaging materials and solving the technical problems of filling, sealing, and distribution. It was reportedly Rausing’s wife Elisabeth who came up with the idea of continuously sealing the packages through the milk while filling the tube in the manner of stuffing sausages, to prevent oxygen from entering the package. In 1946, a model for a packaging machine was presented by engineer Harry Järund, and in collaboration with Swedish paper mills and foreign chemical companies a viable paper for packaging was finally produced when coating carton paper with polyethylene, which made the paper waterproof and allowing for <b>heat-sealing</b> during filling.|$|E

However, there are still some problems with unit-dose packaging, such as low adherence, difficulty opening and the is-sue of the large amount of waste involved. In this study, we evaluated the conventional unit-dose packaging and developed it which suit for Japanese patients and medical service. We made a prototype of the new unit-dose packaging and evaluated usability of this one in medication through comparison with conventional unit-dose <b>heat-sealing</b> film. This was a prospective, controlled 2 week trial conducted in 20 elder patients. Accord-ing to the questionnaire, Almost patients satisfied with the new packaging due to ease of choosing right unit which should take. Furthermore, the number of remained medicine in the study group is less than the control group. The control group generated larger amount of trash than the study group.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{widespread}} use of dose administration aids (DAAs) there is little available data on the stability of drugs during repackaging or storage in these devices. Aim: To investigate the physicochemical stability of paracetamol tablets repackaged in DAAs. Method: Physicochemical stability studies were performed on a commonly used paracetamol tablet directly after <b>heat-sealing</b> in a DAA frequently employed in practice, then at ambient (25 ºC; 60 % relative humidity) and accelerated (40 ºC; 75 % relative humidity) conditions, over a 3 -month period. Physical characteristics of the tablets (weight uniformity, physical appearance, thickness, hardness, friability, disintegration, dissolution rates) were evaluated at time = 0, directly after <b>heat-sealing,</b> 1 month and 3 months. Chemical stability was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were compared to control samples stored in the original packaging at the various environmental conditions studied. Results: All compendial requirements for physicochemical stability were met for both ambient and accelerated conditions over the 3 -month period. Chemical stability of paracetamol content fell within the required range of 95 – 105 % of the labelled amount, for all environmental conditions. Conclusion: This study provides evidence on the stability of paracetamol tablets in a DAA, to support pharmacists in making sound clinical and operational decisions regarding the repackaging of paracetamol in these devices.

40|$|Water {{purification}} {{proves to}} be a difficult task in many developing nations. The SODIS (SOlar water DISinfection) process is a method which improves the microbiological quality of water making it safer for drinking and cooking using the UV-A rays and heat from the sun. Even simple processes such as this, require components that are not easily attainable in many rural areas-in this case the recommended two-liter bottle. Amy Smith, an instructor in MIT's Edgerton Center, researched and tested the effectiveness of polypropylene collapsible water pouches in the SODIS process. Thus, a <b>heat-sealing</b> device {{that can be used in}} developing nations to manufacture collapsible water pouches is needed. This device is intended to allow individuals in developing countries to take advantage of the SODIS water purification process. The approximately 60 watt prototype of the <b>heat-sealing</b> device is powered by a 12 -volt solar deep-cycle battery and is made of simple materials so that it can be used and maintained in a variety of developing nations. A 20 inch nickel chromium strip is used as the heating element and Teflon forms a barrier between the heating element and the material to be sealed. A 4 -mil polypropylene sheet is the pouch material of choice. (cont.) It is placed on top of the Teflon strip, before a lever arm is lowered, the device is turned 'on' and the sheet is sealed via the heated nickel chromium strip. Although the alpha prototype presented in this thesis has a number of positive attributes, such as using easily accessible or shippable components and making use of available power sources and/or batteries, there are areas for improvement. Making the device more robust, user friendly and versatile and making the seal strength more consistent and accurate are important characteristics that should be considered when designing a beta prototype. by Saundra S.

40|$|Packages {{made from}} {{flexible}} film often use a <b>heat-sealing</b> process to ensure closure. The process involves joining two surfaces of film with heat and pressure across {{a period of}} time. Heat-seal problems arise when another substance partially obstructs the film-to-film contact. This substance acts as a surface contaminant. In packaging operations, the product being packaged is often the source of contamination in the sealing process. Testing heat-seal strength is a primary method for evaluating seal performance of flexible film. Test procedures require contaminant-free film samples to maintain accuracy and precision in results. This study altered the test method to explore the effects of contaminated samples. It was necessary to develop a contamination technique. The new technique applies an equal distribution of contamination for each sample. This study 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis is that a non-contaminated seal will be stronger than a contaminated seal. The findings supported that contamination could block film-to-film contact preventing a continuous seal, resulting in seal strengths less than a noncontaminated seal test. Results from two types of film and different seal temperatures supported the findings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{the work}} of the GDX 2 {{packaging}} units, commonly appear the defects of BOPP <b>heat-sealing</b> face of the hard small box such as relaxation, wrinkles, bubbles etc. So analyzing the heat sealing defects and has become the primary task to improve the GDX 2 packaging units quality.

After statistical analyses of the defect information extracted, the location of the defect concentrating region and the area of the defect region can be determined, and the research shows that the result is basically consistent with the actual distribution of the defects of the side of the hardware package of the small box. By using the image processing technology, the extraction of feature information on the heat sealing defects will be more accurate, and the data information collection of the defect characteristics provides the theoretical basis for analyzing the causes why the defects occur and improving the heat sealing system of the GDX 2 packaging machine...|$|E

40|$|Sequences of {{operations}} on packaging machines {{can be described}} as a series of basic operations. Such basic operations are, for instance, the transport of the packaging material through the machine, the moulding of the packaging material to the package, by folding for example, the dosing and filling up of the products to be packed and the closing of the filled package, for instance by heat sealing. There are several characteristic basic operations for every type of packaging machine. The aim is to find out the relevant properties of the packaging materials for the several basic operations and to determine ranges of numerical values for them wherein maximum undisturbed processing is guaranteed. This is demonstrated on the vertical pouch form-fill seal machine. The tightness of the closures, which are mostly attainable by heat sealing in the case of plastic films, laminated material and plastic coated papers, is of great importance for maintaining the quality of the packed product. The quality of the heat-sealed seams depends on temperature, pressure and dwell time at the <b>heat-sealing</b> process on the one hand, and on the sealing procedure and on the construction of the heat sealing devices, especially of the surface profile, on the other hand. It is shown how leakages in heat sealed seams and in packages in general {{have an effect on the}} efficiency of moisture-proof, gas and vacuum packages...|$|E
40|$|Runoff {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{contamination}} in urban areas, since water can transport pollutants from many different media, among which the hydrocarbons generated by vehicles have an especially significant relevance. Under this premise, the study of geotextiles used as water purification layers within pervious pavement structures becomes a crucial issue, since these fabrics have proved to be a suitable environment for the development of biofilms, which are groups of microorganisms capable of reducing the presence of hydrocarbons. For this reason, this paper proposes a first test to assess the capacity of ten different geotextiles by immersing them in a culture medium prepared to favour the growth of a microbial community. The results showed the major importance of geotextile thickness in the generation of biomass and its relationship to the manufacturing process of the fabric, either <b>heat-sealing</b> or needlepunching. Consequently, a second test was developed to measure the mechanical behaviour of a geotextile of each type when buried in a microbially active soil under different conditions. The comparison between exposed and control samples revealed the maintenance of strength-related properties of geotextiles in the presence of microorganisms.

40|$|For {{industrial}} applications, solid-state O 2 sensors {{based on}} the quenching of photoluminescence, should be accurate, robust, easy-to-use in a calibration-free manner. These sensors generally consist of an O 2 sensitive luminescent dye in a polymer matrix. The properties of this matrix such as dye compatibility, O 2 permeability, mechanical strength and chemical resistance have a significant influence on the sensors final operating parameters. Although used in many applications, the existing solid-state sensing materials and manufacturing processes remain complex, rigid and expensive for large scale fabrication while incurring a substantial extra cost. Currently, as few sensors fit these ideals, {{there is a need}} for new sensor materials, fabrication techniques and integration technologies. We created and evaluated five new solid-state O 2 sensitive materials: four based on microporous polypropylene fabric materials and one on polyphenylene sulphide films. The onus was on simplifying composition of sensors and ergo reduction in material consumption and manufacturing cost. The sensors exhibited lifetime signals and working characteristics suitable for use in food packaging. When tested in food simulants and in direct contact with food, the sensor based on ungrafted polypropylene membrane fabricated by the swelling method, outperformed the other sensors. This sensor is cheaper than commercial sensors, is easily incorporated into current packaging materials by means of <b>heat-sealing</b> or lamination and has a storage shelf-life of at least 12 months when stored in normal atmospheric conditions.

When biodegradable bags were sealed using a bar impulse sealer, hermetic seals were obtained. The Romaine stored in these bags had a similar rate of decay and level of pinking after 14 days storage as Romaine packaged in the commercial PE/OPP bags. These results indicate that the use of commercial impulse sealers, rather than thermal-bar heat sealers, would allow industry to utilize these biodegradable films for pre-cut lettuce mixes...|$|E
40|$|Appendices A (MAPSIM Program Files) and D (Input Data Files), on disk with thesis print copy held in LibraryENZA New Zealand (International) is {{considering}} {{the use of}} modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) {{as an adjunct to}} cool storage for cartons of apples. The objectives of this study were to measure modified atmosphere development in apple cartons and to develop a mathematical model that {{could be used as a}} tool for package design and optimization. Storage trials were carried out with film-lined cartons of 'Braeburn', 'Royal Gala', and 'Granny Smith' apples. Measured package O 2 and CO 2 concentrations showed excellent reproducibility for cartons with heat-sealed liners. Liners closed by folding produced less modified and less consistent package atmospheres, especially for thicker films (40 µm versus 25 µm). Macroscopic holes in the liners resulted in almost total loss of atmosphere modification, whereas microscopic holes resulted in smaller changes apparent for O 2 concentrations only. A high incidence of film damage could quickly erode any potential fruit quality benefits imparted by the liners. Packing of warm rather than pre-cooled fruit resulted in much faster rates of atmosphere modification, without the development of unduly low O 2 or high CO 2 concentrations. The detrimental quality effects of slower cooling rates for film-lined cartons may outweigh any benefits of more rapid modified atmosphere development. Short-term exposures (less than 24 hours) to 20 °C resulted in relatively short-lived and non-critical disturbances to package atmospheres. Periods of more than 3 days at 20 °C led to a significant risk of anaerobic conditions or harmful CO 2 levels forming within the fruit, especially within the 40 µm liners. Folding rather than <b>heat-sealing</b> of liners did not reduce this risk. The MAP model simulated fruit respiration as a function of temperature and fruit O 2 and CO 2 concentrations; O 2, CO 2, N 2, and water vapour exchange between the fruit, package, and external atmospheres; condensation of moisture within the package; and moisture sorption by paper-based packaging materials. Gas concentrations and temperature throughout (i) the fruit and (ii) the package atmosphere were each assumed to be uniform with position. The model can be applied to a wide range of packages under variable-temperature storage regimes. The model closely predicted observed trends in experimental data collected during the MA storage trials, but tended to under-predict CO 2 concentrations and performed less well under conditions of extremely modified atmospheres. Sensitivity analyses showed that this lack of fit was not greater than that which could be explained by uncertainties in respiration and permeability data. It is recommended that future work be aimed at resolving the worst of these uncertainties before a significant amount of effort is directed towards further model development. The MAP model was considered sufficiently accurate for it to be usefully applied to the design and optimization of MAP systems...|$|E
