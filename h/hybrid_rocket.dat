25|$|On October 31, 2014, VSS Enterprise {{crashed in}} the Mojave Desert near Cantil, California, United States. The {{aircraft}} was {{performing a test}} flight, powered flight 4 (PF04), from the Mojave Air and Space Port {{in which it was}} dropped from the WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft, VMS Eve. The test flight was the aircraft's first powered flight in nine months, and was to include the first flight testing of a new, more powerful and steadier-thrust <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> engine whose fuel grain was composed of nylon instead of rubber.

2500|$|On-orbit {{propulsion}} of the Dream Chaser {{was supposed}} to be provided by twin <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> engines fueled with non-toxic and storable hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and nitrous oxide. Unlike solid rockets, Dream Chaser's hybrid fuel system would allow the motor to stop and start repeatedly and be throttleable. SNC Space Systems was also developing a similar <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket,</b> RocketMotor Two, for Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, as a subcontractor to Scaled Composites. [...] In May 2014 their involvement in the program ended after Virgin Galactic elected to replace SNC's version of RocketMotorTwo, powered by HTBD rubber fuel, with its own internally developed hybrid motor using a polyamide plastic fuel, while continuing to use the same nitrous oxide oxidizer.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> engine {{design for}} SpaceShipTwo has been {{problematic}} and caused extensive delays {{to the flight}} test program. [...] The original rocket engine design was based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer, {{sometimes referred to as}} an N2O/HTPB engine. [...] It was developed by Scaled Composites subcontractor Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) from 2009 to early 2014. [...] In May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced a change to the hybrid engine to be used in SpaceShipTwo, and took the development effort in-house to Virgin Galactic, terminating the contract with Sierra Nevada and halting all development work on the first-generation rocket engine. [...] Virgin then modified the engine design to include a change of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> fuel from a HTPB to a polyamide fuel formulation.

In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket motor, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2014, Virgin Galactic {{took over}} engine {{development}} from Sierra Nevada and announced a {{change to the}} fuel {{to be used in}} the SpaceShipTwo <b>hybrid</b> <b>rocket</b> engine.

2500|$|In {{order for}} a rocket to work, it needs two things: {{reaction}} mass and energy. [...] The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass having mass m at velocity v is mv.
