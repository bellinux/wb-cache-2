25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E

500|$|The frontal {{presentation}} of the deity is appropriate for a plaque of worship, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> [...] "pictorial reference to a god" [...] but [...] "a symbol of his presence". Since the relief is the only existing plaque intended for worship, {{we do not know}} whether this is generally true. But this particular depiction of a goddess represents a specific motif: a nude goddess with wings and bird's feet. Similar images have been found on a number of plaques, on a vase from Larsa, and on at least one cylinder seal; they are all from approximately the same time period. In all instances but one, the frontal view, nudity, wings, and the horned crown are features that occur together; thus, these images are iconographically linked in their re{{presentation of}} a particular goddess. Moreover, examples of this motif are the only existing examples of a nude god or goddess; all other representations of gods are clothed. The bird's feet have not always been well preserved, but there are no counter-examples of a nude, winged goddess with human feet.|$|E

His magnum opus, however, is the book The Language of Post-Modern Architecture, first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions.

This means that demolishing the church would be unthinkable. Any decision on moving the church will {{have to go through the}} local planning authority, but being Grade I listed will make a difference on how people view the building." [...] On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated:"The decision was simple – the church has to move if the airport is to survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go ahead, will be lost. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> case of expansion. We have to comply with safety standards set down by the Civil Aviation Authority and they must be implemented. The future hinges on these plans." [...] The vicar of the church, Rev.

For more than 1,000 years the church has stood on this site undisturbed. It is shrouded in history and is truly a magnificent example of architecture. The decision by English Heritage will certainly make it more difficult for any plans to move the church. The local community is firmly against any changes and so am I." ...|$|E
