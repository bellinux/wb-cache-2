40|$|An {{overview}} {{of the development of}} two microphone directional arrays for aeroacoustic testing is presented. These arrays were specifically developed to measure airframe noise in the NASA Langley Quiet Flow Facility. A large aperture directional array using 35 flush-mounted microphones was constructed to obtain high resolution noise localization maps around airframe models. This array possesses a maximum <b>diagonal</b> aperture <b>size</b> of 34 inches. A unique logarithmic spiral layout design was chosen for the targeted frequency range of 2 - 30 kHz. Complementing the large array is a small aperture directional array, constructed to obtain spectra and directivity information from regions on the model. This array, possessing 33 microphones with a maximum <b>diagonal</b> aperture <b>size</b> of 7. 76 inches, is easily moved about the model in elevation and azimuth. Custom microphone shading algorithms have been developed to provide a frequency- and position-invariant sensing area from 10 - 40 kHz with an overall target [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedures}} and formulations suggested in literature {{for the design}} of diagrid structures start from the assumption that <b>diagonal</b> <b>sizing</b> process is governed by the stiffness requirements, as usually occurs for other, less efficient, structural types, and that member strength demand is automatically satisfied by the cross section resulting from the stiffness requirements. However, thanks to the high rigidity of the diagonalized façade, strength requirements can be of paramount importance and even be the governing design criterion. In this paper, stiffness and strength design criteria for diagrid structures are examined and translated in simplified formulae for quick member sizing. The application of the two approaches {{for the design of}} a 100 -storey building model, carried out for different diagrid geometrical patterns, gives the opportunity of discussing the relative influence of stiffness and strength on the design outcomes, in terms of resulting diagonal cross sections and steel weight, {{as well as on the}} structural performance...|$|R

50|$|Optical {{format is}} a {{hypothetical}} measurement approximately 50% {{larger than the}} true <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> of a solid-state photo sensor.

The CoC size of 0.025 mm for this format appears in Jacobson's Photographic Lenses Tutorial,and the 1730 in his 1996 Photographic Lenses FAQ.Jacobson derived the 0.025 mm CoC number from analysis of the Zeiss Triotar lens DoF markings on the Rollei B35 (see photo). The manual for the Rollei B35 also states 0.025 mm CoC for its tabulated DoF distances, though it also includes an example DoF reading that implies a larger CoC.|$|E
50|$|For still photography, a lens with a {{focal length}} about {{equal to the}} <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> of the film or sensor format is {{considered}} to be a normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance equal to the print diagonal; this angle of view is about 43° diagonally. For cinematography, where the image is larger relative to viewing distance, a wider lens with a focal length of roughly a quarter of the film or sensor diagonal is considered 'normal'. The term normal lens can also be used as a synonym for rectilinear lens. This is a completely different use of the term.|$|E

5000|$|Sensor {{sizes are}} {{expressed}} in inches notation {{because at the time}} of the popularization of digital image sensors they were used to replace video camera tubes.

5000|$|A lens with a {{focal length}} about {{equal to the}} <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> of the film or sensor format {{is known as a}} normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle {{subtended}} by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance of the print diagonal, which therefore yields a normal perspective when viewing the print; this angle of view is about 53 degrees diagonally. For full-frame 35 mm-format cameras, the diagonal is 43 mm and a typical [...] "normal" [...] lens has a 50 mm focal length. A lens with a focal length shorter than normal {{is often referred to as}} a wide-angle lens (typically 35 mm and less, for 35 mm-format cameras), while a lens significantly longer than normal may be referred to as a telephoto lens (typically 85 mm and more, for 35 mm-format cameras). Technically, long focal length lenses are only [...] "telephoto" [...] if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens, but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens.|$|E
