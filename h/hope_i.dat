5|$|I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
25|$|The film is grandiose, horrible, showing monstrous crimes...regrettably, {{the film}} {{people here are}} putting me under {{pressure}} to finish {{the whole thing in}} ten days even though the film is barely finished. I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can get it all together. I'm living here like a monk, I go to bed at 8 in the evening, eat and drink very little and don't feel at all at ease in this giant city with all the responsibility for the film.|$|E

25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E

500|$|Northcote, while appreciating Boydell's largesse, also criticised {{the results}} of the project: [...] "With the {{exception}} of a few pictures by Joshua [...] and [...] Opie, and—I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> may add—myself, it was such a collection of slip-slop imbecility as was dreadful to look at, and turned out, as I had expected it would, in the ruin of poor Boydell's affairs".|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "I didn't want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, and I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> haven't offended anyone in doing so." [...] He {{has stated that}} he was familiar {{with a lot of}} beliefs of the Hindu religion and found it [...] "quite fascinating".|$|E
500|$|In a {{final scene}} that {{followed}} Jacqueline's suicide, Mary, Gregory, and Jason {{meet at the}} Dante restaurant. Gregory and Mary go off together, leaving Jason standing before the restaurant's mural of Dante and Beatrice, making clear his failure {{as an artist and}} lover. He says to himself: [...] "I am alive, yet every <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> had is dead. Death can be good. Death can be happy. If I could speak like Cyrano... then perhaps, you might understand." ...|$|E
500|$|There is also {{debate over}} whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately. [...] Although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some {{hypothetical}} examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a “zombie” that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding [...] "I don’t know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> have illustrated their conceptual possibility." ...|$|E

500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you. I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and I just think that's gross."

The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, 'Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' ...|$|E

[...] The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.|$|E
500|$|Charity Wakefield {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Marianne Dashwood.

I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E

I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place", he returned home captivated by the Arctic.
