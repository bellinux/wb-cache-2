5|$|While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{maintains}} the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, {{it has received}} criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation and fandom for the music of Aerosmith.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany, with imprecise boundaries. When Gustav Adolf von Götzen explored the country ten years later, {{he discovered that}} the Kingdom of Rwanda included a fertile region east of Lake Kivu. Germany wanted this region, which was also claimed by Leopold II {{as part of his}} own Congo Free State (annexed by Belgium to form the Belgian Congo in 1908). To <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> claim, Germany began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy and supporting Tutsi chiefs; this system allowed colonisation with few European troops. Yuhi V Musinga, who emerged as king after a succession crisis following {{the death of his father}} Rwabugiri and a struggle with Belgian troops, welcomed the Germans and used them to consolidate his power. The territory became the western border of German East Africa. German rule allowed Rwabugiri's centralisation policy to continue, and the rift between Tutsi and Hutu deepened.|$|E

25|$|There was {{outrage over}} the closure plan: critics pointed out {{that this was a}} main line, not a small branch railway. The {{campaign}} uncovered evidence that British Rail had mounted a dirty tricks campaign against the line, exaggerating the cost of repairs (£6million for Ribblehead Viaduct alone) and diverting traffic away from the line in order to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> closure plans, a process referred to as closure by stealth.|$|E

They have also criticized the perceived failure of Turkish intervention to achieve or <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> stated goals (protecting the sovereignty, integrity, and independence of the Republic of Cyprus), claiming that Turkey's intentions from the beginning were to create the state of Northern Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on hold for a time.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{politicians}} {{have speculated that}} there are already 143,000 Ukrainian refugees in Russia. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted those claims of refugees increase in Russia. At a briefing on 4 March 2014, the director of department of information policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Yevhen Perebiynis said that Russia was misinforming its own citizens {{as well as the}} entire international community to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> own actions in the Crimea.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the one-child policy is not {{effective}} enough to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> costs, and that external factors caused a dramatic decrease in Chinese fertility rates to begin even before 1979. The policy {{seems to have had}} little impact on rural areas (home to about 80% of the population), where birth rates never dropped below 2.5 children per female. Nevertheless, the Chinese government and others estimate that at least 250million births have been prevented by the policy.|$|E
25|$|The 240mm {{howitzer}} M1 {{was designed}} {{together with the}} longer ranged 8-inch Gun M1, and they both shared a related carriage. While use of the 8-inch gun was limited due to excessive bore wear and poor accuracy, the howitzer saw considerable action during World War II in Europe due to its effectiveness against difficult targets such as heavy concrete fortifications. It was also used in the Pacific campaign, notably in the Battle of Manila, but few targets there were heavily fortified enough to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> use.|$|E
25|$|Some Japanese {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion {{in the southern}} portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion in order to <b>justify</b> <b>its</b> conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, {{it can be argued}} that it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.|$|E

40|$|The {{arrival of}} {{female genital cutting}} to northeastern Africa predates that of Christianity and Islam, and Muslims, Christians, and Jews {{continue}} the practice today. Popular association of the practice with religious ideals has <b>justified</b> <b>its</b> continuation, and beliefs that the practice contradicts religious principles have <b>justified</b> <b>its</b> abandonment. Anthias and Yuval-Davis (1989) argue that strategic use of 'gender symbols' concerning the sexuality of women can reproduce religious boundaries, and this process of differentiation may involve national or transnational political bodies that endorse or oppose selected symbols. This framework helps to understand the diverging prevalence of female genital cutting among Christians and Muslims in Egypt...|$|R
