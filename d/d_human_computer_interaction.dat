40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} of estimating the 3 D pose of the upper human body from a single uncalibrated camera. The objective application lies in 3 <b>D</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interaction</b> where hand depth information offers extended functionality when interacting with a 3 D virtual environment, but it is equally suitable to animation and motion capture. A database of 3 D body configurations is built {{from a variety of}} human movements using motion capture data. A hierarchical structure consisting of three subsidiary databases, namely the frontal-view Hand Position (top-level), Silhouette and Edge Map Databases, are pre-extracted from the 3 D body configuration database. Using this hierarchy, subsets of the subsidiary databases are then matched to the subject in real-time. The examples of the subsidiary databases that yield the highest matching score are used to extract the corresponding 3 D configuration from the motion capture data, thereby estimating the upper body 3 D pose...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Scarce {{attention}} has been given to <b>Human</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interaction</b> teaching methods to promote creativity and innovation. Standard approaches to teaching interface design include the use of design aids such as usability guidelines, interaction design patterns and anti-patterns. These approaches do not, however, encourage creativity properly. Interaction design space is usually limitedly and unsystematically explored during student designs. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical framework for design exercises for use in the teaching of <b>Human</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interaction</b> and present some examples of its usage. The use of the pedagogical framework makes it possible to teachers create significant <b>Human</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interaction</b> experiences to students, fostering them to activate mental processes underlying creativity.

40|$|Mark Weiser提出了泛化计算({{ubiquitous}} computing) 的概念。他设想在未来的生活场景中，计算资源极大丰富，可以在任何时间和地点为用户提供信息和服务。在泛化计算环境下，计算设备的形态尺寸、使用计算设备的用户类型和交互场景都会发生重大的变化。这些都会对人机交互技术产生深刻的影响。本文设计并实现了一个适用于微型计算设备的数学公式编辑器，并且试图通过这个非键盘输入的公式编辑器的设计和实现，为探讨在泛化计算的环境下人机交互搭建一个研究平台。本文首先介绍了泛化计算的理念和它对人机交互的影响，接着介绍了隐式人机交互的概念，然后简要地介绍了公式编辑器的功能和操作环境。手写数学公式的识别技术是整个系统的难点和重点，文中花费了主要的笔墨来介绍其识别技术的实现方案。最后本文讨论了通过此公式编辑器体现的一些人机交互技术。It is {{the core}} idea of ubiquitous computing to move computational power into the environment that surrounds the user.
