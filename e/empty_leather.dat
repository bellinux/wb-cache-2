60|$|She {{pushed me}} behind the painted {{curtains}} upon the wall, my <b>empty</b> <b>leather</b> bag {{still in my}} hand. Then she took her taper and walked quickly into the room from which we had come. From where I stood I could see her through the open door.|$|E
60|$|This {{proved to}} be the case. There were another cistern and more piles of firewood, {{otherwise}} it was empty. After a short survey they returned to the main chamber, bringing up with them two of the <b>empty</b> <b>leather</b> bags. In these they placed the bones of the dead, the remains all crumbling when touched, as the first skeleton had done. The bags were lowered to the ground, and the four searchers descended and carried them to the mouth of the ravine. In a spare bag which they brought with them they placed the bones of the two skeletons on the steps, and then carried them all out to the open valley.|$|E

I hope the money won't be spent meanwhile, though, and the <b>empty</b> <b>leather</b> returned to me when wanted no longer. However, that's done already, if done at all. I was a fool for not acting at once;--a double fool for suspecting her! Ass that I was, to take up with a false scent, and throw myself off the true one! My everlasting unbelief in people has punished itself this time. I might have got a search-warrant three months ago, and had that old witch safe in the bilboes. But no--I might not have found it, after all, and there would have been only an esclandre; and if I know that girl's heart, she would have been ten times more miserable for her mother than for herself, so it's as well as it is. Besides, it's really good fun to watch how such a pretty plot will work itself out;--as good as a pack of harriers with a cold scent and a squatted hare. So, live and let live. Only, Thomas Thurnall, if you go for to come for to go for to make such an abominable ass of yourself with that young lady any more, like a miserable school-boy, you will be pleased to make tracks, and vanish out of these parts for ever. For my purse can't afford to have you marrying a schoolmistress in your impoverished old age; and my character, which also is my purse, can't afford worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ja’far {{was famous}} for his acts of charity in Medina. Abu Hurairah recalled: “The most generous {{of all the people}} to the poor was Ja’far ibn Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was {{available}} therein. He would even offer us an <b>empty</b> folded <b>leather</b> container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{high school}} diploma is the symbol of having {{successfully}} completed the basic education required by law for youths. Because of this, {{the presentation of the}} high-school diploma has become an adulthood rite, that is steeped in ritual. The {{high school diploma}} is given to students at a ceremony called high-school graduation. Students who have passed their courses will have their names called out, walk across a stage, and be handed their diplomas. Sometimes, students receive blank pieces of paper wrapped with a ribbon or <b>empty</b> <b>leather</b> binders during the graduation ceremony; when this occurs the actual diploma is received later.|$|E
50|$|To {{the south}} of the room, a walnut welsh dresser was placed in the centre, just below the large <b>empty</b> <b>leather</b> panel, and flanked on both sides by the {{framework}} shelves. On the east side, three tall windows parted the room overlooking a private park, and covered by full-length walnut shutters. To the north a fireplace, over which hung the painting by American painter James McNeill Whistler, Rose and Silver: The Princess from the Land of Porcelain, that served as {{the focal point of the}} room. The ceiling was constructed in a pendant panelled Tudor-style, and decorated with eight globed pendant gas light fixtures. To finish the room, Jekyll placed a rug with a red border on the floor.|$|E
