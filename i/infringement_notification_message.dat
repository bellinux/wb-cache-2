40|$|Workflow {{interoperability}} {{is receiving}} increasing {{attention from the}} distributed computing community. Different standards and levels have been set to achieve interoperability among workflow system, for example, by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC). WS-based <b>notification</b> <b>messaging</b> systems provide a mechanism for decoupling and enabling asynchronous messaging among different applications in the distributed computing environment. In this paper a generic approach to achieving interoperability among workflow systems, based on a WS-based <b>notification</b> <b>messaging</b> system, is proposed. This approach exposes an API called Publish/Subscribe Scientific Workflow Interoperability Framework (PS-SWIF) that can be implemented in multiple workflow systems to provide run time interoperability. The PS-SWIF application is based on Web Services that enable scientists to apply a Publish/Subscribe mechanism to publish a topic using a workflow system, and enables different workflow systems to subscribe to this topic and receive <b>notification</b> <b>messages</b> when an event is executed...|$|R

30|$|The second way of {{capturing}} simulation provenance is to leverage a publish-subscribe method. An example of using {{this approach is}} Tylissanakis et al. work [9], in which they proposed a system to collect and manage data provenance for multi-physics simulation workflows via notification used in Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) [38]. The <b>notification</b> <b>messages</b> follow WS-Notification [39], which is a standard for exchanging messages among web services in the format of publish-subscribe. The authors’ work exposes data and simulation models as WSRF services and if a provenance record is generated, then that record is delivered as a WS-notification message. In this way, simulation provenance in their work is collected non intrusively with an existing system. Another example of adopting the publish-subscribe model is from Simmhan et al. work [10]. Their approach proposes a general framework for capturing provenance for scientific workflows in an implementation-independent way. The proposed framework aims to minimize collection cost by exchanging <b>notification</b> <b>messages</b> among services composed of a scientific workflow. The human intervention is extremely limited in their framework, only up {{to the level of}} letting a workflow component send a provenance <b>notification</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
