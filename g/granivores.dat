5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (<b>granivores),</b> but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: <b>granivores</b> tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
5|$|B.cuneata is {{very unusual}} in {{apparently}} suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat {{a large proportion}} of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B.cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of <b>granivores</b> feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E

25|$|Seed predation, often {{referred}} to as granivory, is a type of plant-animal interaction in which <b>granivores</b> (seed predators) feed on the seeds of plants as a main or exclusive food source, in many cases leaving the seeds damaged and not viable. <b>Granivores</b> are found across many families of vertebrates (especially mammals and birds) as well as invertebrates (mainly insects); thus, seed predation occurs in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. Seed predation is commonly divided into two distinctive temporal categories, pre-dispersal and post-dispersal predation, which may involve different strategies and requirements and have different implications at the individual and population level. Nevertheless, regardless of timing, seed predation has great implications for plant population dynamics. To counterbalance effects of predation, plants have evolved defenses such as seed morphology (size, shape, toughness) and chemical defenses (secondary compounds such as tannins and alkaloids) to defend against their seed predators. However, as plants have adapted defenses to seed predation (e.g., chemical compounds), so have seed predators adapted to plant defenses (e.g., ability to detoxify chemical compounds). Thus, many interesting examples of coevolution arise from this dynamic relationship.|$|E
25|$|Seeds of {{many plants}} have evolved {{a variety of}} {{defenses}} to deter predation from seed predators. Plants may allocate resources toward physical or chemical defenses. Seeds are often contained inside protective structures or fruit pulp that encapsulate seeds until they are ripe. Other physical defenses include spines, hairs, fibrous seed coats and hard endosperm. Seeds, especially in arid areas, may have a mucilaginous seed coat that can glue soil to seed hiding it from <b>granivores.</b>|$|E

30|$|Variability {{is clearly}} {{higher than in}} the whole sample in {{specialist}} <b>granivore</b> and mixed cropping farms, while lower in specialist grazing livestock farms. The high variability of specialised <b>granivore</b> farms is consistent with the findings of Vrolijk and Poppe (2008) and {{can be explained by the}} nature of these farms: high specialisation and a limited importance of DP. Similarly, the low level of income variability of specialist grazing farms is consistent with the findings of previous analysis (Vrolijk and Poppe 2008) (Table  2). Variability is also higher in small farms (Median CV is 0.73) than in medium and large farms as also reported by Vrolijk and Poppe (2008).|$|R
5000|$|In zoology, a graminivore (not to be {{confused}} with a <b>granivore)</b> is an herbivorous animal that feeds primarily on grass (specifically [...] "true" [...] grasses, plants of the family Poaceae). The word is derived from Latin graminis, meaning [...] "grass", and vorare, meaning [...] "to eat." [...] Graminivory is a form of grazing.|$|R
2500|$|Some seeds {{have evolved}} strong anti-herbivore {{chemical}} compounds. In contrast to physical defenses, chemical defenses in seeds to deter consumption by seed predators by using chemicals that are toxic to <b>granivores</b> or inhibit the digestibility of the seed. These chemicals include non-protein amino acids, cyanogenic-glycosides, protease and amylase inhibitors, phytohaemaglutinins. Seeds face trade-offs between allocation toward defenses {{and the size}} and number of seeds produced. [...] Additionally plants have trade-offs in seed defense allocation between deterring seed predators and attracting seed dispersers.|$|E
2500|$|Plants {{may reduce}} the {{severity}} of seed predation by making seeds spatially or temporally scarce to <b>granivores.</b> Seed dispersal away from the parent plant is hypothesized to reduce the severity of seed predation. Seed masting {{is an example of}} how plant populations are able to temporally regulate the severity of seed predation. [...] Masting refers to a concerted abundance of seed production followed by a period of paucity. This strategy has the potential to regulate the size of the population of seed predators.|$|E

30|$|While {{the data}} {{referring}} to the whole sample provide an overall picture {{of the sources of}} income variability, it is important to highlight differences among types of farming.

50|$|Myrmecochorous plants escape {{or avoid}} seed {{predation}} by <b>granivores</b> when ants remove and sequester diaspores. This benefit is particularly pronounced {{in areas where}} myrmecochorous plants are subject to heavy seed predation, which may be common. In mesic forest habitats seed predators remove approximately 60% of all dispersed seeds {{within a few days}} and eventually remove all seeds not removed by ants. In addition to attracting ants, elaiosomes also appeal to <b>granivores,</b> and their presence can increase seed predation rates.|$|E

50|$|D. panamintinus is a <b>granivore</b> {{that lives}} on {{metabolic}} water.

30|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} DP to total variability is way {{higher than the}} mean in specialist field crops farms. These results are coherent with {{the relative importance of}} DP (DP/FI) in these types of farming. The contribution of external costs to the direct effects doesn’t change significantly among different types of farming, except for specialist <b>granivore,</b> in which external costs account for a large share of the direct effects. This is coherent with the relative importance of external costs, that is the highest in specialist <b>granivore</b> farms. Differences among farms belonging to different economic sizes and PSE levels can be generally explained by differences in terms of the relative importance of the three income sources. In particular, the relative contribution of DP to income variability increases from the lowest to the highest PSE quartile. However, because such farms have an higher share of income variability coming from revenues, it may also support the hypothesis that farmers with high level of DP are more willing to take risk from agricultural production (El Benni et al. 2012).|$|R
50|$|Immediately after bushfire, {{granivorous}} birds move in {{to extract}} seed from open follicles, and to eat seeds that have {{fallen to the}} ground. Those seeds that escape the <b>granivores</b> are soon buried by wind and surface water. Nearly all buried seeds germinate.|$|E

40|$|A {{geographic}} {{index of}} the decline in the distribution and abundance of granivorous birds in tropical northern Australia shows that declines are greatest in Queensland and especially in the south-eastern tropics and in inland areas, and lowest in the north Kimberley and east Arnhem districts. In this paper, we use generalised linear models to investigate interrelationships among an index of decline in 1 degrees by 1 degrees cells and measures of grazing intensity and contemporary patterns of burning, together with the environmental variables of rainfall, vegetation and topographic patterning in the landscape. Grazing intensity was the single strongest human effect but strong correlations between grazing intensity and other human influences suggest that these may have been subsumed within the grazing intensity measure. Impacts of grazing may be worse where pastoral settlement occurred earlier. Topographic variation appeared to be a mitigating effect, suggesting a role for 2 ̆ 7 topographic refuges 2 ̆ 7 from human activities. Relationships among <b>granivore</b> declines, grazing and rainfall are difficult to disentangle using inferential statistics, but a consistent effect is that declines are more severe in areas with greater year-to-year variation in rainfall. We do not suggest that our analyses are conclusive. However, they do support the proposition that better understanding of the causes of decline at finer spatial scales will emerge most strongly in studies that link habitat quality with <b>granivore</b> demography at inland sites of highly variable year-to-year rainfall and with strongly contrasting grazing histories...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of specific seed traits in scatter-hoarded tree species often has {{been attributed to}} <b>granivore</b> foraging behavior. However, the degree to which foraging investments and seed traits correlate with phylogenetic relationships among trees remains unexplored.

5000|$|One {{promising}} {{factor that}} could lead to and be responsible for increased <b>granivore</b> in Agropyron cristatum is a certain genetic difference found on chromosome 6 of plants with a higher <b>granivore</b> content. Plants with a translocation on chromosome 6P yield wheat of greater weight and longer spike length than those without the mutation. Agropyron cristatum possesses higher tiller number, higher floret numbers, and greater resistance to various pathogens such as wheat rusts, powdery mildew, and barley yellow dwarf virus than many of its close wheat relatives. It has been used to cross-breed with other species of grass and wheat to transfer a greater disease resistance to them, as well as enhance their properties as a food source. This cross-breeding involves the transferring of the chromosome 6P translocation to the species it is cross-breeding with. Chromosome 6P of A. cristatum has also been proven {{to play an important role}} in regulating fertile tiller number and it possesses positive and negative regulators of tiller number. These regulators were specifically found to be on the 6PS and 6PL chromosome arms. High floret numbers and number of kernals per spike is controlled by genes located on chromosome 6P of Agropyron cristatum. Agropyron cristatum’s genes can be used to instill leaf resistance in other species of wheat. Three backcrosses between Agropyron cristatum and Aegilops tauschii produces a number stable, fertile lines of Aegilops tauschii that then has resistance to leaf rust. [...] Also, multi-spike cultivars of A. cristatum have been found to be more stable agronomically and achieve higher yields than cultivars with large-spike type.|$|R
