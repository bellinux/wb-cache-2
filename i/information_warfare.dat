Unlike the United States military, the ADF does not class cyberwarfare as being a separate sphere of warfare. In July 2017 an <b>Information</b> <b>Warfare</b> Division was raised, tasked with both defensive and offensive cyber operations.|$|E

Throughout the war, No. 87 Squadron flew a variety of aircraft from bases in Australia, gathering photographic intelligence on Japanese forces and installations throughout the Pacific. At the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron was disbanded but was later re-formed in 1948, carrying out aerial survey operations in Australia until 1953.

25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{primarily}} {{engages in}} <b>information</b> <b>warfare</b> rather than overt actions {{to topple the}} government. They smuggle information {{in and out of}} North Korea. This includes participating in balloon drops. Balloon drops— containing candy, pornographic pictures and propaganda leaflets— were previously performed by the South Korean government, but since the Sunshine Policy under the Kim Dae-jung administration, the balloon drops have been done only unofficially under human rights and defector groups. While releasing balloons is not illegal, the South Korean government often tries to stop balloon releases. Other activities of the North Korean People's Liberation Front include firing squad stage performances of the Kim family members, and smuggling various kinds of media across the North Korean border through China. For instance, in 2014 they sent 6,000 laptops to North Korea, and in early 2015, they smuggled 800 copies of The Interview into North Korea across the border. In 2010, they uncovered a plan by the North Korean National Security Council to disrupt the G20 summit in Seoul.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{military}} analyst William Connor cautioned {{that in the}} Soviet sense, the doctrine covered much more than camouflage and deception. It had, he suggested, the connotation of active control of the enemy. By the time of Operation Bagration in 1944, Connor argues, the Russian doctrine of military deception already included all these aspects. The meaning evolved in Soviet practice and doctrine to include strategic, political, and diplomatic objectives, in other words operating at all levels. This differs from Western doctrines on deception, and from <b>information</b> <b>warfare</b> doctrines, by its emphasis on pragmatic aspects. According to the analyst James Hansen, deception [...] "is treated as an operational art to be polished by professors of military science and officers who specialize in this area."
