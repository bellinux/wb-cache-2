5|$|In Epiphanius' polemic {{against the}} Ebionites found in Panarion 30, a complex picture emerges of {{the beliefs and}} {{practices}} of the 4th century Ebionites that cannot easily be separated from his method of combining together disparate sources. While scholars such as Hans-Joachim Schoeps literally interpreted Epiphanius' account as describing a later syncretic development of Ebionism, more recent scholarship <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> difficult to reconcile his report {{with those of the}} earlier Church Fathers, leading to a conjecture by scholar Petri Luomanen that a second group of Hellenistic-Samaritan Ebionites may also have been present. The rejection of the Jewish sacrifices and the implication of an end-time prophet Christology {{due to the lack of}} a birth narrative lend support for the association of the Gospel of the Ebionites with a group or groups different from the Ebionites known to Irenaeus.|$|E

500|$|Harold Bloom, in 1961, {{described}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] as [...] "the {{most perfect}} shorter poem in the English language." [...] Following this, Walter Jackson Bate, in 1963, claimed that [...] " [...] each generation <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{one of the}} most nearly perfect poems in English." [...] Later, in 1973, Stuart Sperry wrote, To Autumn' succeeds through its acceptance of an order innate in our experience [...] the natural rhythm of the seasons. It is a poem that, without ever stating it, inevitably suggests the truth of 'ripeness is all' by developing, with a richness of profundity of implication, the simple perception that ripeness is fall." [...] In 1981, William Walsh argued that [...] "Among the major Odes [...] no one has questioned the place and supremacy of 'To Autumn', in which we see wholly realized, powerfully embodied in art, the complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in Keats's life, so persuasively argued about in his letters." [...] Literary critic and academic Helen Vendler, in 1988, declared that [...] "in the ode 'To Autumn,' Keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for the social value of art." ...|$|E
500|$|Keats's {{use of the}} odal hymn in his six odes, {{along with}} {{his use of the}} odal hymn with a responsal voice in [...] "Ode to a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", created, {{according}} to Walter Jackson Bate, [...] "a new tone for the English lyric." [...] Bate, when speaking about the 1819 odes, wrote: [...] "The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer. Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning. It was rather a matter of becoming more alive in preparation for the next beginning." [...] In addition to this, Bate argued that [...] "It is because [...] "To Autumn" [...] is so uniquely a distillation, and at many different levels, that each generation <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> one of the most nearly perfect poems in English. We need not be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [...] The 'Ode to a Nightingale,' for example, is a less 'perfect' though a greater poem." [...] Charles Patterson argued the relationship of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats, [...] "The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of [...] "To Autumn" [...] but is much superior in these qualities to the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Later, Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] drew neither attention nor admiration. Herbert Grierson believed [...] "Nightingale" [...] to be superior to the other odes because it and [...] "To Autumn" [...] were more logical and contained stronger arguments. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
500|$|Rebecca Mader's {{audition}} {{scene was}} a fake flashback {{and she was}} disappointed {{that it was not}} used for the show. [...] The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast. [...] Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American; however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly. [...] Losts writer-producers compared Mader to [...] "a young Nicole Kidman". [...] During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a [...] "successful academic". [...] It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte; Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her. [...] Despite never having seen Lost, Mader decided that she [...] "was not going to leave [...] room until [...] made [...] fall in love with [...] ". [...] Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role. [...] In the next two to three weeks, Mader– who was then signed on as a recurring guest star– watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group. [...] Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that [...] "she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type". [...] Mader <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives. [...] Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis, best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity. [...] Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it [...] "wicked" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] for her character to be named after him. [...] Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that [...] "I just wanted to rough it. [...] I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun." [...] Mader claims that she has [...] "never had so much fun in [...] life" [...] as when she is shooting Lost. In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth season episode [...] "LaFleur", when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.|$|E
