50|$|The {{alluvial}} floodplain that lines much of {{the lower}} canyon today is largely {{a result of the}} Wisconsinian glaciation, which forced sea level worldwide to drop up to 400 ft from their previous level in the Sangamon <b>interglacial</b> <b>era.</b> This coincided with a massive North American climate change that shifted the cold, rainy climate of the Pacific Northwest further south to Southern California. Rainfall exceeding 80 in per year changed the slow-moving streams of the South Coast to powerful rivers that eroded deep channels into their floodplains to maintain equilibrium with the dropping sea level.The Wisconsinian era lasted from 70,000 to 10,000 years ago, {{and by the end of}} that period, climate changed to its present state and Southern California rivers reverted to small seasonal streams. The end of the Wisconsinian also marked the rise of sea level about 300 ft to its present-day level. The canyons carved by the rivers became long narrow inlets which gradually filled with sediments, but the difference in sea level between the pre-Wisconsinian and post-Wisconsinian was responsible for the formation of river terraces along most streams with a floodplain.|$|E
40|$|Solar {{variability}} {{influences the}} climate of a planet by radiatively forcing changes over a certain timescale; orbital variations of a planet, which yield similar solar forcing modulations, can be studied within the same scientific context. It is known for Earth that obliquity changes have {{played a critical role}} in pacing glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>eras.</b> For Mars, such orbital changes have been far greater and have generated extreme variations in insolation. Signatures associated with the presence of water ice reservoirs at various positions across the surface of Mars during periods of different orbital configurations have been identified. For this reason, it has been proposed that Mars is currently evolving between ice ages. The advent of climate tools has given a theoretical frame to the study of orbitally-induced climate changes on Mars. These models have provided an explanation to many puzzling observations, which when put together have permitted reconstruction of almost the entire history of Mars in the last 10 million years. This paper proposes to give an overview of the scientific work dedicated to this topic...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT / Despite the {{considerable}} progress achieved during {{recent years in}} quantifying and modeling climatic and ecological processes caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, there are still major un-certainties regarding the potential effects of increasing con-centrations of either CO 2 (carbon dioxide) or future climate change in arid ecosystems. General Circulation Models pre-dict varying patterns of moister or drier conditions in deserts for the next century, but the results of climatic and ecosystem modeling in relation to deserts in a future “greenhouse effect” climate are complex and contradictory. Nevertheless, if deserts do respond more dramatically to global temperature change, as they did during the Holocene and, especially the last <b>interglacial</b> <b>era</b> (130, 000 years ago), they might act as glo-bally significant sinks of carbon into soils and vegetation...|$|E
