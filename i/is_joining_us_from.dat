5000|$|On 10 October 2006 clashes erupted between {{supporters}} of Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena headed by Raj Thackeray. It was alleged that workers of MNS had torn the posters bearing {{the photographs of}} Shiv Sena Supremo Bal Thackeray near the SIES college in Mumbai. Later as a retaliation it was alleged that Shiv Sena workers brought down the hoardings with Raj Thackeray's photo near the Sena Bhavan at Dadar. As the news spread about the incident groups gathered near the Sena Bhavan and started pelting stones at each other. In this incident a policeman was injured and many {{supporters of}} both parties were injured. To restore order the police fired tear gas shells at the mob. Decorum was eventually restored following police action {{and the appearance of}} Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray at the venue. Uddhav appealed to Sena workers to go back home. He said:"The police will take necessary action. This is happening because many people <b>are</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> MNS. The defections have started and that is why they are resorting to such actions".The division chief of the Shiv Sena Milind Vaidya said that they had lodged a complaint with the local police against an MNS worker who was involved in the incident. MNS general secretary Pravin Darekar, however, pinned the cause down to local elections in the SIES college. He alleges that the Sena is concerned about losing their hold over the colleges and that is why they are trying to color the issue, adding that the Sena's allegations had no merit. Raj Thackeray asserts that MNS could not have vandalized the pictures, seeing as how he and his members revere Bal Thackeray.A Parliamentary committee was set up to examine the breach of privileges notices from some MPs for remarks made by Bal Thackeray against Uttar Bharatiyas. Reacting to this, MNS chief Raj Thackeray had said he would not allow any politician from UP and Bihar to enter Mumbai if the parliamentary panel insisted on summoning Bal. Bal countered this by terming his nephew Raj a [...] "backstabber" [...] and reacted to the MNS chief with a [...] "big no thank you." ...|$|R
