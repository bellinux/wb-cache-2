50|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>schools</b> in the United States educate a tiny {{fraction}} of the school-age population (slightly over 1% of the entire school-age population, around 10% of students who go to private schools).

In contrast, public schools are funded and governed by local and state governments, and most parochial schools are owned, governed, and financed by religious institutions such as a diocese or parish. <b>Independent</b> <b>schools</b> may be affiliated with a particular religion or denomination; however, unlike parochial <b>schools,</b> <b>independent</b> <b>schools</b> are self-owned and governed by independent boards of trustees. While <b>independent</b> <b>schools</b> are not subject to significant government oversight or regulation, they are accredited by the same six regional accreditation agencies that accredit public schools.
