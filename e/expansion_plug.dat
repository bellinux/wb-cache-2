40|$|To {{determine}} the tensile properties of irradiated fuel cladding {{in a hot}} cell, a simple test was developed at ORNL and is described fully in US Patent Application 20060070455, Expanded plug method for developing circumferential mechanical properties of tubular materials. This method is designed for testing fuel rod cladding ductility in a hot cell utilizing an expandable plug to stretch a small ring of irradiated cladding material. The specimen strain is determined using the measured diametrical expansion of the ring. This method removes many complexities associated with specimen preparation and testing. The advantages are the simplicity of measuring the test component assembly in the hot cell and the direct measurement of specimen strain. It was also found that cladding strength could be determined from the test results. The basic approach of this test method is to apply an axial compressive load to a cylindrical plug of polyurethane (or other materials) fitted inside a short ring of the test material to achieve radial expansion of the specimen. The diameter increase of the specimen {{is used to calculate}} the circumferential strain accrued during the test. The other two basic measurements are total applied load and amount of plug compression (extension). A simple procedure is used to convert the load circumferential strain data from the ring tests into material pseudo-stress-strain curves. However, several deficiencies exist in this expanded-plug loading ring test, which will impact accuracy of test results and introduce potential shear failure of the specimen due to inherited large axial compressive stress from the <b>expansion</b> <b>plug</b> test. First of all, the highly non-uniform stress and strain distribution resulted in the gage section of the clad. To ensure reliable testing and test repeatability, the potential for highly non-uniform stress distribution or displacement/strain deformation has to be eliminated at the gage section of the specimen. Second, significant compressive stresses were induced by clad bending deformation due to a clad bulging effect (or the barreling effect). The barreling effect caused very large localized shear stress in the clad and left testing material at a high risk of shear failure. The above combined effects will result in highly non-conservative predictions both in strength and ductility of the tested clad, and the associated mechanical properties as well. To overcome/mitigate the mentioned deficiencies associated with the current <b>expansion</b> <b>plug</b> test, systematic studies have been conducted. Through detailed parameter investigation on specific geometry designs, careful filtering of material for the <b>expansion</b> <b>plug,</b> as well as adding newly designed parts to the testing system, a method to reconcile the potential non-conservatism embedded in the <b>expansion</b> <b>plug</b> test system has been discovered. A modified <b>expansion</b> <b>plug</b> testing protocol has been developed based on the method. In order to closely resemble thin-wall theory, a general procedure was also developed to {{determine the}} hoop stress in the tested ring specimen. A scaling factor called -factor is defined to correlate the ring load P into hoop stress., =. The generated stress-strain curve agrees very well with tensile test data in both the elastic and plastic regions...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{performed}} on the International Space Station (ISS) frequently require the experimental organisms to be preserved until they can be returned to earth for analysis in the appropriate laboratory facility. The Kennedy Fixation Tube (KFT) was developed to allow astronauts to apply fixative, chemical compounds that are often toxic, to biological samples {{without the use of}} a glovebox while maintaining three levels of containment (Fig. 1). KFTs have been used over 200 times on-orbit with no leaks of chemical fixative. The KFT is composed of the following elements: a polycarbonate main tube where the fixative is loaded preflight, the sample tube where the plant or other biological specimens is placed during operations, the <b>expansion</b> <b>plug,</b> actuator, and base plug that provides fixative containment (Fig. 2). The main tube is pre-filled with 25 mL of fixative solution prior to flight. When actuated, the specimen contained within the sample tube is immersed with approximately 22 mL (+/- 2 mL) of the fixative solution. The KFT has been demonstrated to maintain its containment at ambient temperatures, 4 degC refrigeration and - 100 C freezing conditions...|$|E

40|$|The flowfield {{and base}} {{pressure}} characteristics of an internal-external <b>expansion,</b> truncated <b>plug</b> nozzle are described over the pressure ratio range from 'open' wake to 'closed' wake conditions. The effect of plug length on these characteristics, including {{the process of}} wake 'closure' is also presented. An existing method for calculating the flowfield and base pressure, for 'closed' wake operation, is modified to include the internal shock wave generated near the shroud exit. The supersonic portion of the flow is calculated using rotational axisymmetric method of characteristics. The technique of Hartree is employed so that the downstream characteristic point locations can be chosen to fit the developing flowfield. An overexpansion technique is used to detect the internal shock wave {{in the vicinity of}} the shroud exit so that its effect on the plug base pressure could be determined.

40|$|Unbleached {{kraft pulp}} for making sack paper is usually first refined {{in a high}} {{consistency}} process followed by low consistency refining {{in order to achieve}} desired paper properties, such as high strain at break and high tensile energy absorption at low airflow resistance. Conventional atmospheric high consistency refining is compared to treatments using two types of compressive screw equipment, Bivis equipment and the pressure <b>expansion</b> (PREX) <b>plug</b> screw feeder, commonly used in thermo mechanical pulp (TMP) plants. The plug screw pretreatments were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 120 °C and 130 °C. Treatment in the Bivis equipment was performed under different compressive and shear conditions. After the Bivis and plug screw treatments, the pulp samples were refined in a low consistency process using the Escher-Wyss refiner. Paper properties were evaluated on freely dried sheets which were produced in order to simulate paper made under industrial sack paper drying conditions. The highest levels of the tensile energy absorption index and strain at break were achieved from curled and kinked fibres, pre-treated under the most compressive and highest shear stress conditions before low consistency refining. These results were obtained at very low airflow resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper, and with very low energy consumption during pre-treatment with the plug screw. The pulp samples pre-treated at high consistency in a plug screw feeder under steam-pressurised conditions or in the Bivis equipment showed, after low consistency refining, increased shrinking ability compared to the pulp samples pre-treated in high consistency refining under atmospheric conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of decreasing the sheet density of paper made from unbleached kraft pulp for the middle layer in board production. The objective was to evaluate how treatments in a compressive screw equipment pressure <b>expansion</b> (PREX) <b>plug</b> screw feeder, atmospheric (HCatm) and pressurised high-consistency refining (HCpress refining) affect both fibre and paper properties and, in particular, how fibre curl affects sheet density. The plug screw pre-treatments and HC refining were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 100 degrees C, 125 degrees C and 175 degrees C. Even though fibre curl increased considerably during plug screw treatment and HCatm and HCpress refining, {{the density of the}} paper sheets did not decrease, as had been expected. A possible explanation for this result may be that the fibres become more flexible during curl treatment, resulting in increased sheet density. In order to obtain fibres that were both very curly and stiff, three ways of improving the fibre stiffness were tested: 1) lowering the pH during refining, 2) drying the fibres (hornification) and 3) treating the fibres with 1, 2, 3, 4 -ButaneTetraCarboxylic Acid (BTCA). If the fibres are dried (hornified), there is a lowering effect on sheet density. However, fibre curl does not have any lowering effect on sheet density. If the pH is decreased during plug screw treatment, the sheet density may be reduced but, again, the fibre curl does not have any positive effect on sheet density. Fibres treated with BTCA had a marked lowering effect on sheet density. With this treatment, the fibre curl does {{have a positive effect on}} sheet density. The BTCA-treated fibres were also used to lower sheet density. A mixture of 15 % by weight BTCA- treated fibres resulted in an approximately 9 % density reduction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUp to now {{the common}} {{material}} used for flexible plug joints of bridges {{has been based}} on bituminous mixtures consisting of aggregates and elastomeric-modified binders. All existing national regulations and also the European Guideline for Expansion Joints ETAG 032 are restricting flexible plug joints to these traditional bituminous mixtures. All existing asphaltic mixtures are susceptible for plastic deformations at higher temperatures including rutting whereas they cause significant reaction forces at low temperatures. These properties limit the application of the traditional joints to areas with moderate climate. In practice asphaltic <b>plug</b> <b>expansion</b> joints also often fail in the intersection between adjacent pavement and joint, causing cracks and leakages. The new expansion joint system shows essential improvements in the intersection pavement/joint by mechanical means and uses a new material based on polyurethane, which does not show negative temperature affine properties and can be processed in cold condition. The new flexible plug joint system also enables new applications, both for a wider climatic range and more complicated geometries. Furthermore the new flexible plug joint allows for larger movements up to more than 100 mm and addresses a longer design working life. As the new design is not covered by existing standards and verification methods in the first phase a comprehensive research had to executed after consultation with leading European experts from Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{dynamics}} of structures with thin piezoelectric layers. Piezoelectric materials are used in sensor and actuators and common applications for these are vibration damping, ultrasonic transducers, buzzards and more. In {{one part of the}} thesis power series expansions are used to obtain approximate plate equations or approximate boundary conditions. This is done by expanding the displacements and the electric potential in power series in the thickness coordinate. These <b>expansions</b> are then <b>plugged</b> into the equations of motion, where all but the lowest order expansion functions can be eliminated. The boundary conditions then give either the approximate plate equations, or the approximate boundary conditions. Approximate plate equations are obtained for two different cases. In the first case they are developed for an elastic, isotropic, homogeneous plate. The obtained plate equations are then compared with, e. g., Mindlin's plate theory. In the second case the approximate plate equations are obtained for a piezoelectric and an elastic plate bonded together. Another part of the thesis deals with the calculation of eigenfrequencies for a solid 3 D piezoelectric cylinder. The modes for an infinite plate are derived in a cylindrical coordinate system. These are then used to obtain the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of a circular cylinder with finite radius. In the last part the optimal placement of piezoelectric actuators on an elastic plate is discussed. The optimal locations are found by investigating the transfer function for the plate, with the actuators applied. These locations are the points where the piezoelectric actuators will have most impact on the underlying elastic structure...|$|R

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{reported on the}} development of a biomimetic vein model to measure the performance of sclerosing foams. In this study we employed the model to compare the commercially-available Varithena(®) (polidocanol injectable foam) 1 % varicose vein treatment (referred to as polidocanol endovenous microfoam, or PEM) with physician compounded foams (PCFs) made using different foam generation methods (Double Syringe System and Tessari methods) and different foam formulations [liquid to gas ratios of 1 : 3 or 1 : 7; gas mixtures composed of 100 % CO 2, various CO 2 :O 2 mixtures and room air (RA) ]. PCFs produced using the DSS method had longer dwell times (DTs) (range 0. 54 - 2. 21 s/cm in the 4 mm diameter vein model) than those of the corresponding PCFs produced by the Tessari technique (range 0. 29 - 0. 94 s/cm). PEM had the longest DT indicating the best cohesive stability of any of the foams produced (2. 92 s/cm). Other biomimetic model variables investigated included effect of vessel size, delayed injection and rate of plug formation (injection speed). When comparing the 4 and 10 mm vessel diameters, the DTs seen in the 10 mm vessel were higher than those observed for the 4 mm vessel, as the vein angle had been reduced to 5 ° to allow for foam plug formation. PCF foam performance was in the order RA > CO 2 :O 2 (35 : 65) ? CO 2 :O 2 (65 : 35) > CO 2; PEM had a longer DT than all PCFs (22. 10 s/cm) except that for RA made by DSS which was similar but more variable. The effect of delayed injection was also investigated and the DT for PEM remained the longest of all foams with the lowest percentage deviation with respect to the mean values, indicating a consistent foam performance. When considering rate of plug formation, PEM consistently produced the longest DTs and this was possible even at low <b>plug</b> <b>expansion</b> rates (mean 29. 5 mm/s, minimum 20. 9 mm/s). The developed vein model has therefore demonstrated that PEM consistently displays higher foam stability and cohesiveness when compared to PCFs, over a range of clinically-relevant operational variables...|$|R
