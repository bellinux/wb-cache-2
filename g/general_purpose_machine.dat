5|$|The Portuguese {{forces were}} {{under the command of}} General António Augusto dos Santos, a man with strong faith in new {{counter-insurgency}} theories. Augusto dos Santos supported a collaboration with Rhodesia to create African Scout units and other special forces teams, with Rhodesian forces even conducting their own independent operations during the conflict. Due to Portuguese policy of retaining up-to-date equipment for the metropole while shipping obsolete equipment to the colonies, the Portuguese soldiers fighting in the opening stages of the conflict were equipped with World War II radios and the old Mauser rifle. As the fighting progressed, the need for more modern equipment was rapidly recognised, and the Heckler & Koch G3 and FN FAL rifles were adopted as the standard battlefield weapon, along with the AR-10 for paratroopers. The MG42 and, then in 1968, the HK21 were the Portuguese <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> guns, with 60, 81 and 120mm mortars, howitzers and the AML-60, Panhard EBR, Fox and Chaimite armoured cars frequently deployed for fire support.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Software Defined Networks (SDN) aim to {{deconstruct}} current routers into a {{small number}} of controllers, which are <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machines,</b> and a large number of switches that contain programmable forwarding engines. The vision is that instead of the ad-hoc mechanisms used in current routers we can build programmable networks using proper computer science abstractions. This technology is now at the startup stage, and is being deployed in the data centres of large web service firms. We are interested in protecting a future SDN. The current designs follow traditional security assumptions and do not consider many likely deployment scenarios. We discuss how SDN architecture can be structured to offer more security, the auxiliary services that such a network will require and the advantages that it can offer. ...|$|R
