Although quality indicators have been developed in other countries, Canadian cardiovascular disease indicators do not exist. OBJECTIVE: To develop quality indicators for measuring and improving congestive heart failure (CHF) care in Canada. METHODS: An 11 -member multidisciplinary national expert panel was selected from nominees from national medical organizations. Potential quality indicators were identified by a detailed search of pub-lished guidelines, randomized trials and outcomes studies. A two-step modified Delphi process was employed with an initial screening round of indicator ratings, followed by a national quality <b>indicator</b> <b>panel</b> meet-ing, where definitions of the indicators were developed using consensus methods.

The study reports the impact using two statistical methods: 1) statistical analysis of double differencing; and 2) calculation of DALYs (disability adjusted life years). The results indicate a self-reported reduction from 30 per cent to 14 per cent in cases of waterborne diseases between 2008 and 2010 in the intervention areas. Regression analysis suggests that 3. 1 percentage points of this 16 point decline can be attributed to interventions under the programme. Furthermore the paper noted a 2 per cent reduction in DALYs between 2008 and 2010 in the target communities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature by using propensity score matching to test for causal effects of starting to export on firm performance in Croatian manufacturing firm-level data. The results confirm that exporters have characteristics superior to those of non-exporters. In the main sample specification there is pervasive evidence of self-selection into export markets, meaning that firms are successful years before they become exporters. Using multiple firm performance <b>indicators,</b> <b>panel</b> and cross section data models together with various sample specifications there is scant evidence on learning-by-exporting which holds true only in a few cases. On the other hand, higher sales growth is found to be a more conclusive distinguishing characteristic of new exporters.

5000|$|Level 2 is {{a digital}} radio-based system. Movement {{authority}} and other signal aspects {{are displayed in}} the cab for the driver. Apart from a few <b>indicator</b> <b>panels,</b> it is therefore possible to dispense with trackside signalling. However, the train detection and the train integrity supervision still remain {{in place at the}} trackside. Train movements are monitored continually by the radio block centre using this trackside-derived information. The movement authority is transmitted to the vehicle continuously via GSM-R together with speed information and route data. The Eurobalises are used at this level as passive positioning beacons or [...] "electronic milestones". Between two positioning beacons, the train determines its position via sensors (axle transducers, accelerometer and radar). The positioning beacons are used in this case as reference points for correcting distance measurement errors. The on-board computer continuously monitors the transferred data and the maximum permissible speed.|$|R

40|$|Background. Cardiovascular (CV) {{diseases}} are major causes of morbidity {{and death in}} adults in the world. Major differences {{have been reported in}} the management strategies and the outcome of CV diseases within and between countries. To better understand and address these differences, there is a need for quantitative information on patient management, outcome, and prognosis. Objective. This article describes the development of a set of quality indicators for cardiac care and summarizes work under-taken by the Cardiac Care Panel of the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators Project. Methods. A list of 61 potential indicators was identified through a literature search, review of national measurement systems, and nomination from countries participating in the project. The Cardiac Care Panel then used a modified Delphi process developed originally by RAND to select <b>indicators.</b> <b>Panel</b> members individually rated each indicator on a scale of 1 – 9 for scientific soundness and importance. All indicators receiving scores of 7 or more for both importance and soundness were included in the final set. Results. Seventeen cardiac indicators were selected for the final set of indicators from the following areas: acute coronary syndromes, cardiac interventions, secondary prevention, and congestive heart failure. Conclusions. The final set of 17 indicators selected by the Cardiac Care Panel constitutes a comprehensive set of measures fo...|$|R

If, {{on the one}} hand, this {{equalization}} {{resulted in}} an expressive organizational restructuring, with growth {{of the number of}} educational units, in addition to the incorporation of new educational levels, on the other, this institutional growth was dissociated from efforts of standardization of administrative processes, notably, under the academic departments of different units – where it shows a variation of the process of launching notes/concepts.
