5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
25|$|It was his baptism of fire, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> {{wondered}} at the strange caprice which strikes down {{one man in}} his first skirmish and protects another time after time. But I suppose all pitchers will get broken in the end. Outwardly I sympathised with my brother in his misfortune, which he mourned bitterly, since it prevented him {{taking part in the}} impending battle, but secretly I confess myself well content that this young gentleman should be honourably out of harm's way for a month.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney {{acted as if}} we had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, being the first London lady with whom I had the pleasure of acquaintance, I saw in her what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} money <b>I</b> <b>had</b> earned in my life, and a prouder day than many <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>since.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>since</b> that time, {{discovered}} {{that her name}} was Margaret Porcher, {{and that she was}} the most awkward, slatternly, and obstinate servant in the house.|$|R
6000|$|Walter {{was silent}} for a few minutes, then drew a sigh, saying, 'Poor Isabel, <b>I</b> wish it <b>had</b> not been! These were the only {{comfortable}} holidays <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> she chose to marry.' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{right arm}} {{was over the}} belly, {{the back of the}} hand and wrist had on it clotted blood. The legs were drawn up with the feet close to the wall. The body and face were warm and the hand cold. The legs were quite warm. Deceased had a silk {{handkerchief}} round her neck, and it appeared to be slightly torn. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> ascertained it was cut. This corresponded with the right angle of the jaw. The throat was deeply gashed and there was an abrasion of the skin about one and a half inches in diameter, apparently stained with blood, under her right arm.|$|E
500|$|Having {{completed}} work on Ulysses, Joyce was {{so exhausted}} {{that he did}} not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923 he wrote a letter to his patron, Harriet Weaver: [...] "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them." [...] This is the earliest reference to what would become Finnegans Wake.|$|E
500|$|Stoney {{initially}} {{coined the}} term electrolion in 1881. Ten years later, he switched to electron to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894: [...] "... an estimate {{was made of the}} actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, for which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> ventured to suggest the name electron". A 1906 proposal to change to electrion failed because Hendrik Lorentz preferred to keep electron. The word electron is a combination of the words electric and ion. The suffix [...] which is now used to designate other subatomic particles, such as a proton or neutron, is in turn derived from electron.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "Thank goodness, I shall {{get out of}} this frightful place to-morrow, {{and soon}} have once more a roof of my own over my head. What an {{experience}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I not be {{the judge}} of that?" [...] he begged. [...] "Giving depends upon the recipient, you know. You have given me more {{happiness}} within this last half-hour than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> we parted in France." ...|$|R
60|$|I gave {{myself over}} to the first real merriment <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard of Mr. Carvel's death.|$|R
500|$|Bourdon's agent, Kent Hughes, {{stated that}} he never knew about his client's new hobby (motorcycles). [...] "I had no idea," [...] he {{explained}} to CKNW in Vancouver. [...] "Another client of ours, Kris Letang, said Luc let him know he was riding his dad's motorcycle with some friends {{a week or two}} ago. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> been told—though I don't know—that he actually bought a motorcycle two days ago". Maryse Bourdon, Luc's stepmother, said he had purchased the motorcycle about three weeks before. Letang, Bourdon's close friend and former roommate from junior hockey, planned to buy a motorcycle after Bourdon told him about his; because of the crash, he decided against it.|$|E
500|$|Having {{completed}} work on Ulysses, Joyce was {{so exhausted}} {{that he did}} not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923 he informed a patron, Harriet Weaver: [...] "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them. Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio, the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'" [...] Thus was born a text that became known, first, as Work in Progress and later Finnegans Wake.|$|E
500|$|After Louisbourg, {{the company}} was {{stationed}} first at Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick), and then at Fort St. Anne, where {{the company was}} part of a campaign against Indians and Acadians that had taken refuge there from the ongoing expulsion of the Acadians. [...] These raids were sometimes quite brutal; the company was known to scalp Acadian settlers. [...] In one particularly brutal incident, Hazen was responsible for the scalping of six men, and the burning of four others, along with two women and three children, in a house he set on fire. [...] Joseph Bellefontaine, a leader of the local militia and the father of one of the women, claimed that he was forced to witness this event in an attempt to coerce his cooperation with the rangers. [...] (Bellefontaine escaped into the woods with two of his grandchildren.) [...] General Jeffrey Amherst, who did not hear of the incident until after he had promoted Hazen to captain, noted, [...] "I am sorry that to say what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> heard of that affair has sullied his merit with me as I shall always disapprove of killing women and helpless children." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have had}} a {{tremendous}} night; the largest house <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>had</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> first began--two thousand three hundred people. To-morrow afternoon, at three, I read again.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] replied Tarzan, with a smile, [...] "it has {{convinced}} {{me that it is}} the one worth-while street in all Paris. Never again shall I miss an opportunity to traverse it, for it has given me the first real entertainment <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> left Africa." ...|$|R
60|$|N.B. <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> however, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{wrote the}} above, heard Mr. J. Hookham Frere speak highly of Fulgentius.|$|R
2500|$|... "Our {{grandfather}} was intimately acquainted {{with all the}} traditionary legends which that great writer [...] has since made use of in the Tales of a Grandfather and other works. As a boy I remember listening to him with delight, for his memory was stored with a never-ending stock of stories, {{many of which were}} wonderfully like those <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> heard while sitting by the African evening fires. Our grandmother, too, used to sing Gaelic songs, some of which, as she believed, had been composed by captive islanders languishing hopelessly among the Turks [...]|$|E
2500|$|In a 1994 {{debate with}} Senator Ted Kennedy, Romney said: [...] "One {{of the great}} things about our nation ... is that we're each {{entitled}} to have strong personal beliefs, and we encourage other people to do the same. But as a nation, we recognize the right of all people to believe as they want and not to impose our beliefs on other people. I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate. I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it, and I sustain and support that law, and the right of a woman to make that choice, and my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, Tom Cruise, {{an actor}} and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, {{condemned}} Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking {{in favor of the}} antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, [...] "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has her career gone?" [...] Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "dangerous." [...] She said that he should [...] "stick to fighting aliens" [...] (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds {{as well as some of}} the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), [...] "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." [...] The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay [...] "War of Words" [...] published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, [...] "In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>since</b> tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." [...] On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was [...] "heartfelt." [...] Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I {{received}} yesterday {{two most}} charming letters--the nicest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> left--December 26th and January 1st: this morning I got January 3rd.|$|R

5000|$|... "Part of my {{original}} intention with the Jerry Cornelius stories was {{to liberate the}} narrative; to leave it open to the readers interpretation {{as much as possible}} - to involve the reader {{in such a way as}} to bring their own imagination into play. This impulse was probably a result of my interest in Brecht - an interest <b>Id</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> the mid-fifties.|$|R
