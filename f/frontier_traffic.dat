500|$|The {{building}} phase {{started on}} September 22, 1966, on the interchange {{that was to}} replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86million (about $ in [...] dollars). SR109 was planned to follow Camino del Rio up to the <b>Frontier</b> <b>traffic</b> circle, where the city of San Diego would resume construction; both SR109 and SR209 were {{to be built in}} the future. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Bidding for the SR109 contract was to begin in 1968, after the City Council endorsed the route in December 1967. Completion of both the interchange and SR109 was planned for early 1969. An interchange was planned at Midway Drive, and the western end of the freeway was to be at Sunset Cliffs and Nimitz boulevards. The cost of the SR109 project was estimated to be $2.3million (about $ in [...] dollars).|$|E

5000|$|Another {{way is to}} use multi-system {{motive power}} that can operate under several {{different}} voltages and current types. In Europe, two-, three and four-system locomotives for cross <b>frontier</b> freight <b>traffic</b> are becoming a common sight (1.5 kV DC, 3 kV DC, 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC, 25 kV, 50 Hz AC). [...] Locomotives and multiple units so equipped can, depending on line configuration and operation rules, pass from one electrification system to another without a stop, coasting for a short distance for the change over, past the dead section between the different voltages.|$|R
5000|$|Colonel Plug (1700s? - 1820?), {{also known}} as Colonel Fluger and [...] "The Last of the Boat-Wreckers", who existed {{sometime}} between the 1790s and 1820, was the legendary river pirate who ran a criminal gang on the Ohio River in a cypress swamp {{near the mouth of}} the Cache River. The outlaw camp of Colonel Plug was supposedly below the river pirate hideout of Cave-In-Rock and the U.S. Army post at Fort Massac, which monitored and policed <b>frontier</b> river <b>traffic</b> just above the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{abortive}} {{attempt by}} Britain and Spain {{to negotiate the}} joint sovereignty of Gibraltar in 2001 – 02, the incoming Spanish Government in 2004 proposed {{the establishment of a}} Forum of Dialogue, in which for the first time Gibraltar would take part as an independent third party. This Forum was designed to achieve cooperation across a number of issues, including the use of the airport, <b>frontier</b> <b>traffic</b> flows, pensions for former Spanish workers in Gibraltar and telecommunications, and by September 2006 proposed solutions were reached on all of them. The paper explores the Forum process and its achievements, but concludes that, given the fundamental differences in the ultimate objectives of the Forum participants and in particular Spain’s sensitivity to Gibraltar’s status, the agreements may only prove to be a means of managing the Gibraltar ‘problem’ rather than resolving it. Finally, the article considers whether the Forum model offers any lessons for other disputes in the region where sovereignty is contested...|$|E
50|$|Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri {{spent the}} winter of 1515 and the spring of 1516 {{preparing}} an army he proposed leading to the disturbed confines of Asia Minor. Before beginning the march, an embassy arrived from Selim I promising in friendly terms to agree to Mamluk requests to appoint an Egyptian vassal to the Beylik of Dulkadir - a long-standing buffer state between Mamluks and Ottomans - and to reopen the <b>frontier</b> to the <b>traffic</b> of goods and slaves. On 18 May 1516 Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri set out from Cairo with a large force (reportedly 20,000 knights), appointed well in all respects but artillery.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} points {{to be dealt with}} in 1897 was to settle the {{incubation}} period for this disease, and the period to be adopted for administrative purposes. It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of disease notification was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, {{and at the same time}} state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land <b>frontiers</b> against <b>traffic.</b> As regards the Red Sea, it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.|$|R
