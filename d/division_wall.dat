One other obvious remedy for his dejection was to indulge in the society of Miss Garland, love being so much more effectually got rid of by displacement than by attempted annihilation. But Loveday's belief that he had offended her beyond forgiveness, and his ever-present sense {{of her as a}} woman who by education and antecedents was fitted to adorn a higher sphere than his own, effectually kept him from going near her for a long time, notwithstanding that they were inmates of one house. The reserve was, however, in some degree broken by the appearance one morning, later in the season, of the point of a saw through the partition which divided Anne's room from the Loveday half of the house. Though she dined and supped with her mother and the Loveday family, Miss Garland had still continued to occupy her old apartments, because she found it more convenient there to pursue her hobbies of wool-work and of copying her father's old pictures.

40|$|The {{periclinal}} {{walls of}} cambial cells in neighboring lineages (rows) {{may not be}} parallel when viewed in their radial aspect. This lack of longitudinal parallelism may be so extensive that in active cambium pairs of cells from neighboring rows may be in contact only along restricted segments. This means that the initial cells, rather than farming a continuous layer, may be arranged in an irregular network pattern from which some parts project inward or outward from the layer of their mutual cantacts. The longitudinal nonparallelism of cambial cells becomes more pronounced during symplasitic radial growth. Unequal periclinal divisions counteract this, and in initial cells abscission of the parts projecting from the layer of mutual contact occurs. When the cambium passes from a period of activity to a Period of rest a continuous layer of initials is reestabhshed. This involves elongation by intrusive growth of those cells previously shortened {{as the result of}} irregular periclinal divisions. The division walls in cambial cells may be warped, that is they change their orientation along the longitudinal direction perhaps even similar to an aircraft propeller.

40|$|Cell division, {{which is}} {{critical}} to plant development and morphology, requires the orchestration of hundreds of intracellular processes. In the end, however, cells must make critical decisions, based on a discrete set of mechanical signals such as stress, strain, and shear, to divide {{in such a way}} that they will survive the mechanical loads generated by turgor pressure and cell enlargement within the growing tissues. Here we report on a method whereby tobacco protoplasts swirled into a 1. 5 % agarose entrapment medium will survive and divide. The application of a controlled mechanical load to agarose blocks containing protoplasts orients the primary division plane of the embedded cells. Photoelastic analysis of the agarose entrapment medium can identify the lines of principal stress within the agarose, confirming the hypothesis that cells divide either parallel or perpendicular to the principal stress tensors. The coincidence between the orientation of the new <b>division</b> <b>wall</b> and the orientation of the principal stress tensors suggests that the perception of mechanical stress is a characteristic of individual plant cells. The ability of a cell to determine a shear-free orientation for a new partition wall may be related to the applied load through the deformation of the matrix material. In an isotropic matrix a uniaxial load will produce a rotationally symmetric strain field, which will define a shear-free plane. Where high stress intensities combine with the loading geometry to produce multiaxial loads there will be no axis of rotational symmetry and hence no shear free plane. This suggests that two mechanisms may be orienting the division plane, one a mechanism that works in rotationally symmetrical fields, yielding divisions perpendicular to the compressive tensor, parallel to the long axis of the cell, and one in asymmetric fields, yielding divisions parallel to the short axis of the cell and the compressive tensor...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental research}} results of machineless energy separation effect with transversal ribs in supersonic channel. The energy separation effect assumes a physical {{division of the}} inlet flow into two or more flows, each having different stagnation temperature. Among well-known energy separation effects noted there are Ranque-Hilsch vortex tubes, Hartmann-Sprenger resonance tubes, pulsating tubes and some others. A working principle of device under study is based on thermal interaction between subsonic and supersonic gas flows through a heat-conducting <b>division</b> <b>wall.</b> This energy separation method was proposed by academician Leontiev and was patented in 1998. A number of references for PhD theses, articles, and conference proceedings devoted to the research of “Leontiev tube” have been mentioned in the paper. Efficiency factors for energy separation device performability have been analyzed in detail. The main attention {{was focused on the}} phenomenon of shock waves generation in supersonic channel of Leontiev tube. Experiment was carried out in the air prototype of energy separation device with supersonic flow Mach numbers 1. 9 and 2. 5, stagnation temperatures 40 °С and 70 °С, and for uni-flow and counter-flow air moving direction in subsonic and supersonic channels. Shock waves have been generated by means of circular ribs in supersonic channel of energy separation device. The research was carried out by means of infrared thermal imaging, thermocouples, total and static pressure probes, and modern National Insturments automation equipment. The work shows that shock waves have no negative influence on energy separation effect. A conclusion is made that unexpected shock wave generation in supersonic channel will not cause operability loss. It was gained that counter-flow regime is more efficient than uni-flow. Energy separation effect also appears to be higher with the rise of Mach number and flow initial stagnation temperature. The explanation of the results has been suggested and future research directions have been grounded. </p...|$|E

The main results we present are ap-proximation algorithms for a class-constrained version of the knapsack problem, that has applications in scheduling problems, and an experimental study of several well known approximation algorithms. The class-constrained version of the knapsack problem can be stated as follows: Given an integer K, a set of items S, each item with value, size and a class, find a subset of S of maximum total value such that items are grouped in compartments.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} {{stress on the}} root apical meristem (RAM) organization of Zea mays was investigated. In the experiment performed, root apices were grown through a narrowing of either circular (variant I) or elliptical (variant II) shape. This caused a mechanical impedance distributed circumferentially or from the opposite sides in variant I and II, respectively. The maximal force exerted by the growing root {{in response to the}} impedance reached the value of 0. 15 N for variant I and 0. 08 N for variant II. Significant morphological and anatomical changes were observed. The changes in morphology depended on the variant and concerned diminishing and/or deformation of the cross-section of the root apex, and buckling and swelling of the root. Anatomical changes, similar in both variants, concerned transformation of the meristem from closed to open, {{an increase in the number}} of the cell layers at the pole of the root proper, and atypical oblique divisions of the root cap cells. After leaving the narrowing, a return to both typical cellular organization and morphology of the apex was observed. The results are discussed in terms of three aspects: the morphological response, the RAM reorganization, and mechanical factors. Assuming that the orientation of <b>division</b> <b>walls</b> is affected by directional cues of a tensor nature, the changes mentioned may indicate that a pattern of such cues is modified when the root apex passes through the narrowing, but its primary mode is finally restored...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -dimensional {{model for}} the heat {{transfer}} in the furnace of a fluidized bed boiler is presented. The model, {{which is part of}} a comprehensive modeling work for large-scale CFB boilers, describes separately the convective and radiative heat transfer mechanisms at different heat extraction surfaces in the furnace (waterwalls, wing <b>walls</b> and <b>division</b> <b>walls).</b> The focus of the paper is on the heat transfer in the furnace, but the heat balance closure at a unit level including the return leg is also treated. Modeled data are compared to measurements from CFB boilers at two different scales: in the Chalmers 12 MWth research boiler and in a large scale boiler of about 300 MWth. Modeled and measured data generally show a good agreement. Since convective heat extraction depends strongly on the local properties of the solids flow, 3 D modeling of the convective heat transfer requires other expressions than those found in literature (which are typically. based on cross-sectional averaged solids concentration). In regions with low solids concentration (upper part of furnace), the radiative heat transfer is significantly influenced from regions several meters away from the heat extraction surface. Thus, in the description of the radiative heat transfer, optical factors accounting for the absorption in the gas-solids suspension are used. The model results reveal the importance of the exchange of radiative heat between the upflowing core and the downflowing wall layers. In addition, the importance of the fluid dynamics (wall layer flow properties, local solids flow properties such as the backflow effect and corner effects,) on the heat transfer is discussed with help of the model presented...|$|R
