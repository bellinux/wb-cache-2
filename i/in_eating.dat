Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> a golden wolf.

40|$|Butyrate, a short-chain {{fatty acid}} {{produced}} in the colon, induces cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in transformed cell lines. In this report, we {{study the effects of}} butyrate (BuA) on the growth of Ehrlich ascites tumor (<b>EAT)</b> cells <b>in</b> vivo. BuA, when injected intraperitoneally (i. p) into mice, inhibited proliferation of EAT cells. Further, induction of apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells was monitored by nuclear condensation, annexin-V staining, DNA fragmentation, and translocation of caspase-activated DNase into nucleus upon BuA-treatment. Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase- 3 inhibitor, completely inhibited BuA-induced apoptosis, indicating that activation of caspase- 3 mediates the apoptotic pathway <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. The proapoptotic effect of BuA also reflects on the antiangiogenic pathway <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. The antiangiogenic effect of BuA in vivo was demonstrated by the downregulation of the secretion of VEGF <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. CD 31 immunohistochemical staining of peritoneum sections clearly indicated a potential angioinhibitory effect of BuA <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. These results suggest that BuA, besides regulating other fundamental cellular processes, is able to modulate the expression/secretion of the key angiogenic growth factor VEGF <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells.

5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E
5|$|The Lānai hookbill is {{only known}} to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe. The type {{specimen}} was caught while feeding on the plant, and its berries were subsequently discovered in its stomach. It is considered likely that the hookbill additionally ate akoko fruits due to their similarity in size and shape to those of the ōpuhe. However, the hookbill's unique bill is considered unlikely to have evolved if the species was purely frugivorous, and {{it has been suggested that}} the hookbill specialized <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> snails. The species was very active while searching for food, constantly flying from tree to tree. While perched it shifted restlessly.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{expression}} of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in adipose tissue {{has been associated}} with inflammation, adipocyte hypertrophy, and impaired insulin signal. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a visceral fat surrounding the myocardium, is potentially involved in the onset/progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). To date, the role of RAGE <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> has not been explored much. We examined whether the RAGE expression <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> was associated with EAT adiposity and metabolic dysfunctions normally found <b>in</b> CAD patients. <b>EAT</b> samples were obtained from 33 patients undergoing open-heart surgery. EAT {{expression of}} RAGE, GLUT 4, adiponenctin, GLO 1, HMGB 1, TLR- 4, and MyD 88 was analyzed by microarray. EAT thickness was quantified by echocardiography. Anthropometric measures and clinical parameters were taken. BMI, HOMA-IR, and LAP indices were calculated. With increasing RAGE expression <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> we observed increases <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> thickness, reduced expression of GLUT 4, adiponectin, and GLO 1, and elevations of HMGB 1, TLR- 4, and MyD 88. There were significant correlations between RAGE and EAT thickness and between RAGE and the genes. LAP was higher in patients with increased RAGE expression. Our data suggest that in CAD patients RAGE may be involved <b>in</b> promoting <b>EAT</b> adiposity and metabolic dysfunction, such as impaired insulin signaling...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{apparent}} {{success of the}} cane toad <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the cane toad {{to be released in}} Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii and brought to Australia. After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E
5|$|Various feeding {{behaviours}} were proposed before {{more complete}} remains of Deinocheirus were known, {{and it was}} early on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal with giant arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz found that the hands of Deinocheirus were unsuited for grasping, but could instead {{have been used to}} tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky compared the forelimbs of Deinocheirus to sloths, leading him to hypothesise that Deinocheirus was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would have been good defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the ecological niches for Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that Deinocheirus had the largest vertical feeding range due to its hip height, and specialised <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> high foliage.|$|E

5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{biological}} {{functions of}} epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) remain largely unknown. However, {{the proximity of}} EAT to the coronary arteries suggests {{a role in the}} pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The objectives of this study were to identify genes differentially regulated among three adipose tissues, namely EAT, mediastinal (MAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) and to study their possible relationships with the development of cardiovascular diseases. Methods and Results: Samples were collected from subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries. Gene expression was evaluated in the three adipose depots of six men using the IlluminaH HumanWG- 6 v 3. 0 expression BeadChips. Twenty-three and 73 genes were differentially up-regulated <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> compared to MAT and SAT, respectively. Ninety-four genes were down-regulated <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> compared to SAT.

40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD), epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) expression of inflammatory genes is high while expression of anti-inflammatory genes is low. We hypothesized that expression of certain genes <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> would correlate directly with the degree of adjacent CAD. Methods: EAT and paired subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples were collected from cardiac surgery patients (n= 9) with and without CAD. RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix 1. 0 ST chips. Genes differentially expressed <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> vs. SAT were identified. Probe intensities were correlated with the severity of CAD in each patient using the Gensini score. Results: 35 genes were differentially expressed <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> at 3 ̆e 3. 0 fold change (p Conclusions: Expression of ITGB 8 is directly correlated with CAD severity. ITGB 8 has been previously shown to be expressed by fibroblasts and functions to activate TGFβ. TGFβ signaling has also been correlated with advanced atherosclerosis.

40|$|The {{superoxide}} anion generation in Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) cells {{increased more than}} two-fold {{in the presence of}} the tumour promoter, tetradecanoyl phorbol myristate acetate (TPA). Epinephrine and dibutryl cAMP (Bt 2 cAMP) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, both basal and TPA-triggered superoxide generation <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. The kinetics of inhibition of superoxide generation showed a maximum inhibition between 30 and 40 min of preincubation with epinephrine or Bt 2 cAMP of EAT cells and coincided with an increase in activity of a phosphoprotein phosphatase. <b>In</b> TPA-treated <b>EAT</b> cells, epinephrine or Bt 2 cAMP increased the phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro EGTA, EDTA and sodium fluoride inhibited phosphatase activity. Superoxide generation in response to TPA <b>in</b> Triton-permeabilized <b>EAT</b> cells was inhibited by inclusion of the phosphatase in the assay. Taken together, these results clearly suggest that the phosphatase activity <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells develops as a result of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) -mediated phosphorylation of the phosphatase which then mediates dephosphorylation of the PKC-triggered phosphorylation of proteins to inhibit respiratory burst.
