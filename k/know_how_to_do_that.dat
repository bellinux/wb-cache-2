2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... {{he taught me how}} to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Autechre use many {{different}} digital synths {{and a few}} analog synths in their production, as well as analog and digital drum machines, mixers, effects units and samplers. They have also made extensive use {{of a variety of}} computer based sequencers, software synthesisers, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesized sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customized by the band themselves. Autechre have also experimented in depth with development environments such as Max/MSP, and Kyma, amongst others, from 1997 onwards. From 2005 until 2009, they have used the Elektron Machinedrum and Monomachine, alongside Akai MPC and Nord Modular in their live performances. It has also been rumoured that Autechre have used military equipment in their work. In 2008, Sean Booth reported that if he were locked in a cell for a year with only one piece of software and one piece of hardware, he'd [...] "probably take a copy of Digital Performer and an AKG C 1000 microphone." [...] Other machines that Autechre have repeatedly mentioned in interviews are appreciated for their interface and aesthetics as much as their sound, including the Roland TR-606 and MC-202, and the Nord Lead. According to the 2016 interview to Resident Advisor, both members haven't bought a piece of equipment [...] "in the last 5 years", making MAX/MSP a primary production method, with Sean Booth stating that [...] "in Max I can generally build the thing I need, and if I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> it'll generally be worthwhile learning." ...|$|E

60|$|The Catechism, in short, {{takes for}} granted that the child knows his duty; but it takes for granted also {{that he does not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> duty. It takes for granted, that in every child there is as St. Paul says, 'a law in his members warring against the law of his mind, and {{bringing}} him into captivity to the law of sin' (literally, of short coming, or missing the mark) 'which is in his members.' Now man's natural inclination is to suppose that good thoughts are part of himself, and therefore that a good will to put them in practice is in his own power. I blame no one for making that mistake: but I warn them, {{in the name of the}} Bible and of the Catechism, that it is a mistake, and one which every man, woman, and child will surely discover to be a mistake, if they try to act on it. Good thoughts are not our own; they are Jesus Christ's; they come from Him, The Life and The Light of men; they are His voice speaking to our hearts, informing us of His laws, showing us what is good. And good desires are not our own: they come from the Holy Spirit of God, who strives with men, and labours to lift their hearts up from selfishness to love; from what is low and foul, to what is noble and pure; from what is sinful and contrary to God's will, to what is right and according to God's will.|$|E

I never thought I would do it again, but I decided to open up that room and see what I could find. It's been interesting. Some of it sounds familiar, some of it sounds contemporary, some of it you can't put a label on—and I've never been big on labels anyway." [...] Perry is reluctant however to put a timescale on his return. [...] "I'll be honest, I don't really <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but I can definitely smell a solo project on the horizon. I will be recording some music." ...|$|E

5000|$|Key to the band's {{new sound}} on the album is Iommi's {{distinctive}} playing style that he developed after an accident at a sheet metal factory where he {{was working at the}} age of 17 in which the tips of the middle fingers of his fretting hand were severed. Iommi created a pair of false fingertips using plastic from a dish detergent bottle and detuned the strings on his guitar {{to make it easier for}} him to bend the strings, creating a massive, heavy sound. [...] "I'd play a load of chords and I'd have to play fifths because I couldn't play fourths because of my fingers," [...] Iommi explained to Phil Alexander in Mojo in 2013. [...] "That helped me develop my style of playing, bending the strings and hitting the open string at the same time just to make the sound wilder." [...] In the same article bassist Geezer Butler added, [...] "Back then the bass player was supposed to do all these melodic runs, but I didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> because I'd been a guitarist, so all I did was follow Tony's riff. That made the sound heavier." ...|$|E
