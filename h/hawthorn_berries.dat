25|$|Nova Meadow is damp area {{containing}} moisture loving plants including lady's smock, common tussock grass, meadowsweet, {{ragged robin}} and yellow flag iris. A pond {{was created in}} 2003 to attract wildlife and {{the southern part of}} the meadow has reverted to scrubland creating a habitat for yellowhammers and linnets. In autumn it attracts thrushes, fieldfares and redwings which feed on the <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of jars from the neolithic village Jiahu in the Henan province of northern China revealed traces of alcohol that were absorbed and preserved. According {{to a study}} published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical {{analysis of}} the residue confirmed that a fermented drink made of grapes, <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berries,</b> honey, and rice was being produced in 7000–6650 BC. The results of this analysis were published in December 2004. This is approximately the time when barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East.|$|E
60|$|The amateur nature-lover passes off the down, {{and towards}} Banstead village. He {{is on the}} watch for {{characteristic}} objects of the countryside, and rustling through the leaves beneath a chestnut avenue he comes upon an old boot. It is a very, very old boot, all its blacking washed off by the rain, and two spreading chestnut leaves, yellow they are with blotches of green, with their broad fingers extended, rest upon it, as if they would protect and altogether cover the poor old boot in its last resting-place. It is as if Mother Nature, who lost sight of her product at the tanner's yard, meant to claim her own trampled child again at last, after all its wanderings. So we go on, noting a sardine tin gleaming brightly in the amber sunlight, through a hazel hedge, and presently another old boot. Some <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berries,</b> some hoary clematis we notice--and then another old boot. Altogether, it may be remarked, in this walk the amateur nature-lover saw eleven old boots, most of them dropped in the very sweetest bits of hedge tangle and grassy corner about Banstead.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{close this}} chapter with shorter or better {{advice to the}} reader, than merely, {{whenever}} he hears discussions about {{the relative merits of}} great masters, to remember the young lady's question. It is, indeed, true that there is a relative merit, that a peach is nobler than a <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berry,</b> and still more a <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berry</b> than a bead of the nightshade; but in each rank of fruits, as in each rank of masters, one is endowed with one virtue, and another with another; their glory is their dissimilarity, and they who propose to themselves in the training of an artist that he should unite the coloring of Tintoret, the finish of Albert Durer, and the tenderness of Correggio, are no wiser than a horticulturist would be, who made it the object of his labor to produce a fruit which should unite in itself the lusciousness of the grape, the crispness of the nut, and the fragrance of the pine.|$|R
40|$|Enteric {{pathogens}} play {{a prominent}} role for causing health problems {{in most of the}} developing countries. These pathogens cause disease symptoms ranging from mild gastroenteritis to life threatening systemic infections and dehydrating diarrhea. Diarrhea genic organisms (E. coli, S. typhi,S. boydii,V. cholerae) are the most common bacterial pathogens implicated in diarrhea worldwide. To combat the spreading dreadful disease several researches have been done in plant extracts to prove its efficiency to treat diarrhea. My work is aimed to focus on the antibacterial activity of <b>Hawthorn</b> <b>berry</b> ethanolic extract (HBEE) against these enteric pathogens responsible for causing diarrhea. Macrobroth dilution method is employed in this study to find out Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Results concluded that HBEE showed significant antibacterial activity against enteric bacterial pathogens tested at different concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{dentistry}} was not {{a specialized}} branch of Ayurveda, it is included in its Shalakya Tantra (system of surgery). Problems such as deformities of the oral cavity, plaques and infections were managed in ancient India. Traditional medicine can treat various infectious and chronic conditions. Research has shown that all kinds of chewing sticks described in ancient Ayurveda texts have medicinal and anti-cariogenic properties. Its oil pulling (Kaval, Gandush) practice is claimed to cure about 30 systemic diseases. Amla (Emblic myrobalan), is a general rebuilder of oral health. Bilberry fruit (Vaccinium myrtillus) and <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berry</b> (Crateagus oxycanthus) stabilize collagen, strengthening the gum tissue. Liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabral) promotes anti-cavity action, reduces plaque, and has an antibacterial effect. Use of safe, quality products and practices should be ensured based on available evidence if traditional medicine is to be acknowledged as part of primary health care. Scientific validations of the Ayurveda dental health practices could justify their incorporation into modern dental care. Publicity of these techniques using appropriate media would benefit the general population by giving more confidence in the ancient practices, thus preventing tooth decay and loss...|$|R
60|$|Next to your paling, comes your low stone dyke, your {{mountain}} fence, indicative at {{a glance}} either of wild hill country, or of beds of stone beneath the soil; the hedge of the mountains--delightful in all its associations, and yet more in the varied and craggy forms of the loose stones it is built of; and next to the low stone wall, your lowland hedge, either in trim line of massive green, suggested of the pleasances of old Elizabethan houses, and smooth alleys for aged feet, and quaint labyrinths for young ones, or else in fair entanglement of eglantine and virgin's bower, tossing its scented luxuriance along our country waysides;--how many such you have here among your pretty hills, fruitful with black clusters of the bramble for boys in autumn, and crimson <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berries</b> for birds in winter. And then last, and most difficult to class among fences, comes your handrail, expressive {{of all sorts of}} things; sometimes having a knowing and vicious look, which it learns at race-courses; sometimes an innocent and tender look, which it learns at rustic bridges over cressy brooks; and sometimes a prudent and protective look, which it learns on passes of the Alps, where it has posts of granite and bars of pine, and guards the brows of cliffs and the banks of torrents. So that in all these kinds of defence there is some good, pleasant, or noble meaning. But what meaning has the iron railing? Either, observe, that you are living in the midst of such bad characters that you must keep them out by main force of bar, or that you are yourself of a character requiring to be kept inside in the same manner. Your iron railing always means thieves outside, or Bedlam inside; it can mean nothing else than that. If the people outside were good for anything, a hint in the way of fence would be enough for them; but because they are violent and at enmity with you, you are forced to put the close bars and the spikes at the top.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the inhibitory effect of teas on key enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) linked with type- 2 diabetes and their antioxidant properties. Four samples of three brands were used; infusions of green tea (GT), 2 brands of black tea (BT), and a formulated herbal preparation for diabetes (ADT) (white tea, Radix Puerariae, Radix ophiopogonis, <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berry,</b> Chinese yam, and fragrant Solomon seal rhizome) were prepared and subsequently analyzed for their total phenol, ascorbic acid contents, antioxidant properties (2, 2 -Azizobis (3 -Ethylbenzo-Thiazoline~ 6 -sulfonate) “ABTS” scavenging ability and ferric reducing antioxidant property), and inhibition of pancreatic-α-amylase and intestinal-α-glucosidase in vitro. The study revealed that GT had the highest total phenol content, ascorbic acid content, ABTS* scavenging ability, and ferric reducing ability. Furthermore, all the teas inhibited Fe 2 + and sodium nitroprusside induced lipid peroxidation in pancreas, with GT having the highest inhibitory effect. Conversely, {{there was no significant}} difference (P> 0. 05) in the inhibitory effects of the teas on α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The antidiabetic property of the teas could be attributed to their inhibitory effect on carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes implicated in diabetes and their antioxidant activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} <b>Hawthorn</b> leaves, <b>berries</b> and flowers {{have been used}} in Asia to treat {{hypertension}} (high blood pressure) and other cardiovascular diseases. It is hypothesized that the Hawthorn extract acts as a vasodilator increasing the size of the lumen of blood vessels by relaxing the smooth muscle. This occurs by decreasing the amount of calcium that is present in the cytosol by either increasing the effectiveness of the Ca 2 + -ATPase pump or by altering the Na+ -Ca 2 + antiport exchanger. With this decrease in cytosolic calcium the calcium unbinds from CaM causing the enzyme myosin phosphatase to remove phosphate from the myosin thus causing the smooth muscle to relax. The commercially available Hawthorn extract used in these studies did not {{have a significant effect on}} coronary or pulmonary arteries. The denuded and intact LADs did have a significant relaxation at higher concentrations which was likely due to the ethanol that was used in the formulation of the extract...|$|R
50|$|Cyanidin is {{a natural}} organic compound. It is a {{particular}} type of anthocyanidin (glycoside version called anthocyanins). It is a pigment found in many red berries including grapes, bilberry, blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cranberry, elderberry, <b>hawthorn,</b> loganberry, açai <b>berry</b> and raspberry. It can also be found in other fruits such as apples and plums, and in red cabbage and red onion. It has a characteristic reddish-purple color, though this can change with pH; solutions of the compound are red at pH < 3, violet at pH 7-8, and blue at pH > 11. In certain fruits, the highest concentrations of cyanidin are found in the seeds and skin.|$|R

5000|$|When John Edgerley sailed for England in 1842 he {{had taken}} back a {{collection}} of New Zealand plants for Kew Gardens. In return the director of Kew, Sir William Hooker, undertook to provide him {{with a wide range}} of flowering shrubs (six casefuls) for setting up his nursery on this land in Epsom. Edgerley requested the following plants: “Rhododendrons, camellias, arbutus or strawberry tree, laurustine, Portugal laurel, common laurel, azaleas, a plant or two of lilac, wisteria sinensis, tree paeonia, with a few plants of fuchsias - corymbiflora if you can spare it, ribes sanguinea, magonlia grandiflora, deutzia scabra, box for hedging, with a few good roses, white moss if you can spare it, ajuga japonica, cedar of Lebanon, jasminum…acorns, chestnuts, <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berries</b> or any other seed you thought would germinate, also a small collection of good flower seeds with fir cones” [...] Although roses, flowering seeds and annuals had been imported by early missionaries, their planting concentrated on practical plants such as fruit trees, shelter trees and crops. Certainly this was the first importation of rhododendrums, camellias, azaleas, lilac and wisteria into New Zealand [...] He married Sarah Newnham at Upper Arley on 27, December, 1842 and they travelled on the Tyne arriving at Hobart August 1843 then coming on to Auckland. It was possible that he leased some land immediately in the Epsom/Newmarket area as in the police census of 1844, he was living in a raupo hut in that location. John Edgerley brought a collection of items out with him including a set of blasting tools, candle snuffers, a tinder box and a humane man trap, these items are now in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E

40|$|Relationship between total mercury {{as well as}} cadmium {{contents}} and total anthocyanins content in wild forest fruit berries collected in environemtally burden region of Stredny Spis in the Slovakia was investigated in this study. From the sampling points of different localities of this region small berries were sampled: blackberries (6 localities), blackthorns (5 localities), rosehips (6 localities), hawthorn fruits. Metal determinations were performed in a Varian AA 240 Z (Varian, Australia) atomic absorption spectrometer with Zeeman background correction. Total anthocyanin content (TA) in fruits was determined spectrophotometrically using the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS – 1240, Japan). With exception of three samples in all other fruit samples the hygienic limit for Cd (30 μg/kg) given for foodstuffs by Slovak Republic Food Codex was exceeded. Only in one fruit sample the determined Hg content was higher than hygienic limit (30 μg/kg). Total anthocyanin content expressed as mg cyanidin equivalents/kg of fresh matter (mg CE/kg FM) was in range 370 – 830 in blackberries (Rubus Fruticosus), 2500 – 3000 in rosehips (Rosa rubiginosa), 213 in raspberries (Prunus spinosa) and 317 mg CE/kg FM in <b>hawthorn</b> <b>berries</b> (Crataegus laevigata). The strong statistical dependences between investigated parameters: Hg – TA in blackthorns,, Cd – TA in raspberries, Hg – TA in raspberries, Cd – TA in hawthorn and Hg – TA in hawthorn were confirmed based on the values of correlation coefficients (R= 0. 6958, R= 0. 9633, R= 0. 9163, R= 0. 8587 and R= 0. 8938, respectively) ...|$|E
