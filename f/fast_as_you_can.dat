500|$|After landing, {{some of the}} 9th and 10th Battalion's men {{headed for}} 400 Plateau. The first 10th Battalion platoon to arrive was {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Noel Loutit, and accompanied by the Brigade-Major, Charles Brand. They discovered the Turkish battery in the Lone Pine sector, which was preparing to move. As the Australians opened fire the battery withdrew down Owen's Gully. Brand remained on the plateau and ordered Loutit to continue after the Turkish battery. However, the guns had been hidden {{at the head of}} the gully and Loutit's platoon moved beyond them. Around the same time, Lieutenant Eric Smith and his 10th Battalion scouts and Lieutenant G. Thomas with his platoon from the 9th Battalion arrived on the plateau, looking for the guns. As they crossed the plateau Turkish machine-guns opened fire on them from the Lone Pine area. One of Thomas's sections located the battery, which had started firing from the gully. They opened fire, charged the gun crews, and captured the guns. The Turks did manage to remove the breech blocks, making the guns inoperable, so the Australians damaged the sights and internal screw mechanisms to put them out of action. By now the majority of the 9th and 10th Battalions, along with brigade commander Maclagen, had arrived on the plateau, and he ordered them to dig in on the plateau instead of advancing to Gun Ridge. Unfortunately the units that had already passed beyond there were obeying their orders to [...] "go as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> at all costs keep going".|$|E
2500|$|Townshend played {{keyboards}} {{on several}} Who songs. On Who's Next, {{he began to}} work with analogue synthesizers, using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He {{had this to say}} about the instrument: [...] "I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren't in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you're stuck with as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> play and I don't play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional naval {{doctrine}} envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This {{view was}} challenged when army airman General Billy Mitchell demonstrated {{the capability of}} aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not {{been shown to be}} as lethal. The adage [...] "Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power" [...] was well known. Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power. Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at Admiral Husband Kimmel's hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to [...] "get to the other fellow with everything you have as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and to dump it on him." [...] Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.|$|E
