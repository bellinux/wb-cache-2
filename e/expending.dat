5|$|On 23 September, {{the first}} bombing {{formation}} attacked, <b>expending</b> {{large amounts of}} munitions on the retreating columns on the Es Salt to Amman road, returning about 07:00 when a rout resulted. Amman was attacked from the air {{during the day and}} retreating columns from Amman and another column moving from Es Salt to Amman were attacked. An Australian aircraft saw columns retreating from Deraa and Samakh, where trains appeared ready to leave for Damascus. By the afternoon of 24 September, virtually all the area west of Amman was clear of Ottoman soldiers but on 25 September a column moving from Amman was seen at Mafrak. The column was attacked between 6:00 and 08:00 by ten Australian aircraft, with attacks continuing throughout the day <b>expending</b> four tons of bombs and almost 20,000 machine gun rounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} autumn of 1808, the French Navy {{despatched}} four large frigates to the East Indies. These ships, stationed on Île de France and Île Bonaparte, {{were ordered to}} attack and disrupt British trade routes from the Far East, in particular British India. This disruption was intended to have a negative financial effect on the British economy and force the Royal Navy to send ships into the Indian Ocean, <b>expending</b> valuable resources in doing so. The commander of this French force was Commodore Jacques Hamelin, a highly skilled officer who ordered his frigates to disperse in the Bay of Bengal to hunt British East Indiamen, large and well armed merchant ships that carried millions of pounds worth of goods between Britain and her Empire ever year.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by <b>expending</b> metabolic energy.|$|E
25|$|Type A program – a Type A {{program is}} any federal program within a {{recipient}} which <b>expends</b> either: (1) $750,000 {{or more of}} federal assistance for recipients with $10 million or less of <b>expended</b> federal assistance during the audit period, or (2) 3% of the total federal assistance <b>expended</b> during the year for those who exceed $10 million, whichever is greater. In other words, if a recipient <b>expended</b> a total of $10 million or less in federal assistance, then any single program which <b>expended</b> $300,000 or more is considered a Type A. If a recipient <b>expended</b> more than $10 million in federal assistance, then any single program which <b>expended</b> 3% of that amount is considered a Type A program.|$|R

5|$|This {{efficient}} long-distance travelling {{underlies the}} albatross's {{success as a}} long-distance forager, covering great distances and <b>expending</b> little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced {{to rest on the}} ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding. When taking off, albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift.|$|E
5|$|Chinese troops counterattacked {{in force}} at 23:00, with two battalions of {{infantry}} supported by snipers and mortar fire. Aided by 7th Division artillery fire, the Rangers held the hill against Chinese resistance. The Rangers repulsed four successive Chinese assaults {{by one of}} the battalions, <b>expending</b> all of their grenades by 02:00 on 18 May, and running short on ammunition by 03:00. At that point, the second Chinese battalion commenced its assault, surprising the Rangers and driving them from the peak of Hill 581. Queen counterattacked and retook the hill by 05:00. At 06:45, the Chinese gave up the attack, having been severely mauled. In the unsuccessful attempt to take Hill 581, Chinese losses amounted to at least 120 killed and several hundred injured. The Rangers, having relied on tight interlocking crossfire and well dug-in positions, suffered only 10 wounded in the battle. Commanders in the 7th Infantry Division were stunned by the 2nd Ranger Company's effectiveness in the fight, {{and as a result of}} the action, the company came to be considered a model unit.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the German Army was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen {{was supposed to have}} been captured on the first day of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was <b>expending</b> irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive were in the midst of destroying the German Army Group Centre. In France, the German Army had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of the German Army, including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Battalion, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Colonel Donald Butterworth, was sent to France shortly after the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939 as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade (alongside the 1st Loyal Regiment and 1st Gordon Highlanders), 1st Infantry Division and was part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and was involved in the battles of France and Belgium before eventually being evacuated from Dunkirk on 1 June 1940. Following that, the 2nd Battalion spent years on home defence in the United Kingdom preparing for a possible German invasion of England which never arrived. The battalion remained in the United Kingdom until 1943 when, still as part of 1st Infantry Division, it sailed to North Africa and took part in the campaign in Tunisia, British First Army. The battalion did not participate in the invasion of Sicily or the initial invasion of Italy but was one of the lead units in the Anzio landings in January 1944, under command of US Fifth Army, where they suffered extremely heavy casualties. On 7 February the battalion suffered 323 casualties attempting to capture Buonriposo Ridge which they captured but were forced to surrender the ridge after <b>expending</b> their ammunition. By May, following Operation Diadem, the battalion had absorbed eight drafts of replacements. Now fighting as part of the British Eighth Army, the 2nd Battalion continued to serve in Italy, fighting around the Gothic Line, until January 1945 when the battalion and the rest of 1st Infantry Division were transferred to Palestine.|$|E

40|$|At present, most {{aggregation}} routing algorithms for WSNs {{assume that}} aggregation <b>expends</b> are so little {{as to be}} neglected. But with the growing demand for the collection of multimedia data, the aggregation <b>expends</b> are much larger and can’t be neglect. In view of this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive aggregation routing algorithm with the minimal energy consumption (RMEAAT). Firstly, it constructs an -balancing spanning tree {{on the basis of}} SPT and MST as the initial communication path. And then it defines the aggregation benefit with consideration of aggregation <b>expend</b> and transmission <b>expend,</b> and data are adaptively judged whether to aggregate at every node of -balancing spanning tree according to aggregation benefit in the process of transmission. Correspondingly, the initial transmission path is gradually improved in terms of the aggregation judgment. The simulation results show that RMEAAT algorithm has better performance in WSNs with different aggregation <b>expends</b> and fusion degrees. </p...|$|R

25|$|Soaring: gliding in rising or {{otherwise}} moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air {{is due to}} thermals, ridge lift or other meteorological features. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without <b>expending</b> energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward section}} of the {{fuselage}} was divided into three levels. The top deck housed the pilots and wireless station, the middle the engine compartment and the lower the bombardiers, fuel tanks and payload. It has to be noted that this configuration {{would have made the}} aircraft top heavy when, after <b>expending</b> its fuel and weapon payload, it eventually landed.|$|E
25|$|Sandhill cranes' large wingspans, {{typically}} , {{make them}} very skilled soaring birds, similar in style to hawks and eagles. Using thermals to obtain lift, {{they can stay}} aloft for many hours, requiring only occasional flapping of their wings and consequently <b>expending</b> little energy. Migratory flocks contain hundreds of birds, and can create clear outlines of the normally invisible rising columns of air (thermals) they ride.|$|E

25|$|Bathypelagic {{fish have}} special adaptations {{to cope with}} these {{conditions}} – they have slow metabolisms and unspecialized diets, being willing to eat anything that comes along. They prefer to sit and wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it. The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish. Mesopelagic are often highly mobile, whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait predators, normally <b>expending</b> little energy in movement.|$|E
25|$|They can {{be divided}} into flabby or robust body types. Flabby benthopelagic fishes are like bathopelagic fishes, they have a reduced body mass, and low {{metabolic}} rates, <b>expending</b> minimal energy as they lie and wait to ambush prey. An example of a flabby fish is the cusk-eel Acanthonus armatus, a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90% water. This fish has the largest ears (otoliths) and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates.|$|E
