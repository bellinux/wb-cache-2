500|$|That storyline came at {{the behest}} of {{editor-in-chief}} Joe Quesada, who said, [...] "Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man". It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer J. Michael Straczynski, who [...] "told Joe that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> name off the last two issues of the [...] arc" [...] but was talked out of doing so. At issue with Straczynski's climax to the arc, Quesada said, was ...|$|E
500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... {{there was a point}} where I made the decision, and told Joe, that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and I have a lot of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Antuofermo {{lost his}} title later to British boxer Alan Minter, who gave Hagler his second title shot. Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter. The tense {{atmosphere}} was stoked further when Minter {{was quoted as}} saying that [...] "No black man is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> title"—Minter would later insist he meant [...] "that black man". Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut prone Minter. The referee halted the contest after 3 rounds. At the conclusion of this bout a riot broke out and Hagler and his trainers had to be carried away to their locker rooms by the police, {{in the middle of a}} rain of beer bottles and glasses. [...] After 7 years and 50 fights, Hagler was World Middleweight Champion.|$|E

2500|$|On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report {{reported}} that Oprah staffers were [...] "sharply {{divided on the}} merits of booking Sarah Palin". Drudge said that he obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets saying, [...] "The item in today’s Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this presidential campaign when I decided that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates." [...] Oprah Winfrey's public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on Larry King Live in 2007. Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{returned}} to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is {{having an affair with}} his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky's remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to Comcast: [...] "I truly believe that [...] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much as everybody else. It's hard for her to articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she's very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That's kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life." [...] When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website Zap2it described that Lucky: [...] "generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson's trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin' hearts off-kilter." [...] Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: [...] "Jonathan actually seemed like one more step and he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he was yelling at me like he did." [...] Jones from Zap2it stated that in the confrontation scenes: [...] "Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young's and most recently, Greg Vaughan's. Now Lucky seems like a whole person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties." [...] Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky's position: ...|$|E
