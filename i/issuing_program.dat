50|$|With funds {{allocated}} {{under the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the U.S. Department of Education dramatically increased the funds provided to SEAs under section 1003(g) while <b>issuing</b> <b>program</b> requirements that charged the SEAs with channeling {{the funds to}} LEAs for the “persistently lowest-achieving schools” to support rapid improvement through four relatively prescriptive intervention models: • The turnaround model in which the LEA replaces the principal and rehires no more than 50% of the staff, gives the principal greater autonomy, and implements other prescribed and recommended strategies. • The “restart model” in which the LEA converts or closes and reopens a school under a charter school operator, charter management organization, or education management organization. • The “school closure model” in which the LEA closes the school and enrolls the students in other schools in the LEA that are higher achieving. • The “transformation model” in which the LEA replaces the principal (except in specified situations), implements a rigorous staff evaluation and development system, institutes comprehensive instructional reform, increases learning time and applies community-oriented school strategies, and provides greater operational flexibility {{and support for the}} school.|$|E
50|$|A postal {{system was}} created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the {{off-road}} routes, would {{come under the}} control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration. Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924-2006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp <b>issuing</b> <b>program.</b> He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the Bhutan Stamp Agency in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.|$|E

40|$|The {{recent report}} {{produced}} by Vice President Gore's committee on government efficiency {{highlights the importance}} of streamlining government operations. But often there are trade-offs between administrative streamlining and accomplishing substantive program objectives. This article examines these tradeoffs {{in the context of the}} Food Stamp Program, an important component of the United States' safety net for providing low-income assistance. We estimate impacts on both administrative costs and substantive outcomes (participant food expenditures) resulting from <b>issuing</b> <b>program</b> benefits in the form of checks rather than the usual food coupons. The findings, which are based on experimental tests of the cashout approach in parts of Alabama and California, suggest that significant cost savings can be attained through cashout but that these savings may be achieved at the cost of weakening the program's ability to achieve its substantive objective of encouraging food use. ...|$|E
