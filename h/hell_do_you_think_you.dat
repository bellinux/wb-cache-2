5000|$|In 1952, Iowa {{football}} {{had only}} had three winning {{seasons in the}} previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press International story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?" [...] Evashevski snapped, [...] "Why in the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I took the job?" [...] Afterwards, a photographer noted, [...] "I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football." ...|$|R

Slavkos later comment was also published in the book: [...] "Evidently she thought shed done me a great favour by allowing me to live a normal life and publish newspapers all those years".

Calvert noticed that friendly forces nearby were drawing heavier fire. In fact, elements of the South Staffordshire Regiment had dug in adjacent to a Japanese unit. Neither force {{was aware of the}} other. Deciding that {{something had to be done}}, he elected to make a frontal assault: [...] "I saw something had to be done pretty quickly, so I shouted to Freddie that we were going to charge. I then told everyone that we were going to charge the Pagoda Hill. There were reinforcements on our left flank who would charge as well. So, standing up, I shouted out 'Charge' in the approved Victorian manner, and ran down the hill…Half of the South Staffords joined in. Then looking back I found a lot had not. So I told them to bloody well 'Charge, what the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're doing.' So they charged. Machine-gunners, mortar teams, all officers — everybody who was on that hill" ...|$|R

Gavin recalls, [...] "It really put things into perspective for me because I never felt the Faction was anything special. But the EMP thing was a sign of respect and recognition of our contribution to the scene." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tomas Mureika of All Music said [...] "An astonishingly mature album by any artist's rights, The Whiff of Bedlam delves into {{territory}} {{many would}} never even dare to approach, {{all the while}} remaining cloaked {{in some of the}} most gorgeous melodies Reyne has ever crafted. The opening [...] "Who The <b>Hell</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>You</b> Are?" [...] sets the agenda - from a wispy electric piano intro, Reyne launches into an enigmatically vicious attack against someone, yet does so simply through the dynamics of his voice, avoiding the high-pitched intensity that earmarked his earlier works. From then on, there are twelve achingly soulful confessionals through which Reyne seems constantly on the verge of tears.. The devastating [...] "It's Only Natural" [...] moves from an organ intro through [...] hook after hook, as Reyne seems to resign himself to his new discoveries as he has aged, only to immediately counter the downfall with the more upbeat melancholy of [...] "Winds Of Change". With the harrowing possibilities unleashed by The Whiff of Bedlam, it is certain to say that Reyne has found his own day in the sun... and it keeps getting gloriously darker.".|$|E
5000|$|Among fellow comic creators, Kanigher was as {{well known}} for his {{unstable}} personality and violent temper as he was for his brilliance as a writer, and collaborators such as Gene Colan and John Romita Sr. have commented on the difficulty of working with him. Romita recounted: I worked on a series with Kanigher - he wrote two series {{for me in the}} romance dept. One about an airline stewardess, and one about a nurse. He used to compliment me whenever he'd see me in the bullpen. [...] "Like the stuff... like the stuff..." [...] That was about the amount of conversation we had. Then one day we were in the elevator together, and he said, [...] "Like the stuff." [...] I, like an innocent fool... I used to do some adjustments to his pages. If he had a heavy-copy panel, I might take a balloon from one panel {{and put it in the}} next. Just because I was distributing space. I was so stupid and naive, I said to him, [...] "It doesn't bother you, does it, that I sometimes switch some of the panels around and move some of the balloons from one panel to another?" [...] He started to chew me out in the elevator! [...] "Who the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are, changing my stuff? Where do you come off changing my stuff?

5000|$|Worlfwood's {{middle name}} is never stated, but Nightow has given varying answers in {{interviews}} when {{asked the question}} by fans, such as [...] "Dangerous" [...] and [...] "Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora", Yakuza slang which translates to [...] "What the <b>hell</b> family <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!" [...] After Wolfwood showed potential in the orphanage {{in which he is}} raised, Chapel (also known as Master C) took him into the Eye of Michael, an organization of assassins founded by a plant worshipper, and trained and modified Wolfwood to be a killer. The modifications gave him enhanced abilities and the ability to regenerate from heavy injuries using special vials, but as a result caused him to age at an accelerated rate, giving him the appearance of being middle-aged though he is only in his late teens by the start of the series.His potential was recognized as exceptional, and so he was given the tenth incarnation of the organization's most powerful, a special large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which becomes his official title within the Eye of Michael. Wolfwood later betrayed and shot Chapel, impersonating Chapel to gain entry into the Gung-Ho-Guns in an attempt to kill Millions Knives. He failed, and was instead sent by Knives to guide and protect Vash on the latter's travels to Knives's base, thus killing fellow Guns Rai-Dei the Blade and Gray the Ninelives. After Vash is taken prisoner in the Ark, Wolfwood rescues him and later departs to December to protect the orphanage from the retaliation. He battles his childhood friend, Livio, and his crippled master in a two volume face off. He manages to mortally wound Chapel and defeat Livio The Double Fang and Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death, but having overdosed on the regenerative vials, he soon dies while having a last drink with Vash.|$|R
