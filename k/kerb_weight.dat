25|$|The {{second most}} {{powerful}} production car ever featured on Top Gear, the 1001 PS (987bhp; 736kW) Bugatti Veyron, was taken {{around the track}} by The Stig in Series 12, Episode 4, after 3 years of waiting. However, it disappointed the team by only managing fifth place on the Power Board (currently 16th), an unexpectedly low position ultimately attributed to the car's <b>kerb</b> <b>weight</b> of , {{more than any of}} the four faster cars. In Series 15 Episode 5 however, the Stig took the 1,200 PS Super Sport version around the track in 1:16.8, thus setting a new lap record.|$|E
500|$|The Girling-manufactured brakes used [...] discs at {{the front}} and [...] drums at the rear. The {{suspension}} was independent {{at the front}}, using coil springs, and at the rear had a live axle and semi-elliptic springs. Apart from {{the addition of a}} Panhard rod to better locate the rear axle, and stiffer front springs to cope with the weight of the V8 engine, the Tiger's suspension and braking systems are identical to that of the standard Alpine. The fitting points for the Panhard rod interfered with the upright spare wheel in the boot, which was repositioned to lie horizontally beneath a false floor; the battery was moved from beneath the rear seat to the boot at the same time.

50|$|The {{contemporary}} Finnish legislation {{allowed a}} total weight of 16 tonnes for the two-axle M-161. The three-axle M-162 and M-163 {{were allowed to}} load up to 22 tonnes and the four-axle M-168 total 28 tonnes. The <b>kerb</b> <b>weights</b> of the vehicles varied according to the engine, cabin and superstructures, and therefore, the payloads varied as well.|$|R
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{are seen}} as a key future trend in the automotive industry. These vehicles rely on rechargeable batteries to store energy on board. The optimum size of this energy store, {{often referred to as the}} battery capacity measured in ampere-hours (Ah) or kilowatt-hours (kWh), depends on the specific application, design limitations, costs and the degradation of the particular battery pack. Validated by 'real-world' driving data from the Imperial College Racing Green Endurance (RGE) flagship electric supercar, the SRZero, a software model following a quasi-steady, backward-forward facing and equivalent circuit approach is introduced. This model is also supported by the results of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 RAC Future Car Challenges as well as by battery life testing from a lab environment. Furthermore, travel surveys from the United Kingdom (UK), Germany and the United States (US) have been analysed and then converted into input parameters for this algorithm. The work considers five different electric vehicle classes ranging from mini cars to sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Results show that varying <b>kerb</b> <b>weights</b> combined with differing levels of driving resistances (aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, climbing resistance, etc.) lead to reference 'driving forces' of 70 - 290 Wh/km for the five reference vehicle classes. On average, SUVs consume more than four times as much energy per unit distance as mini cars. Also, driving behaviour has a significant impact on energy consumption and thus on the optimum nominal battery capacity. Empirical data has shown that the mean driving force can vary up to 23...|$|R

2500|$|The BMW M57 {{diesel engine}} was {{replaced}} for 2007 with the TDV8 engine developed by Ford and Land Rover at Dagenham and Gaydon. The 3.6-litre AJD-V8 32-valve twin turbo V8 engine develops , {{far more than}} the [...] of the previous engine and so is better capable to deal with the weighty vehicle. The maximum speed is 124mph, whilst 0-60mph was reduced to 8.6 seconds for a car with a <b>kerb</b> <b>weight</b> of 2.7 tons. Torque is a substantial 640Nm at 2,000 rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transmission}} is a dual-clutch direct-shift gearbox computer-controlled automatic with seven gear ratios, with magnesium paddles behind {{the steering wheel}} and a shift time of less than 150milliseconds, built by Ricardo of England rather than Borg-Warner, who designed the six speed DSG used in the mainstream Volkswagen Group marques.

2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a <b>kerb</b> <b>weight</b> of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E

50|$|Although the quoted {{power outputs}} {{are low in}} {{comparison}} to modern small hatchbacks, or even to other hatchbacks of the time, the <b>kerb</b> <b>weight</b> was generally very low, with even the range-topping VTS having a <b>kerb</b> <b>weight</b> of just 935 kg, with other smaller engine models (except the diesel) being around 100 kg lighter than this. This meant a high power-to-weight ratio which meant for decent acceleration and made the car suitable for city driving.
