40|$|<b>Hemp</b> <b>fibres</b> {{belong to}} the group of natural, {{cellulose}} bast fibres. These fibres have exceptional properties such as: antimicrobial effect, absence of allergy effect, extraordinary sorption properties, good electro-physical properties (small static electricity in regard to other cellulose fibres) as well as high values of breaking strength (the natural fibre with the highest strength). However, <b>hemp</b> <b>fibres</b> have some defects: heterogeneous chemical composition, large quantity of accompanying substances (lignin pectins, waxes) and unsatisfactory fineness and eveness. It is possible to a great extent to eliminate or reduce, the defects of <b>hemp</b> <b>fibres</b> by of appropriate modification treatments. In order to determine the appropriate modification treatment of <b>hemp</b> <b>fibres,</b> the dependences between the chemical composition, fineness and electric resistance of <b>hemp</b> <b>fibres</b> were presented in this paper. In the experimental part of the paper, by the application of a procedure for the determination of the chemical composition, the accompanying supstances of <b>hemp</b> <b>fibres</b> were gradually removed. After each phase some fibrous substrates were separated. After that the fineness and electric resistance were determined.
