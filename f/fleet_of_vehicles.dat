However, according to the U.S. Department of Energy in 2011 only 862,837 flex-fuel fleet-operated vehicles were regularly fueled with E85. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, {{signed into law by}} President Bush on 8 August 2005, in its Section 701 requires the federal government's <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> capable of operating on alternative fuels to be operated on these fuels exclusively, unless a waiver is granted if the alternative fuel is not reasonably available; or if the cost of the fuel required is unreasonably more expensive compared to gasoline.

According to the Government Accountability Office, in 2010 Federal employees received waivers to use gasoline in 55 percent of fleet flex-fuel vehicles because E85 was not available.|$|E

2500|$|The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency {{found that}} if Minnesota's <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> making lengthy trips were {{replaced}} by plug-in hybrids, [...] emissions per vehicle would likely decrease. However, unless more than 40% of the electricity used to charge the vehicles were to come from non-polluting sources, replacing the vehicles with non-plug-in hybrids would engender a larger decrease in [...] emissions. Plug-in hybrids use less fuel in all cases, and produce much less carbon dioxide in short commuter trips, which is how most vehicles are used. The difference is such that overall carbon emissions would decrease if all internal combustion vehicles were converted to plug-ins.|$|E
