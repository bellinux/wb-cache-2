40|$|AbstractThe Ordos Basin of North China is {{not only}} an {{important}} <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> province, but also a major producer of oil, gas and coal in China. The genetic relationship between <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> and hydrocarbons has been recognized by a number of previous studies, but it has not been well understood in terms of the hydrodynamics of basin fluid flow. We have demonstrated in a previous study that the preferential localization of Cretaceous <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> in {{the upper part of the}} Ordos Jurassic section may have been related to the interface between an upward flowing, reducing fluid and a downward flowing, oxidizing fluid. This interface may have been controlled by the interplay between fluid overpressure related to disequilibrium sediment compaction and which drove the upward flow, and topographic relief, which drove the downward flow. In this study, we carried out numerical modeling for the contribution of oil and gas generation to the development of fluid overpressure, in addition to sediment compaction and heating. Our results indicate that when hydrocarbon generation is taken into account, fluid overpressure during the Cretaceous was more than doubled in comparison with the simulation when hydrocarbon generation was not considered. Furthermore, fluid overpressure dissipation at the end of sedimentation slowed down relative to the no-hydrocarbon generation case. These results suggest that hydrocarbon generation may have played an important role in <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization,</b> not only in providing reducing agents required for the mineralization, but also in contributing to the driving force to maintain the upward flow...|$|R

40|$|The Contact Lake lode {{gold deposit}} is {{situated}} in northern Saskatchewan within the Proterozoic La Ronge Domain of the Trans-Hudson Orogen (∼ 1. 9 - 1. 7 Ga). The deposit {{is associated with a}} high angle, reverse shear zone, which crosscuts the central granitic and granodioritic phases of the composite Little Deer Lake pluton. Four temporally distinct stages of veining within the shear zone have been identified on the basis of mineralogical, textural and crosscutting relationships. The four discernable vein types (two devoid of gold and two containing gold mineralization) permit the detailed study of fluids responsible for gold mineralization versus barren fluids, which is critical to gold exploration. High grade gold mineralization is related to stage IV veins. The interaction between the auriferous stage IV vein fluid and the granitic and granodioritic phases of the pluton produced distinct alteration mineral assemblages. The Proterozoic Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, hosts several of the largest and richest uranium deposits in the world. The uranium deposits occur at the intersection between Hudsonian-age faults and the unconformity between Athabasca Group sandstones and Aphebian metasediments and Archean gneisses. <b>Uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> formed at ca. 200 °C from the mixing between the oxidizing, uranium bearing basinal brine and the reducing basement fluid which issued along the faults. High concentrations of REE-rich phosphates are associated with <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> in the Athabasca Basin. The relations among REE-rich minerals, diagenetic clays and <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> in the basin and basement rocks indicate extensive REE mobility during diagenesis of the Athabasca Basin. The REEs and U most likely were derived from detrital fluor-apatite and zircon in the sandstone, and garnets in the basement rocks. These relations indicate that REEs, and possibly the uranium, were transported as F-complexes. The three stages of ore formation and associated alteration minerals permit the detailed study of fluids responsible for uranium deposition and alteration, which is critical to understanding and refining the model for the genesis of unconformity-type uranium deposits. In addition, the high concentration of REEs associated with <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> may render these deposits viable sources of REEs in addition to uranium.

As results from previous works, the emplacement of these injections is structurally controlled and well defined by large shear zones striking in an ENE–WSW direction and crosscut by NW–SE to NNW–SSE fault sets. VLF method has been applied to map the structure and the presence of radioactive minerals that have been delineated by the detection of high <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization.</b> The electromagnetic survey was carried out to detect the presence of shallow and deep conductive zones that cross the granites along ENE–WSW fracturing directions and to map its spatial distribution. The survey comprised seventy N–S spectrometry and VLF-EM profiles with 20 m separation. The resulted data were displayed as composite maps for K, eU and eTh as well as VLF-Fraser map. Twelve profiles with 100 m separation were selected for detailed description. The VLF-EM data were interpreted qualitatively as well as quantitatively using the Fraser and the Karous–Hjelt filters. Fraser filtered data and relative current density pseudo-sections indicate the presence of shallow and deep conductive zones that cross the granites along ENE–WSW shearing directions. High uranium concentrations found just above the higher apparent current-density zones that coincide with El-Sela shear zone indicate a positive relation between conductivity and uranium minerals occurrence.

40|$|The Cenex uranium deposit {{occurs in}} gneisses and schists of the Tazin Group which {{represent}} supracrustal rocks folded and metamorphosed to amphibolite rank during the Hudsonian orogeny. During the late {{stages of the}} orogenic uplift, cataclastic deformation caused partial retrogression of the rocks to greenschist facies assemblages and their transformation into mylonites, ultramylonites, and mylonite schist. Continued uplift of these rocks led to their brittle fracture, and, contemporaneous erosion on surface resulted {{in the formation of}} successor basins in the area. The orebody occurs at the intersection of northwest and northeast-trending fault zones and the ore is localized in breccia zones, along faults, and in veins and the adjacent wallrocks. The host rocks are quartzo-feldspathic mylonites and ultramylonites and chlorite, sericite, quartz, graphite, feldspar mylonite schist. The uranium-bearing minerals are pitchblende and a uraniferous titanate, which commonly occur finely disseminated in the host rocks. Cross-cutting relationships between mineralized structures indicate five stages of <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> separated by fracturing events· The earliest episode of mineralization is associated with late-stage retrograde metamorphic processes in the mylonite schist, whereas later stages of mineralization are dominated by the intense hematization, carbonatization, and chloritization of the quartzo-feldspathic mylonites and ultramylonites. Traditional genetic models, which metamorphic-hydrothermal sources propose magmatic for the uranium and ore-bearing fluid, have been evaluated and found to be ·inconsistent with the geological history of the rocks and the relative time of emplacement of <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization.</b> In the Cenex mine area there appears to have been contemporaneity of late uplift, erosion, and deposition of continental clastics on the one hand, and· brittle fracture and <b>uranium</b> <b>mineralization</b> in the basement, on the other.
