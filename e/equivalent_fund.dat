40|$|Performance-related bonuses in {{the finance}} sector are {{considered}} important tools to provide incentives. An example is that stock portfolio managers are awarded bonuses conditionally on their portfolios producing superior returns either relative to an index or <b>equivalent</b> <b>funds.</b> Concerns are however expressed that bonuses to portfolio managers {{are based on}} too short time intervals, which may impact negatively on {{the degree to which}} environmental and social factors are taken into account in investment decisions. The question addressed in this article is how bonus schemes can be designed so that delayed payouts will be equally motivating as short-term payouts. We have conducted two experiments to investigate preference for bonus payments that are paid out either frequently of infrequently. In Experiment 1 employing 27 undergraduates, preferences were measured for one certain long-term bonus versus four certain bonuses evenly distributed across time. A majority chose the short-term bonuses, and in order for a long-term bonus to be equally preferred the results showed that it needs to be approximately 40 percent higher than the four combined short-term bonuses. Experiment 2 employing another 36 undergraduates introduced uncertainty of outcomes which more accurately reflects the setting faced by stock investors. A four-year bonus is compared to four one-year bonuses. Uncertainty was the same, decreasing or increasing over the four years. The results showed that decreasing uncertainty made a majority prefer the four-year bonus to the added one-year bonuses. In conclusion, introducing uncertainty in choices concerning future outcomes is shown to reduce the extent to which future bonus outcomes are discounted relative to immediate bonus outcomes.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the performance of alternative UCITS funds {{on the basis of}} manager offshore experience and, additionally, the existence of an “equivalent” offshore hedge fund. Managers with offshore experience are defined as management companies managing offshore hedge funds in addition to managing UCITS. For a sample period from 2008 to 2011, we find that such UCITS have a positive alpha, still with a p-value of 0. 12 due to the limited size of the subsamples, which could provide some evidence of offshore manager added value. Among these UCITS, we identify further those which have an <b>equivalent</b> offshore hedge <b>fund</b> whose performance is replicated by using the same or a similar strategy, or through a swap. We find that “offshore-experienced” UCITS without offshore equivalents (1) exhibit no meaningful differences in mean performance compared to those with equivalents, but are (2) generally less volatile and show a positive significant alpha at the 95 % level. Concentrating then on those with <b>equivalent</b> offshore hedge <b>funds,</b> the onshore-offshore comparison shows no significant differences in mean performance and volatility when we use equally-weighted indices but an offshore outperformance when we do a cross-sectional study. We also find a sizable regulation-induced tracking error. ...|$|R
