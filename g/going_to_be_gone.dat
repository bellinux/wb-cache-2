His bedroom was small, {{and he was so}} stiff and sore that he could not get comfortable. He twisted and turned and fidgeted. The more he fidgeted, the more uncomfortable he grew. He thought of the warm sunshine outside and how comfortable he would be, stretched out full length on the doorstep. It would take the soreness out of his legs. Something must have happened to Granny to keep her so long. If she had known that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> such a long time, she wouldn't have told him to stay until she came back, thought Reddy.|$|E

5000|$|An {{incident}} {{arose in}} the 1930's between the Ku Klux Klan and the family. The story is documented in a book by David Frost, called Witness to Injustice. One of the Forte men went to town and had a fight with a white man. A knife was involved and both men were injured. When Forte made it home to Eufaula, {{the women and children}} moved into the woods for protection, while the men prepared for a fight. The next day a group of klansmen came to seek revenge at the Forte compound. They stopped at a country store to load up on supplies.

5000|$|The city is {{far enough}} south {{that during the}} summer there is {{daylight}} twenty four hours a day. The premises opened at 8 pm. The police testimony at the trial described women arriving at the nightclub from the living quarters. The women were required to be on duty from 11 pm to 6 am, and received one day off each week. (In one interview, Kinan said that the work shift started at 11:30 pm.) However, Kinan testified that shifts could extend to 8 am or even 2 pm. There was a listing near the bar with prices for drinks and women. The women were available for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour. Police witnesses said that men started arriving at the nightclub around midnight, and women would leave with the men, returning alone. When a customer left the nightclub with a woman, he had to pay the nightclub {{the price of a}} cup or half a cup, depending on how long the woman was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone.</b> (The nightclub paid 20 pesos for a drink and charged the customers 150 pesos, which the owner himself described as [...] "cheating the customers".) ...|$|E

After his appearance on Survivor, Wade was fired as head women's soccer coach for the university.

They entered the semi-finals against a strong and experienced Redhills side and won by 2-5 to 1-5 with two second half goals settling the issue, scored by P. Carolan and J. Farrelly respectively. The final brought together Cuchulainns beaten finalists in 1985 and the side they accounted for in the semi-final of the same competition, Killeshandra.|$|R

Despite praise from critics, Hugo was cited {{as one of the}} year's notable box-office flops. Its perceived failure <b>was</b> due <b>to</b> competition with Disney's The Muppets and Summit's Breaking Dawn Part 1. The film <b>was</b> estimated <b>to</b> have had a net loss of $100 million. Producer Graham King said that the film's box-office results were painful. [...] "There's no finger-pointing—I'm the producer and I take the responsibility," [...] he said.

5000|$|With {{apparent}} {{reference to}} the impact of the Iraq war policy, in a press conference held on November 8, Bush talked about the election and announced the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Bush stated, [...] "I know there's a lot of speculation on what the election means for the battle we're waging in Iraq. I recognize that many Americans voted last night to register their displeasure with the lack of progress being made there." [...] Prior to the election, Bush had stated that he intended to keep Rumsfeld on as Secretary of Defense until the end of his Presidency. However, Bush then went on to add Rumsfeld's resignation <b>was</b> not due <b>to</b> the Democratic victories on November 8.

However, he experienced a season-ending injury when he tore his medial collateral ligament (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in an optional pre-season practice session. The Mutiny traded him to the Dallas Burn where Burn coach Dave Dir moved Hattrup to the wide midfield. As Hattrup noted, [...] "The strange thing is he told me he wanted me to come and score goals.
