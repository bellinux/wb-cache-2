40|$|Introduction Upon {{power-on}} a GSM {{mobile station}} (MS) {{one of its}} first tasks is to locate and then synchronize itself to the carrier frequency of the local base station (BS). This is to ensure adequate reception and more importantly, {{to ensure that the}} MS transmitter's carrier frequency is within specifications. The next task is to determine the symbol timing of the received signal. This is necessary to properly demodulate the incoming bit stream and to ensure that the transmitter's symbol timing meets specifications. Thus, both frequency and timing synchronization must be achieved [1]. The frequency synchronization system must locate the broadcast control channel (BCCH) carrier signal, determine the starting point of the <b>frequency</b> <b>correction</b> <b>burst</b> (<b>FCB),</b> calculate the frequency o#set of the mobile unit's local reference oscillator relative to the BS carrier, and adjust the local reference oscillator frequency to reduce the frequency o#set to within specifications.

40|$|This work {{is part of}} the multi-center Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a large multi-site {{study of}} dementia, {{including}} patients having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as healthy elderly controls. A major portion of ADNI involves the use of [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET). The objective of this paper is the reduction of inter-scanner differences in the FDG-PET scans obtained from the 50 participating PET centers having fifteen different scanner models. In spite of a standardized imaging protocol, systematic inter-scanner variability in PET images from various sites is observed primarily due to differences in scanner resolution, reconstruction techniques, and different implementations of scatter and attenuation corrections. Two correction steps were developed by comparison of 3 -D Hoffman brain phantom scans with the ‘gold standard’ digital 3 -D Hoffman brain phantom: i) high frequency correction; where a smoothing kernel for each scanner model was estimated to smooth all images to a common resolution and ii) low frequency correction; where smooth affine correction factors were obtained to reduce the attenuation and scatter correction errors. For the phantom data, the high <b>frequency</b> <b>correction</b> reduced the variability by 20 %– 50 % and the low <b>frequency</b> <b>correction</b> further reduced the differences by another 20 %– 25 %. Correction factors obtained from phantom studies were applied to 95 scans from normal control subjects obtained from the participating sites. The high <b>frequency</b> <b>correction</b> reduced differences similar to the phantom studies. However, the low <b>frequency</b> <b>correction</b> did not further reduce differences; hence further refinement of the procedure is necessary...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{equivalent}} linearization technique, when used properly, enables us to calculate <b>frequency</b> <b>corrections</b> of weakly nonlinear oscillators beyond the first order in nonlinearity. We illustrate the method by applying it to the conservative anharmonic oscillators and the nonconservative van der Pol oscillator that are respectively paradigmatic systems for modeling center-type oscillatory states and limit cycle type oscillatory states. The choice of these systems is also prompted {{by the fact that}} first order <b>frequency</b> <b>corrections</b> may vanish for both these types of oscillators, thereby rendering the calculation of the higher order corrections rather important. The method presented herein is very general in nature and, hence, in principle applicable to any arbitrary periodic oscillator. Comment: 4 pages, Accepted in EPJ...|$|R

The empirical approach describes functions on season, local time, geographic/geomagnetic location and solar activity conditions approximated by the solar radio flux index F 10. 7. The 12 coefficients are derived from global TEC data provided by the University of Berne over more than half a solar cycle (1998 - 2007). It has been found that both the global Neustrelitz TEC Model (NTCM-GL) and the NeQuick model show a better performance than the Klobuchar model by a factor of about two. Nevertheless, NTCM and NeQuick models deviate considerably at low latitudes indicating that modelling of the low latitude ionosphere is a challenging task that needs further research.
