5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual maturity <b>in</b> <b>males</b> declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual maturity <b>in</b> <b>males</b> had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid (UA), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and arterial stiffness {{have not been}} fully investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify whether CRP, UA, and estimated GFR are related to arterial stiffness estimated using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). The subjects were local government employees (3412 men and 854 women). baPWV, CRP, UA, GFR, and conventional risk factors were evaluated. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that CRP and UA were significantly related to an elevation of PWV <b>in</b> <b>male</b> and female subjects, and that the estimated GFR was significantly related to an elevation of PWV <b>in</b> <b>male</b> subjects. Significant progressive increases in baPWV were observed across the quartiles of CRP <b>in</b> <b>male</b> subjects and for UA <b>in</b> <b>male</b> and female subjects. In female subjects, the relationship of quartile CRP to baPWV had marginal significance (P= 0. 055). But, <b>in</b> <b>male</b> and female subjects, quartile of estimated GFR had no significant association with PWV. These results suggest that CRP and UA are associated with an increase of arterial stiffness <b>in</b> <b>male</b> and female subjects, and that estimated GFR is possibly related to arterial stiffness <b>in</b> <b>male</b> subjects...|$|R

Fishman cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years <b>in</b> <b>males</b> and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially <b>in</b> <b>males)</b> allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
