40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{fragrances}} and flavors together with requirements of green chemistry are {{the basis for the}} development of new heterogeneous catalytic syntheses. It was shown that the aldol condensation of acetone and citral to pseudoionone over a basic ion exchanger work with good conversion and high selectivity. The same applies to the analog aldol reactions to the various methylpseudoionones. <b>Diacetone</b> <b>alcohol</b> and mesityl oxide are further possible products. The aldol condensation can be realized both in a batch or continuous process. The batch procedure is easier to build up and generates many results in short time as would be important for example for benchmarking. In a continuous fixed bed reactor higher selectivities are possible. For the reaction of acetone with citral to pseudoionone a selectivity of 96 % is achieved on a conversion of 97 %. A benchmarking shows the influence of matrix and type of the ion exchange resins on conversion, selectivity and lifetime. All current ion exchanger deactivate within a relatively short time. Therefore they are not suitable for industrial use but very usefull for the production of small quantities. In a laboratory scale the various commercially not available isomers of pseudoionone could be prepared separately with high purity. The synthesis of <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol</b> can be catalyzed by ion exchange very well. A selectivity of 99 % is achieves with minimal catalyst deactivation. The aldol reaction is a standard reaction in organic chemistry for the formation of new CC bonds. However, there are often problems to stop the reaction at the beta-hydroxy carbonyl compound and prevent condensation. This is exactly what is possible while using strongly basic ion exchangers for the production of <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol.</b> An addition of water during the reaction {{have a positive effect on}} selectivity and the lifetime of the basic ion exchanger. The water reduces the Hofmann elimination an at the same time it also reduces the deactivation by the organic fouling. Rare earth metal oxides show good performance for the aldol condensation, especially the use of lanthanum oxid. But rare earth metal oxides need higher temperatures to catalyse an aldol condensation. Therefore, all reactions with these catalysts have been performed in autoclaves. The catalysis of aldol reactions with acetone show exactly the described phenomenon that the reaction does not stop at the stage of the beta-hydroxy carbonyl compound, but directly the condensation occurs. In the case of the aldol condensation of acetone the product obtained, mesityl oxide, is also of economic interest.

40|$|In this work, we have {{examined}} the activity and selectivity of new catalysts for the single-stage production of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK, 4 - methyl- 2 -pentanone) from acetone (both in liquid and gas phase), using a fixed bed reactor operated in the temperature range between 373 and 473 K. The main reaction pathways for the synthesis of MIBK from acetone are given in Fig. 1. The first step is the self condensation of acetone to <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol</b> (DAA, 4 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone); the second step is the dehydration of DAA to mesityl oxide (MO, 4 -methyl- 3 -penten- 2 -one); the final step is the selective hydrogenation of the carbon–carbon double bond of MO to form MIBK. The most commonly observed side reactions are over-condensations and unselective hydrogenations (also shown in Fig. 1). Two types of catalysts were studied: i) Pd supported on MgO-SiO 2 mixed oxides with ratio of Mg to Si, synthetized using Ohnishi’s method and ii) Pd supported on alumina doped with 5 % or 10 % of MgO. The different Mg-Si and Mg-Al catalysts were characterized by different techniques (XRD, BET, SEM, NH 3 -TPD and CO 2 -TPD) and tested under different conditions in the condensation of acetone to <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol</b> and its dehydration to mesityl oxide to enhance the activity. Palladium was chosen as metal component, and its hydrogenation activity was studied. A low hydrogenation activity negatively affects the acetone conversion and promotes the production of mesityl oxide. Hydrogenation conditions being too severe may favor the unwanted hydrogenation of acetone to 2 -propanol and of MIBK to methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC, 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanol) but this effect is less detrimental to the MIBK selectivity than an unsufficient hydrogenation activity...|$|E

40|$|International audienceconversion reaction. The {{formation}} of acetone and acetylene {{is indicative of}} the basic properties of the zinc oxide surface. This basic catalyst, whose conversion level depends {{on the nature of the}} pre-treatment, was found to deactivate versus time on stream. Poisoning the basic sites by CO 2 pre-adsorption only affects the active sites working at the beginning of the reaction, those still working at steady state being not impacted. This is consistent with the modification of the strength and population of the active sites during the catalytic reaction. Indeed, from operando DRIFTS experiments, at the beginning of the reaction, the strong acid base pairs generated upon inert treatment at 773 K promote the self aldol condensation of acetone, leading to oligomers. This reaction also produces water, which dissociates on the surface, filling up oxygen vacancies. This contributes to the lowering of the strength of the active sites, resulting in the quenching of polymerization of acetone at a certain stage, at the benefit of the increase of the amount of <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Consistently, pre-adsorption of water was shown to lead to a decrease of the conversion level, resulting in a conversion profile similar to that obtained after 10 min of reaction in the absence of pre-adsorbed water.

40|$|The {{defatted}} seed meal of C. abyssinica was systematically {{analysed for}} insecticidal activity against Musca domestica and the active components were isolated and characterized. 2 -(S) - 1 -Cyano- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butene (SCHB) and phenylethyl cyanide (PEC) {{were identified as}} active components, whereas <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol</b> (DAA), which was identified in the extracts and tested, was not toxic to house flies. The presence of DAA and PEC in the extracts was confirmed by using gas chromatographic and mass-spectral (GC-MS) comparison with purchased reference compounds. 1, 3 -Benzodioxole- 5 -carboxaldehyde (piperonal, PIP) was also identified as a possible minor component, but was not tested. GC-MS analysis determined that the dichloromethane extract of defatted crambe seed meal contained SCHB and crambe oil {{at a ratio of}} 5 : 2, while DAA and PEC were present in trace amounts. Topical LD 50 values for M. domestica were calculated for SCHB, PEC, DAA, crude crambe extract, crambe oil and an 2 ̆ 2 artificial crambe extract 2 ̆ 2 composed of SCHB and crambe oil in the proportions found in the crude crambe extract. SCHB was found to be the most toxic major component of the crambe extract. Although SCHB concentration accounted for the toxicity of the artificial extract, the natural crambe extract was significantly less toxic than would be expected based on SCHB concentration alone. 2 -(R) - 1 -Cyano- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butene (RCHB), an enantiomer of SCHB which does not occur in crambe, was extracted from Brassica napus seed meal and tested as well. RCHB was found to be significantly less toxic to house flies than SCHB...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to develop an optimum {{chemical}} process philosophy for the manufacture of [beta]-hydroxy-[beta]-methyl-butyrate (HMB), using existing synthesis and purification schemes as a starting point. Process analysis and improvement were performed {{as a means to}} increase overall efficiency and to address environmental concerns;A protein breakdown suppresser, HMB is used as a nutritional supplement or as a feed additive. The current process which employs reaction of <b>diacetone</b> <b>alcohol</b> and sodium hypochlorite, separation of the product by batch extraction, and crystallization, displays very low efficiency and has to deal with waste disposal issues. Currently, the high costs of this process negatively infringe on the price of the product on the human market and constitute the main obstacle in fully exploiting the animal market;The first two steps, reaction and extraction, were studied in detail, as they are of crucial importance for the outcome and profit of the entire operation. Reaction kinetics and equilibrium were investigated experimentally in an effort to identify operating conditions such as temperature, reactant ratio, species concentration, solvent and salt effects that will result in an increased molar yield. A kinetic model is proposed and a computer simulation was performed that led to estimating the rate constant in the formation of HMB, which is necessary for reactor design. The current extraction technology was evaluated and it was concluded that its poor performance, with low product recovery and high solvent usage, can be attributed to both the batch and cross-current mode of operation and to the limitations of ethyl acetate as an extractant for HMB. A series of screening experiments was performed to identify solvents capable of providing superior partition coefficients and selectivities. Several physical extractants, such as methyl-ethyl ketone, hexanol and reactive extractants, such as methyl-ethyl ketone solutions of tertiary fatty amines and chloroform solutions of tri-octyl phosphine oxide, were found to display excellent HMB separation capacities;The results of this work demonstrate that the bleach/diacetone alcohol synthesis of HMB can be significantly improved by a combination of changes in both chemistry and equipment. Reaction yield can be increased from 50 % to 72 % in a tubular reactor operated at sub-ambient temperatures, at a NaOCl/substrate initial ratio of 3. 7 and in the presence of chloride ions. By using a continuous, counter-current column and a reactive extractant, extraction efficiency can be enhanced by 19 % and solvent consumption can be reduced to a half. Overall, product yield can be increased by 70 %, material costs are reduced by 24 % for the reaction and by 60 % for extraction. Operating costs can be substantially diminished...|$|E
