This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E

The following morning, Noble Team assists UNSC forces in assaulting a Covenant <b>ground</b> <b>base.</b> When a massive Covenant super-carrier joins the fight, Jorge and Six {{take part in a}} plan to destroy the super-carrier using a makeshift bomb. The Spartans use starfighters to infiltrate a smaller Covenant corvette, prepare the bomb and set the corvette on a docking course with the carrier, but the bomb's timer is damaged. Left with no choice, Jorge stays behind and sacrifices himself to destroy the super-carrier. Moments later, huge numbers of Covenant ships arrive at Reach and begin a full-scale invasion.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, several {{airlines}} {{are experimenting with}} base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the <b>ground</b> <b>base</b> stations as during take off and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration {{in the autumn of}} 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} atomic oxygen on boron nitride (BN) and silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) were {{evaluated}} {{in a low}} Earth orbit (LEO) flight experiment and in a <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> simulation facility. In both the inflight and <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> experiments, these materials were coated on thin (approx. 250 A) silver films, and the electrical resistance of the silver was measured in situ to detect any penetration of atomic oxygen through the BN and Si 3 N 4 materials. In the presence of atomic oxygen, silver oxidizes to form silver oxide, which has a much higher electrical resistance than pure silver. Permeation of atomic oxygen through BN, as indicated {{by an increase in}} the electrical resistance of the silver underneath, was observed in both the inflight and <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> experiments. In contrast, no permeation of atomic oxygen through Si 3 N 4 was observed in either the inflight or <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> experiments.

Nawaz Sharif aggressively forwarded towards the privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation of private sector in a vision to [...] "turning Pakistan into a Korea by encouraging greater private saving and investment to accelerate economic growth".

40|$|Remote sensing {{technology}} {{that uses the}} observation from satellite sensor {{is necessary for the}} global estimation of forest biomass. However, a wide range of <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> measurements (e. g., diameter at breast height (DBH), crown height, crown width, tree height) is required for the algorithm development and verification of satellite based estimation of biomass. These <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> measurements are time consuming, laborious and costly as well. <b>Ground</b> <b>based</b> laser scanning method which can provide various measurements and structural analysis of the forest can be an alternative method to traditional <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> measurements. However, some problems exist on <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> laser scanner. For example, it is impossible to estimate the shape of invisible tree where <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> laser cannot reach. In this case, high density laser scanned data can be acquired by overlapping the scanning data by measuring from multi-observational points. As a result, the problem of invisible area in the forest could be solved. However, it is also problem to take more observation points than the optimum observational points because the requirements of labor, time increase with the increase in observational points. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the multi observation points of the <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> laser scanning system in a forest. The meaning of optimization is to sufficiently observe the targeted area without any invisible area with the lowest possible observation points. In this idea of optimization, arrangement of observational points which can overlap the observed area by reducing the invisible are is important. This paper presents the method and result of overlapping the laser scanning area with optimization of multi observation points...|$|R
