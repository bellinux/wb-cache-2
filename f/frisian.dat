5|$|English is an Indo-European language, and {{belongs to}} the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages. Old English {{originated}} from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum {{along the coast of}} the North Sea, whose languages are now known as the Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic. As such, the modern <b>Frisian</b> languages are the closest living relatives of Modern English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the <b>Frisian</b> languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic, though this grouping remains debated. Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English. Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other English (Anglic) languages, including Scots and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Old Norse Þórr, Old English ðunor, Old High German Donar, Old Saxon thunar, and Old <b>Frisian</b> thuner are {{cognates}} {{within the}} Germanic language branch, descending from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *þunraz 'thunder'.|$|E
5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or <b>Frisian,</b> do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E
5000|$|East <b>Frisians</b> (Ostfriesen) are, in {{the wider}} sense, the {{inhabitants}} of East Frisia in the northwest of the German state of Lower Saxony. In the narrower sense the East <b>Frisians</b> are the eastern branch of the <b>Frisians,</b> a Germanic people and belong, together with the Danes, Sorbs, Sinti and Romanies to the recognised minorities in Germany. They {{are closely related to}} the Saterland <b>Frisians,</b> who come from East Frisia and moved from the coastal region to the interior. The East <b>Frisians</b> are also related to the North <b>Frisians</b> and the Westlauwers <b>Frisians.</b>|$|R
50|$|West <b>Frisians</b> {{in general}} {{do not feel}} or see {{themselves}} {{as part of a}} larger group of <b>Frisians,</b> and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with East or North <b>Frisians.</b> Because of centuries of cohabitation and active participation in Dutch society, as well as being bilingual, the <b>Frisians</b> are not treated as a separate group in Dutch official statistics.|$|R
25|$|The wars {{ended with}} the last {{uprising}} of the <b>Frisians</b> in 793 and the pacification of the <b>Frisians</b> by Charlemagne.|$|R
5|$|On 25 June 1943, another B-17 {{formation}} {{headed into}} Germany. However, both {{primary and secondary}} targets were covered with cloud and the bombers attacked two convoys off the <b>Frisian</b> Islands. Some eight assorted groups of fighters intercepted, among them III./JG 1, who claimed seven bombers, Leesmann responsible for one of them. III./JG 1 lost two pilots including Adjutant Oberleutnant Friedrich Hardt, and three pilots were injured.|$|E
5|$|One type of coin for Beonna has no named moneyer and depicts an {{interlace}} motif on its reverse. A {{specimen of}} this type (now lost) was found at Dorestad, which was during Beonna's time an important trading centre: these coins resemble Frankish or <b>Frisian</b> deniers that were issued from the Maastricht area during this period.|$|E
5|$|Recognised native {{minority}} {{languages in}} Germany are Danish, Low German, Sorbian, Romany, North <b>Frisian</b> and Saterland Frisian; they are officially {{protected by the}} European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim {{to be able to}} communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frisians</b> in Oostergo and Westergo {{supported}} Dirk's brother William, who invaded Holland. William {{was supported}} {{by some of the}} West <b>Frisians</b> as well.|$|R
2500|$|Though the Merovingian {{king of the}} Franks Chilperic I (561-584) is {{mentioned}} in Frankish sources as the [...] "terror of the <b>Frisians</b> and the Suebi," [...] {{there is evidence that}} around 600 the <b>Frisians</b> were successful in a war led by their king Audulf. This allowed the <b>Frisians</b> to expand further south.|$|R
50|$|Despite Batavianization and {{the general}} idea that <b>Frisians</b> were {{underdeveloped}} and rural, <b>Frisians</b> never were the subject of ethnic discrimination or willful linguistic or cultural oppression.|$|R
5|$|The English {{proper name}} Sun {{developed}} from Old English sunne {{and may be}} related to south. Cognates to English sun appear in other Germanic languages, including Old <b>Frisian</b> sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the <b>Frisian</b> Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the <b>Frisian</b> Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The only {{significant}} Christian {{success of the}} Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, <b>Frisian,</b> Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the Holy Land, the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon, expelling its Moorish occupants.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German Bight. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became {{to be known as the}} Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East <b>Frisian</b> Islands.|$|E
5|$|English is a North Sea Germanic {{language}} that was first spoken in early medieval England {{and is now}} a global lingua franca. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the <b>Frisian</b> languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, especially French.|$|E
5|$|German is the {{official}} and predominant spoken language in Germany. Standard German is a West Germanic language and {{is closely related to}} and classified alongside Low German, Dutch, Afrikaans, <b>Frisian</b> and English. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). German is written using the Latin alphabet.|$|E
5000|$|North <b>Frisians</b> are, in {{the wider}} sense, the {{inhabitants}} of the district of Nordfriesland in Schleswig-Holstein. In a narrower sense they are an ethnic sub-group of the <b>Frisians</b> from North Frisia and on Heligoland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{troops of}} Christopher the Spendthrift finally {{subjected}} the Wursten <b>Frisians</b> in the Battle of Mulsum on 9 August 1524. In 1525 the Wursten Consuls had to conclude the Treaty of Stade, which incorporated Wursten into the prince-archbishopric, {{did away with}} the Wursten constitution, including the election of consuls and subjected the Wursten <b>Frisians</b> to feudal dues and duties and prince-archiepiscopal bailiffs (Vögte), wielding authoritarian force over the Wursten <b>Frisians.</b>|$|R

5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old <b>Frisian.</b> Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E
5|$|The Dole {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the Gudbrandsdal, an inland valley in the county of Oppland. It is likely that the Dole is in part a descendant of the Friesian, as the two breeds are similar in conformation, and the <b>Frisian</b> people were known traders in the area between 400 and 800 AD. There was also equine movement between western Norway and northern England during the 9th century through the mid-11th century; this extended period of trade between these areas likely influenced the strong resemblance between the Dole, Friesian, Fell Pony and Dale Pony breeds.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel {{is identical}} to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old <b>Frisian</b> helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
25|$|She {{was clearly}} a Danish (or at least 'half-Danish') princess, who had married Finn, prince of the <b>Frisians,</b> doubtless a {{political}} move to secure peace between Danes and <b>Frisians.</b> Hildeburh had a brother, Hnæf, who apparently went to Finn with his Danish retinue in friendship.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Warns (Frisian: Slach by Warns, Dutch: Slag bij Warns) was {{a battle}} from the Frisian-Hollandic War between count Willem IV of Holland and the <b>Frisians</b> {{which took place}} on 26 September 1345. The annual {{commemoration}} of the battle is important for many nationalist <b>Frisians.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From {{the stage}} act by Otto Waalkes: [...] "The East <b>Frisians</b> and the Bavarians are playing football. Suddenly a train goes past nearby and whistles. The East <b>Frisians</b> think {{the game has}} ended and go home! (pause) Half an hour later the Bavarians score the first goal!" ...|$|R
5|$|In 1071, {{the sixth}} Count of Flanders, Arnulf III, {{was killed in}} the first Battle of Cassel by the forces of Robert the <b>Frisian</b> in a dispute over the {{succession}} to the title of count. Although Arnulf was numerically superior and was supported by King Philip I of France, Robert was able to defeat his rival's army and took the title of Count of Flanders with the acquiescence of Philip I after a further five years of struggle. The town was re-fortified, possibly by Robert, with a castle and a new set of walls built on the remains of the old Roman walls. The castle does not survive today – it was already in ruins by the early 18th century – but is depicted on old engravings as a large square tower, the Tour Grise, dominating the western flank of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the <b>Frisian</b> area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|Other {{diversion}} operations included 40 Lancasters, 19 Halifaxes and 35 Vickers Wellingtons from No. 7 Group RAF flying {{toward the}} <b>Frisian</b> Islands. Some aircraft withdrew owing to mechanical difficulties but 91 dropped 3,721 bundles of Window over the North Sea. Five Halifaxes, three B-24 Liberators and eight B-17 Flying Fortress also assisted with jamming operations. The USAAF committed 24 B-24s to bomb Emden {{in support of}} the main force. In the final pre-amble to the main attack No. 100 Group committed 10 Halifaxes and six Mosquitos to drop target markers over Meppen to mislead German ground controllers into believing it was the target. The bombers struck Ladbergen, and the canal burst its banks, the safety gates were overwhelmed and canal boats were stranded. The attack lasted just 25 minutes.|$|E

50|$|The free <b>Frisians</b> (actually petty noblemen) and {{the city}} of Groningen founded the Opstalboom League to counter feudalism. The league {{consisted}} of modern Friesland, Groningen, East Frisia and the German North Sea coast, and parts of the Danish North Sea coast (Schleswig). But the Opstalboom league did not consist only of <b>Frisians,</b> as the area of Zevenwouden {{and the city}} of Groningen were Saxon. Some <b>Frisians</b> lived under the rule of the counts of Holland in West Friesland. The Opstalboom League was short-lived; it collapsed after a few years because of continual internal strife.|$|R
