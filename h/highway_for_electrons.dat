40|$|Large volume {{changes and}} {{limited access to}} redox sites of high {{capacity}} anode materials are great challenges. Although, various strategies were adopted but still results are far from required values for their practical usage. Here, we have designed a unique structure to prevent surface reaction and structural disintegration meanwhile intrinsic conductivity is improved to involve all redox sites in conversion reaction. CoSnx@C-PAn hybrid was synthesized through aqueous chemical route, Co doping in tin make accessible all redox sites by faster conduction of electrons while its hard nature relaxes internal stress, carbon shell prevents surface reaction and brings well control on solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film by maintaining barrier between electrode surface and electrolyte and nitrogen doped porous carbon provides faster diffusion of Li+ deep in electrode make possible high mass loadings and conduction <b>highway</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrons.</b> Furthermore, porous carbon also provides room to compensate volume expansion and keeps electrode structure stable. Because of its unique structure hybrid shows excellent reversible capacity of 2044 mAh/g (retention 100 %) with mass loading of 3. 8 mg/cm 2 along with long cyclic life up to 1000 cycles and bears high rate capability (20 A/g). We believe that present study makes possible the use of high capacity materials in applications...|$|E
40|$|A well-organized {{flexible}} interleaved {{composite of}} graphene nanosheets (GNSs) decorated with Fe 3 O 4 particles was synthesized through in situ reduction of iron hydroxide between GNSs. The GNS/Fe 3 O 4 composite shows a reversible specific capacity approaching 1026 mA h(- 1) g(- 1) after 30 cycles at 35 mA g(- 1) 580 mAh g(- 1) after 100 cycles at 700 mA g(- 1) {{as well as}} improved cyclic stability and excellent rate capability. The multifunctional features of the GNS/Fe 3 O 4 composite are considered as follows: (i) GNSs play a "flexible confinement" function to enwrap Fe 3 O 4 particles, which can compensate for the volume change of Fe 3 O 4 and prevent the detachment and agglomeration of pulverized Fe 3 O 4, thus extending the cycling life of the electrode; (ii) GNSs provide a large contact surface for individual dispersion of well-adhered Fe 3 O 4 particles and act as an excellent conductive agent to provide a <b>highway</b> <b>for</b> <b>electron</b> transport, improving the accessible capacity; (iii) Fe 3 O 4 particles separate GNSs and prevent their restacking thus improving the adsorption and immersion of electrolyte {{on the surface of}} electroactive material; and (iv) the porosity formed by lateral GNSs and Fe 3 O 4 particles facilitates ion transportation. As a result, this unique laterally confined GNS/Fe 3 O 4 composite can dramatically improve the cycling stability and the rate capability of Fe 3 O 4 as an anode material for lithium ion batteries...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{core-shell}} {{design for}} nano-structured electrode materials is introduced for realizing cost-effective and high-performance supercapacitors. In the proposed core-shell design, thin shell-layers of highly pseudo-capacitive materials provide the platform for surface or near-surface-based faradaic and non-faradaic reactions together with shortened ion-diffusion path facilitating fast-ion intercalation and deintercalation processes. The highly-conducting core serves as <b>highway</b> <b>for</b> fast <b>electron</b> transfer toward current collectors, improving both energy and power performance {{characteristics of the}} core-shell structure in relation to pristine component materials. Furthermore, use of carbon (C) -based materials as a shell layer in either electrode not only enhances capacitive performance through double-layer formation but also provides enough mechanical strength to sustain volume changes in the core material during long-cycling of the supercapacitor improving its cycle life. In order to enhance electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance and rate capability via core-shell architecture and nano-structuring, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled using ZnO/alpha-Fe 2 O 3 and ZnO/C core-shell nanorods as respective negative and positive electrodes. The ASC exhibits a specific capacitance of similar to 115 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s in a potential window as large as 1. 8 V with a response time as short as 39 ms and retains more than 80 % of its initial capacitance after 4000 cycles. Interestingly, the ASC can deliver an energy density of similar to 41 Wh/kg and a power density of similar to 7 kW/kg that are significantly higher than those reported hitherto for iron-oxide-based ASCs.
