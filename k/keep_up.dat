5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E

5|$|Românul Literar {{tried to}} <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> {{with the latest}} {{developments}} in literary form, and Caion was among the first Romanian reviewers of Futurism. However, the paper went out of print in January 1911. It was reestablished as a bi-monthly on November 1, and again ceased publication in December. It was restored a third and final time in June 1912, but went out of business soon after.|$|E

5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E

5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke {{recorded}} that they were able to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's disloyalty {{led to the}} Crown {{seizing the}} castle again and taking on the burden of {{repairing}} and maintaining it. The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into {{the development of the}} castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus earthworks and timber palisades. They were maintained in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that required them to repair and <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> sections of the palisades.|$|E

The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E

To <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
