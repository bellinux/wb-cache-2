25|$|Intrapartum {{asphyxia}} is the {{impairment of}} {{the delivery of}} oxygen to the brain and vital tissues during the progress of labour. This may exist in a pregnancy already impaired by maternal or fetal disease, or may rarely arise de novo in labour. This can be termed <b>fetal</b> <b>distress,</b> but this term may be emotive and misleading. True intrapartum asphyxia is not as common as previously believed, and is usually accompanied by multiple other symptoms during the immediate period after delivery. Monitoring might show up problems during birthing, but the interpretation and use of monitoring devices is complex and prone to misinterpretation. Intrapartum asphyxia can cause long-term impairment, particularly when this results in tissue damage through encephalopathy.|$|E

Additionally, carbetocin should not be used if a patient has high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Overdosage or repeated use of carbetocin, particularly if used during pregnancy, could cause hyper-excitation of the oxytocin receptors resulting in excessive and prolonged stimulation of uterine contractions, increasing risk of uterine rupture, placental abruption, <b>fetal</b> respiratory <b>distress</b> and postpartum hemorrhage.|$|R

Therefore great emphasis {{have been put on}} formal description of deceleration features provided by FIGO guidelines. Patterns lasting less than two minutes are divided into two classes: episodic decelerations and periodic ones. Periodic patterns are characterized by correlation with uterine contraction, while episodic decelerations do not show such relation. The research material includes 101 cardiotocographic records of total duration of 285 hours, the clinical experts selected 383 patterns for further classification. Nineteen different parameters of quantitative description of deceleration were used as the input variables of the classification system. It turned out that there was a group of 11 parameters which can be omitted because they have very weak influence on the classification process.

40|$|Maternal hypertiroidism is a {{relative}} rare disorder, which can seriously complicate pregnancy in each of its periods. There are several maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period. Correct management includes an accurate diagnosis, rigorous individualized treatment and minutious follow-up. We are presenting a retrospective study of 38 pregnant women who delivered in the Obstetric Unit of the University Emergency Bucharest Hospital {{in the past five}} years. We established a follow-up protocol in collaboration with endocrinologists. Precocious diagnosis of pregnancy is, in our opinion, mandatory. Accurate diagnosis of hormonal status beginning from the first week of pregnancy is of great importance. Maternal (weight, BP, TSH, thyroid hormones, ECG, etc.) and fetal (ultrasound, non-stress test, Doppler study) evaluation during pregnancy were rigorous performed. Results: abortion rate was 5 %; 15 % of pregnant women delivered prematurely; cesarean section rate was 22 %; fetal outcome was excellent. Treatment adjustment during pregnancy was frequent, 28 % of pregnant women had no hormonal treatment in the last trimester of pregnancy. Maternal complications were rare (poor weight gain, tachycardia). Fetal complications included low birth weight (24 %), <b>fetal</b> respiratory <b>distress</b> (10 %).

50|$|It {{is unknown}} {{how much time}} is needed for a fetus to die. Fetal {{behavior}} is consistent and {{a change in the}} fetus' movements or sleep-wake cycles can indicate <b>fetal</b> <b>distress.</b> A decrease or cessation in sensations of fetal activity may be an indication of <b>fetal</b> <b>distress</b> or death, though it is not entirely uncommon for a healthy fetus to exhibit such changes, particularly near the end of a pregnancy when there is considerably less space in the uterus than earlier in pregnancy for the fetus to move about. Still, medical examination, including a nonstress test, is recommended in the event of any type of any change in the strength or frequency of fetal movement, especially a complete cease; most midwives and obstetricians recommend the use of a kick chart to assist in detecting any changes. <b>Fetal</b> <b>distress</b> or death can be confirmed or ruled out via fetoscopy/doptone, ultrasound, and/or electronic fetal monitoring.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{neonatal}} outcomes of monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies. Methods: A retrospective cohort study involving 51 twin pregnancies followed and delivered at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital was conducted between January 2006 and December 2011. Result: Thirty six (71 %) pregnancies were dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), 14 (27 %) were monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), and one (2 %) was monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA). The antepartum complications noted in the 15 monochorionic twins were discordant fetal growth in 2 (14 %) cases, low birth weight in 11 (73 %) babies, pre-eclampsia in three mothers (21 %) and twin to twin transfusion syndrome in four (29 %) cases. <b>Fetal</b> respiratory <b>distress</b> affected eight (57 %) of the pregnancies. Six (40 %) twin sets were delivered before 30 weeks, 4 (27 %) sets at 31 to 32 weeks, 2 (13 %) sets at 34 - 35 weeks, 2 (13 %) sets at 36 - 37 weeks, and 1 (7 %) at 37 - 38 weeks. Fifteen mothers delivered 16 live infants, 9 (30 %) stillbirths and 5 (17 %) died after birth. Most neonatal deaths were due to neonatal sepsis and pulmonary hypoplasia. Dichorioinic twins, (DC) morbidity was seen in 11 % and 40 % for monochoroinic twins (MC). Mortality rate was 17 % for DC and 47 % for MC twins. Conclusions: Perinatal morbidity and mortality remain high among monochorionic twins. This is likely due to frequent twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, prematurity, fetal growth restriction and intrauterine fetal death. Improved fetal and neonatal management may result in improved outcomes...|$|R

METHOD: In a case-control study we examined all newborns presenting meningitis between August/ 2002 and December/ 2003 in the neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Healthy newborns were enrolled as a Control Group (CG). Data related to pregnancy, labor and the neonate itself were collected. The results with p< 0, 05 were considered significant. RESULTS: 42 newborns with meningitis were compared to 42 controls. The meningitis group (MG) presented a lower number of medical visits during the prenatal care. The most common abnormalities detected in both groups were: drug addiction, congenital infections, preeclampsia, eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus and urinary tract infections. <b>Fetal</b> respiratory <b>distress</b> and the use of respiratory support were related to the occurrence of meningitis. The average weight and the APGAR scores were lower in the MG. The prevalence of premature and small for the gestational age infants was significantly higher in the MG.

40|$|A micro-method {{has been}} devised for {{isolating}} a lung-derived membranous fraction from human amniotic fluid. The phospholipid content of this fraction, known as Ia-mellar body phospholipid, provides {{an indication of}} fetal lung maturity (Ann. Gun. Biochem 16 : 191, 1979). This method has now been applied to 479 samples of amniotic fluid from 330 pregnancies. The lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio has also been determined {{for each of the}} samples by the routine method currently in use in the hospitals pro-viding the samples. Hyaline membrane disease was as-sociated with a low concentration of lamellar body phos-pholipid (< 35 mg/L) in all eight cases encountered in this study. In contrast, in 182 of the 185 cases where the Ia-mellar body content of the amniotic fluid, collected within two days of delivery, exceeded 35 mg/L, the infants were free from serious respiratory problems.
