40|$|Purpose: The <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} and provision of digital collections are gaining {{importance in the}} missions of memory institutions. The ENUMERATE Core Survey 3 tried to establishing the status and progress on <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage across Europe. The article presents the survey methodology and results thus comparing the achievements of Slovenian and European participating institutions. The assessment of current status is {{made on the basis}} of findings and a possible explanation is sought. Methodology/Approach: The research methodology was established as a result of the ENUMERATE project. It includes a set of statistical indicators. Data were collected in the ENUMERATE Core Survey 3 using a web questionnaire. The survey took place in the year 2015. There were 1. 030 sample institutions from 32 countries, 54 participating institutions were from Slovenia. Data are presented and analysed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: Statistical indicators for Slovenian institutions and comparison to other Europe’s cultural heritage institutions are presented. The indicators analysed are addressing the <b>digitisation</b> activity, size <b>of</b> collections, object types, digitisation progress, strategic approach, availability of metadata and objects, collecting born digital heritage, measuring use of digital collections, reasons for providing digital access, channels of provision to digital collections, digital preservation, budgets, costs, staff and funding. In general, the results indicate that participating Slovenian institutions are lagging behind the participating European countries. Research limitation: Findings have a limited validity due to non-representativeness of the sample. Originality/Practical implications: Findings can be used for the assessment of current status and devising actions and strategies, however the research limitation has to be considered.

The proposed {{approach is developed}} {{within the framework of}} the REACH Greek National Project with the overall aim to provide a web portal enabling access to different databases <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>content</b> with emphasis on multimedia material. In order to achieve this, the project employs ontology-based representation <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>content,</b> multimedia content-based search algorithms, hybrid ontology and content-based access and user-friendly search interfaces. This fusion approach provides users with resources for building queries of multimedia repositories sequentially using multiple individual search tools, and performs higher quality searching.

40|$|The safeguarding, {{preservation}} and valorisation <b>of</b> the <b>cultural</b> heritage has increasingly become {{associated with the}} process <b>of</b> making <b>cultural</b> heritage assets available online (“Towards an Integrated Approach”). The process <b>of</b> <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> assets, while playing {{a key role in}} sharing knowledge, still represents a challenge for European and global heritage. While the focus on audiovisual cultural heritage has been characterised by a limited engagement with film and television as cultural products, cinema audiences and their experiences have been virtually neglected. Looking at the cinemagoing experience shifts the focus from the film, as cultural/commercial product, to the audiences, as citizens. The articles included in this special issue of Alphaville demonstrate that research on cinema audiences has the potential to broaden the scope <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage by including cinema heritage as a new cultural category, which relates to cinemas and the experience of cinemagoing as the social counterpart of film and filmmaking: in this sense the consumption <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage becomes a cultural phenomenon in its own right...|$|R

Local libraries, museums and archives can act as mediators, providing advice, training and the necessary infrastructure. Cultural heritage has an important role to play in today's society. Not only does it help us to understand our past but it also has an impact on social development, the economy and education. Developments in Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) have provided new opportunities for the manipulation <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. <b>Digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> material has widened access beyond the boundaries of traditional memory institutions and has provided scope for adding value to collections. The involvement of non-experts in creating recordings <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, in whatever medium, so as to capture the experience of 'ordinary citizens' in their own terms, could lead to richer and more illuminating collections as new insights and previously hidden information is revealed. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a marked uptake in the <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} collections. Though this has enabled more sources to be made available to experts and the wider public, curators still struggle to instigate and enhance engagement with cultural archives. This is largely due to the monolithic nature of many digital archives; the challenge of understanding large collections, especially if the language is inconsistent; and because users vary in expertise and have different tasks and goals that they are trying to accomplish. This paper describes CULTURA, an FP 7 funded project that is addressing these specific issues. The various technologies and approaches being used by CULTURA are discussed, along with the lessons learnt thus far, and the future work necessary to be implemented before the project concludes...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> and {{scientific}} heritage material {{for use by}} the scholarly community has been led by supply rather than demand. The DiSCmap project commissioned by JISC in 2008, aimed to study what refocussing <b>of</b> <b>digitisation</b> efforts will suit best the users of digitised materials, especially {{in the context of the}} research and teaching in the higher education institutions in the UK. The paper presents some of its initial outcomes based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of 945 special collections nominated for digitisation by intermediary users (librarians, archivist and museum curators), as well as end users' study involving a combination of online survey, focus groups and in-depth interviews.

One way is to focus upon the overall organizational climate regarding peoples 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards cultural diversity.

40|$|In recent years, {{cultural}} institutions and commercial providers have created extensive digitised newspaper collections. This book asks the timely question: {{what can the}} large-scale <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> newspapers {{tell us about the}} wider <b>cultural</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> mass <b>digitisation?</b> The unique form and materiality of newspapers, and their grounding in a particular time and place, provide challenges for researchers and digital resource creators alike. At the same time, the wider context in which <b>digitisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage occurs shapes the impact of digital resources in ways which fall short of the grand ambitions of the wider theoretical discourse. Drawing on case studies from leading digitised newspaper collections, the book aims to provide a bridge between the theory and practice of how these digitised collections are being used. Beginning with an exploration of the hyperbolic nature of technological discourses, the author explores how web interfaces, funding models and the realities of contemporary user behaviour, contrast with the hyperbolic discourse surrounding mass digitisation. This book will be of particular interest to those who want to investigate how user studies can inform our understanding of technological phenomena, including digital resource creators, information professionals, students and researchers in universities, libraries, museums and archives...|$|R

40|$|Keyword : An analysis, Culture, <b>Cultural</b> <b>Content,</b> English textbook, English Zone It is very {{obviously}} that {{language and culture}} are closely interwoven. Language {{is an expression of}} humansÂ’ communication through knowledge, belief, and behavior that can be explained and shared among group of people. Meanwhile, culture is a system of knowledge that are shared by among groups of people including values, belief, and attitudes. In this research, the researcher analyzed two problems needed to be investigated. First, cultural dissemination in English textbook Â“English ZoneÂ” for the tenth grade students of senior high school was divided into three categories: source culture, target culture, and international target culture based on Cortazzi and Jin, (1999). Second, types <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>content</b> representation that were classified into four senses: aesthetic, pragmatic, semantic, and sociological sense based on Adaskou, Britten, and Fahsi, (1990). Qualitative research design was used by the researcher as research design. The data of this research were collected from English textbook for senior high schools entitled Â“English ZoneÂ” written by Eka Mulya Astuti and published by Erlangga publisher. There were 21 reading passages that were analyzed by the researcher. The finding revealed that there were three categories of culture found and they were: source culture, target culture, and international target culture. Regarding the types <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>content</b> that were represented, the finding showed various result. In the target culture, the four senses of culture found that were: sociological sense, pragmatic sense, semantic sense, and aesthetic sense. Meanwhile, in the source culture and the international target culture were found only three cultural senses: sociological sense, semantic sense, and aesthetic sense. Regrettably, pragmatic sense was not found. Overall, the textbook presented variety <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>content</b> that can build students awareness about the exposure <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> issue in the English textbooks.
