50|$|Older model {{helicopters}} use three independent servos {{to manipulate}} the swashplate. The <b>elevator</b> <b>servo</b> is used to tilt the swashplate forward and aft (longitudinal cyclic), varying the aircraft's pitch. The aileron servo is used to tilt the swashplate left and right (lateral cyclic), varying the aircraft's roll. The collective pitch servo raises and lowers the entire swashplate, varying the collective, and hence the pitch of all the rotor blades collectively. An intermediate mechanical mixing system is used to transfer the control inputs from the servos to the swashplate, therefore the name of mechanical CCPM (mCCPM). This requires an elaborate system of control rods and levers, which often contains many ball bearings.|$|E
50|$|The {{quick access}} {{recorder}} was pioneered by British European Airways (BEA) on its Hawker Siddeley Trident {{aircraft in the}} 1960's as a requirement to prove {{the safety of the}} aircraft's autoland system for certification of the autoland system by the CAA. Quick access recorders are carried by all BEA's successor airline, British Airways (BA), aircraft. Data from the Penny & Giles quick access recorder of a BA Boeing 747-400 London-Bankok flight in which the aircraft suffered un-commanded elevator movement and momentary elevator reversal caused Boeing to implement a change in the <b>elevator</b> <b>servo</b> valve design, a modification that was applied to all Boeing 747's in service, and suspicion of a similar original valve design arising from this BA data was subsequently used by the NTSB in the determining of the causes of the crashes of United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the request}} of the NTSB, data from the Penny & Giles Quick Access Recorder - [...] "QAR" [...] - of a British Airways (BA) Boeing 747-400 London-Bankok flight in which the {{aircraft}} had suffered an un-commanded elevator movement and momentary elevator reversal on take-off, the aircraft then continuing its flight and landing safely, was supplied to the NTSB by BA. Unlike a standard FDR, the QAR sampled control input data at much shorter time intervals, as well as sampling and recording many more other aircraft parameters. This BA data led to renewed suspicion of the similar valve design used on the 737 rudder. As a result of this earlier BA incident Boeing had in fact modified the design of the 747 <b>elevator</b> <b>servo</b> system, and the modified system had been retroactively fitted to all 747-400's in service.|$|E

5000|$|The mixing {{works as}} follows: When {{receiving}} rudder input, the two servos work together, moving both control surfaces {{to the left}} or right, inducing yaw. On <b>elevator</b> input, the <b>servos</b> work opposite, one surface moves to the [...] "left" [...] and the other to the [...] "right" [...] which gives the effect of both moving up and down, causing pitch changes in the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accident}} {{flight was}} the first flight following maintenance that included flight control cable rigging. The flight was also intended to provide cockpit familiarization for the first officer and the pilot observer, and as a training flight for the first officer. About one minute after takeoff, the first officer contacted the tower and stated {{that they needed to}} return to land. The airplane impacted a cornfield about one mile southwest of the approach end of the runway, and 2 minutes 40 seconds after the initiation of the takeoff roll. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) indicated that, during the flight, neither the captain nor the first officer called for the landing gear to be raised, the flaps to be retracted, or the power levers to be reduced from full power. From the time the first officer called [...] "rotate" [...] until the impact, the captain repeated the word [...] "pull" [...] about 27 times. When the observer pilot asked, [...] "Come back on the trim?" [...] the captain responded, [...] "There's nothing anymore on the trim." [...] The inspection of the airplane revealed that the elevator trim cables were rigged improperly, which resulted in the trim cables being reversed. As a result, when the pilot applied nose-up trim, the elevator trim system actually applied nose-down trim. An examination of the maintenance instruction cards used to conduct the last inspection revealed that the inspector's block on numerous checks were not signed off by the Required Inspection Item (RII) inspector. The RII inspector did not sign the item that stated: [...] "Connect <b>elevator</b> <b>servo</b> trim tab cables and rig in accordance with Allison Convair manual...‚Äù The item had been signed off by the mechanic, but not by the RII inspector. The card also contained a NOTE, which stated in bold type, [...] "A complete inspection of all elevator controls must be accomplished and signed off by an RII qualified inspector and a logbook entry made to this effect." [...] The RII inspector block was not signed off.|$|E
40|$|The {{flight of}} a rocket {{vehicle in the}} {{equatorial}} plane of a rotating earth is considered with possible disturbances in the atmosphere due to changes in density, in temperature, and in wind speed. These atmospheric disturbances together with possible deviations in weight and in moment of inertia of the vehicle tend to change the flight path away from the normal flight path. The paper gives the condition for the proper cut-off time for the rocket power, and the proper corrections in the elevator angle so that the vehicle will land at the chosen destination in spite of such disturbances. A scheme of tracking and automatic navigation involving a high-speed computer and <b>elevator</b> <b>servo</b> is suggested for this purpose...|$|E

This paper presents some issues encountered while flight testing a Model Reference Adaptive dynamic inverse controller (MRAC), on a General Aviation (GA) fly-by-wire test bed. Adaptation was replaced with a Modified State Observer (MSO) method which shows promising results in simulation. The flight test results of the MRAC summarized in this paper show PLA surging issues due to adaptation during the commanded flight path angle and airspeed. To overcome this problem, MSO based adaptation methodology is adopted to control the longitudinal dynamics of a typical general aviation aircraft. The advantage of MSO is that it adapts to estimation error, not modeling or tracking error. The controller performance is evaluated for elevator and engine dynamics along with the thrust saturation limits. The elevator model considered in this study deals with a very large delay (200 msec) in the <b>elevator</b> <b>servo.</b> The thrust saturation depends on engine shaft horse power limits that simulate the flight test condition. A controlled flight simulation is carried out including the turbulence effects observed during flight. Controller design using the saturated thrust is used in flight test conditions, where the thrust generated by the engine is not an observable state. The simulation results showing the controller adaptability to flight path angle and airspeed commands are promising. The random PLA surge seen during the simulation and flight test of the baseline MRAC controller is not observed in the simulation results of MSO adaptation controller. Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) Ground Tests and Flight test of MSO based controller is scheduled in the near future. This material is based upon work supported by NASA under award number NNXO 9 AP 20 A...|$|E
5000|$|An {{evolution}} of the C design the E is a new design which incorporates tricycle landing gear, including a fixed, non-steerable nosewheel, but no brakes. Some E models have been flown on floats. The standard engine is a [...] Cuyuna 215R or a Yamaha go-cart engine. The E maintains {{the use of a}} weight-shift sling seat acting on the rudder, although it also acts on the <b>elevator</b> through a <b>servo</b> tab attached to the seat to boost weight-shift control authority.|$|R
50|$|An {{odometer}} {{driven by}} a vane anemometer on the nose determined when the target area had been reached, accurately enough for area bombing. Before launch, the counter was set to a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions. As the missile flew, the airflow turned the propeller, and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted down one number on the counter. This counter triggered the arming of the warhead after about 60 km. When the count reached zero, two detonating bolts were fired. Two spoilers on the elevator were released, the linkage between the <b>elevator</b> and <b>servo</b> was jammed and a guillotine device cut off the control hoses to the rudder servo, setting the rudder in neutral. These actions put the V-1 into a steep dive. While this was originally {{intended to be a}} power dive, in practice the dive caused the fuel flow to cease, which stopped the engine. The sudden silence after the buzzing alerted listeners of the impending impact. The fuel problem was quickly fixed, and when the last V-1s fell, the majority hit with power.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a dynamic wind tunnel flying study of the pitching moment coefficients of the Standard Dynamics Model as a function of angle-of-attack, ranging from about - 10 deg to + 30 deg. The fully instrumented model, with its <b>servoed</b> <b>elevator,</b> has been flown in a single-pitch degree-of-freedom at low speeds under moment trim conditions covering both the stable CG locations of 19. 2 percent, 25 percent, and the unstable CG location of 35 percent of mean aerodynamic chord. In the unstable case an active control law has been invoked to fly the model in an angle of attack control mode. The freely flying model has been disturbed with flight testlike inputs, and the responses have been analyzed to generate the aerodynamic pitching moment coefficients using a maximum likelihood estimation procedure. The analysis includes the closed loop active controlled system parameter estimation and the results are compared with the available SDM pitching moment data...|$|R
5000|$|The {{plane was}} {{conceived}} as a fast light bomber and reconnaissance plane. To obtain high speed and good aerodynamics, it was powered by two M-103 inline engines in tandem in a fuselage nose, driving two contra-rotating coaxial three-blade propellers. The design had quite unusual look, with long fuselage nose and a crew cab moved rearwards, towards double tailfin. Wings had a fighter-like form and their span was rather short. The VVIA under Bolkhovitinov was enlarged to tackle the expected problems {{in the design of}} the Bolkhovitnov S. The rear engine was geared to two high-speed shafts which passed either side of the forward engine to drive the rear propeller gearbox, whilst the forward engine and gearbox drove the forward propeller via shaft through the middle of the rear propeller gearbox. The structure of the S was predominantly light alloy stressed skin, the wing having two spars with heavy flush-rivetted upper and lower skins, and the fuselage built up from pre-formed upper, lower, and side panels attached to four longerons to give a strong but relatively simple structure to build. A total of 29 electrical actuators drove the Fowler Flaps, undercarriage, (rotating 90deg to lie flat in the wing), exit flap of the large common radiator duct, and many other services. The tail unit consisted of twin fins with rudders attached to the tips of the tailplane, variable geared <b>elevators</b> and separate <b>servo</b> and trim tabs on elevators, and rudders. Detail design of the aircraft began in 1937 and construction in July [...] The first prototype S-1 was built in 1939, but it was made in order to evaluate an airframe only and therefore was powered by only one engine M-103. It was unarmed and fitted with a fixed skid landing gear. It first flew on January 29, 1940, with B.N. Kudrin at the controls. A maximum speed was 400 km/h. The second prototype S-2 was powered by two engines and was armed with a single machinegun and bombs. Four 100 kg bombs were carried vertically in a bay between pilot and a rear gunner-navigator, under a common canopy. Its state testing started from March 20, 1940, and lasted until July 1940. A maximum speed reached was 570 km/h (354 mph). The plane had good handling, except for take-off and landing, which were difficult due to high wing loading. Its range and speed were also lower than estimated. As a result, it was decided to improve the plane further. However, the plane was not developed in a favour of next Bolkhovitinov designs.|$|R
