50|$|A <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> pump is {{a device}} to pump highly viscous {{material}} directly from barrels. So it sometimes is called a barrel <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> pump.It is applied in food manufacturing, resin dispensing, gluing and so on.|$|E
50|$|Hardened {{material}} {{on the edge of}} the sealing lip of the <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> can be carried into the material, causing waste of produced parts or process breakdown.|$|E
50|$|The <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> can {{be lowered}} too fast {{in such a}} way, that {{material}} is squeezed out at the side instead of being raised in the center.|$|E
50|$|The pistols are fed using a {{detachable}} steel {{magazine of}} the single position feed type with the cartridges arranged in a staggered column pattern. The magazine’s <b>follower</b> and floor <b>plate</b> are fabricated from polymer. The magazine catch-release {{is located on the}} left side of the frame, directly behind the trigger guard. After expending the last cartridge from the magazine, the pistol’s slide remains locked open on the metal slide stop, located {{on the left side of}} the frame and operated with the thumb.|$|R
5000|$|The Sacred Grove is also {{suggested}} {{as a possible}} site where Smith showed the golden plates to Eight Witnesses in June 1829. Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, said the event took place at a location near the Smith log home [...] "where the Smith family were {{in the habit of}} offering up their secret devotions to God" [...] <b>Followers</b> believe the <b>plates</b> had been taken there by the Angel Moroni, who had buried them there after their abridgement 1,400 years earlier. (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|End {{plates are}} used to contain the needles or bearing axially. On stud style {{followers}} one of the end plates is integrated into the inner race/stud; the other is pressed onto the stud up to a shoulder on the inner race. The inner race is induction hardened so that the stud remains soft if modifications need to be made. On yoke style <b>followers</b> the end <b>plates</b> are peened or pressed onto the inner race or liquid metal injected onto the inner race. The inner race is either induction hardened or through hardened.|$|R
50|$|For highly viscous {{material}} <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> {{pumps are}} connected with an eccentric screw pump or a scooping piston pump. Metering is controlled for mass, time, and volume {{to determine the}} amount of resin dispensed.|$|E

50|$|The {{company also}} {{manufactures}} {{a variety of}} material preparation and feeding systems for liquid and pasty materials, even for such containing highly abrasive fillers. These systems are designed for container sizes ranging from standard cartridges to barrels. A patented vacuum <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> was designed to facilitate the material feed from pails while reducing material waste.|$|E
5000|$|John Bowen {{proposed}} in 1899 a compact [...] "card shuffling machine" [...] where the unshuffled pack was enclosed between two horizontal plates. The principle of this apparatus {{was similar to}} Tingley and Stetson's machine. The top plate could move and was called the <b>follower,</b> the bottom <b>plate</b> was fixed. The operator would press the deck using a vertical handle which {{was connected to the}} follower, and he would turn a crank that activated two rollers which were above and under the deck. In front of the deck, a bar would block most cards except those on top of the pack as well as those at the bottom. The rollers were pressing against the cards and with their respective rotation, would throw them into a receptacle. At each step, cards could come from the top or the bottom of the deck and the number of cards which were ejected was not constant. Variable friction between the rollers and the cards themselves ensured some randomness as in Ranney's machine.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{days after}} leaving Ile-Ife, the plate {{suddenly}} stopped near Olokemeji near present-day Abeokuta. After seventeen days, it began moving again, only {{to stop at}} Oke-Ata for another seventeen days. At the end of seventeen days, the plate began moving again, only to stop again on the southern outskirts of present-day Abeokuta, where it stayed for another seventeen days. At this location, some of Olofin's followers decided to remain, led {{by a man named}} Osho Aro-bi-ologbo-egan. The plate continued downriver, stopping again at Isheri, where it remained for a much longer period of time. Olofin began instructing his followers to begin setting up a permanent settlement, but after 289 days (17 x 17) the plate began moving again. Olofin and a few <b>followers</b> followed the <b>plate,</b> {{while the rest of the}} group stayed behind. After two days the plate stopped briefly at Iddo in Lagos. At Idumota in central Lagos, it whirled around in the water and sank to the bottom. When Olofin returned to his group at Iddo, they are said to have asked him where the plate was. He answered [...] "Awo Ti Ri" [...] meaning [...] "The plate has sunk". This is how the name Awori is said to have come into being.|$|R
5000|$|The Awori whose {{ancestral home}} is Isheri-Olofin were in Lagos before the Benin {{invasion}} as propounded by the Olofin Adimula of Orile Isheri {{and supported by}} other Awori groups such as Apa, Ilogbo-Eremi, Ibereko, Oto, Ota, Ado-Odo and Igbesa. Post-independence political creation of States however saw the dispersal of the homogenous clan scattered around the present Ogun and Lagos State.Journey From Ile-IfeOlofin and his followers left the palace of Oduduwa in Ile-Ife and migrated southward along a river. Oduduwa had given Olofin a mud plate and instructed him to {{place it on the}} water and follow it until it sank into the river. The plate is said to have stopped at various locations and finally sank at Idumota in the present day Lagos State in Nigeria. As they were to settle wherever it sank, the people were filled with joy when this finally happened. The name AWORI, translates as [...] "The plate sank". It was adopted as the clan’s name till today.Several days after leaving Ile-Ife, the plate suddenly stopped near Olokemeji, near the present day Abeokuta. After seventeen days, it began moving again, only to stop at Oke Ata, for another seventeen days.

50|$|In {{the paper}} Rotter details the {{problems}} related to variations in drum height and width and the effect on pump tube length as well as drum cover, <b>follower</b> <b>plate</b> and pressure primer design. He details the benefits to lubricant manufacturers and customers in inventory handling and cost savings. And he calls for a joint effort by N.L.G.I., petroleum industry groups, the American Standards Association and the National Bureau of Standards {{to solve the problem}} of inconsistent lubricant packaging.|$|E
50|$|If an {{ordinary}} intake socket is lowered into highly viscous material, the material will flow so slowly, that after short time, the pump will soak up air, because the socket {{is not fully}} covered by the material anymore. To avoid that, a plate, closing tight {{to the wall of}} the barrel by a soft sealing lip, is put on top of the material in the barrel. This plate is lowered slowly so that the material rises {{through a hole in the}} center of the plate into the intake socket. The pumped amount and the amount lifted through the plate have to be precisely the same. This must be ensured by appropriate control of the <b>follower</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
