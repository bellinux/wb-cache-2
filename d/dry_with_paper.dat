40|$|Hand washing is {{when you}} wet your hands under warm water, add soap and rub hands {{together}} for 20 seconds or longer, rinse, <b>dry</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> towel, and finally turn off running water with that paper towel you just dried your hands off with. Hand washing is something that helps {{prevent the spread of}} germs that lead to illness. This is a health problem that could anywhere and everywhere in the community, but I specifically looked into the Paducah-Murray regional campus. Photovoice is a process where members of a community take pictures that give some insight on what they believe are community needs and assets. The first photo I took was of a sign that explained when and how to wash your hands. It is hanging {{on the back of the}} bathroom door on campus. The second picture I took was of the black intercom that sits on the desks for students to hold down to be able to communicate with other students and the teacher at other campuses. In Paducah, and in most places, you will more than likely see signs in the bathrooms of different places reminding people to wash their hands. It is something you may see by sinks in a workplace, as well. I imagine preschool and elementary teachers are advocates of teaching this habit. It’s good to start introducing hand washing at an early age and how important it is. You can have them do creative things like singing, get fun shaped soaps, or foam soaps. With the older generation, it is best to get more serious, maybe by showing a documentary on the diseases that could happen. Hand washing is something that helps prevents sickness, stops the spread of germs, and by doing this one simple task, it will be beneficial in the long run. Doyle, E. I., Ward, S.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{compared}} the cleaning efficiency of Mtwo, Race and Medin Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments. Materials and Methods: Sixty mandibular molar mesial roots were selected with angle curvatures between 25 - 35 degrees and {{divided into three}} groups; each containing 20 teeth. Canals were prepared with the rotary files and irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCl solution after each instrument. Total of 5 mL of normal saline {{was used as the}} final rinse; subsequently the canals were <b>dried</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> points. The amount of debris and smear layer in three parts of the root canal walls was evaluated using SEM and the data were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The results for remnant debris in the coronal part of root canals were similar, whereas in the middle third, Mtwo instruments achieved significantly better results compared to Race and Medin instruments. In the apical third of the root canals more debris was created by Race instruments. Conclusion: Overall, Mtwo instruments had greater success in producing clean canals...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{the risk}} of filling {{material}} extrusion throughout the apex, a satisfactory apical seal {{can be difficult to}} achieve in canals with open apices or iatrogenic enlargements of the apical constriction. These situations pose a challenge to root canal filling. This paper describes the root canal filling of a maxillary right canine with an overinstrumented apex, complete loss of the apical stop, extensive canal transportation and apical periodontitis. A 5 mm calcium hydroxide apical plug was placed before root canal filling. The plug was made by soaking <b>paper</b> points <b>with</b> saline, dipping the points in calcium hydroxide powder and then applying it to the apex several times, until a consistent apical plug was obtained. The canal was then irrigated with saline in order to remove any residual calcium hydroxide from the root canal walls, <b>dried</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> points and obturated with an inverted # 80 gutta-percha cone and zinc oxide-eugenol based sealer by the lateral condensation technique.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{evaluate}} the influence of the substance used as root canal lubricant during relining and the cleaning protocol on the bond strength of relined posts to root dentin. Eighty single canal mandibular bovine incisors were used in the study. The root canals were endodontically treated and allocated into four groups (n =  20) according to the lubricant material and the root canal cleaning protocol: petroleum jelly/no cleaning; petroleum jelly/cleaning <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> points; hydrosoluble gel/no cleaning; hydrosoluble gel/water rinse and <b>drying</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> points. All posts were relined with resin composite and luted to the root canals with regular resin cement. Specimens were cross-sectioned to obtain root slices producing 1.5  mm thick slices. The push-out test was performed at a crosshead speed of 0.5  mm/min until post dislodgement occurred. The failure mode was verified using a stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (push-out) with α =  0.05. A statistically significant difference was found considering the type of lubricant (p <  0.001). The hydrosoluble gel/water rinse group showed the highest mean bond strength value (11.0  ±  3.7  MPa). The most frequent pattern of failure was adhesive between the root canal walls and resin cement. The use of a hydrosoluble gel as lubricant substance seems to be adequate for the relining post technique.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} blood contamination and different decontamination procedures on marginal adaptation and bond strength of a two-step total-etch adhesive system to dentin. Methods: A total of 135 bovine incisors had the labial surfaces ground to receive cylindrical cavities, and were randomly divided into a control and 8 experimental groups (n= 15) according to contamination and decontamination procedures. Freshly collected human blood was applied onto the cavity either before or after light-curing of the adhesive. Four decontamination protocols were tested (<b>drying</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper,</b> water rinsing, phosphoric acid etching, and 10 % NaOCl rinsing). The cavities were restored with Adper Single Bond and Filtek Z 250 (3 M ESPE). The specimens were subjected to thermal cycling before the dye staining test. The cavity floor was removed and the restorations were subjected to a push-out test. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey???s test (??= 0. 05). Results: Blood contamination after adhesive light-curing increased marginal gap and yielded lower push-out bond strength values (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Water rinsing {{seems to be a}} reliable procedure for cavity decontamination. The decontamination procedures tested do not recover marginal sealing and bond strength when blood contamination occurs after light-curing of the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of root canal dimensions, type of needle, and injection rate on the apical extrusion of an irrigant in a simulated root canal. Methods: Ten students used two types of 28 -gauge needles, to deliver 3 mL irrigant solution into artificial canals prepared in acrylic blocks to a standard size of ISO 25, 30, or 40 (0. 06 taper; n = 10). Each block was preweighed to the nearest microgram before and after irrigation once the canal was <b>dried</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> points. This was repeated with a syringe pump at a flow rate of 50, 100, 200 or 300 lL/s with the needle inserted to a standard depth. Results: Significant differences were observed between the side-vented and notched-end needles when the rate of irrigation was higher than 100 lL/s, and when the apical size was below ISO 40 (P < 0. 001). The amount of extrusion was more variable and significantly higher when irrigation was performed manually, compared with the syringe pump groups. Conclusions: Injection rates above 100 lL/s increased the risk of extrusion, whereas increasing the apical canal size to ISO 40 reduced the amount of extrusion in all groups. The use of a side-vented needle negates the injectionrate effects...|$|R

Three millimeters of gray mineral trioxide aggregate was placed directly over the platelet-rich plasma clot. Three days later, the tooth was double-sealed with permanent filling materials. Results: Clinical examination revealed no sensitivity to percussion or palpation tests. Radiograph revealed continued thickening of the dentinal walls, root lengthening, regression of the peri-apical lesion and apical closure. Both the roots showed complete apical closure at the 10 -month follow-up. However, the teeth were not responsive to electric pulp test.
