Large-sized, well-oriented lamellar microstructures of PS-PLLA thin films were produced for both samples by using the crystallizable solvents: benzoic acid (BA) and hexamethylbenzene (HMB). In strongly segregated (high Mn) PS-PLLA, the oriented microstructures were obtained through the PS-PLLA microphase separation due to directional crystallization of crystallizable solvents at the eutectic point (<b>directional</b> eutectic <b>solidification)</b> regardless of the PLLA crystallization.

In weakly segregated (low Mn) PS-PLLA, the oriented microstructures were formed through the directional crystallization of PLLA on the substrates (crystallization-induced orientation) regardless of the <b>directional</b> eutectic <b>solidification</b> and lattice matching. Two mechanisms: of <b>directional</b> eutectic <b>solidification</b> and of crystallization-induced oriented microstructure have thus been identified.

Cubic αc-AlFeSi and β-AlFeSi were always present in the alloy, but Al 13 Fe 4 was only observed at 5 mm/min and monoclinic αT-AlFeSi at 80 mm/min. Cubic αc-AlFeSi was observed to {{have a variety of}} morphologies resulting from flexibility in its growth mechanisms. β-AlFeSi with twins and faults showed strongly anisotropic growth by steps, resulting in its platelet morphology.

The behavior presented by the Al- 5. 5 wt. %Sn alloy during solidification was similar to that of other aluminum alloys, i. e., the dendritic network became coarser with decreasing cooling rates, indicating that the immiscibility between aluminum and tin does not have a significant effect on the relationship between primary dendritic arm spacing and the cooling rate.

In this paper Al-Fe binary alloys was chosen for this study. This binary system shows the miscibility gap at specified concentration and temperature. The electrolytic grade iron powder of 300 mesh size was dispersed in the melt of commercially pure aluminum. The iron content in the composite varied from 1. 67 to 11. 2 wt%. Experimental quantitative expressions, which correlate UTS, yield tensile strength, elongation, wear volume and frictional coefficients to the presence of iron in the matrix, have been determined. The presence of iron in the composite improved the ultimate tensile strength, 0. 2 % proof stress and the hardness. The ductility showed the adverse effect with increase of the iron content in the matrix.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} methods in which anisotropy could be induced in fine-grained alloys. We have identified two general processing routes to creating a fine, textured microstructure: form an amorphous precursor and devitrify {{in a manner that}} induces texture or form the fine, textured microstructure upon cooling directly from the liquid state. Since it is possible to form significant amounts of amorphous material in RE-Fe-B alloys, texture could be induced through biasing the orientationof the crystallites upon crystallization of the amorphous material. One method of creating this bias is to form glassy material and apply uniaxial pressure during crystallization. Experiments on this are presented. All of the work presented here utilizes melt-spinning, either to create precursor material, or to achieve a desired final microstructure. To obtain greater control of the system to process these materials, a study was done on the effects of heating the wheel and modifying the wheel’s surface finish on glass formation and phase selection. The second general approach—creating the desired microstructure directly from the liquid—can be done through <b>directional</b> rapid <b>solidification.</b> In particular, alloys melt-spun at low tangential wheel speeds often display directional columnar growth through a portion of the ribbon. By refining and stabilizing the columnar growth, a highly textured fine microstructure is achieved.

50|$|Risers, {{also known}} as feeders, {{are the most common}} way of {{providing}} <b>directional</b> <b>solidification.</b> It supplies liquid metal to the solidifying casting to compensate for solidification shrinkage. For a riser to work properly the riser must solidify after the casting, otherwise it cannot supply liquid metal to shrinkage within the casting. Risers add cost to the casting because it lowers the yield of each casting; i.e. more metal is lost as scrap for each casting. Another way to promote <b>directional</b> <b>solidification</b> is by adding chills to the mold.

40|$|Abstract. Upward <b>directional</b> {{transient}} <b>solidification</b> {{experiments have}} been carried out with an Al- 1. 0 wt%Fe alloy. Tensile tests were carried out with samples collected along the casting length and these results have been correlated with measured cell spacings, since cellular growth has prevailed along the directionally solidified casting. The resulting mechanical properties include ultimate tensile strength, yield tensile strength and elongation. The used casting assembly was designed {{in such a way that}} the heat was extracted only through the water-cooled system at bottom of the casting. During non-equilibrium solidification, typical of DC (direct chill) castings, different cooling rates occur from the casting cooled surface up to the top of the casting, causing the formation of metastable intermetallic phases (AlmFe, Al 6 Fe, etc) in addition to the stable Al 3 Fe phase. The extensive presence of plate-like Al 3 Fe phase in the as-cast structure adversely influences the mechanical properties of Al-Fe alloys, since this morphology is more likely to induce microcracks than the fibrous Al 6 Fe phase. In order to permit an appropriate characterization of these intermetallic phases, they were extracted from the aluminum-rich matrix by using a dissolution technique. These phases were then investigated by optical microscopy and SEM techniques. It was found that the ultimate tensile strength, the yield strength and the elongation increase with decreasing cell spacing and experimental laws correlating cell spacing and these mechanical properties have been established...|$|R

The thermal profile around the melt pool was modeled using a pragmatic model for SLM. Furthermore, rotation of the scanning direction between different layers was seen to promote the competitive growth. As a result, the texture strength increased to as large as 4. 7 for rotating the scanning direction 90 ° every layer. By comparison of the yield strength measured by compression tests in different orientations and the averaged Taylor factor calculated using the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model, it was found that both the morphological and crystallographic texture observed in SLM Ta contribute to yield strength anisotropy. status: publishe...|$|R
