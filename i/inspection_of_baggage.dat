40|$|Increasing {{requirements}} for technical parameters of inspection digital radiography systems {{are caused by}} increasing incidences of terrorism, drug trafficking and explosives via variety of transport. These requirements have determined research for new technical solutions that enable {{to ensure the safety}} of passengers and cargos in real-time. The main efforts in the analyzed method of testing are aimed at the creation of new and modernization of operated now systems of digital radiography as a whole and their main components and elements in particular. The number of these main components and elements includes sources of X-ray recording systems and transformation of radiometric information as well as algorithms and software that implements these algorithms for processing, visualization and results interpretation of inspection. Recent developments of X-ray units and betatrons used for inspection of small- and large-sized objects that are made from different materials are deserve special attention. The most effective X-ray detectors are a line and a radiometric detector matrix based on various scintillators. The most promising methods among the algorithms of material identification of testing objects are dual-energy methods. The article describes various models of digital radiography systems applied in Russia and abroad to <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>baggage,</b> containers, vehicles and large trucks...|$|E
40|$|Sensors {{used for}} Security {{purposes}} {{have to cover}} the non-invasive <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> persons, <b>baggage</b> and letters with the aim to detect weapons, explosives and chemical or biological threat material. Currently, {{emphasis is placed on}} system concepts and technologies for this type of applications, employing millimeterwave-, submillimeterwave- and terahertz sensors. This is based on the capability of these frequency bands to look through textiles and the possibility to achieve a geometric resolution which is sufficient to resolve critical items within the necessary range. Using multiple frequencies promises to give more detailed information about the structure of the observed objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of passive millimeter- and submillimeterwave sensors which depend on indirect illumination, systems using miniaturized mmw-radar modules are applied as well. This paper describes two approaches for the detection of concealed weapons, the first using a millimeterwave radiometer on a scanner and the second employing a miniaturized radar module based on a synthetic aperture method...|$|R
