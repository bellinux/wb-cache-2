40|$|Purpose – The {{emerging}} {{perspectives of}} entrepreneurial ecosystems, bricolage and effectuationhighlight {{the interaction between}} the entrepreneur and the surrounding community, and its potentialfor creative resource acquisition and utilization. However, empirical work on how this process actuallyunfolds remains scarce. This paper aims to study {{the interaction between the}} opportunity constructionprocess and the development of resources in the surrounding ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a qualitative analysis of the extreme case of AaltoEntrepreneurship Society (Aaltoes), a newly founded organization successfully promotingentrepreneurship within a university merger with virtually no resources, based on interviews of six keycontributors and four stakeholder organisations. Findings – The opportunity construction process both supported and was supported by two keyresource generating mechanisms. Formulating and opportunistically reformulating the agenda forincreasing potential synergy laid the groundwork for mutual benefit. Proactive concretization enhancedboth initial resource allocation and sustaining input to the process through offering tangible instancesof specific opportunities and feedback. Research limitations/implications – Although based on a single case study in a university setting,proactive concretization emerges as a promising direction for further investigations of the benefits anddynamics of entrepreneur– <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction</b> in the opportunity construction process. Practical implications – Intentionally creating beneficial entrepreneur– <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction</b> andteaching proactive concretization becomes a key goal for educators of entrepreneurship. Originality/value – The paper extends an understanding of creative resource generation and utilizationin the opportunity construction process. The role of proactive concretization was emphasized in theinteraction of the entrepreneur and the ecosystem, creating virtuous spirals of entrepreneurial activity. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Stock conditions, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction,</b> technological specification, and relative prices under which at-sea discards are acute are identified. A dynamic model is developed to balance ecological interdependencies among multiple fish species, and scope economies implicit in a costly targeting technology. Three regulatory regimes, species-specific harvest quotas, landing taxes, and revenue quotas, are contrasted against a hypothetical sole-owner problem. An optimal plan under all regimes precludes discarding. For both very low and very high levels of targeting costs, first best welfare is close to that achieved through any of the regulatory regimes. In general, however, landing taxes welfare dominate species-specific quota regulation; a revenue quota fares the worst.

40|$|A {{complicated}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction</b> is impacting South African abalone Haliotis midae {{and rock}} lobsters Jasus lalandii along the East of Hangklip (EoH) coastline. The lobsters have dramatically reduced sea urchin Parechinus angulosus populations, thereby indirectly negatively impacting juvenile abalone, which {{rely on the}} urchins for shelter. This ecosystem change effect is incorporated in the spatial and age-structured assessment model for abalone, with model projections predicting steep declines in abalone spawning biomass in the lobster-infected areas. In practice, multi-species considerations have been incorporated in an ad hoc manner only in the assessment, because of the difficulties both in the conceptualisation and parameterisation of a more complicated multi-species model capable of explicitly representing the various interactions. However, a preliminary abaloneurchin-lobster multi-species model has been developed {{as a first step}} to explore the problem, to investigate the data needs and to test the potential sensitivity of model results to the choice of parameter values.

40|$|Referring to a {{workshop}} activity {{held at the}} Civic Museum of Zoology in Rome, {{in this article is}} discussed the implementation of the constructivist paradigm to a situation of non-formal education. The "Hall of Biodiversity" in the Museum is an ideal context in which to develop a discussion on the concept of biodiversity and its mental representations for the non-specialist audiences; the participants in the debate come from different organizations involved in the field of environmental education to children and adults. Starting from the sharing of personal experiences, first of all are explored the relationships between the impact of the place where people spend their lives (urban vs. rural) and the construction of the awareness about the environmental goods care, one of the steps that the group believes essential for a deep understanding of the concept of biodiversity. The discussion then develops considering the concepts of species, <b>ecosystem,</b> <b>interaction</b> and balance, frequently emerged from the shared experiences; they could be a guiding thread of a possible path of non-formal education. The educational process could develop by observing the increasing frequency of natural catastrophes that the public is not able to relate with the changes of the balance between the different components of ecosystems. In this way the group agrees that people could better understand the impact of man on nature, often supported by economic interests. In a widespread lack of accredited training opportunities form teacheres and educators, the awareness of the role played by the media in the distribution of an often biased information reinforces the need to undertake educational programs that offer broader and more integrated vision of environmental problems. This is even more urgent given the growing centrality of the concepts of uncertainty and complexity in the search for solutions to the problems associated with sustainable development. Transdisciplinarity and participation seem to be the best road to introduce actions for democracy and active citizenship; these actions reproduce the reciprocity of the relationship between different components of a system as one of the fundamental characteristics of the concept of biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|In the 1990 s the Dutch {{government}} {{expressed the}} need to investigate the impacts of diffuse pollution at (sub) -ecosystem levels. The resulting Netherlands Stimulation Programme on System-oriented Ecotoxicological Research (SSEO programme) ran from 1998 to 2006. Its primary objective {{was to assess the}} impacts of low- to medium-level, diffuse, multiple contaminations on ecosystems. The research results were intended as underpinning for policies on environmental, conservation and nature issues. Research was carried out at three sites that were selected because of their importance for nature management and the presence of diffuse contamination. These sites were: a river meadow/floodplain area (Afferdensche en Deestsche Waarden), an estuarine reed-land area (Biesbosch) and an area of lowland peat soils that had been contaminated with urban waste in past centuries (De Ronde Venen). This introductory paper describes the set-up of the programme, the types of diffuse contamination, the interactions between pollutants and other stress factors, the various methodologies used to integrate the effects on (sub) ecosystem level, and the consequences for formulating policies for and the management of these types of locations. The results of the programme are diverse and complicated and show {{how difficult it is to}} draw firm, unambiguous, generic conclusions about the effects at the 'total' ecosystem level. It is however, possible to draw conclusions about effects on major components of ecosystems:-The distribution of contaminants, both from a spatial, chemical and ecotoxicological point of view, plays a decisive role in actual effect levels. Even when total contaminant loads are high, such as in estuarine and floodplain areas, bioavailability may be so low that the actual effects are limited. The irregular, heterogeneous, spatial distribution of contaminants in the soil further complicates effect studies, impact assessments and monitoring. -Various stress factors, other than contaminants, both natural and anthropogenic, also play a role. The negative effect of the repeated inundation of floodplain areas, for instance, greatly interferes with the impact of contaminants in the lower soil layers. -A major problem is to find a method to extrapolate the observations from individual and population levels to the ecosystem level. In addition to traditional food-chain models and similar approaches, the potential of other, not yet extensively explored, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction</b> mechanisms is discussed. -Finally, the results have to be interpreted from a policy point of view, both for national soil policies and for implementing the EU Soil Strategy regulations. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Spring {{temperatures}} {{have increased}} over the past 25 years, to which {{a wide variety of}} organisms have responded. The outstanding question is whether these responses match the temperature-induced shift of the selection pressures acting on these organisms. Organisms have evolved response mechanisms that are only adaptive given the existing relationship between the cues organisms use and the selection pressures acting on them. Global warming may disrupt <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interactions</b> because it alters these relationships and micro-evolution may be slow in tracking these changes. In particular, such shifts have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning for the tight multitrophic interactions involved in the timing of reproduction and growth. We determined the response of winter moth (Operophtera brumata) egg hatching and oak (Quercus robur) bud burst to temperature, a system with strong selection on synchronization. We show that there has been poor synchrony in recent warm springs, which is due to an increase in spring temperatures without a decrease in the incidence of freezing spells in winter.

40|$|The Coniferous Forest Biome was {{initially}} funded in 1970 by the National Science Foundation as a large-scale, interdisciplinary, interinstitutional research program to study coniferous forest and associated aquatic ecosystems. It was initiated {{as one of}} the Integrated Research Programs in the Ecosystem Analysis Section of the U. S. /International Biological Program (US/IBP). The IBP was generated in response to a need to solve the major problems confronting mankind: rapidly increasing population, food and fiber shortages, and environmental degradation. Its major theme was "determination of the biological basis for productivity and human welfare. " The US/IBP is sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council and terminates on 30 June 1974. This proposal requests continued support in the post-IBP period from 1 January 1975 to 31 December 1977. Our initial proposals were developed around the need for developing new approaches and theory in ecology and concentrated on integrating knowledge of the structure and function of selected terrestrial and linked aquatic ecosystems. Development of ecosystem theory is needed to forward basic ecological science and for practical land management purposes. This proposal emphasizes further extension of Biome research in space and time dimensions from the data base and theoretical understanding of coniferous forest ecosystems gained to date. This will be accomplished through studies that will be conducted at the stand, watershed, regional, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction,</b> lake and stream integration levels. Modeling will be used as an integrating mechanism at each of the levels. The proposal is presented in three volumes. Volume 1 (parts 1 and 2) describes our research rationale, our proposed research in relation to our findings, research management, application of Biome results, budgets, and project summaries. Volume 2 (parts 3 - 5) represents an initial synthesis of program results to date. Part 3 describes the structure and dynamics of natural coniferous ecosystems in the Biome with emphasis on the Douglas-fir region. Modeling has been used as our major integrating mechanism. Part 4 is devoted to discussion of what we have learned about integrating ecosystem studies through modeling. We have just initiated studies on the behavior of stressed (e. g., insect defoliated) and manipulated (e. g., fertilized) ecosystems, and the preliminary information we have gained in this area is presented in part 5. In this discussion our findings are compared with the findings of other researchers where possible. There are many gaps in our knowledge of the effects of stress and manipulation on coniferous forest ecosystems, and as a result we have proposed research in that area. Volume 3 consists of the Appendix (part 6), which includes a list of Biome publications (contributions, bulletins, and internal reports), a section on model documentation, and curriculum vitae. The section on model documentation is particularly important since it provides a framework for evaluating complicated models by biologists and modelers alike...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation {{sets out to}} answer the following question: How is a woman’s maternal identity constructed when her child lives with the father? The answer is sought by examining the life stories recounted in oral interviews with 18 women and the memories recorded by three women in a group. As the dissertation is related to the discipline of social work and feminist research, it also has the emancipatory dimension of reconstructing women’s socio-cultural status. From the theoretical perspective, the dissertation is based on the hermeneutic, phenomenological and narrative approaches. The hermeneutic-phenomenological approach connects the dissertation to an understanding and interpretative research paradigm which seeks the meanings of individual experiences, while narrativity is manifested in the effort {{to understand the nature of}} the corpus used in the dissertation. The technique of close reading is used to analyse the dissertation corpus. In close reading, new thematic contents and interpretations are sought and found by reading transcribed texts and listening to recordings several times. As a starting point for the analysis, the concept of identity is understood as constructed through social interaction. Underlying this view is the notion that human beings are holistic entities, in which corporeality, consciousness and situationality are simultaneously present. The concept of identity is seen as a social construct and, accordingly, humans are understood as active corporeal beings functioning in an extensive <b>ecosystem.</b> <b>Interaction</b> between humans and their living environment is manifested in three types of relations: relations that alter reality, that is, interaction with the material environment, relations that are based on symbolic communication, and power relations. The analysis and reporting are founded on the concept of space, which is manifested in the corpus as concrete, mental or abstract and metaphorical space. The construction of identity is perceived as taking place in spatial dimensions which are simultaneously present. These dimensions may be defined as cultural space which assumes mythical features, relational space based on human interaction, the home as an experiential and lived space, reflective space based on current and future definitions of the self, and the space of moral emotions. The maternal identity of women living apart from their children is constructed in a contradictory space. The women consider themselves as good mothers. They construct their maternal identity according to the ethics of concern, responsibility and care. However, the women are discredited in their own communities and stigmatised for abandoning their children. In reality, most of the mothers have had to accept (in some cases voluntarily) a solution they would rather have rejected. In the course of the research, the relationship with the children’s father emerged as an important element in the construction of maternal identity. Most of the women have had a violent spouse, who has controlled the family home and limited the mother’s space. However, a close connection with the child after the parents’ separation aids in constructing a positive maternal identity despite the guilt felt by the women because they cannot look after their children’s everyday needs. The mothers interviewed for this dissertation construct their identity in the paradoxical space of strength and fragility. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the study of lagoon <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction</b> and adjustment of the lagoon floor morphologies, water dynamics and sequences of change involving the motion of sediment. The aim of the study is to implement a functional mechanism to evaluate and analyse changes in the Lagos Lagoon and its ecosystem, with the objectives: (i) to investigate the extent and impact of urban expansion on the Lagoon coastline and its ecosystem; (ii) to quantify changes in the spatial extent of mangroves by use of satellite images from 1984 to 2016; (iii) to investigate the spatial dynamics of the Lagoon water floor and estimate its flushing time, (iv) to investigate the behaviour and relationship pattern of the Lagoon hydrodynamic parameters;, (v) to collect sediment samples from the Lagoon, analyse their settling behaviour and particle size distribution (PSD) in order to study their spatial evolution and characterisation; and (vi) to initiate a model that can predict the influence of sea level rise on the Lagoon ecosystem. The existing problem of an overcrowded human population in Lagos, the incessant repository of industrial effluence into its Lagoon, and increased flooding from the immediate watershed generate the research questions for this thesis. Lack of studies in the areas of morphodynamics and hydrodynamics on the Lagoon is a gap in the body of coastal knowledge, especially the temporal and long term dynamics of a significant Lagoon like that of Lagos. Understanding the dynamics of the Lagoon will enhance efficient monitoring, sustainable management and hence reveal the great importance the Lagoon preserves for the coastal region. Landsat images (1984 – 2016) of the study area (Lagos Lagoon) and its ecosystem were obtained for some specific data derivations. Land Surface Temperature (LST), NDVI and delineated Lagoon coastline were derived from the images. An Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) and a Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to extract land classification information, likewise, the GIS was used to develop a model for investigating the Lagoon coastline changes. With the use of ENVI and GIS software, land classification types were derived with the percentage of the coverage area for each land use classification for the years of study. A novel empirical method was designed to collect in-situ hydrodynamic data for both the dry and wet seasons in 2014, this was correlated and analysed using a case study approach. Also, in-situ bathymetric data was collected in 2014 to join the 2008 available data for studying the changes in the Lagoon water bed morphology. Functional models were used to examine the interaction of the various hydrodynamic information that was studied on the Lagoon. Results and inferences from the study show that the wetland of the system is depleting rapidly with increase urbanisation. In both lateral and vertical directions, the morphological shape of the Lagoon is reducing both in size and depth. The result from the model that investigated the system coastline indicates that reclamation and recession are taking place on the Lagoon coast at an approximate ratio of 4 to 1 whereas, the total surface area has reduced to approximately 204. 51 km 2 as opposed to its approximate area of 208 km 2 as at the year 2010. The results from the analysis of the Lagoon salinity implies a wide salinity variation between the dry and the wet season; this confirms the system as brackish water in the dry season and freshwater in the wet season. Other inferences reveal the critical point of well-mixed water mass, significant vertical mixing during the wet season and a stable state during the dry season. In overview, the ratio of the Lagoon stratification during the dry season to that of the wet season is approximately 1 to 7 and flushing time of approximately 26 days and 22 days respectively. Lastly, the Lagoon possesses a varying settling velocity that is uniquely related to the diameter of its particles at various spatial locations. This research has been able to provide baseline investigations concerning the morphology and hydrodynamic study of the Lagos Lagoon.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 The natural {{composition}} of terrestrial ecosystems can {{be shaped by}} climate {{to take advantage of}} local environmental conditions. Ecosystem functioning, e. g. interaction between photosynthesis and temperature, can also acclimate to different climatological states. The combination of these two factors thus determines ecological-climate interactions. The ecosystem functioning also {{plays a key role in}} predicting the carbon cycle, hydrological cycle, terrestrial surface energy balance, and the feedbacks in the climate system. Predicting the response of the Earth's biosphere to global warming requires the ability to mechanistically represent the processes controlling ecosystem functioning through photosynthesis, respiration, and water use. The physical environment in a place shapes the vegetation there, but vegetation also has the potential to shape the environment, e. g. increased photosynthesis and transpiration moisten the atmosphere. These two-way ecoclimate interactions create the potential for feedbacks between vegetation at the physical environment that depend on the vegetation and the climate of a place, and can change throughout the year. In Chapter 1, we derive a global empirical map of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate using the response of satellite-observed greenness to interannual variations in temperature and precipitation. We infer mechanisms constraining ecosystem functioning by analyzing how the sensitivity of vegetation to climate varies across climate space. Our analysis yields empirical evidence for multiple physical and biological mediators of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate at large spatial scales. In hot and wet locations, vegetation is greener in warmer years despite temperatures likely exceeding thermally optimum conditions. However, sunlight generally increases during warmer years, suggesting that the increased stress from higher atmospheric water demand is offset by higher rates of photosynthesis. The sensitivity of vegetation transitions in sign (greener when warmer or drier to greener when cooler or wetter) along an emergent line in climate space with a slope of about 59 mm/yr/C, twice as steep as contours of aridity. The mismatch between these slopes is evidence at a global scale of the limitation of both water supply due to inefficiencies in plant access to rainfall, and plant physiological responses to atmospheric water demand. This empirical pattern can provide a functional constraint for process-based models, helping to improve predictions of the global-scale response of vegetation to a changing climate. In Chapter 2, we use observations of vegetation interaction with the physical environment to identify where ecosystem functioning is well simulated in an ensemble of Earth system models. We leverage this data-model comparison to hypothesize which physiological mechanisms - photosynthetic efficiency, respiration, water supply, atmospheric water demand, and sunlight availability - dominate the ecosystem response in places with different climates. The models are generally successful in reproducing the broad sign and shape of ecosystem function across climate space except for simulating generally lower leaf area during warmer years in places with hot wet climates. In addition, simulated <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interaction</b> with temperature is generally larger and changes more rapidly across a gradient of temperature than is observed. We hypothesize that the amplified interaction and change are both due to a lack of adaptation and acclimation in simulations. This discrepancy with observations suggests that simulated responses of vegetation to global warming, and feedbacks between vegetation and climate, are too strong in the models. Finally, models and observations share an abrupt threshold between dry regions and wet regions where strong positive vegetation response to precipitation falls to nearly zero in places receiving around 1000 mm/year. In Chapter 3, we investigate how ecoclimate interactions change across seasons in the Amazon basin. We use observations of solar induced fluorescence from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO 2) to statistically analyze the sensitivity of fluorescence to synoptic variations in temperature and precipitation. In addition to studying the sensitivity of vegetation to climate across seasons, we use OCO 2 measurements of total column water vapor (TCWV) and CO 2 concentration (XCO 2) to investigate the influence of the Amazon basin vegetation on the CO 2 concentration and water vapor of the atmosphere leaving the basin. Our analysis determines the seasonal importance of vegetation activity on the outflow of CO 2 from the Amazon basin, while providing evidence that transpiration is primarily driven by variations in temperature during the dry season, rather than photosynthesis. We establish a statistical relationship between fluorescence (as a proxy for vegetation photosynthesis), temperature, and precipitation, as well as the difference between the outflow of atmospheric water vapor from the inflow water vapor, basin fluorescence, temperature, and precipitation...|$|E

40|$|For decades, fish {{recruitment}} {{has been}} a subject of intensive research with stock–recruitment models commonly used for recruitment prediction often only explaining {{a small fraction of}} the inter-annual recruitment variation. The use of environmental information to improve our ability to predict recruitment, could contribute considerably to fisheries management. However, the problem remains difficult because the mechanisms behind such complex relationships are often poorly understood; this in turn, makes it difficult to determine the forecast estimation robustness, leading to the failure of some relationships when new data become available. The utility of machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) for solving complex problems has been demonstrated in aquatic studies and has led many researchers to advocate ANNs as an attractive, non-linear alternative to traditional statistical methods. The goal of this study is to design a Baltic cod recruitment model (FishANN) that can account for complex <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interactions.</b> To this end, we (1) build a quantitative model representation of the conceptual understanding of the complex <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interactions</b> driving Baltic cod recruitment dynamics, and (2) apply the model to strengthen the current capability to project future changes in Baltic cod recruitment.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{basis of}} prey capture by scyphomedusae {{has been largely}} ignored, despite {{the importance of these}} predators in a variety of planktonic <b>ecosystems.</b> <b>Interactions</b> between swimming, fluid motions, and prey capture were examined during 1991 – 1992 for a species from the three scyphozoan orders having planktonic medusae: Rhizostomeae, Stomolophus meleagris Agassiz, 1862; Coronatae, Linuche unguiculata (Schwartz, 1788); and Semaeostomeae, Cyanea capillata (Linnaeus, 1758). All three species used flow created during bell pulsation to capture prey, but the type of flow used for prey capture and the capture surface morphology were different for each species. The mechanics of capture by these species of diverse morphology and taxonomic affinity suggests that the use of bell pulsation-induced flow for prey entrainment and capture is widespread among the scyphomedusae...|$|R

40|$|A few summary {{points are}} listed below and {{expanded}} {{in the accompanying}} talk to summarise some recent developments concerning fisheries ecosystem modelling {{and its role in}} providing management advice. As has been the convention at several recent international workshops, the term fisheries ecosystem model here broadly refers to all fisheries models that include more than a single species, given that multi-species models are often a first step towards a broader ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) (FAO 2003). The first document is a detailed technical report that consolidates, classifies and compares the range of ecosystem models currently in existence (Plagányi 2007). This report served as the background document for a FAO Workshop on Modelling <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>Interactions</b> for Informing an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries: Best Practices in Ecosystem Modelling (Italy 3 - 6 July 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} human-environment (ecosystems) interactions—ecosystems (land cover classes), population, {{biodiversity}} hotspots and protected status—is {{examined in the}} eastern coastal zones, the eastern region, the middle region, the western region and the whole of China. The analysis is based on consistent, comprehensive, geo-referenced and recent datasets and advanced analytical Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A comparative national and regional priority ranking of the provinces was conducted using the total score of eight indicators, for the four dimensions of human-environment (<b>ecosystems)</b> <b>interaction.</b> Using, these ranks, all the provinces were grouped in low, high and medium priority provinces. The comparative ranking and categorization of provinces will be useful for designing policies and management operations for spatially-differential scientific planning and management of environment (ecosystems) at the regional and national levels in China. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{failures}} of traditional target-species management have led many to propose an ecosystem approach to fisheries to promote sustainability. The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially {{to account for}} fishery <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interactions,</b> but by itself {{is not sufficient to}} address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries: inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total-harvest limits and input controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen natural experiments in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community and individual harvest or territorial rights and price ecosystem services and that are coupled with public research, monitoring, and effective oversight promote sustainable fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is an important}} natural physical influence on organism function and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interactions.</b> The UV radiation fluxes in extraterrestrial environments are substantially different from those experienced on Earth. On Mars, the moon and in Earth orbit they are more biologically detrimental than on Earth. Based on previously presented fluxes and biologically weighted irradiances, this paper considers in more detail measures to mitigate UV radiation damage and methods to modify extraterrestrial UV radiation environments in artificial ecosystems that use natural sunlight. The transmission characteristics of a Martian material that will mimic the terrestrial UV radiation environment are presented. Transmissivity characteristics of other Martian and lunar materials are described. Manufacturing processes {{for the production of}} plastics and glass on the lunar and Martian surface are presented with special emphasis on photobiological requirements. Novel UV absorbing configurations are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to develop}} {{extensive}} forest-based climate change vulnerability assessments have informed proposed management and policy options intended to promote improved on-the-ground policy outcomes. These assessments {{are derived from}} a rich vulnerability literature and are helpful in modeling complex <b>ecosystem</b> <b>interactions,</b> yet their policy relevance and impact has been limited. We argue {{this is due to}} structural-functional logic underpinning these assessments in which governance is treated as a procedural "black box" and policy-making as an undifferentiated and unproblematic output of a political system responding to input changes and/or system prerequisites. Like an earlier generation of systems or cybernetic thinking about political processes, the focus in these assessments on macro system-level variables and relationships fails to account for the multi-level or polycentric nature of governance and the possibility of policy processes resulting in the nonperformance of critical tasks...|$|R
