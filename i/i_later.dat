5|$|The {{area around}} Kirkcaldy has been {{inhabited}} since the Bronze Age. The first document {{to refer to}} the town is from 1075, when Malcolm III granted the settlement to the church of Dunfermline. David <b>I</b> <b>later</b> gave the burgh to Dunfermline Abbey, which had succeeded the church: a status which was officially recognised by Robert I in 1327. The town only gained its independence from Abbey rule when it was created a royal burgh by Charles I in 1644.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or to help those in need because of World War <b>I.</b> <b>Later</b> writers have generally admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who <b>I</b> <b>later</b> learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

5|$|The R-5 Pyramid {{is largely}} {{believed}} to by K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I's tomb, based mostly on evidence from Panel 4, crafted by Itzam K'an Ahk I, which records the new ajaw either dedicating or ceremonially re-opening {{the tomb of}} K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I. The panel itself explicitly names the R-5 pyramid as the muk, or burial, of K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I. However, despite intense efforts, no burial has ever {{been found in the}} pyramid, although the search was complicated by—and eventually abandoned because of—rubble fill left behind by looters. It is probable {{that the majority of the}} pyramid was constructed within the years following the death of K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I, likely under Itzam K'an Ahk I's patronage. Itzam K'an Ahk <b>I</b> <b>later</b> erected six stelae at the base of this pyramid.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of the name Belograd {{appeared}} on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal letter to Bulgarian ruler Boris <b>I.</b> <b>Later,</b> this name appeared in several variants: Alba Graeca (Greek city), Griechisch Wiessenburg (Greek white castle), Nandor Alba (City of the Bulgarians), Nandor Fejervar (The white castle of the Bulgarians), Castelbianco (White Castle), Alba Bulgarica (Bulgarian City). For about four centuries, the city remained a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976–1025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade; while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.|$|E

Karl died on 18June 1593, and was buried in the Strasbourg cathedral; Gebhard wrote a codicil leaving Agnes to the care and protection of the Dukes of Württemberg. Gebhard died on 21 May 1601.
