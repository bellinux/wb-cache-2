500|$|In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an {{exclusive}} contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E

[...] The ten [...] "novels" [...] of the series have been collected in 16 books, known as [...] "Cerebus phonebooks" [...] for their resemblance to telephone directories. [...] At {{a time when the}} series was about 70% completed, celebrated comic book writer Alan Moore wrote, [...] "Cerebus, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to say so, is still to comic books what Hydrogen is to the Periodic Table." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, {{and there is a lot}} of people around me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|At dawn [...] {{set out to}} find , the Horned Monster. [...] He came to a broad plain at {{the foot}} of the mountains, and saw [...] lying at rest. It had hair like a moose and a great pair of horns. While , Monster Slayer stood watching, Gopher, [...] came up to him. [...] "I wonder what you are doing here," [...] he said. [...] "There is someone here I seek," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "Do you not fear , the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?" [...] asked Gopher. [...] "Now that you mention it, it is he I seek," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I wish to kill him." [...] "I can help you with that," [...] said Gopher, [...] "but I want a piece of his hide." [...] "You shall have it," [...] said [...] [...] Then Gopher dug a tunnel right up to [...] [...] He {{returned}} and said, [...] "I have tunneled right up to where he lies. [...] And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. [...] You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart." [...] , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. [...] "Raise your right leg," [...] said Gopher. [...] While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. [...] Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where [...] lay above the opening. [...] He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into [...] [...] The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. [...] tore at the earth around the tunnel. [...] Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. [...] dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. [...] began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. [...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "What brings you to this place?" [...] "I am looking at something," [...] said , Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder what you are looking at," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "I am looking at ," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> fear him." [...] "I will go over there and see if he is dead," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. [...] If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." [...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. [...] So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. [...] And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that [...] was slain.|$|E

6000|$|... "Neither one of {{you shall}} go," [...] I replied. [...] "It is work that {{requires}} stealth and strategy, not force. One man alone may succeed where more would invite disaster. I shall go alone. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> your help, I will return for you." ...|$|E
