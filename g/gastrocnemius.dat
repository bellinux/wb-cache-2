5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{posterior}} muscles three {{are in the}} superficial layer. The major plantar flexors, {{commonly referred to as}} the triceps surae, are the soleus, which arises on the proximal side of both leg bones, and the <b>gastrocnemius,</b> the two heads of which arises on the distal end of the femur. These muscles unite in a large terminal tendon, the Achilles tendon, which is attached to {{the posterior}} tubercle of the calcaneus. The plantaris closely follows the lateral head of the <b>gastrocnemius.</b> Its tendon runs between those of the soleus and <b>gastrocnemius</b> and is embedded in the medial end of the calcaneus tendon.|$|E
25|$|This {{particular}} swimming technique encompasses all {{the muscles}} in the knee and will increase not only mobility but also {{the strength of the}} surrounding muscles, which include the quadriceps, hamstrings, <b>gastrocnemius,</b> tibialis anterior (shin muscle), abductor hallucis, abductor digiti minimi, and flexor digitorum brevis (foot muscles).|$|E
25|$|Dancing Dobermann {{disease is}} a type of {{myopathy}} that primarily affects the <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscle in Dobermanns. It usually starts between the ages of 6 to 7 months. One rear leg will flex while standing. Over the next few months it will begin to affect the other rear leg.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower leg}} and ankle {{need to keep}} {{exercised}} and moving well as they are {{the base of the}} whole body. The lower extremities must be strong in order to balance the weight {{of the rest of the}} body, and the <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscles take part in much of the blood circulation.|$|E
25|$|Jumping - {{is another}} risk {{because if the}} legs do not land {{properly}} after an initial jump, there may be damage to the meniscus in the knees, sprain to the ankle by everting or inverting the foot, or damage to the Achilles tendon and <b>gastrocnemius</b> if {{there is too much}} force while plantar flexing.|$|E
25|$|As in the brainstem, higher {{segments}} of the spinal cord contain α-MNs that innervate muscles higher on the body. For example, the biceps brachii muscle, a muscle of the arm, is innervated by α-MNs in spinal cord segments C5, C6, and C7, which are found rostrally in the spinal cord. On the other hand, the <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscle, one of {{the muscles of the}} leg, is innervated by α-MNs within segments S1 and S2, which are found caudally in the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|Plantar flexion: One of {{the most}} popular lower leg muscle {{stretches}} is the step standing heel raises, which mainly involves the <b>gastrocnemius,</b> soleus, and the Achilles tendon. Standing heel raises allow the individual to activate their calf muscles by standing on a step with toes and forefoot, leaving the heel hanging off the step, and plantar flexing the ankle joint by raising the heel. This exercise is easily modified by holding on to a nearby rail for balance and is generally repeated 5-10 times.|$|E
25|$|Pressure wounds {{are often}} the result of local {{ischemia}} from the increased pressure. Increased pressure also plays a roles in many diabetic foot ulcerations as changes due to the disease causes the foot to suffer limited joint mobility and creates pressure points {{on the bottom of}} the foot. Effective measures to treat this includes a surgical procedure called the <b>gastrocnemius</b> recession in which the calf muscle is lengthened to decrease the fulcrum created by this muscle and resulting in a decrease in plantar forefoot pressure.|$|E
25|$|High-heeled shoes slant {{the foot}} forward and down while bending the toes up. The more the feet are forced into this position, {{the more it}} may cause the <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscle (part of the calf muscle) to shorten. This may cause {{problems}} when the wearer chooses lower heels or flat-soled shoes. When the foot slants forward, a much greater weight is transferred to the ball of the foot and the toes, increasing the likelihood of damage to the underlying soft tissue that supports the foot. In many shoes, style dictates function, either compressing the toes or forcing them together, possibly resulting in blisters, corns, hammer toes, bunions (hallux valgus), Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis and many other medical conditions, {{most of which are}} permanent and require surgery to alleviate the pain.|$|E
500|$|Although flightless, emus have vestigial wings, {{the wing}} chord {{measuring}} around , and each wing having a small claw at the tip. Emus flap their wings when running, {{perhaps as a}} means of stabilising themselves when moving fast. They have long necks and legs, and can run at speeds of [...] due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature. Their feet have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated foot muscles; emus are the only birds with <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscles {{in the back of the}} lower legs. The pelvic limb muscles of emus contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass as do the flight muscles of flying birds. When walking, the emu takes strides of about , but at full gallop, a stride can be as long as [...] Its legs are devoid of feathers and underneath its feet are thick, cushioned pads. Like the cassowary, the emu has sharp claws on its toes which are its major defensive attribute, and are used in combat to inflict wounds on opponents by kicking. The toe and claw total [...] in length. The bill is quite small, measuring , and is soft, being adapted for grazing. [...] Emus have good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect threats at some distance.|$|E
2500|$|A 2009 study {{utilizing}} [...] and ultrasonography discovered {{strain and}} pennation angle heterogeneity within the medial <b>gastrocnemius</b> pennate muscle during differing modes of contraction. Parameters of fascicle location and contraction type (eccentric or passive), determined {{the magnitude of}} strain experienced by differing regions of the MG.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of fractures (commonly occurring on the tibia and the ankle mortise), it is recommended that parachutists wear supportive footwear. [...] Supportive footwear prevents inward and outward ankle rolling, allowing the PLF to safely transfer impact energy through the true ankle joint, and dissipate it via the medial <b>gastrocnemius</b> and tibialis anterior muscles.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the <b>gastrocnemius</b> would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the <b>gastrocnemius</b> flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the <b>gastrocnemius</b> muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{hazardous}} nature of skydiving, {{the greatest of}} precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death. For first time solo-parachutists, this includes anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of ground instruction. Since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing (approximately 85%), the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper parachute landing fall (PLF), which seeks to orient the body as to evenly disperse the impact through flexion of several large, insulating muscles (such as the medial <b>gastrocnemius,</b> tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus [...] ), as opposed to individual bones, tendons, and ligaments which break and tear more easily.|$|E

50|$|The {{superficial}} {{layer of}} posterior leg muscles is {{formed by the}} triceps surae and the plantaris. The triceps surae consists of the soleus and the two heads of the <b>gastrocnemius.</b> The heads of <b>gastrocnemius</b> arise on the femur, proximal to the condyles, and soleus arises on the proximal dorsal parts of the tibia and fibula. The tendons of these muscles merge to be inserted onto the calcaneus as the Achilles tendon. Plantaris originates on the femur proximal to the lateral head of the <b>gastrocnemius</b> and its long tendon is embedded medially into the Achilles tendon. The triceps surae is the primary plantar flexor and its strength becomes most obvious during ballet dancing. It is fully activated only with the knee extended because the <b>gastrocnemius</b> is shortened during knee flexion. During walking it not only lifts the heel, but also flexes the knee, assisted by the plantaris.|$|E
