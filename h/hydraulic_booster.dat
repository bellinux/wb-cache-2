50|$|The {{flight control}} system {{operates}} a set of conventional flight control surfaces with a rigid push-rod transmission system, which itself is electrically or hydraulically operated. The aileron control system, of irreversible servo-control type, is composed of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>booster,</b> an artificial-feel device, a feel trim actuator and a rigid push-rod transmission mechanism. The elevator and rudder control systems are of reversible push-rod type.|$|E

25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boosters</b> transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the swashplates directly.|$|R
5000|$|ZSU-23-4M4 and ZSU-23-4M5 (1999): modernized variants, {{armed with}} two {{additional}} paired man-portable air-defense systems [...] "Igla" [...] {{on each side}} of the turret and equipped with 81mm smoke grenade launchers, laser emission sensors, electro-optical vision devices (including television system for driver) and improved weapon radar system. The mechanical transmission was replaced with hydrostatic transmission, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boosters</b> were installed. Mobility increased to the level of main battle tanks. This upgrade was first shown during the exhibition MAKS-99 in Zhukovsky and was carried out by the Minotor Service Enterprise and Peleng Joint Stock Company from the Republic of Belarus, and the Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant of Russia. The Ulyanovsk Mechancial Plant is also offering ZSU-23-4 upgrade packages independently.|$|R
5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boosters</b> were fitted for the control system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} two {{different}} Antilock braking system (ABS) are simulated and compared. One is the ordinary hydraulic ABS system {{which we call}} it ABS {{and the other is}} Electromagnetic Antilock braking system which is called (EMABS) the basis of performance of an EMABS is based upon Electromagnetic force. In this system {{there is no need to}} use servo <b>hydraulic</b> <b>booster</b> which are used in ABS system. In EMABS to generate the desired force we have use a magnetic relay which works with an input voltage through an air gap (g). The generated force will be amplified by the relay arm, and is applied to the brake shoes and thus the braking torque is generated. The braking torque is proportional to the applied electrical voltage E. to adjust the braking torque it is only necessary to regulate the electrical voltage E which is very faster and has a much smaller time constant T than the ABS system. The simulations of these two different ABS systems are done with MATLAB/SIMULINK software and the superiority of the EMABS has been shown. Keywords—ABS, EMABS, ECU I...|$|E

2500|$|The Gazelle was {{the first}} {{helicopter}} to be adapted for single-pilot operations under instrument flight rules. An advanced [...] autopilot system was developed by Honeywell {{in order to allow}} the pilot to not be overworked during solo flights; the Gazelle was chosen as the platform to develop this capability as {{it was one of the}} faster and more stable helicopters in service at that point and had a reputation for being easy to fly. The docile flying abilities of the Gazelle are such that it has been reported as being capable of comfortably flying without its main hydraulic system operation at speeds of up to 100 knots. The flight controls are highly responsive; unusually, the Gazelle lacks a throttle or a trimming system. <b>Hydraulic</b> servo <b>boosters</b> are present on all flight control circuits to mitigate control difficulties in the event of equipment failure.|$|R
50|$|After a {{successful}} launch on March 12, Missile 46D (March 15) failed when the sustainer hydraulic rise-off heat shield broke off. Radiated heat caused the rise-off disconnect valve to fail, resulting in loss of sustainer engine <b>hydraulic</b> fluid. After <b>booster</b> jettison, the missile tumbled {{and fell into}} the Pacific Ocean less than 500 miles downrange. This incident was a near repeat of a failed Atlas-Agena launch three months earlier, and after another Atlas-Agena the following June fell victim to a hydraulic rise-off heat shield loss, the heat shield was redesigned. Check valves were installed on the hydraulic system of Atlas SLVs, although not ICBMs.|$|R
40|$|The NACA is {{conducting}} a general investigation of servo-mechanisms for use in powering aircraft control surfaces. This paper presents a theoretical analysis {{and the results of}} bench tests of a control-booster system which employs a variable displacement <b>hydraulic</b> pump. The <b>booster</b> is intended for use in a flight investigation {{to determine the effects of}} various booster parameters on the handling qualities of airplanes. Such a flight investigation would aid in formulating specific requirements concerning the design of control boosters in general. Results of the theoretical analysis and the bench tests indicate that the subject booster is representative of types which show promise of satisfactory performance. The bench tests showed that the following desirable features were inherent in this booster system: (1) No lost motion or play in any part of the system; (2) no detectable lag between motion of the contra 1 stick and control surface; and (3) Good agreement between control displacements and stick-force variations with no hysteresis in the stick-force characteristics. The final design configuration of this booster system showed no tendency to oscillate, overshoot, or have other undesirable transient characteristics common to boosters...|$|R
