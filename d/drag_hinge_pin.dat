5000|$|Hinge screws — {{longer or}} {{specialized}} screws that prevent {{the door from}} being simply pulled out after removing the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> Often the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> itself is screwed, from the inside while the door is open, into the hinge to prevent removal of the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> without first opening the door.|$|R
40|$|A hinge (20) {{includes}} two hinge plates (22, 24) and a connecting <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32). A coil spring (48) supported on a bushing (44) overlies the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32), which {{is free to}} move along its longitudinal axis (30). A cam follower (42) on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) engages a cam (32) mounted {{to one of the}} hinge plates (22), so that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) slides longitudinally as the hinge plates (22, 24) pivot relative to each other about the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32). As the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) slides longitudinally, it axially compresses or decompresses the spring (48). The cam (32) is oriented such that pivoting of the hinge plates (22, 24) in either direction from an open position compresses the spring (48), providing a restoring force which tends to retain the hinge plates (22, 24) in the open position...|$|R
40|$|During {{refurbishing}} of a {{pilotless target aircraft}} after a sortie, the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> which {{connect the}} elevator to a connecting flange was found broken on both port and starboard sides. These pins had been cadmium plated. Electron fractography indicated that {{the failure of the}} pins was due to hydrogen embrittlement. Also the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> did not conform to material specifications...|$|R

50|$|The Avro built C.8 was a {{refinement}} of the C.6, {{with the more}} powerful 180hp Lynx radial engine, and several C.8s were built. The C.8R incorporated <b>drag</b> <b>hinges,</b> due to blade flapping motion causing high blade root stresses in the rotor plane of rotation; this modification, however, resulted in other problems such as ground resonance for which <b>drag</b> <b>hinge</b> dampers were fitted.|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{joins the}} {{two parts of the}} rifle or shotgun; the stock with its firing mechanism and the fore-piece and barrel, which hold the round to be fired. In some cases the <b>hinging</b> <b>pin</b> may be easily removable, allowing the two portions of the weapon to be compactly and safely stored. In other cases the hinge will consist of a hook over a pin; releasing an auxiliary latch will allow sufficient travel to allow the hinge to be unhooked.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|R
30|$|The {{assessment}} {{was based on}} crack initiation only and hence complete dislocation was not investigated here. But as the wall thickness from the drilled hole to the outer surface of the bone is small, {{it can be concluded}} by simple engineering reasoning that complete rupture of the opposite cortex follows soon after crack initiation. These data suggest that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> offers no relevant benefit for the treatment of malalignment since the need for correction in patients with varus alignment is frequently above 8 ° of correction. It is well documented that the risk of revarisation {{in the presence of the}} opposite cortex fracture increases with every degree of valgus correction (Pape et al. 2004 a, 2004 b). Obviously, the current study suggests that the cortex-preserving <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> effect is absent in larger corrections exceeding 5 °. This observation is confirmed in an experimental study by Reyle et al. (2017), which used human cadaver tibial bone, artificial Synbones and Sawbones to investigate the fracture of the lateral hinge in an open-wedge HTO with and without a <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The HX {{was shown}} with a slant-back configuration, wearing a desert-inspired matte olive paint scheme, and {{featured}} removable doors with exposed <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> and removable composite fender flares that are attached with quarter-turn quick-release fasteners.|$|R
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|R
50|$|The core, foot {{deck and}} {{peduncle}} are constructed of anodized CNC machined aluminum. The flukes are {{a composite of}} rubber compression molded around an aluminum core frame. The <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is 316 stainless steel with a delrin bearing.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{suggests}} that the drill hole (<b>hinge</b> <b>pin)</b> {{at the end of}} the horizontal osteotomy reduces the stresses in the contralateral cortex and hence increases the critical opening angle prior to cracking of the opposite cortex in specimen with small correction angles. But the difference from having a drill hole or not is not so significant, especially for older patients. The ductility of the cortical bone is the decisive parameter for the calculated critical opening angle. Transferred to clinical practice, these data suggest that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is an asset, but not the decisive parameter, and it cannot avoid cracking and rupture of the opposite cortex in cases of larger correction angles.|$|R
5000|$|A {{semi-rigid}} rotorhead {{does not}} have individual flapping or <b>drag</b> <b>hinges</b> but provides for flapping and lag motion through gimbal mounting. [...] A common example of a semi-rigid rotor is a teetering rotorhead found on the Robinson family of helicopters.|$|R
50|$|The Contender, first {{introduced}} in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle {{with a number}} of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.|$|R
25|$|There {{are various}} levels of door {{protection}}. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{side of the door}} unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.|$|R
5000|$|With a rifle barrel mounted above a [...]410 shotgun barrel, this {{is known}} as a superposed [...] "over-under" [...] design. The barrel {{assembly}} is connected to the stock/action group by means of a removable <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b> Whether folded or disassembled, the overall length for storage is approximately 18.5 inches.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} levels of door {{protection}}. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{side of the door}} unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.Which level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a risk assessment of the door.|$|R
40|$|During {{the time}} frame {{allocated}} by the delivery order, members of the UAH Applied Research Program, {{with the cooperation of}} representatives from NASA investigated and conducted stress analysis of the SEDSAT 1 satellite. The main area of concern was with the design of the deployable 10 m antennas. The placement of the holes for the antenna door <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> was too close {{to the edge of the}} antenna canister. Because of the load placed on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> the stress analysis of this area suggested that more space would be needed between the holes and the edge of the material. Due to other conflicts, SEDSATI was removed from flying on the space shuttle and moved to the Delta Launch Vehicle. This changed many of the design requirements for the mounting and deployment of the satellite that forced a new design for the satellite. Once this happened, the stress analysis became obsolete, and the task was concluded...|$|R
50|$|Lubrication fixes this. Suitable {{lubricants}} include plumber's {{grease and}} silicone spray. Oil {{is not so}} suitable as it can drip off when in excess. Graphite is also unsuitable as it spreads to other surfaces and makes a mess. To give complete coverage of lubricant, the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is removed to be covered in the lubricant, and then reinserted. Oiling a squeaky hinge is considered a masculine behaviour.|$|R

50|$|Coiled pins {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and locks, and latches as <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> They {{are also used}} as pivots and axles, for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together—such as a gear and shaft—and even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use coiled pins in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|R
50|$|On July 7, 1980, after Shiue {{left for}} work, Mary Stauffer managed {{to remove the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> from the locked closet door. Despite being chained to each other, Mary and Elizabeth were able to reach {{the phone in the}} kitchen and call law enforcement. After making the call, they hid behind the car at Shiue's {{residence}} until police arrived. Both were immediately freed after seven weeks of imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is {{the portion}} of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron sights, barrels with telescopic sights, and even the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.|$|R
25|$|A {{crash in}} February 1926, caused by blade root failure, {{led to an}} {{improvement}} in rotor hub design. A <b>drag</b> <b>hinge</b> was added {{in conjunction with the}} flapping hinge to allow each blade to move fore and aft and relieve in-plane stresses, generated as a byproduct of the flapping motion. This development led to the Cierva C.8, which, on 18 September 1928, made the first rotorcraft crossing of the English Channel followed by a tour of Europe.|$|R
50|$|In door hinges, {{bearings}} sit {{between the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> and housing to ensure smooth {{movement of the}} door when it is opened and closed by passengers. Composite bearings are used {{in a number of}} automotive hinge systems due to their durability under high loads and corrosion resistance. Bearings also play a role in obtaining a quality paint finish on the car. Composite bearings’ PTFE compound liners are conductive and can transfer electricity to the hinges to facilitate the electrostatic painting process.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt guide rod assembly guides the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding {{the upper and lower}} receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|R
25|$|Pistol grips, butt {{stocks and}} {{fore-ends}} {{have been made}} available in stained walnut, or in recoil reducing composite materials. Different pistol fore-ends are required for the octagonal versus the round versus the bull barrels. The fore-ends have had an assortment of either one or two screw attachment points, used for attaching the fore-ends to the barrel with its matching one or two attachment points. Universally, the fore-ends, in addition to attaching to the barrel, cover the single <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> that connects the barrel to the receiver.|$|R
30|$|Obviously, the {{capacity}} for maintaining bony stability {{in the presence of}} (multiple) cortex fissures can vary significantly among patients and bone stability does not allow an “all-or-nothing principle”. Nevertheless, the data of the present study indicate that a correctly placed <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{at the end of the}} horizontal and ascending tibial osteotomy does not prevent opposite cortex fracture in larger corrections. The data suggest that bone ductility is an important factor for the crack initiation and hence integrity of opposite cortex, especially for higher corrections.|$|R

50|$|Ground {{resonance}} {{is usually}} precipitated by a hard landing or an asymmetrical ground contact, {{and is more}} likely to occur when components of the landing gear or damping system are improperly maintained, such as the <b>drag</b> <b>hinge</b> dampers, oleo struts, or wheel tire pressure. Under extreme conditions, the initial shock can cause violent oscillations that quickly build and result in catastrophic damage of the entire airframe. In some cases, complete destruction occurs, e.g. body panels, fuel tanks, and engines are torn away, even at normal rotor speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then declutched. The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled <b>drag</b> <b>hinges</b> with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to {{leap into the}} air. With all the engine power now applied to the forward thrusting propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.|$|R
50|$|As {{reported}} by Professor M. Milazzo (M.Milazzo P.Sardella analisi XRF quantitativa nelle applicazioni archeometriche), The XRF {{analysis performed on}} the metal of the crown revealed that all the foils, rosettes and bezels were made with the same alloy, made of 84 - 85% gold, 5 - 7% silver, and 8 - 10% copper, suggesting a contemporary construction of {{the main part of}} the crown, while the fillets external to the enamel plates and the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> were made of 90 - 91% gold and 9 - 10% silver, suggesting one or more subsequent reworking.|$|R
50|$|The Gyroplane was a two-seat {{autogyro}} without wings, with a {{ducted fan}} pusher propeller {{driven by a}} 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 piston engine. It had a three bladed rotor, formed from bonded aluminium. There were flapping <b>hinges</b> but no <b>drag</b> <b>hinges.</b> In normal flight the rotor was undriven, but the design team were keen to enable vertical jump starts, an autogyro technique which spins up the rotor before take off without forward movement over the ground. The first prototype used conspicuous tip jets fed directly with compressed air from a fuselage mounted cylinder.|$|R
50|$|A hinge is a {{component}} that attaches one {{edge of a}} door to the frame, while allowing the other edge to swing from it. It usually consists {{of a pair of}} plates, each with a set of open cylindrical rings (the knuckles) attached to them. The knuckles of the two plates are offset from each other and mesh together. A <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is then placed through the two sets of knuckles and usually fixed, to combine the plates and make the hinge a single unit. One door usually has about three hinges, but it can vary.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{used in the}} Peabody rifle, it {{saw more}} {{widespread}} use in the Martini-Henry and the subsequent Martini-Enfield. It employs a breechblock with a rear hinged falling block design, in which the breech is opened by permitting {{the front of the}} breechblock to drop down while pivoting on its hinge. Firing force is transmitted through the knuckle of the hinge and does not act directly on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b> The breechblock design as has been called a falling or tilting block but in omitting the role of the hinge can lead to ambiguities. It is also used in the Krag-Petersson rifle.|$|R
50|$|Traditional working {{dinghies}} have a lee {{board that}} can be hooked over the side. This does not split the cargo space. A sailing rudder is usually tied or clipped to a simple pair of pintles (<b>hinge</b> <b>pins)</b> on the transom with the bottom pintle being longer so that the rudder can be mounted one pintle at a time. The rope keeps the rudder from floating off in a wave. Both rudders and lee boards have swiveling tips so the dinghy can be landed. Rudders are often arranged so the tiller folds against the rudder to make a compact package.|$|R
