40|$|Two key {{questions}} regarding ‘‘no-take’’ marine reserves are: (1) how <b>eﬀective</b> are <b>reserves</b> likely to be, and (2) how does eﬀec- tiveness vary with life history attributes {{and the relative}} size of reserves. To investigate these questions, we use a simple Ricker model that includes ﬁshing, larval dispersal, and larval loss while in a planktonic pool, and that tracks protected and unprotected populations. We applied two diﬀerent measures of reserve eﬀectiveness to our simulation results. One metric was intended to reﬂect goals oriented towards conservation and the second was intended to reﬂect ﬁshery enhancement goals. Both metrics compare the situation before reserves are established to after the reserve {{has been in place}} and a new equilibrium was reached. Yield eﬀectiveness is deﬁned as the total equilibrium annual harvest after reserves are established divided by the total annual harvest before reserves are established. Conservation eﬀectiveness is deﬁned as the average adult density inside the reserve divided by the average density in the same area prior to reserve establishment. A substantial fraction of the 5120 simulated parameter combinations representing diﬀerent harvest rates and life history attributes went extinct {{in the absence of a}} reserve, and these scenarios leading to extinction could be predicted accurately (85 % aptly classiﬁed) simply on the basis of exploitation rate and population growth rate. Of the cases that did not go extinct, we compared the performance of reserves as measured by each eﬀectiveness metric. Few of the cases (less than 8 %) produced <b>eﬀective</b> <b>reserves</b> as measured in terms of increased harvest; whereas over half of the cases resulted in <b>eﬀective</b> <b>reserves</b> as measured by conservation eﬀectiveness. Moreover, the two measures of reserve eﬀectiveness were only weakly correlated. Simple linear regression or polynomial regression could explain at most 23 % of the variation in reserve eﬀectiveness as measured by either metric. As expected, the size of the reserve area had a marked and typically negative eﬀect on total annual yield, which suggests that while marine protected areas may do a good job of conserving protected populations, there will generally be pressure from the ﬁshing community to keep them small because of their tendency to reduce total catchPeer reviewe...|$|R

This study investigates how the ecological performance of 56 marine reserves throughout the Philippines, Caribbean, and Western Indian Ocean (WIO) {{is related to}} both reserve design features and the socioeconomic characteristics in associated coastal communities. Ecological performance was measured as fish biomass in the reserve relative to nearby areas.

Relationships between population density and the reserve effect on fish biomass were negative in the Caribbean, positive in the WIO, and not detectable in the Philippines.

Higher levels of compliance reported by resource users was related to higher fish biomass in reserves compared with outside, but this relationship was only statistically significant in the Caribbean.

Data acquired through habitat mapping {{is used as a}} surrogate measure for biodiversity, therefore simplifying the planning process for more <b>effective</b> <b>reserves.</b> The problem with this method is that it assumes areas with similar habitat variable measures will support the same species. Here, with the use of data acquired with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), I report that habitat variables in temperate rocky reefs off the east coast of Australia can be successful predictors of sessile invertebrate species richness and relative abundance. Temperate rocky reefs at approximately 30 metres depth within Batemans Marine Park were surveyed for this study. The best model for predicting species richness and relative abundance was composed of bathymetric variance and aspect. Together these variables explained 31 % of the variation in sessile invertebrate species richness and 50 % of the variation in relative abundance. Assemblages within rocky reefs differed at all scales investigated (kilometres), but most significantly at the smallest scale. The conservation implications of these findings suggest that several rocky reefs must be protected as assemblages varied significantly among them. This study provides future researchers with information on patterns of distribution required to understand the processes that drive change in sessile invertebrate assemblages. Understanding the spatial scale at which assemblages vary is the first step towards predictive models that will greatly benefit MPA design in the future...|$|R
