40|$|Lebugini River is {{the branch}} of Juanariverswhich is under the {{authority}} of the Central River Region Pemali - Juana, precisely located in the administrative area of the Kudus District. The location, which is on the upstream,causes degradation of the river channel, thus, to stabilize the river channel, the local Goverment should have a plan to build the conservation building. The dataused for the planning of check dam areprimary data (geotechnical data, the geometry of Lebugini river, and also the water level when flood came) and secondary data (topographic map and rainfall data). These data is used as a basic ofmain dam planning, sub dam, apron, complementary buildings, building stability control, and as the reference to determine the budget plan. From the calculation, height of main dam is 4, 00 m, width of main dam 2 ̆ 7 s and sub dam 2 ̆ 7 s crest are 17, 00 m each, thick of main dam 2 ̆ 7 s and sub dam 2 ̆ 7 s crest are 1, 50 m each, the upstream slope of the dam is around 1 : 0, 5, the downstream slope of the dam is around 1 : 0, 2, width of main dam 2 ̆ 7 s and sub dam 2 ̆ 7 s wing are 1, 50 m each, both main dam 2 ̆ 7 s and sub dam 2 ̆ 7 s wing penetration are 2, 00 m each, height of sub dam 1, 60 m, length of apron is 11 m, square -shaped <b>drip</b> <b>hole</b> with sides 1, 00 m by 11 pieces. The total cost to build the check dams of Lebugini River is IDR 1. 521. 177. 000, 00 include VAT and 110 days workmanship...|$|E
40|$|Kraushohle (Garns. Styria, Austria) is {{the only}} current known sulfuric acid cave in the Eastem Alps. Cupolas, ceiling partings and portals, ceiling channels, {{replacement}} pockets. Horizontal orrosion/convection notches, sulfuric acid karren, blind chimneys. incomplete dissolution walls, <b>drip</b> <b>holes</b> and cup shaped hollows in tbe floor are the most striking morphological features in this cave. Mineralogical analysis showed the presence, besides calcite, of gypsum, gibbsite, opaline, jarosite, metaluno,ene, hydroxylapatite, halloysite, and alunite. The timing of speleogenesis was preliminary determined, using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of alunite, a product of acid limestone weatbering, to 80 ka + 1 - 80 (the cave is thus younger than 160 ka). Preliminary U-Th dates of calcitic stalagmites indicate a minimum age of gypsum deposition of 52 ka. Stable isotope data of these speleothem are consistent with an epigenic origin of the drip water at that rime...|$|R
50|$|A {{dripstick}} {{is a thin}} hollow tube installed vertically in {{the bottoms}} of fuel tanks of many large aircraft, used to check fuel levels. To read a dripstick, it is withdrawn from the lower surface of the wing. When {{the top of the}} dripstick is withdrawn below the level of the fuel, fuel enters the dripstick and <b>drips</b> through a <b>hole</b> in the cap. Graduations on the dripstick indicate the level of the fuel in the tank.|$|R
5000|$|Drip {{chambers}} can {{be classified}} into macro-drip(about 10 to 20 gtts/ml) and micro-drip (about 60 gtts/ml) based on their drop factors. For a given drip chamber (when the fluid <b>drips</b> from the <b>hole</b> into the chamber) drop factor means number of drops per ml of the IV fluid. Flow rate can be calculated {{with the help of}} the observations from the drip chamber and its drop factor. The unit of flow rate is gtts/min, where gtts means guttae (Latin word of drop) ...|$|R
5000|$|A suikinkutsu (literally [...] "water koto cave") {{is a type}} of Japanese garden {{ornament}} {{and music}} device. It consists of an upside down buried pot with a hole at the top. Water <b>drips</b> through the <b>hole</b> at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant splashing sound that rings inside of the pot similar to a bell or a Japanese zither called koto. It is usually built next to a traditional Japanese stone basin called chōzubachi, part of a tsukubai for washing hands before the Japanese tea ceremony.|$|R
5000|$|Former Residence of Mao Zedong or Mao Zedong's Former Residence (...) {{was built}} in the late Qing Dynasty. It is located in Shaoshan Village of Shaoshan {{township}} in Shaoshan, Xiangtan, Hunan, China. The building was the birthplace and childhood home of Mao Zedong, the first leader of the People's Republic of China. It has a building area of about 472.92 m2, embodies buildings such as the old houses, the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall, the Bronze Statue of Mao Zedong, the Cultural relics Exhibition Hall, and the Dishui <b>Hole</b> (<b>Dripping</b> Water Cave; [...] ).|$|R
