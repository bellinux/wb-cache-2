Dada's redesign {{was done}} in the Mughal style, with red, <b>hand-laid</b> brickwork and arches. Dada also had plastic seating installed in place of the existing concrete benches. The lower portion under the stands was enclosed and converted to shops for boutiques and offices. Gaddafi Stadium was the first in Pakistan to be equipped with modern floodlights having their own standby power generators.|$|E
25|$|The Rutgers School of Social Work {{was built}} {{as the home}} of the School of Ceramics (now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering) in 1922. The {{structural}} and design elements of the building are fabricated entirely of ceramic materials donated by the ceramics industry of New Jersey. The third floor classroom has a beautifully enormous gas-fired fireplace which was state of the art when constructed. The floor of the room consists entirely of <b>hand-laid</b> artistic tile, including an unusual feature, a pre-Nazi use of a then-innocuous pattern now known as the swastika. The Ceramic Engineering Department moved to Busch Campus in 1963 when the Engineering Building was constructed.|$|E
500|$|The college's first unified {{library was}} in Thompson Hall, which was {{constructed}} in 1905. [...] Funds for its construction were provided by William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh's {{in honor of his}} mother. [...] His wife, Mary Thaw Thompson, later established a fund for library. [...] The building is sandstone, with <b>hand-laid</b> mosaic tile floors and skylights. [...] It was lit by electric lights and heated by steam. [...] In addition to the college's holdings and those of the various literary societies, the library held the Walker Room, a room with fine furnishings, Tiffany lamps, and John Walker's personal library of 5,000 volumes. [...] From its construction until the 1970s, its steps and green space held the commencement exercises. [...] The building is sandstone, with <b>hand-laid</b> mosaic tile floors and skylights. In 1965, this room was transferred to the U. Grant Miller Library. [...] In 2004, the building was remodeled into administrative facilities.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the largest}} N scale layouts {{in the world is}} located at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum. Pacific Desert Lines [...] is a [...] layout {{featuring}} <b>hand-laid</b> code 40 rail. Each piece of rail is [...] (forty thousandths) high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About [...] (scale miles, actually [...] ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of Model Railroader magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse.|$|E

5000|$|A {{detailed}} {{survey of the}} perimeter walls of the garden, parts of which are thought to date from the late 19th century, was undertaken. These are built of a mix of traditional <b>hand-laid</b> earth (pakhsa) and sun-dried bricks on stone foundations — techniques still widely used in rural construction in Afghanistan. After careful documentation, damaged sections of the walls were repaired or re-built between during 2002 and 2004, during which nearly 100,000 work-days were generated for skilled and unskilled labour.|$|E
5000|$|Built in 1964, {{the vehicle}} was {{powered by a}} 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and was backed by a Powerglide {{automatic}} transmission.

5000|$|A key {{design element}} {{is the use}} of brick. The masonry resembles {{patterns}} popular in the Southeast. Braves executive {{vice president of sales and}} marketing Derek Schiller says the masonry gives the ballpark’s exterior a look of “timelessness.” In addition, the Braves decided to use pre-cast stone. Schiller said “It looks custom <b>hand-laid.</b> It’s at all of the entryways. It brings the whole scale of the brick way down.” According to Schiller, by designing breaks in the masonry like porches, canopies, varying angles and trellises, “it not only creates shade, it also warms the architecture and gives it a different scale.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} is extremely heavy, which appeals to many prospective cruisers. The hull {{is made of}} <b>hand-laid</b> fibreglass, in 12 layers, alternating woven roving with chopped strand mat, set in polyester resin. This results in a solid hull whose thickness ranges from half an inch at minimum to almost an inch. This is considerably more than most equivalent boats. The deck is half-inch plywood sheathed in GRP; the bulkheads are also plywood, tabbed to the hull with fibreglass cloth. The ballast is 7000 lb, either lead and iron (earlier boats) or all lead, installed inside the keel (which {{is part of the}} hull shape) and set in resin.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hand-laid</b> {{composite}} {{stock is}} composed out of {{materials such as}} fiberglass, kevlar, graphite cloth, or some combination, saturated in an appropriate binder, placed into a mold to set, or solidify. The resulting stock is stronger and more stable than an injection-molded stock. It can also {{be as little as}} half the weight of an injection-molded stock. Inletting and bedding can be accomplished by molding in as part of the manufacturing proceess, machining in the inletting after the stock is finished, molding directly to the action as a separate process, or molding a machined metal component in place during manufacture. Finish is provided by a layer of gel coat applied to the mold before the cloth is laid up.|$|E
50|$|The rest of {{the twentieth}} century brought several changes for the caverns and park. On the surface, two picnic shelters, a dining hall (which has since been {{converted}} to a storage building), a playground, a restroom building, and a steel barn were built. Later, a small exit building was built to increase security at the exit stairwell, and the entrance building was renovated to now include a gift shop and a new basement containing offices and storage. In the cave, concrete was <b>hand-laid</b> on the floors in the 1970s. A professional cave lighter, whose team hid the new lights in concrete sconces in more creative and less obstructive places than the previous bare bulbs, was hired in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The museum had {{an earlier}} model {{railroad}} layout, {{dating back to}} the early 1940s when Minton Cronkhite built the original Museum and Santa Fe Railway; a 2340 sq ft layout in O scale. This layout had over 1000 ft of track and over 20,000 <b>hand-laid</b> ties. The project was financed with a $58,000 grant from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Cronkhite began construction in 1939 and the exhibit made its public debut in January 1941. Much of the rolling stock and locomotives were hand built from scratch by Cronkhite using original Santa Fe plans. It featured Santa Fe’s southwestern freight and passenger operations, including a depiction of the Grand Canyon and quickly became a favorite with children and adults visiting the museum.|$|E

5000|$|All Bristols {{included}} an interior overhead fiberglass headliner that hid rough, irregular fiberglass {{on the inside}} of the cabin. The cabinetry was fiberglassed to the hull, rather than using an interior liner with molded cabinetry, which significantly added to the structural integrity of the hull. The cabinetry was built from 3/4" [...] mahogany plywood, attached with bronze wood screws and glued. The hulls of early Bristols were all solid, <b>hand-laid</b> fiberglass. The decks and cabin tops were cored with end-grain balsa. The cored structure extended to the cockpit seat tops and the cockpit sole. Rudder posts and propeller shafts were solid bronze. Bronze Wilcox Crittenden tapered-plug seacocks were used on all underwater thru-hulls. A distinguishing feature of virtually all Bristol models included at least two moulded dorade boxes on the cabin top abaft the mast step that allowed ventilation in rough seas or rainy weather.|$|E
50|$|These shoes {{also use}} the two-slot cleat {{mounting}} system like casual cycling shoes but have a more aggressive, lugged outsole for better performance when the rider has {{to get off the}} bike to run or to push or carry the bike. Most of these shoes also allow for attachment of two screw-in spikes in the toe area for even more traction in mud or steep trails. The cleats used on mountain bike shoes are also depressed below the treads of the sole, keeping them safe from contact with the ground. Injection-molded nylon midsoles reinforced with fiberglass, carbon fiber-reinforced injection molded nylon and <b>hand-laid</b> carbon fiber midsoles can be found depending on manufacturer and price range. Prices in the US in 2010 range from $70 to well over $350 for the most expensive models. Sizes are available from 35 to 50, with some companies offering a wider model or two.|$|E
50|$|The Manta Mirage was a {{mid-engined}} vehicle produced by Manta Cars, owned by brothers Brad and Tim LoVette, in Costa Mesa, California* from 1974 to 1986. The Mirage, originally {{referred to as}} just the 'Manta', or the 'Manta Can-Am', was a light-weight road-legal car, based loosely on the McLaren M8 Can-Am racing car. The Mirage's steel space frame chassis was fitted with a high-output V8 engine and 4-speed transaxle. Most Mirages were equipped with 327 cu. in. (5.4 L) or 350 cu. in. (5.7 L) Chevrolet small block V8 engines, though some used 454 cu. in. (7.4 L) or 460 cu. in. (7.5 L) V8 engines. The original Mirage design mated the Chevy V8 to a Corvair transaxle via a Kelmark adapter and remote shifter. The bodywork was all <b>hand-laid</b> fiberglass, pre-colored {{in a range of}} gel-coat colors. Gull-wing doors were fitted to a removable top section, while the doors flip forward for entry. With curb weights as light as 1,900 lbs (680 kg), the cars could be built by the factory or their owners to be extremely fast.|$|E
