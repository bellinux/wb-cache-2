5000|$|Auxis is a genus of ocean-dwelling ray-finned bony fish in {{the family}} Scombridae, and tribe Thunnini, {{also known as the}} tunas. Auxis, {{commonly}} and collectively called the <b>frigate</b> <b>tunas,</b> is one of five genera of tunas which comprise the Thunnini tribe.|$|R
50|$|With {{regards to}} the type of fishing gears, the {{majority}} of the fisherman uses hook and the line type. The species caught using this type are <b>frigate</b> <b>tunas,</b> big eye scads, yellow fin tunas, pacific sailfish groupers, Spanish mackerels and slip mouth, round scads, maya-maya, flying fish, bumo and saray. Other types gears used are spear guns, gillnets and the casting net. The municipality of San Luis together with BFAR has provided payaos to fisherman association of coastal barangays to increase fish catch of fisherman.|$|R
50|$|Since time immemorial, {{the method}} of fishing {{employed}} in the Archipelago has been the pole and line method. The types of fish caught by this method are <b>tuna,</b> skipjack <b>tuna,</b> <b>frigate</b> and mackerel. The main catch is tuna, which {{is used in the}} daily diet of the inhabitants, as well as for export in different forms. The daily catch depends for the most part on the seasons. Although triangular sailed dhoni were used in the past, today fishing dhoanis are mechanized.|$|R
50|$|The {{favourite}} fish is skipjack tuna, either dried or fresh. Other similar {{fish species}} {{that are part of}} the average Maldivian diet are little tunny (latti), yellowfin tuna (kanneli), <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> (raagondi), bigeye scad (mushimas), wahoo (kurumas), mahi-mahi (fiyala) and mackerel scad (rimmas). These can be eaten boiled or processed.|$|E
50|$|Within a {{radius of}} 20 m there are {{elevated}} number of animal species, {{in addition to}} sea plants. Predominantly, the area is a habitat for brown alga (Stypopodium zonale), red alga (Asparagopsis armata), Sawfish, Vadigo (Campogramma glaycos), <b>Frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> (Auxis thazard) and anchovy, in addition to Needlefish, Grouper and Hake, among others; {{there are more than}} 69 different species (the area has a 7.2 Margalef scale/biodiversity index-rating), and it has been defended as a candidate for protection, owing to the biodiversity in the region.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with the other islands, the raising of cattle and milk production never attained {{the same level of}} development. Agriculture is still the predominant activity in the municipality, occupying 47.6% of the land. This activity is usually confined to small ventures, involving forging plants, small pastures and permanent holdings. There are several commercial species of fish in the waters around Santa Maria, such as sheepshead, vejas, red snapper, grouper, wrasse, mackerel, anchovies, needlefish and <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna.</b> Secondary industries are dominated by civil construction, sawmills, tile and block factories, and artisan/handicraft manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|White marlin feed on {{a variety}} of {{schooling}} baitfish, including sardine, herring, and other clupeoids; squid; mackerel; scad; saury; and smaller tuna-like fishes, such as <b>frigate</b> and bullet <b>tuna.</b> Like their close relatives the striped marlin, and sailfish, white marlin will often group together to corral schooling baitfish into a tight group for feeding purposes, a phenomenon commonly referred to as [...] "balling bait". When this occurs, it is common for two or more fish to be raised to the baits or hooked up simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{feed upon}} {{a variety of}} {{zooplankton}} along with drifting fish eggs and other larvae. They progress to feeding {{on a wide range}} of fishes, particularly scombrids, such as mackerel and tuna, squid, and especially near oceanic islands and coral reefs, on juvenile inshore fish. Studies of stomach contents have found that smaller schooling scombrids such as <b>frigate</b> mackerel, bullet <b>tuna,</b> and skipjack tuna make up a substantial proportion of their diet. Squid and deep-sea fishes such as pomfret and snake mackerel are also important prey items in certain areas. Blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as white marlin, as well as yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the 100-lb range. Conversely, they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as filefish and snipefish.|$|R
40|$|The Fishing Industry in the Philippines {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the food and employment need of Filipino fishers. By using anchored Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs or payao), the Philippine tuna fisheries was transformed into a million-dollar industry. Minimal studies on exploitation rates and fish behavior around anchored FADs hampered further understanding of this fishery practice. Studies on fish behavior using Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) are good complement where data is limited. A study using semi-structured interview (n = 46) and three focus group discussions (n = 39 participants) to record fishers' knowledge and observations on the behavior of different fish species around anchored FADs was conducted. This particularly focused on attraction, retention, and departure behavior of fishes in identified FAD sites. Based on the fishers' knowledge, tuna schools are attracted to anchored FADs at 10 km distance. In anchored FADs, tuna form schools segregated by species and size. There was no relationship between the attraction distance and the reported school size and the various waiting times for fish to aggregate below the FADs. There was no variation between the species present at day or night time although fishers have reported a distinction of species found near the surface (0 - 10 m) and those found at other depths (11 - 20 m). Juvenile yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), and <b>frigate</b> and bullet <b>tunas</b> (Auxis spp.) are found to stay at 25 - 50 m from the FAD at a depth of > 20 m. Adult oceanic tunas reside in deeper waters (75 m). The fish visual census produced similar results with the semi-structured interviews and FGDs but did not observe oceanic tunas at depths of 15 - 20 m in the anchored FADs examined. </p...|$|R
50|$|Malampaya Sound's waters, coral reefs, {{seagrass}} beds, mangrove coastlines {{and surrounding}} lowland forests provide habitat {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. More than 156 fish species are found in its waters including commercially valuable fish such as mackerel, anchovy, crevalle, sea catfish, snapper, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna,</b> rabbit fish and grouper. Crabs and stingray are also abundant in the sound and is also visited by dugongs and marine turtles like green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles. The sound is also home to three species of dolphins: the Irrawady dolphin found in the Inner Sound, the bottle-nosed dolphin in the Outer Sound, and Risso's dolphin found at Minapla Bay.|$|E
50|$|The little tunny's {{markings}} {{allow it}} to easily be distinguished from similar species. It is often confused with the skipjack tuna, the <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna,</b> the Atlantic bonito, and the bullet tuna. Close relatives also include the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the Atlantic bonito is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the little tunny, the skipjack tuna lacks markings {{on the back and}} has broad, straight stripes on the underside.|$|E
50|$|Blue marlin are eclectic feeders {{preying on}} a wide range of prey species and sizes. Scientific {{examination}} of blue marlin stomach contents has yielded organisms as small as miniature filefish. Common food items include tuna-like fishes, particularly skipjack tuna and frigate mackerel (also known as <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna),</b> squid, mackerel, and scad. Of more interest to sport fishermen is the upper range of blue marlin prey size. A 72 in white marlin has been recorded as being found in the stomach of a 448 lb blue marlin caught at Walker's Cay in the Bahamas, and more recently, during the 2005 White Marlin Open, a white marlin in the 70 lb class was found in the stomach of one of the money-winning blues. Shortbill spearfish of 30 to 40 lb have been recorded as feed items by Kona blue marlin fishermen. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna of 100 lb or more have also been found in the stomachs of large blue marlin.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} changes in <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> populations in southern Sri Lanka, based on reports from fishers in three age classes. Significantly higher values for best day's catch and largest specimen ever caught {{were obtained by}} older fishers than younger ones. Values were also significantly higher during early years, providing clear evidence of {{a decrease in the}} resource over time (1951 - 2007). Older fishers reported best catches further inshore and in shallower waters which, on becoming depleted, forced younger generations to fish in less exploited areas further offshore. Heavy harvesting is also evident from the significantly greater number of sites reported by older fishers as being depleted, compared with observations of younger fishers. These findings contrast markedly with catch and catch per effort patterns from statistics for <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and bullet tuna (combined) in southern Sri Lanka (1994 - 2004). No stock decline is evident, and at least one report in the early 1990 s advocated increasing exploitation rates by 40 % to maximize yields. Although not a primary research objective, fisher observations on <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> populations were also analysed to help evaluate possible effects of the 2004 tsunami. Most fishers reported post-tsunami decline, but mainly from a larger new generation of fishers, rather than extra boats provided by aid money or (direct or indirect) biophysical impacts from the tsunami. Reliance on fishery statistics, especially for mixed species and over a limited period, can be risky and easily mask true stock status. Evidence of harvesting effects on <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> in southern Sri Lanka is evident using questionnaire data over a longer time scale. This study provides another compelling case of the 'shifting baseline syndrome', whereby fishers of different ages have altered perceptions/experiences of their environment. This may be its first reported occurrence in Sri Lanka. Traditional knowledge from this and similar surveys may provide national fishery management with valuable insights and help improve conservation prospects for <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and other marine resources...|$|E

40|$|Small juveniles of {{the nine}} species of scombrids in Australian waters are morphologically similar to one another and, consequently, {{difficult}} to identify to species level. We show that the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene region is {{a powerful tool for}} identification of these young fish. Using this method, we identified 50 juvenile scombrids collected from Exmouth Bay, Western Australia. Six species of scombrids were apparent in this sample of fish: narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta), <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> (Auxis thazard), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), leaping bonito (Cybiosarda elegans), and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis). The presence of Indian mackerel, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna,</b> leaping bonito, and kawakawa is the first indication that coastal waters may be an important spawning habitat for these species, although offshore spawning may also occur. The occurrence of small juvenile S. commerson was predicted from the known spawning patterns of that species, but other mackerel species (Scomberomorus munroi, Scomberomorus queenslandicus, Scomberomorus semifasiciatus) likely to be spawning during the sampling period were not detected among the 50 small juveniles analyzed here...|$|E
40|$|Maldivian tuna catches are {{affected}} by changes in oceanographic conditions, including those associated with ENSO events and with decadal-scale oscillations. Three types of variability are considered here. (1). On inter-annual time scales, catch rates of skipjack tuna tend to go down during El Niño events, while catch rates of yellowfin tuna, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and kawakawa tend to go up. The opposite is seen during La Niña events. (2). Over decadal scales, skipjack catches were higher and yellowfin tuna catches were lower than average during 1970 - 72 and 1985 - 92, but the opposite was seen during 1973 - 84 and 1993 - 98. This is interpreted as evidence for a decadal-scale oscillation in Indian Ocean oceanographic conditions, with {{a period of about}} 20 years. (3). Over still longer periods, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> catches have decreased while kawakawa catches have increased.

The greatest concentrations of bluefin tuna larvae, {{as well as those}} of other tuna species, were found east of Ibiza in the Mallorca channel and in the area south of the island of Menorca. The circulation pattern of the region could have facilitated the transport of larvae from the Mallorca channel towards the southern area off Menorca. Largest sizes of tuna larvae were found in this area that seems to act as a retention area due to the existence of a strong anticyclonic gyre. Other environmental parameters are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Following the 2004 tsunami in Sumatra, Sri Lanka {{experienced}} > 30, 000 confirmed {{deaths and}} disruption of livelihood. Damage to coastal ecosystems {{was less than}} anticipated, especially in comparison with reported impacts from unsustainable development. This research examines tsunami related damage {{against a background of}} anthropogenic pressures. Fishery changes were determined through interview of three generations of fishers targeting <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna.</b> Significantly higher values for best day’s catch and largest specimen ever caught were obtained by older fishers than younger ones. Values were also significantly higher during early years, providing clear evidence of resource decline and the ‘shifting baseline syndrome’. Most fishers reported posttsunami decline in <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna,</b> but mainly from a larger new generation of fishers, rather than extra boats provided by aid money or (direct or indirect) biophysical impacts from the tsunami. The number of boats post-tsunami increased significantly in all research areas, which could result in further catch decline. The perceptions of 500 Sri Lankan fishers about the influence of risk factors on tsunami death toll and house damage are quantified). Mangroves, coral reefs and sand dunes afforded protection against tsunami damage (67 – 94 % of fisher responses), as did housing and roads. Fishers believed rivers/estuaries, concave coastlines and hotels exacerbated impacts. For comparison, multi-variable models for death toll, housing damage, inundation area and distance are built, incorporating both natural and developmental risk factors. Bathymetry is the only factor significantly associated with all indicators of impact. Mangroves and marsh were not a significant factor in final multivariable models. However, in terms of inundation, sand dunes were identified as protective, while bodies of water exacerbated damage. The extent of agreement and variance between modelling results and the opinions of fisher questionnaires is critically examined. Research findings highlight the need for better coastal management. While the role mangroves in tsunami protection remains equivocal, their known role in providing many other ecosystem services suggests that mangroves warrant greater conservation attention in Sri Lanka, in the face of coastal development pressures. Coastal policy and conservation priorities should be influenced by scientific research (e. g. the tsunami model in this thesis) as well as traditional ecological knowledge and opinions from indigenous people. Factors shown to provide tsunami protection often cannot be altered by human intervention (e. g. topography and bathymetry). However, sand dunes could potentially be preserved to reduce future impacts. Tsunamis are rare events and further research should be carried out to determine which risk factors are important for more frequent events (e. g. monsoon). The needs of coastal communities should always remain paramount in considerations of future tsunami and environmental policies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|During the 2008 - 2011 period, 1548 {{specimens}} of tuna and tuna-like species were tagged by the Spanish Confederation of Responsible Recreational Fishing (CEPRR) with the scientific coordination of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Of these, 1031 bluefin tuna were tagged with conventional tags, whereas 10 other {{specimens of}} the same species were tagged with pop-up satellite electronic tags in the Mediterranean. Five pop-up electronic tags remained on the adult specimens up to 110 days. In this period, the specimens stayed in the tagging area except for one of them, which reached Algerian waters in the winter. Similarly, 333 long-finned tuna and up to 184 specimens belonging to other species such as swordfish, little tunny, bonito, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> and spearfish, were also tagged. Eight bluefin tuna were recaptured, including one adult tuna which was found in the same area where it was tagged (Balearic Islands) 1343 days after release. A juvenile tuna tagged in the Mediterranean was recaptured more than two years after release in the Cantabrian Sea. Over the 2008 - 2011 period, the IEO provided a number of training courses on conventional and electronic tagging techniques at the different ports where tournaments and/or tagging and release campaigns were carried out. This promoted participation of the CEPRR in the tagging design of the GBYP-ICCAT Atlantic-wide Research Programme on Bluefin Tuna, as well as strategic and scientific interest. Postprin...|$|E
