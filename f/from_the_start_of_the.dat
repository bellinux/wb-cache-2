5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liturgical year on {{the first}} Sunday in Advent, Bach {{composed}} prolifically.

When Bach's hope to become Drese's successor was not realized, he ceased to compose cantatas for the Weimar court.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E

Depending on {{the format of the}} show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century onwards, {{the garden}} went through major changes as it fell into neglect. It was painted in 1747 by Canaletto {{during a period}} of transition, as Westminster was being {{transformed}} by the construction of new buildings and roads. By the start of the 19th century it had been redeveloped as the site for a row of townhouses, some of which were occupied by prime ministers seeking homes near the government buildings nearby. The last remnants of the Privy Garden were destroyed in 1938 during the construction of government offices which now house the Ministry of Defence's headquarters building.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war to mid-1941, Coastal Command {{had only}} one {{functioning}} Operational Training Unit (OTU). Officially it had to provide training for 17 units. The pressure on the OTU was such that it offered {{little more than a}} conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even though at that time in the war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry to meet outstanding OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month. This figure, on the outbreak of war, proved grossly inadequate.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, a British {{blockade}} on {{shipments to}} Germany affected the Reich economy.

Much {{of the country was}} occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E

Whitlock fumbled the ball on the return of the second interception and possession was recovered by Darius Hanks. The Tide continued its drive to the Gamecock 8, and Leigh Tiffin kicked a field goal to put Alabama ahead 10–0.|$|E

As the series unfolds, Lex's curiosity about Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship.

A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by {{the construction of a}} water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was.|$|E

5|$|On 28 October 1940, Italy invaded Greece, {{initiating}} the Greco-Italian War {{as part of}} the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's expansionist ambitions. The Greek army quickly defeated the Italians and pushed them back to Albania. Less than two weeks later, the Italian fleet was badly damaged in the British Raid on Taranto, which significantly reduced the threat the Italian Regia Marina posed to the Greek fleet. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, Kilkis was used as a floating battery based in Salamis.
