5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
40|$|The {{sections}} of pornography and porno-actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> KUHP are {{a kind of}} regulation which is formed by the Council of People Representative for eliminating the pornography and porno-action occur in our nation, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> sections cover the typology of law, from the above mentioned background, it could drawn the problem formulation, that is : how the typology <b>of</b> law <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> KUHP about <b>the</b> {{sections of}} pornography and porno-action. The method of writing this law was by using the method of normative jurisdiction approach, the technique of collecting data was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of materials of primary law and the materials of secondary law were then analyzed through the normative descriptive method. The typology of law is a kind of science which studies the order of development as an evolution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationship of law with order of political and social. Therefore, the law is not blind with the consequences of social, there are three typologies of law, they are : the repressive law, the autonomy law, and <b>the</b> responsive law. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> KUHP, <b>the</b> legislators should use one of those three typologies of law as the basic foundation of legislating, that is : the repressive law which is a kind of law that mostly put the interest of the state as the top priority, this kind of law would not consider the interest of the society as the most important concern <b>in</b> general.

25|$|Madison, {{the lead}} {{supporter}} of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill {{through most of the}} convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates. Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks. Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 21 to ratify the Constitution, {{by the fact that the}} convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratifications, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.|$|E

25|$|Rep. John Bingham, the {{principal}} framer of the Fourteenth Amendment, advocated that the Fourteenth applied {{the first eight}} Amendments of the Bill of Rights to the States. The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently declined to interpret it that way, despite the dissenting argument in the 1947 case of Adamson v. California by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black that the framers' intent should control the Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment (he included a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony). Although the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court during the following twenty-five years employed a doctrine of selective incorporation that succeeded in extending to the States {{almost all of the}} protections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> as well as other, unenumerated rights. The Bill of Rights thus imposes legal limits on the powers of governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted the idea of the Bill of Rights “was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.” The 14th Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
