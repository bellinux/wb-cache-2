5000|$|The JDM iS/Type S (not to be {{confused}} with the RSX Type-S), which was essentially the same as the base Acura RSX, featured the K20A3 engine with an output of [...] and is offered with either a 5-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. Integra iS is offered in 2002-2004 model years with 15-inch steel wheels with covers, or optional 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. JDM Type S was offered in 2005-2006 model years, and was equipped with a 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels shared with the Acura RSX Type-S. The Integra Type R, sold in Japan had reduced weight, a 220 PS / 164 kW / 217 hp K20A I4 engine (Japan-only; Oceania models have an engine similar to the Acura RSX-S), 6-speed close-ratio manual transmission, as well as a helical limited slip differential (LSD), stiffer springs and shocks, high intensity discharge projector headlights, aluminum pedal set, 4-piston front Brembo brake caliper, 17-inch 5 double spoke wheels on Bridgestone Potenza tires, Recaro suede seats/matching <b>interior,</b> leather <b>wrapped</b> MOMO steering wheel, body trim, front strut bar, and more. The Type R lacked many of the luxury features (like vanity mirrors or side airbags) in the Type S, true to its racing heritage. The C package on the Type R added various accessories like the rear window wiper, remote control, folding mirrors. JDM Integras iS had one interior colour, Ebony, available for the first model year. After 2002, Titanium interiors became available for all exterior colours. Type S had redesigned cloth and leather seats. Type R had choices of black/blue/red interiors (including colour matching Recaro seats), depending on exterior colours. Refreshed Integra Type R had the option of either the high wing, or the trunk lip spoiler. Integra iS and Type S were available with sunroof, and navigation systems. Additional interior and exterior accessories were available from Honda's Modulo line. Modulo accessories offered include interior trim (shift knobs, decals, etc.), foglights, aero kits (front/side/rear bumper enhancements), wing spoilers, alloy wheels, push button start, upgraded speakers, and navigation.|$|R

The Z06 is available with a Tremec seven-speed manual with rev-matching technology or a Hydra-Matic 8L90 eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. It also has a removable carbon fiber roof panel, uniquely calibrated SLA-type front and rear suspension design, standard Magnetic Selective Ride Control dampers, standard smart electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD) integrated with Electronic Stability Control and Performance Traction Management systems, 19x10-inch front and 20x12-inch rear spin-cast aluminum wheels on Michelin Pilot Sport P285/30ZR19 front and 335/25ZR20 rear tires, extended fenders by 56 mm at the front and 80 mm at the rear, Brembo brakes (371x33mm front and 365x25mm rear two-piece steel brake discs, aluminum six-piston front and four-piston rear fixed calipers), a front splitter, spats around the front wheel openings, a unique carbon-fiber hood with a larger vent, larger front fender vents and unique air blades over the inlets on the rear fenders, a larger unique rear spoiler, and rear-fascia openings that are larger than the Stingray.

40|$|Biological macromolecules such as {{proteins}} are remarkable {{machines at}} the nano scale. The mechanical motion of proteins that {{is present in}} every living system allows those molecules to perform theie specific tasks. Most proteins are enzymes. Enzymes bind to their substrates, speed up the chemical reaction and release the products. Upon this binding and unbinding they undergo a large conformational motion. In case of Guanylate Kinase, the protein under study in my thesis, this deformation is about 1 nm, relatively large compared to the enzyme’s size (~ 4 nm). This conformational motion {{is essential to the}} protein’s activity. Proteins are not rigid solids, but rather deformable, wiggling and jiggling inside a medium. This deformability is a general materials property of a folded protein. Enzymes can be deformed and their activity can be modulated by perturbations other than ligand binding. Fluctuations of enzymes have been studied {{for a long time and}} although some progress has been made, still much is unknown about proteins dynamics. In my thesis I try to reveal a little more about proteins dynamics by studying the effect of different kinds of perturbations. For this purpose, a nano-rheology technique is used which allows us to detect deformations as small as half an Angstrom. In this technique we look at the molecule as a whole: the <b>interior</b> polymer chain <b>wrapped</b> by the surface hydration layer. An oscillatory force is applied to the protein, and the amplitude of the resulting oscillation is measured. It has been shown previously, that enzymes are viscoelastic: dissipative at low frequencies and elastic at higher frequencies. I have looked, more closely, for the origin of this atomic scale dissipation. First, I study the contribution of the hydration layer, which is an integral part of the molecule, by modifying it using an order-inducing compound: Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), which, at small concentrations is harmless to a protein’s native forms. This compound was added to the molecule’s surface, i. e. the hydration shell, and formed strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Even at small DMSO concentrations a significant change in the dynamics was observed: the enzyme became stiffer. The effect is bigger at lower frequencies where enzyme shows dissipative behavior. In that sense, DMSO makes the enzyme more dissipative. For the first time with this experimental setup, I measured the phase of the response (i. e. the phase difference between the applied force and the resulting deformation, which is basically the imaginary part of the amplitude). Having the ability to measure the phase, we have direct access to dissipation measurements. Phase measurements also revealed that DMSO makes the enzyme more dissipative, which suggest that the hydration layer partially controls the viscoelastic behavior. Then I investigated at the contribution of the interior, i. e. the polymer chain bulk. To do so I induced point mutations in specific residues of the amino-acid sequence. The mutation points are in a region that goes under a huge strain as the enzyme goes from an open to a closed configuration. Surprisingly, one of the mutated proteins is 10 times more active than the wild type, meaning that the rate of the enzymatic reaction is 10 times faster with the mutated enzyme. Mechanics of the mutated proteins were studied using the same nano-rheology technique, and some changes were observed, suggesting that both the interior and the surface contribute to dissipation. I then looked at the deformation caused by ligand binding, in order to see if there is any difference in how different mutants deform upon binding the substrates or unbinding the products. Since the effect of ligand binding is small, our detection method was improved to increase the sensitivity and therefore be able to detect these small deformations. It was seen that some ligands make the enzyme softer while others make the enzyme stiffer. In some cases ligand binding’s signature was only detectable in phase measurements. Overall the conformational change caused by ligand binding was very similar among different mutants, with one exception. For one of the ligands (Guanylate monophosphate-GMP, which makes the enzyme stiffer) the fast mutant seems to have two binding events: one at low concentrations of the ligand and one at higher concentrations, whereas in the wild type only the low-concentration binding event is observed. It seems like the hyperactive mutant might have two binding sites for GMP: at higher concentrations, GMP might bind to ATP binding site. This is a case where specificity is traded off with speed: the mutant is faster but less specific. Overall, some of my main results are: - Hydration layer is an integral part of the molecule which is partially responsible for dissipation. - Both interior and the surface contribute to the viscoelastic behavior. A dissipative contribution in the elastic regime is observed which can be associated with a second dissipation term, namely the one of the bulk. - Phase measurements provide direct access to dissipation measurements at the atomic scale...|$|R
