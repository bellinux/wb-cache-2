5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as he felt it was important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{three of}} the {{previous}} five years, the legislature had {{failed to meet the}} June 30 deadline. On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2. Aides to Corzine claimed that the governor felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to order the shutdown under the state's Constitution.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E
5000|$|A meek senior {{insurance}} company officer finds himself being neatly blackmailed regarding the first sexual misadventure of his life. Surely <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to pay...|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{that more}} {{will come in}} search of him, LeConte realizes <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to leave Earth, {{inviting}} Keller to come along with him in search of new worlds.|$|R
50|$|Once {{defeated}} by Vash, Legato demands that Vash finish him, threatening {{the life of}} Livio and everyone else Vash holds dear. Feeling <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> Vash shoots Legato in the head. Legato dies smiling.|$|R
5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E
5|$|In November 1276, war was declared. Initial {{operations}} were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen. In July 1277 Edward invaded {{with a force}} of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen. The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to surrender. By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, he was left only with the land of Gwynedd, though {{he was allowed to}} retain the title of Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The raking fire inflicted massive {{damage and}} {{casualties}} on the French ship, and although Dénian continued to resist for some time, his ship {{was no longer}} effectively able to respond once Saumarez had crossed his bow. Eventually, with Circe now rapidly approaching with a strengthening of the wind, Dénian accepted that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to surrender his vessel after an engagement lasting two hours and ten minutes. The cutter, which had been ignored during the battle, successfully escaped to Cherbourg while the captain of Sémillante, anchored in the harbour, made a fruitless effort to reach the engagement, delayed by contrary wind and tides that prevented the frigate from sailing.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, Tahn fleet {{intercepts}} Sten's convoy and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> than attack his numerically superior opponent. When his transports {{manage to}} escape, Sten surrenders his heavily damaged ship and both Sten and Alex are captured by Tahn.|$|R
50|$|Nick {{is desperately}} {{in love with}} Franky, but it's a one-way street. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept Franky as his friend and nothing more, while his love for her grows with each passing day. Then Matty gets in touch - he's {{still in love with}} Franky and needs Nick's help {{to get him out of}} Morocco and back to Bristol. Ever loyal, Nick tries to put his {{feelings}} for Franky aside and agrees to help his brother. Torn between his love for Franky, his loyalty to Matty and his fear of confrontation, Nick's life begins to spin wildly out of control until <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to step up and discover what he's truly capable of.|$|R
50|$|Ashamed, Chris quietly {{attempts}} {{to resign from}} CID. A disgusted Hunt views the resignation as cowardice and refuses, telling him that although he won't go to prison, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to stay on and bear {{the consequences of his}} betrayal.|$|R
5|$|Blamey felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> but his {{assumption}} of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, {{the commander of}} I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a {{lack of confidence in}} him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Stephen Tomašević's expectations, Bobovac fell within days. The King {{had already}} {{realized}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> {{but to take}} refuge in the neighbouring Croatia or Dalmatia. Angelović tirelessly pursued him, and {{caught up with him}} in Ključ. The Ottoman army was reportedly about to pass the city's fortress, not suspecting that the King was hiding within its walls, when a local man revealed his whereabouts in return for money. A four-day-long siege of the fortress ensued. Eager to capture him, Angelović had his messengers solemnly promise the King that he would be done no harm if he surrendered, and sent him a document guaranteeing him freedom. With food supplies and ammunition running short, Stephen decided to surrender himself and his garrison to Angelović. Angelović, in turn, brought him, his uncle Radivoj and 13-year-old cousin Tvrtko before Mehmed in Jajce.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{opens with}} Godber and Harris {{carrying}} a metal folding bed into Fletcher’s cell. Predictably, Fletcher {{is not happy}} with the situation, but Mr Barrowclough tells him <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> due to the increase in crime and limited prison resources.|$|R
50|$|Ann Reece, the Tweener agent, again frees him, {{brings him}} to their city, {{where he is}} hypnotically programmed. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to carry out his}} mission, to enter the Shadow city and shut off its {{defensive}} energy field, so that an air raid might destroy the Shadows.|$|R
50|$|The raid is a disaster, {{and they}} are {{captured}} by Kandemirians. Interrogated {{by the head of}} the Kandemirian forces, Tarkamat, Donnan is told that if he refuses to re-create the technology for Kandemir, his crew will die horribly, one by one. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to comply.|$|R
5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he {{felt a sense of}} satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On {{the last day of the}} examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E
25|$|El Temür again asked Budashiri {{to install}} El Tegüs {{but it was}} {{declined}} again. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to invite Toghun Temür back from far-away Guangxi in southwest China.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{gave the}} men light sentences. Langston and Bushnell sued for a writ {{of habeas corpus}} in 1859 in the Ohio Supreme Court, but it ruled against them, with the judge saying <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to uphold the federal law.|$|E
50|$|The new vicar (Michael Hordern) of St. Peter's Church is {{astonished}} {{to learn that}} the long-serving verger, Albert Foreman (James Hayter), is illiterate. When Foreman is too set in his ways to want to learn to read, the vicar feels <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to sack him.|$|R
50|$|Wen <b>He</b> unknowingly <b>has</b> {{an affair}} with Zhenzhu under the {{influence}} of alcohol. Soon after, Zhenzhu discovers she is pregnant. When Wen He finds out, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to take responsibility. Wen Qing discovers what happened, and hits the roof. However, Zhenzhu miscarriages. Wen Qing reluctantly forgives Wen He.|$|R
60|$|It was {{unfortunate that}} Adair {{had won the}} toss. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to take first innings. The weather had been bad for the last week, and the wicket was slow and treacherous. It was likely to get worse during the day, so Adair had chosen to bat first.|$|R
25|$|During {{the buildup}} to the 2010 World Cup, Van Nistelrooy again made himself available, but was left {{out by the}} Netherlands' new coach Bert van Marwijk. After being left out for the World Cup, Van Nistelrooy said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to face the fact}} that his {{international}} career is finished.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} twenty-five, he {{left home}} and renounced his worldly life for good. For many days he had {{traveled}} from his home to Beijing, with high hopes. To his dismay, the school had been shut down due to military confrontations among warlords. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to return to Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|With Saumarez {{about to}} cross his bow and Circe now rapidly {{approaching}} {{due to a}} strengthening wind, Dénian realised <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to surrender his vessel. The engagement had lasted two hours and ten minutes during which time the cutter, Espérance, managed to escape to Cherbourg. The French frigate Sémillante, which had been anchored in the harbour, was unable to come to Réunion's rescue because of contrary wind and tides.|$|E
50|$|Huang Rong is an {{excellent}} cook. She prepared several fine dishes for Hong Qigong {{to ask him to}} teach Guo Jing martial arts. Hong Qigong has a penchant for fine cuisine and could not resist the temptation that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to keep his promise and teach Guo Jing.|$|R
50|$|Hadubrand {{takes this}} as a ruse {{to get him off}} guard and belligerently refuses the offer, accusing Hildebrand of deception, and perhaps {{implying}} cowardice. Hildebrand accepts his fate and sees that he cannot honourably refuse battle: <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to kill his own son or be killed by him.|$|R
5000|$|Finally realizing <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> <b>he</b> {{breaks down}} {{and for the}} first time goes to apply for food stamps. He spends all day at the [...] "North Seattle Food Bank" [...] being shuffled from one line to another until they tell him that the {{earliest}} he can receive assistance will be in 5 days.|$|R
25|$|Hassan-i Sabbah {{continued}} his missionary activities, which climaxed with his taking {{of the famous}} citadel of Alamut. Over the next two years, he converted most of the surrounding villages to Ismailism. Afterwards, he converted most of the staff to Ismailism, took over the fortress, and presented Alamut's king with payment for his fortress, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept. The king reluctantly abdicated his throne, and Hassan-i Sabbah turned Alamut into an outpost of Fatimid rule within Abbasid territory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 228, defectors from Wei's rival state, Wu, claimed that Wu forces were {{preparing}} to attack the territories north of the Yangtze River, with the Wu emperor Sun Quan personally leading his forces. Man Chong deduced that the Wu forces were deliberately spreading misinformation and that their true target was Xiyang County (西陽縣; southwest of present-day Guangshan County, Henan), so he gave orders to strengthen the defences at Xiyang County. When Sun Quan found out, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to call off the attack.|$|E
25|$|Lü Yi's {{ancestral home}} was in Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡), which is around present-day Nanyang, Henan. His father, Lü Chang (呂常), escorted Liu Yan into Yi Province (益州; {{covering}} present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) around 188 when Liu Yan was appointed as the Governor of Yi Province {{by the central}} government of the Eastern Han dynasty. After completing his mission, Lü Chang could not return to Nanyang Commandery because the road was obstructed, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to remain in Yi Province and settle down there. Lü Yi was most probably born in Yi Province.|$|E
5000|$|Stuck {{with the}} {{nickname}} [...] "Dreadnought," [...] Dickie Marchant (Brian Rix) feels <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to pursue a}} career as a boxer. To mollify his uncle (Leo Franklyn), Rix pretends to be the soul of religiosity, while his tough-talking manager Walter 'Wally' Burton (William Hartnell) poses as a man of the cloth.|$|R
50|$|This Casey {{is shown}} to be a good man who only fights crime on his own when he feels like <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> <b>He</b> does not use a wide array of weapons, opting for just his hockey stick and later a lead pipe. The film ends with Casey and April {{arranging}} to go on a date.|$|R
50|$|Then Cramer arrives. After some {{preliminary}} hostilities, Wolfe gives Cramer the bullet that Archie shot using Mrs. Hazen's gun. He suggests that Cramer {{compare it with}} the bullet that killed Mr. Hazen. By now Cramer is puce in the face; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to leave with the bullet and without either Wolfe or Archie.|$|R
