40|$|On {{behalf of}} GATE Intelligent Support AB an energy audit has been {{conducted}} {{in the spring of}} 2015. The project was to develop an energy audit at an <b>industrial</b> <b>premise</b> in Vännäs municipality. Vännäs Fastigheter AB is the owner of this venue and has recently received complaints from tenants about an cold indoor climate in the property. Furthermore, it emerged that the property's future energy supply of heating is uncertain. Therefore a separate project to find an alternative heating sources solution has been initialized. This report will place great emphasis on changes, which lead to an improved indoor climate as to energy savings. To achieve this plan and to make it more understandable the simulation program IDA ICE has been used throughout the whole paper. Additionally, economic calculations for an LCC-analysis including repayment time has been done to compare the measures easier. Results from this project have demonstrated that this <b>industrial</b> <b>premise</b> can when all energy saving measures are carried out, reduce their energy consumption from 299 MWh per year to 129 MWh per year. This means a total decrease of 56. 9 %. The inspection of the property reveals shortcomings in the existing heating system. The current radiator system was configured wrong which resulted in a significant reduction of the heat outcome. This was not just done by changing settings of the radiator system but as well by adjusting the ventilationsystem to the business conditions of the property. ...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{there are}} {{industries}} that utilize AGVs to transport goods and materials from one location to another. For smaller scale industries it is costly {{to have a}} custom made AGV for their manufacturing unit, so they modify {{the shape of an}} AGV to accommodate the necessity of carrying and transporting goods. When the shape of an AGV is modified the built-in sensors will not detect the change in shape of the AGV. Hence, there is a risk that the AGV may collide with objects. Also in some AGVs floor sensors are missing to detect the presence of floor/no floor in front of the AGV, which can be a hazardous situation as there are chances of the AGV falling off from the surface. An example of such an AGV is the Patrolbot which can travel around in an <b>industrial</b> <b>premise</b> wirelessly, but needs addition of such sensors to avoid collisions with the modified structure. A Patrolbot has been used in this thesis work and ultrasonic sensors are utilised for obstacle detection with a modified structure and a built-in laser scanner is studied for mapping purpose. The results of this master thesis was that the ultrasonic sensors were tested under various conditions and results were derived. To obtain the same level of results every time it is required to maintain the conditions on which the ultrasonic sensors rely...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{air distribution}} {{systems that are}} based on confluent jets; this system can be of interest for the establishment of indoor environments, to fulfill the goals of indoor climate and energy-efficient usage. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide deeper understanding of the flow field development of a supply device that is designed based on wall confluent jets and to investigate the ventilation performance by experimental and numerical methods. In this study, the supply device can be described as an array of round jets on a flat surface attached to a side wall. Multiple round jets that issue from supply device apertures are combined at a certain distance downstream from the device and behave as a united jet or so-called confluent jets. Multiple round jets that are generated from the supply device move downward and are attached to the wall at the primary region, due to the Coanda effect, and then they become wall confluent jets until the floor wall is reached. A wall jet in a secondary region is formed along the floor after the stagnation region. The characteristics of the flow field and the ventilation performance of conventional wall confluent jets and modified wall confluent jets supply devices are investigated experimentally in an office test room. The study of the modified wall confluent jets is intended to improve the efficiency of the conventional one while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort in an office environment. The results show that the modified wall confluent jets supply device can provide acceptable thermal comfort for the occupant with lower airflow rate compared to the conventional wall confluent jets supply device. Numerical predictions using three turbulence models (renormalization group (RNG k– ε), realizable (Re k– ε), and shear stress transport (SST k– ω) are evaluated by measurement results. The computational box and nozzle plate models are used to model the inlet boundary conditions of the nozzle device. In the isothermal study, the wall confluent jets in the primary region and the wall jet in the secondary region, when predicted by the three turbulence models, are in good agreement with the measurements. The non-isothermal validation studies show that the SST k– ω model is slightly better at predicting the wall confluent jets than the other two models. The SST k– ω model is used to investigate the effects of the nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle array configuration, and inlet discharge height on the ventilation performance of the proposed wall confluent jets supply device. The nozzle diameter and number of nozzles play important roles in determining the airflow pattern, temperature field, and draught distribution. Increased temperature stratification and less draught distribution are achieved by increasing the nozzle diameter and number of nozzles. The supply device with smaller nozzle diameters and fewer nozzles yields rather uniform temperature distribution due to the dominant effect of mixing. The flow behavior is nearly independent of the inlet discharge height for the studied range. The proposed wall confluent jets supply device is compared with a mixing supply device, impinging supply device and displacement supply device. The results show that the proposed wall confluent jets supply device has the combined behavior of both mixing and stratification principles. The proposed wall confluent jets supply device provides better overall ventilation performance than the mixing and displacement supply devices used in this study. This study covers also another application of confluent jets that is based on impinging technology. The supply device under consideration has an array of round jets on a curve. Multiple jets issue from the supply device aperture, in which the supply device is positioned vertically and the jets are directed against a target wall. The flow behavior and ventilation performance of the impinging confluent jets supply device is studied experimentally in an <b>industrial</b> <b>premise.</b> The results show that the impinging confluent jets supply device maintains acceptable thermal comfort in the occupied zone by creating well-distributed airflow during cold and hot seasons...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{irregular}} geometrical patterns of <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> and {{items of the}} process machinery installed in <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> cause redistribution of the acoustic energy and its essential acoustic properties, including the average free path length, the reverberation time, and the average sound absorption coefficient. Any failure {{to take account of}} the above influence causes errors in identification of the sound pressure intensity and in assessment of efficiency of design and acoustics-related actions aimed at noise reduction that incorporate sound-proof facing. The authors present the results of simulation of acoustic processes in the premises that have items of process machinery installed, and analyze their influence on the sound absorption intensity. The software developed {{on the basis of the}} beam tracing method is designated to assess the influence of patterns of arrangement of items of equipment onto acoustic parameters of premises. The software comprises independent modules designated for the simulation of acoustic processes in different premises that demonstrate different acoustic properties. The results of the research demonstrate that the software simulation of noise processes on the basis of the method of beam tracing is an effective tool that may be effectively applied in the analysis of noise patterns inside <b>industrial</b> <b>premises.</b> The software may be employed to identify integrated acoustic patterns inside <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> with account for the influence of dimensions of premises, characteristics of items of process machinery capable of disseminating sounds, etc. and other factors of signifi cance in terms of the distribution of reflected sound energy.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is important both {{to reduce costs}} and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Reducing costs will also help maintain business competitiveness. Scania in Södertälje is a company where the optimization of energy use is an ongoing and continual process. One area with potential to make energy and cost savings is {{the effectiveness of the}} ventilation systems in offices and <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> at Scania. During the summer months an increased demand for cooling occurs, leading to increased ventilation and a peak in district cooling system usage. Sorptive cooling is a technology where the supplied air is cooled by applying external heat. This technique involves a reduction in electricity consumption compared to electrically-powered cooling machines and does not affect the district cooling system usage. It was therefore of interest to investigate if sorptive cooling would be an energy efficient and viable solution for Scania in the future. This investigation shows that sorptive cooling requires more power than a conventional ventilation system. Despite the fact that Scania has access to free heat during the summer months, the study shows that sorptive cooling would not be economically viable to install in the <b>industrial</b> <b>premises,</b> where no cooling systems currently exist. However, compared to an electrically-powered cooling machine, sorptive cooling is anyway more energy efficient.
