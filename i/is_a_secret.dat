It is a one-storeyed structure for the Sultan to meditate, or some said, a hiding place for the royal family during an attack. Another name for this island is Sumur Gumantung, because on {{the south side of}} this island is a well that hangs above the ground. This place could only be reached via the underwater tunnel.

Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco, which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men. Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov.

5|$|In The King of Fighters '99 Iori <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> {{character}} in most {{versions of the}} game.

In the story, Iori discovers the creation of Kyo clones and enters the annual tournament where he finds those responsible, an organization named NEST. Iori follows the battles in secret and fights against the Nests' agents to continue his fight against Kyo. An assistant version of his character, named Striker, also appears for Iori in The King of Fighters 2000 but with an outfit based on his illustrations from artbooks. In The King of Fighters 2001, an agent named Seth invites Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, presuming that he would get his shot against Kyo. While his regular form appears in KOF 2002, his Orochi form is also featured in the PlayStation 2 port from the game as well as the remake of KOF '98.

In the following video game, Iori and Kyo form a team once again with Kyo's student Shingo Yabuki to fill Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. At the end of the tournament, the strengthening presence of Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood state, in which he attacks his comrades. Ash appears afterward and defeats Iori, stealing his powers. Iori is a playable {{character in}} The King of Fighters XII. Iori is featured with a different outfit, and with a new moveset, that does not use purple flames. Like each character, he does not have a team. Iori's appearance in The King of Fighters XIII sees him teamed with his former team members from the 1996 tournament, Mature and Vice, who return as spirits.
