5000|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate,</b> an {{alkaline}} salt, {{is produced}} in two forms. One is a clear, liquid concentrate, which can be mistaken for corn syrup if repackaged and not properly labeled or it is packaged as a white, odorless, powdered chemical substance that is not flammable, combustible, or explosive and has low acute oral and dermal toxicity. This salt, which is commonly confused with boric acid, is used as an insecticide and is commonly sold in liquid or powder form. It is also effective against fungi and algae. It has an infinite shelf life and is not affected by temperature. [...] "Bora-Care" [...] is the liquid form suitable {{for use in a}} sprayer. The powdered brands are [...] "Tim-Bor," [...] "Borathor," [...] "Termite Prufe" [...] or [...] "Board Defense" [...] as sold in the United States, and as [...] "Can-Bor" [...] in Canada. This chemical is also a flame-retardant. [...] In the liquid form, it is commonly diluted and sprayed on wood surfaces to kill termites, powder post beetles, carpenter ants, fungi and algae. It is also available as pellets for embedding in structural wood. This alkaline salt is {{not to be confused with}} boric acid (an acidic chemical) or the laundry detergent additive used for stains.|$|E
5000|$|Boric acid, oxides and salts (borates) are {{effective}} wood preservatives and are supplied under numerous brand names throughout the world. One {{of the most}} common compounds used is <b>disodium</b> <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> (commonly abbreviated DOT). Borate treated wood is of low toxicity to humans, and does not contain copper or other heavy metals. However, unlike most other preservatives, borate compounds do not become fixed in the wood and can be partially leached out if exposed repeatedly to water that flows away rather than evaporating (evaporation leaves the borate behind so is not a problem). Even though leaching will not normally reduce boron concentrations below effective levels for preventing fungal growth, borates should not be used where they will be exposed to repeated rain, water or ground contact unless the exposed surfaces are treated to repel water. [...] Zinc-borate compounds are less suspectible to leaching than sodium-borate compounds, but are still not recommended for below-ground use unless the timber is first sealed. Recent interest in low toxicity timber for residential use, along with new regulations restricting some wood preservation agents, has resulted in a resurgence of the use of borate treated wood for floor beams and internal structural members. Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have developed organoborates which are much more resistant to leaching, while still providing timber with good protection from termite and fungal attack. The cost of the production of these modified borates will limit their widespread take-up but {{they are likely to be}} suitable for certain niche applications, especially where low mammalian toxicity is of paramount importance.|$|E

40|$|The eighth {{annual report}} details {{continued}} progress {{on each of}} the five objectives. In this year's report, Objectives II and III from previous reports have been combined to reflect the similarity of each effort. Improved fumigants: The previously established field trials continue to demonstrate the superior performance of both chioropicrin and Vorlex after 18 years in poles and 13 years in piling. In addition, solid methylisothiocyanate (MIT) continues to protect Douglas-fir poles {{in a manner similar to}} Vorlex. Along with evaluations of existing registered formulations, we continue to explore the use of novel solid fumigants for their ability to arrest decay in Douglas-fir heartwood. Laboratory studies indicate that both Mylone and sodium n-methyldithiocarbamate (NaMDC) can be pelletized to improve handling safety. Previous studies indicate that the rate of decomposition to produce MIT is often too slow for effective fungal control, but the incorporation of certain buffers or metallic salts can alter the rate and characteristics of chemical decomposition. In our tests, the levels of chemical release varied with PH; however, complete fungal control was not achieved. Further studies are underway to determine if other conditions can alter the rate of MIT production by these compounds. Both chemicals are registered for other, nonfood uses and should be registerable for application to wood. Efforts to better understand the properties of MIT, the major fungitoxic product of both Vorlex and Vapam, are also continuing. These efforts have led to the development of a preliminary model to describe fumigant movement through Douglas-fir heartwood. The goal of this work is optimize treatment dosage and application patterns for various pole sizes. In addition to the more theoretical studies, we are continuing our efforts to determine the ability of fumigants to control decay fungi in poles containing large decay voids and to determine the levels of volatile emissions from fumigant treated wood. Field treatment: The field tests to evaluate potential replacements for pentachlorophenol (penta) treatment of western redcedar sapwood were evaluated after 7 years using the Aspergillus bioassay. The results indicate that residual levels of chemical were detectable in the penta treatments, but the remaining test chemicals exhibited little evidence of residual fungitoxicity. Further decay tests are planned on material removed from these pole sections. In addition to the pole sections, the small-scale test blocks were also evaluated using the Aspergillus bioassay. The results indicate that several chemicals remained in the wood at fungitoxic levels after one year of accelerated weathering. Further decay tests are also planned on these samples. The bolt hole study is now in its seventh year and the incidence of decay fungi in the test poles remains low. Variations in incidence from year to year have made it difficult to draw any useful conclusions from this study. To overcome this problem, a second test has been established which accelerates leaching and evaluates the ability of a test fungus to invade the field drilled bolt hole to cause wood weight loss. Decay detection and residual strength: We continue to evaluate the use of lectins for detecting fungal colonization at the early stages. This past year, we completed a comparison of colonization by three common decay fungi over a 12 week period. The search for small-scale methods for estimating residual strength is also continuing. Longitudinal compression measurements were used to determine residual strength of a pole involved in an automobile accident. ii Finally, we have completed portions of a study to determine the effects of fungal colonization on wood strength. Four fungi, Poria carbonica, Poria placenta, Peniophora spp., and Haematostereum sanguinolentum were evaluated in this study. Results with P. carbonica and Peniophora spp. indicate strength effects lag behind fungal colony development in small beams. These results were similar to previous field studies and indicate that air-seasoning for 2 to 3 years should not produce significant strength losses. Further studies with these fungi are underway. Initiation of decay in air-seasoning Douglas-fir: While the air-seasoning studies are now completed, we are continuing to evaluate the data from these tests. A detailed examination of the three year decay development study indicates that several fungi were typically found only in the heartwood or sapwood zones of the pole sections. In addition, the fungal flora at the four seasoning sites varied widely, with the greatest deviation occurring at the Oroville, CA. This site has the driest and warmest conditions, and would appear to be best site for seasoning. A detailed discussion of isolation frequency by position is presented for the eleven most common basidiomycetes. Studies to prevent colonization by basidiomycetes during air-seasoning are also continuing using polyborate dips or sprays. Sodium <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> appears to reduce the level of colonization after one year of air-seasoning at both Oroville and Corvallis, OR. Dipping shortly after peeling appeared to produce the best results, although spraying at regular intervals also had some effect on colonization. This study will continue for an additional two years. Determining the ability of existing pressure treatment cycles to eliminate fungi which colonize Douglas-fir poles during air-seasoning also remains a high priority. Only a few additional schedules were examined during iv the past year, but efforts to develop more realistic heating curves are under way. In addition, several questions concerning the accuracy of the existing data were answered. Additional studies using the Cellon process and the longer steaming period for the ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate treatments are planned in the coming year. While sterilization during preservative treatment is an important factor in pole longevity, questions have also arisen concerning the storage of poles for long periods after treatment. A survey of poles which were treated with creosote, pentachiorophenol, chromated copper arsenate, and ammoniacal copper arsenate prior to storage for one to 15 years was conducted. While colonization varied widely between sites, the results indicated that storage of poles for long periods substantially increased the risk that the pole would be placed in service with an active decay fungus established somewhere along its length. Several suggestions are made for remedying this situation. Effect of microfunqi on Douglas-fir poles: A study was conducted to determine the effect of microfungi which commonly colonize fumigant treated Douglas-fir heartwood on the ability of P. carbonica and P. placenta to cause wood weight loss in fumigant treated wood. The results indicate that several isolates were associated with reduced weight losses by these fungi. The decreased weight losses suggest that the microfungi could be colonizing fumigant treated poles prior to the basidiomycetes and, once there, could help prevent reinvasion. This scheme may help explain the remarkable protection provided by fumigant treatment. Further studies are underway to explore this possibility...|$|R

Arenas were established both in the laboratory and in the field. Initial tunnel formation was unaffected by the presence of borate treated wood. Avoidance of borate treated wood developed after ca. 3 - 5 days. Termites did not avoid borate treated wood as a result of necrophobic behavior. Termite responses when the locations of the treated and untreated wafers were switched within the arenas indicated that the delayed avoidance was related to the location of the treated wood rather than to recognition of the chemical treatment.

Significant reduction in boron leachability in samples treated with monoglycerides was observed compared to the standalone boron treated specimens.

40|$|Bagasse, or {{sugarcane}} rind, is a fibrous {{by-product of}} sugar extraction from sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L. Bagasse fiber performs similarly to hardwood fiber in composite board products. In laboratory studies, Formosan subterranean termites survived {{as well on}} a diet of bagasse as on Douglas-fir wood. Field tests with a compressed bagasse panel (produced by heat extrusion) indicated that termites readily penetrated the acrylic/vinyl latex coating on the panel, and tunneled throughout the interior bagasse fibers. Treatment of the fibers with <b>disodium</b> <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> did not prevent termite penetration of the panel exterior. Subsequent moisture sorption by the fibers led to rapid swelling and deformation of the panels. A dimensionally stable, high density bagasse particleboard was also evaluated in laboratory tests.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Boron and boron {{compounds}} {{have been}} long used for pressure treatment, dip-diffusion, and remedial treatments of wood {{because of their}} proven efficacy against fungi and insects. These materials are especially attractive because their high water solubility promotes deeper penetration into wood. Other useful properties of boron include its neutral pH, non-corrosiveness, lack of color or odor, and little or no effect on wood strength. Boron also has low-mammalian toxicity and minimal environmental effects. However, high water solubility limits outdoor applications because the boron will leach from the wood when it is exposed to rain or is in direct soil contact. Boron is widely used as a component in external remedial pastes, primarily as <b>disodium</b> <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> (DOT).

In 14 previously unthinned stands of Norway spruce, the efficacy of mechanized stump treatments with <b>disodium</b> <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> (DOT), Phlebiopsis gigantea (Fr.) Jül. and urea was compared with no treatment of stumps cut {{in the summer and}} winter, and with manual treatment. Stump treatment reduced the stump area colonized by H. annosum s. l. by 88 - 99 % as compared with untreated stumps cut in the summer. In terms of colonized stump area, there were neither differences between compounds, nor between mechanized and manual treatments. Sensitivity of root rot antagonist P. gigantea spores to high temperature or pressure was tested in laboratory and field experiments using a mechanized application. The spores withstood 1, 600 - 2, 200 kPa for 24 h without losing viability. Spore germination of P. gigantea had an optimum at c. 30 ºC. Mechanized application under normal summer conditions in Sweden did not obstruct spore germination of P. gigantea. Functions for predicting the probability of decay in individual trees were developed using logistic regression from data in the Swedish national forest inventory 1983 - 2001. The functions use data readily available in most stand records, and are recommended for strategic, tactical and operational planning. Models for simulation of disease development were developed based on known facts about the mode of infection and spread of H. annosum s. l. in Fennoscandian coniferous forests. The economic outcomes for a number of stands typical of Swedish forest management were modelled and predicted using the models for H. annosum s. l. dynamics and models for cross-cutting of trees. Stump treatment in thinning and previous final felling was profitable (interest rates 1, 3 and 5 %) in pure stands of Norway spruce and in mixed conifer stands in southern Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] lumber was {{converted}} to flakes, which were dip treated with three concentrations each of copper chrome arsenate Type C (CCA-C), and <b>disodium</b> <b>octaborate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> (TIM-BOR). Azaconazole [1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichloropheny 1) - 1, 3 - dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl]- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole] {{was used as}} powder. The flakeboard panels (305 x 304 x 13 mm) were made using phenolformaldehyde powdered resin and wax. Distribution of CCA and TIM-BOR in treated flakes and panels was examined using x-ray fluorescence and titration methods. Concentrations were greater in the ends of flakes than in the center. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) showed that CCA distribution was quite uniform on the surfaces examined. Concentrations of CCA and TIM-BOR in selected panel zones were uniform, indicating that the chemicals did not migrate significantly during panel manufacture. Distribution of azaconazole was not examined because a reliable method was not available. In water leaching test. CCA and azaconazole {{were found to be}} resistant to leaching, while TIM-BOR was not. Samples were tested for decay resistance using the soil block and vermiculite burial tests. Trametes versicolor, a white rot fungus, and Phialophora heteromorpha, a soft rot fungus, caused very low weight losses and did not appear to actively colonize even the untreated controls. Postia placenta, a brown rot fungus, caused substantial weight losses in untreated controls. With the latter fungus, CCA performed better than azaconazole and TIM-BOR, producing the lowest weight loss. The highest weight losses were associated with TIM-BOR, although some of the weight loss may have resulted from leaching during the decay test. The effect of each test chemical on dimensional stability, static bending and internal bond (IB) properties of treated panel was evaluated. When exposed to hot wet conditions, TIM-BOR treated samples had large thickness swell compared to CCA and azaconazole, and often delaminated. Samples placed in hot dry conditions had very small dimensional changes over time. In static bending and internal bond tests, strength reductions for TIM-BOR and CCA treated samples were clearly evident; however, reductions for TIM-BOR treated panels were greater than those for CCA. Azaconazole showed no deleterious effect on strength and generally performed well. A discussion of needs for future research is included. Those include a fundamental understanding of the interaction of preservative chemical within flakes and mats prior to pressing, during pressing, and in service. In addition, the need to establish more appropriate means {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} treatment is identified Environmental safety, both during processing and in-service, is also identified as an important factor...|$|E
