Both 2 D and 3 D high speed imaging techniques {{have been developed for}} this purpose. To maximize the accuracy of the predictions, a specific illumination level is required. This paper describes the development of a high irradiance LED system for high speed motion estimation of fertilizer particles. A spectral sensitivity factor was used to select the optimal LED in relation to the used camera from a range of commercially available high power LEDs. A multiple objective genetic algorithm was used to find the optimal configuration of LEDs resulting in the most homogeneous irradiance in the target area. Simulations were carried out for different lenses and number of LEDs. The chosen configuration resulted in an average irradiance level of 452 W/m 2 with coefficient of variation less than 2 %. The algorithm proved superior and more flexible to other approaches reported in the literature and can be used for various other applications...|$|E

40|$|Current Mechanical {{fertilizer}} applicators using centrifugal spreading {{system could}} not be applied to young palm oil trees (under 5 years old) and hence needed to be modified. The research was to design a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading</b> system, using a pneumatic system. The design used a positive type pneumatic pressure to blow the granular fertilizer out of the metering device to the soil surface around the tree. The metering device was designed to deliver the fertilizer in several application rates, i. e. : 0. 25, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 5 kg/tree. Based on pressure drop analysis the pneumatic system needed a power of 0. 71 kW, where the blower should be rotated at 3000 rpm to produce an air flow of ± 0. 3375 m 3 /s. A This prototipe spreader was tested in the field at 0. 55 and 1. 7 m/s forward speed one at a time.

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of a manual GPS guidance system to assist farming operations is evaluated. The distribution of granular fertilizer was simulated in order to discretize areas with excessive application of fertilizers and areas with fertilizer application rates below the intended rate. The path of travel followed by a tractor with the manual GPS guidance system was analysed and compared with a commercial parallel tracking system and without guidance assistance. In addition, the analysis evaluated how the use of manual GPS guidance systems improves {{the performance}} of field operations that require large distances between passes. Under the experimental conditions used, the best results were obtained using a commercial parallel tracking system but, for our purposes, small differences were observed between the results obtained with the commercial system and the results obtained with the developed manual GPS guidance system, getting pass-to-pass average error values of 0. 26 and 0. 73 m, respectively. The results obtained with both systems were significantly better than the results obtained when no guidance assistance was used. In our trials, area with appropriate fertilizer rate was clearly increased when guidance assistance was used. Values of area with correct fertilizer rate applied ranged between 87 % with commercial parallel tracking and 59 % without guidance assistance.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} source of {{atmospheric}} ammonia. This compound reacts with nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate aerosols. Under specific meteorological conditions, these aerosols can contribute to high particulate matter concentrations in the low troposphere, which can be responsible for adverse health effects. In spring 2007, the forecasts delivered by the chemical transport model (CTM) CHIMERE within the French operational platform for air quality monitoring and forecasting PREV'AIR were underestimating PM 10 levels. In-situ observations on the aerosol composition suggested that was {{due to a lack of}} ammonium nitrate aerosol production. To increase the model capability to capture such particulate episode, we have built a coupled approach between CHIMERE and the mechanistic model VOLT'AIR (INRA). This method improves the ammonia emissions by providing a high description (spatially and temporally) of the use of manure and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading</b> and it then allows to get a more precise assessment of ammonia availability in soil. These new emission data are then used in CHIMERE to simulate the particulate matter levels in the atmosphere. The set-up of this new modelling approach will be presented, with details about the input data and the modelling tools. Results of the study carried out for France from March to April 2007 show large spatio-temporal variations of ammonia emissions. Under favourable meteorological conditions, high ammonia emissions contribute largely to aerosol formation. The comparison of results with the previously used method indicates significant differences in the spatial distribution and magnitude of ammonia emissions and therefore of secondary aerosol formation...|$|E

50|$|For example, if a {{researcher}} feeds an experimental artificial sweetener to sixty laboratory rats and observes that ten of them subsequently become sick, {{the underlying cause}} could be the sweetener itself or something unrelated. Other variables, {{which may not be}} readily obvious, may interfere with the experimental design. For instance, the artificial sweetener might be mixed with a dilutant and it might be the dilutant which causes the effect. To control for the effect of the dilutant, another treatment is added which is the dilutant alone. Now the experiment is controlled for the dilutant and the experimenter can distinguish between sweetener, dilutant and non-treatment. Controls are most often necessary where a confounding factor cannot easily be separated from the primary treatments. For example, {{it may be necessary to}} use a tractor to <b>spread</b> <b>fertilizer</b> where there is no other practicable way to <b>spread</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The simplest solution is to have a treatment where a tractor is driven over plots without <b>spreading</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and in that way the effects of tractor traffic are controlled.|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to return livestock's urine to environment safely and to reuse it as resource through biological decomposition. Most of livestock's urine, however, is disposed of unsuitably, and it is {{regarded as one of}} prime causes of water pollution now. Since 1999,livestock farmers are obligated to dispose of livestock's urine suitably by law. In the other words, livestock farmers have to pay the cost of livestock's urine disposition. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the effects and problems of the recircular process of livestock's urine practiced in Kishima area Saga Prefecture. In Kishima area, livestock's urine is reused as liquid fertilizer with a kind of simple process, by which livestock's urine simply mixed with some phosphoric acid and silicone is used as one kind of liquid fertilizer in paddy fields. The merits of the disposition process to livestock farmers can be concluded as : firtly, the cost of livestock's urine disposition can be cut considerably, secondly, farmland can be reserved by recirclar use of livestock's urine, and thidly, the labor burdan bearing with livestock's urine disposition can be lightened greatly. As well the merits to cultivation farmers include : to lighten the labor burdan of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading,</b> to cut the cost of the chemical fertilizer, to improve the quality of rice and to stabilize the yield of rice, to provide the high value-added agricultural products.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of production of mineral fertilizers, the worldwide crop yield has been increased dramatically, supplying the food for the exponentially growing population. In the 90 ’s of the 20 th century however, a major concern about the environmental implications of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading</b> has been developed. Over-doses can harm the environment seriously, {{as well as the}} crop itself. As a consequence, the spreadability of fertilizer and the uniformity of the spread pattern has become an important topic in this part of agricultural engineering. In Europe, 90 % of the <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading</b> applications are performed by centrifugal spreading. The popularity of this technique lies in their low price, easy maintenance, and large working width. However, its design is highly sensitive to machine characteristics as well as fertilizer particle properties and weather conditions (e. g. wind). As a consequence, research about the mechanism of spreading has become inevitable. A lot of effort on the influence of machine characteristics on the spread pattern has been done by Olieslagers (1997). In this thesis, the emphasis will be put on the study of fertilizer particles. These particles interact with the machine parts as well as with each other. Hereto, the “Discrete Element Method“ computational technique is introduced. Basically, DEM calculates all possible interaction between objects using force models based on spring – dashpot systems, and describes their motion using classical dynamics. By changing the physical properties of the individual particles, such a method allows a comprehensive study of the particle flow on a rotating disc. The physical properties of the fertilizer serve as the input parameters of the model. However, due to nature of fertilizer particles, they are hard to determine. Several techniques have been proposed in this thesis to provide either an accurate measurement or an acceptable estimation of these properties. The accuracy of the model will largely depend on value of the input parameter as well as the sensitivity to this parameter. Before trying to simulate the whole spreading process, the interaction of a single particle with the machine parts (e. g. disc, vanes, [...] ) of the spreader is considered. This step is primordial since it allows a decomposition of the physical problem as well as an easy validation of the simulation model with experiments. Having obtained this insight, simulations of a particle flow on the disc (multi particle simulations) can be carried out. Both the performance of these simulations and the experimental validations are intensive tasks, requiring a lot of time. However, they are mandatory in order to get full insight in the parameters that affect the spread pattern and the predictive value of the model. Generally, {{it was found that the}} DEM simulations perform qualitatively well. The cause of the deviations (below 25 %) between simulations and experiments remains uncertain but is likely to be found in the insufficient knowledge of the initial conditions of the particles (e. g. outflow of the bin) as well as the contact force mechanisms. In the light of the accuracy of the measured particle properties and the model output, a sensitivity study is carried out in this research. The main goal herby is to gain insight in the parameters that influence the spread pattern, and those who don’t. Although done in a qualitative way, such a study can provide valuable information for the manufacturer in the development of new fertilizer kinds or spreader designs. In this research, it was found that friction plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the particles on the disc, and the friction coefficients should be treated as velocity dependent parameters. An important part of the errors made by the model could be explained by this. -General introduction -The Discrete Element Method -Particle measuring methods as input for numerical models -Single particle simulations -Multi particle simulations -Model parameter sensitivity -Case study: DEM simulations of a new concept for lawn spreader -General conclusions and future outlinestatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{implemented}} a new module {{to improve the}} representation of ammonia emissions from agricultural activities in France with the objective to evaluate the impact of such emissions on the formation of particulate matter modelled with the air quality model CHIMERE. A novel method {{has been set up}} for the part of ammonia emissions originating from mineral <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading.</b> They are calculated using the one dimensional 1 D mechanistic model “VOLT’AIR” which has been coupled with data on agricultural practices, meteorology and soil properties obtained at high spatial resolution (cantonal level). These emissions display high spatiotemporal variations depending on soil pH, rates and dates of fertilization and meteorological variables, especiallysoil temperature. The emissions from other agricultural sources (animal housing, manure storage and organic manure spreading) are calculated using the national spatialised inventory (INS) recently developed in France. The comparison of the total ammonia emissions estimated with the new approach VOLT’AIR_INS with the standard emissions provided by EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) used currently in the CHIMERE model shows significant differences in the spatiotemporal distributions. The implementation of new ammonia emissions in the CHIMERE model has a limited impact on ammonium nitrate aerosol concentrations which only increase at most by 10 % on the average for the considered spring period but this impact can be more significant for specific pollution episodes. The comparison of modelled PM 10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm) and ammonium nitrate aerosol with observations shows that the use of the new ammonia emission method slightly improves the spatiotemporal correlation in certain regions and reduces the negative bias on average by 1 μg m− 3. The formation of ammonium nitrate aerosol depends not only on ammonia concentrations but also on nitric acid availability, which is often a limiting factor in rural regions in France, and on meteorological conditions. The presented approach of ammonia emission calculation seems suitable for use in chemistry transport models...|$|E

40|$|In {{every major}} European cities, aerosol {{pollution}} {{is of great}} scientific, economic, health and social concern. Despite geographical disparities, the particulate phase in urban areas is complex {{by virtue of its}} chemical composition and the multitude of emission sources. Long-term and detailed chemical speciation studies are key variables to constrain atmospheric processes and local versus continental imports leading to urban pollution episodes; European standards and legislations however mainly focus on indiscriminate mass concentrations (PM 2. 5 and PM 10). While Aerosol Mass Spectrometers (AMS) may provide valuable 'real-time' data for the chemical characterization of submicron particles, their cost and implementation as networking devices make them improper to be used for long-term measurements. Developed by Aerodyne Research Inc. (Billerica, MA), the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) measures quantitative chemical composition for non-refractory sub-micron aerosol particles. Smaller, lower cost and more robust, the ACSM is designed for long-term unattended deployment and routine monitoring applications. In this context, the infrastructure EU-FP 7 - ACTRIS program has been promoting the use of ACSM for long-term observations at background stations, among which the SIRTA/LSCE site. This station, representative of PM pollution in the region of Paris, has been equipped with an ACSM since June 2011. Co-located multi-wavelength absorption measurements (AE- 31, Magee Scientific) allow for Black Carbon source apportionment (Sciare et al. 2011). Reliable PM 1 data (TEOM-FDMS 1405 F, Thermo) are also available since February 2012. The ACSM has been providing continuous data since June 2011. This large dataset highlight raising important issues on data processing. Nevertheless, the two datasets (ACSM + BC versus PM 1) show very good temporal agreement, with a slope close to 1 (slope= 1. 08, r 2 = 0. 87), pointing out the very good consistency and long term stability of ACSM measurements. First results enlighten the major role played by organics and ammonium nitrate on PM loadings in the region of Paris (Fig. 1), especially during severe winter pollution episodes. Statistical tools, such as Potential Source Contribution Function, reveal the strong influence of continental import on secondary species (nitrate and sulphate) highest concentrations (Fig. 2). Such methodologies applied to Positive Matrix Factorization outputs will also help to better understand the sources and atmospheric processes of organic aerosols.

40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading.</b> Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading.</b> Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{inorganic}} nitrogen leaching from agriculture {{can have}} a severe and long-lasting effect on groundwater quality and it can also affect surface water quality since the contaminated groundwater can be discharged into drains in reclaimed lowland territories, like in the Po river delta. These lands lye below the actual sea level, thus they are continuously drained by pumping stations which collect the water from a capillary distributed network of channels and ditches. A complicating factor in understanding and quantify the effective leaching of nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers is the background ammonium presence in the sub-soils, due to peat layers, which provide a natural source of organic nitrogen slowly mineralized into ammonium. This implies that the geochemical inventory of ammonium-bearing sediments in peaty soils and sediments has an important control for the future development of groundwater quality in these areas. To estimate the mass of inorganic nitrogen present within the unsaturated zone below agricultural fields, a 6 ha wide site was characterized with high resolution core depth profiles. Cores were analyzed for inorganic nitrogen content (nitrate, nitrite and ammonium) and for bromide, used as nonreactive tracer. The soils and sediments within the site are highly heterogeneous, since many sedimentological environments overlapped {{during the last few}} centuries, creating vertical and lateral facies heteropies. These facies heteropies were reconstructed in a GIS environment via grain size analysis, soil organic matter content and detailed stratigraphic logs. The vertical distribution of inorganic nitrogen species is nitrate prevalent in the first meter of soil, where oxic condition prevailed (also induced by tillage and drains); ammonium is the major nitrogen species from 1 to 4 m below ground level. Where buried sandy sediments (paleochannels) are present beneath 1 m below ground level, nitrate can penetrate slightly deeper in the unsaturated zone. Nitrite is detected only in the oxic portion of the unsaturated zone, suggesting that denitrification takes place. Elevated ammonium, chloride and bromide contents are directly related with non-drained peaty sediments (lying below drains elevation), confirming their natural origin. Sharp vertical gradients were found between nitrate and ammonium/bromide, confirming that the recharge only affects the first meter of soil. The ammonium nitrogen inventory in the studied area is more than double with respect to nitrate nitrogen, and even two orders of magnitude higher than nitrite nitrogen. The impact of data quality and resolution on the derived inventory was investigated by varying the size of the considered subset of geological and geochemical data. We found that geological data resolution is less significant with respect to geochemical data. The large presence of ammonium-bearing sediments in these lowland territories makes very challenging to assess nitrogen pollution from agricultural activities, such as <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading,</b> but this natural source should be taken into account when groundwater monitoring campaigns are performed...|$|E

40|$|Since 1987 the Dept. of Agricultural Engineering and the Swedish Institute of Agricultural Engineering {{have been}} working on a project aiming at {{increasing}} the precision in and the effects of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading.</b> This part of the work concerns an investigation of the behaviour of granular flow from a studded roller feeder. Visual studies through a transparent housing of the studded roller feeder indicated that the granular flow could be divided into an active layer (the depth of which equals the stud height), a semi active layer (between the active layer and close to the base, flap) which is dragged along with the active layer, and a passive layer (directly against the base flap) where no continuous flow occurs (see Fig. 2. 1). Figure 2. 1. Active, semi active and passive layers in a studded roller feeder. Empirical flow models showed that the mean mass flow from the studded roller feeder depended on angular velocity of roller, stud height, base flap setting and median particle size. The empirical models also show that the mass flow will vary with inclination of feeder. Mechanistic flow models based on a theoretical analysis of the flow from the active and the semi active layer in the studded roller feeder showed good correlation with measured data. Analysis of the regression parameters and the residuals indicated that the models give a useful description of the flow from the feeder. The angular velocity of the roller and the stud height was found to have the biggest influence on the magnitude of the mass flow. Stud height changes both the general level of the mass flow at a given setting as well as the response of the mass flow to a change in the angular velocity of the feeder. The base flap setting was found to have a much lesser influence on the mass flow than stud height. A change in base flap setting changed the general level of the mass flow at a given setting of the feeder to a much lesser degree than a corresponding change in stud height. Furthermore, the response of the mass flow to a change in angular velocity of the feeder does not change with base flap setting. The influence of changes in particle size distribution was marginal. An explanation of this is that changes in particle size mean changes in internal friction. Since the internal friction, according to the theoretically based hypotheses, only affects the semi active layer, large changes in mass flow due to moderate changes in particle size distribution cannot be expected. The flow from the studded roller feeder will change as a function of inclination. This is a well established fact in the literature. This work show that the effects of inclination is not neglectable in a high precision spreading system where application rates are varied locally on the field. The empirical models point to a change in mass flow of ca. 0. 8 % per degree incline. The work also indicates that the mass flow from the feeder is dependent on the angle from the inlet into the feeder to the outlet (see chapter 1 "NOTATION" and Fig. 1. 1 for definitions of angles). This angle will change as a function of inclination and as a function of base flap design (eg. base flap length). According to the mechanistic flow models, {{the main part of the}} flow stems from the active layer. Mass flow variations due to inclination affect the semi active layer. As a result of the work a new idea for feeding fertilizer with the studded roller feeder was generated. If the semi active layer could be removed, the part of the feeder which is subjected to influence of inclination and friction would probably vanish. By increasing the stud height to provide enough flow and adjusting the base flap setting to zero this idea could be evaluated. The work also identified several areas where knowledge is lacking. Examples of such areas are correlation between angle of repose and angle of internal friction, theory for granular flow and effects of confined spaces on bulk density...|$|E
40|$|A necessidade em se produzir alimentos para atender a demanda crescente, vem se constituindo em um dos principais problemas da humanidade. Desde o primeiro choque do petróleo, em 1973, há preocupação com o consumo de energia, devido à escassez dos recursos energéticos, que ameaça a sustentabilidade dos sistemas de produção atuais. O balanço energético é de {{fundamental}} importância para a determinação da eficiência no aproveitamento da energia de um sistema de produção agrícola sendo determinado através da quantificação dos fluxos de entrada e saída de energia no sistema. O Brasil é o segundo maior produtor mundial de carne bovina e o sexto de leite. Devido à importância econômica da pecuária no país, há uma grande preocupação com a produção de alimentação suplementar para ser fornecida aos animais durante o período seco, sendo um dos métodos mais utilizados para esse fim, a silagem de milho. Além dos métodos tradicionais de produção de alimentação suplementar como a ensilagem e a fenação, surgiram técnicas mais modernas como a silagem emurchecida, utilizada principalmente com gramíneas, que tem o seu sistema de produção muito similar ao do feno,porém apresenta menor tempo de secagem, prevenindo perdas quali e quantitativas {{no material}} a ser recolhido. O trabalho proposto avaliou a eficiência energética de dois diferentes sistemas de produção de alimentos suplementares para bovinos, identificando as variáveis críticas e propondo cenários alternativos. A silagem de milho apresentou balanço energético bruto de 14, 08, ou seja produziu 15, 08 vezes o que consumiu, já a silagem emurchecida de Tifton 85 apresentou balanço energético bruto de  0, 98, consumindo 1, 98 vezes o que produziu. Considerando a energia de saída efetivamente disponível ao gado, devido ao teor de NDT da cultura, o balanço energético é de 9, 12 e  0, 99, respectivamente. A maior demanda da produção da silagem de milho foram a adubação de cobertura e a semeadura-adubação, com 49, 34 e 24, 06 %, respectivamente. Na produção da silagem emurchecida a irrigação demandou 99, 72 % do total da energia de entrada. O balanço energético diário, que visa considerar a ocupação do solo pelo sistema de produção, foi de 0, 087 e  0, 022 para o milho e o Tifton 85, respectivamente. Os mesmos parâmetros considerando a energia de saída disponível ao rebanho, via teor de NDT, são 0, 057 e  0, 022, respectivamente. The need in producing food {{to supply the}} increasing demand {{has been one of}} the most important problems of mankind. Since the first oil chock, in 1973, there is worry about the energy consumption, because of the lack of energy sources, which threatens the sustainability of the present-day production systems. The energy balance has a important role to evaluate how efficient the energy use by a production system is. And it is determined through the quantification of the income and outcome energy flows. Brazil is the second biggest cattle meat producer and the sixth milk producer. Because of the economic importance of cattle raising in Brazil, there is a great worry about supplementary food to be supplied to cattle during the dry season. To reach this goal, maize silage is one of the most used methods. In addition to the traditional methods, like silage and hay, more modern techniques were created such as haylage, which is used mainly with grasses and has its production system too similar to the hays. But haylage requires shorter time to dry, avoiding losses in quantity and quality in the vegetal material that will be collected. The present work evaluated the energetic efficiency in two different production systems of supplementary food to cattle, identifying critical variables and suggesting alternative scenarios. Maize silage presented a gross energybalance of 14. 08, what means a outcome energy 15. 08 times higher than the income one. haylage presented a gross energy balance of  0. 98, what means a income energy 1. 98 times higher than the outcome one. When the really available energy to cattle was considered through the TDN levels, maize silage and haylage presented energy balances of 9. 12 and  0. 99, respectively. The highest energy demand in the maize silage production was the <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreading</b> during the seeding and field cultivation, responsible for 49. 34 % and 24. 06 %, respectively. In the haylage production system irrigation was the most demanding operation since it was responsible for 99. 72 % of the total demanded energy. The daily energy balance, which aims to consider the soil occupation period, was 0. 087 to maize silage, and  0. 022 to haylage (Tifton 85). The same parameters regarding the effective energy available to cattle, via TDN, were 0. 057 and  0. 022, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{was applied}} since 2006 in Ferrara Province (Italy). Notwithstanding elevate nitrate and {{ammonium}} (NH 4 +) concentrations are still present in surface and groundwater of reclaimed areas, respectively. To diminish nitrogen export from agricultural lands an EU project “ZeoLIFE” was funded in 2011, currently testing an integrated zeolitite cycle {{to reduce the}} amount of <b>fertilizers</b> <b>spread</b> in the fields. Natural Kzeolitite (chabasite zeolitite) is mixed with swine manure in a prototype tank, where it takes NH 4 + by cation exchange. The NH 4 +-charged zeolitite was added to experimental plots, where it will slowly release nutrients only upon plant root request. Control plots cultivated in traditional way and plots with untreated natural zeolitite will also be monitored for two years of cultivation. In this paper the results of the monitoring activities on the control plots cultivated with maize are described. The high ammonium concentrations in shallow groundwater (15 ± 15 mg/l) found over the first year of the project confirmed that the WFD application did not allow to reach the NH 4 + admissible levels. This is also due to the presence of peaty layers that contribute to geogenic nitrogen export via mineralization of organic nitrogen. The application of natural zeolitite should improve groundwater and surface water quality, thanks to the reduction of chemical and organic fertilizers in agriculture. Despite of this amelioration, the geogenic background values may persist in deep soil horizons and shallow groundwater. These values should be taken into account during the implementation of the WFD...|$|R

40|$|The area of {{aeolian sand}} soil in Xinjiang is 3. 7189 X 10 (7) hm(2) and {{occupies}} 25 % {{of the total}} land area. Traditionally, it is considered that aeolian sand soil has low yield of crops due to its poor retention power of soil moisture and soil fertility. However, the stems of cotton growing on aeolian sand soil are small and their fictile shape is easy to be controlled. Thus, a culture mode of "increasing stems and bolls, double-layer and double-stem" of cotton is developed by scientific irrigation and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spread</b> as well as artificial control of fictile shape based on the growth laws of cotton and the properties of aeolian sand soil, and a lint yield of over 3, 750 kg/hm(2) has been reaped in successive 3 years. Currently, the cotton culture in Xinjiang is rapidly developed, the proportion of cotton-culture areas occupies 40 similar to 60 %, the cultivating areas of other crops are reduced, the ecosystems are simplified, and the natural enemies in cotton fields are reduced. Alfalfa belts of 8 similar to 10 in in width are planted in the zones affected by shelter forests, the occurrence of Therioaphis maculata (Buckton) in alfalfa belts is 10 similar to 15 days earlier than that of cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii Glover), and in the alfalfa belts the quantity of herioaphis maculata (Buckton), the natural enemies, is 13. 65 times of that in cotton fields when the cotton aphids occur.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to produce future {{scenarios}} on the river inputs of water and nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. They are based on the four contrasting scenarios that were developed by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) for the years 2030 and 2050 and implemented in a spatially explicit manner into the IMAGE model. We first identified the major drivers of the river fluxes by regression analyses, then tested the retained models against the past evolutions between 1970 and 2000, and finally applied the models to the MEA scenarios. For nutrients, the considered river data mainly refer to the large rivers for which long‐term time series exist (Rhone, Po, Ebro, and Danube). Here, recent trends were principally driven by <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreads</b> (NO 3, PO 4), together with urban wastewater releases (PO 4). Future trends remain in the envelope of the observed variability during the last 40 years, both for the large rivers and, when extrapolated to the basin scales, also for the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea. At regional scales, however, the budgets considerably change. In the northern parts of the Mediterranean drainage basin, they uniformly tend to decrease, but they may strongly increase in the south and east. Water discharge is examined on a basis of 37 rivers, showing that this parameter is clearly linked to the evolution of climate. Because of the ongoing evolution toward dryer and warmer conditions, we predict a significant trend of decreasing freshwater fluxes for the future, which already started in the past. Regional hot spots for this decrease are the drainage basin of the Alboran Sea and, when also considering the inhabitant specific water fluxes, the basins of the Aegean and north Levantine seas...|$|R
