5|$|To promote her {{candidacy}} for senior class president, Brittany (Heather Morris) sings a rousing song of female empowerment—"Run the World (Girls)"—at an impromptu assembly, {{with the help}} of the Cheerios and Santana (Naya Rivera), who has rejoined New Directions unbeknownst to cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). The enormous <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school's entire female population worries Kurt (Chris Colfer), the other candidate in the race. Kurt has given up his dream to play Tony in the musical, and gives a bouquet of roses to his boyfriend Blaine (Darren Criss), the likely choice as Tony.|$|E

On 1 June 1932 Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. held a reception for Baba at Pickfair where he delivered a message to Hollywood.

The gold and the fear, employed as arguments by Cristóvão de Moura, replaced the patriot's influence. <b>The</b> Governors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom dissolved <b>the</b> Cortes <b>of</b> Almeirim, at instances of Cristóvão de Moura. Deeply dispirited, Febo Moniz retired himself to Santarém, where <b>the</b> tumultuous acclamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prior <b>of</b> Crato as King of Portugal made him understand that the national cause was losing itself.|$|R
25|$|The first {{national}} league {{was formed in}} 1966, {{which led to the}} formation of the Israel Cricket Association (ICA) in 1968. The league prospered despite conditions ill-suited to cricket. Games were played on dusty, grass-less football fields, on matting wickets. However, the <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players has overcome these drawbacks.|$|E
25|$|The temperance {{movement}} was the social concern which most broadly captured {{the interest and}} <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Methodist Church.

5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apaches was <b>the</b> music <b>of</b> Debussy. Ravel, {{twelve years}} his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than}} ten years. In 1902 André Messager conducted <b>the</b> premiere <b>of</b> Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. <b>The</b> first run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opera consisted <b>of</b> fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|R
50|$|But {{that was}} not the end. The new {{generation}} that Slater launched from the SSMTG and the QTP took knowledge and skills into departments of Physics and Chemistry and Computer Science, into industrial and government laboratories and academe, into research and administration. They have continued and evolved his methodologies, applying them to an increasing variety of topics from atomic energy levels to drug design, and to a host of solids and their properties. Slater imparted knowledge and advice, and he recognized new trends, provided financial support from his grants, and motivational support by sharing <b>the</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonists.|$|R
40|$|Edmund Burke {{is often}} {{considered}} an arch-critic <b>of</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> {{in its various}} religious and secular forms. This article complicates this understanding by situating Burke's writings against <b>the</b> backdrop <b>of</b> eighteenth-century treatments <b>of</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> as a disturbance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination. The early Burke, this article shows, was actually sympathetic to attempts by <b>the</b> Third Earl <b>of</b> Shaftesbury and others to rehabilitate enthusiasm for politics and rescue it from popular derision. Next, the author reveals how Burke firmly resisted attempts to frame anti-Protestant violence in Ireland in terms of religious delusion or enthusiasm, and was alert to the political dangers posed by policies legitimated by that framing. Finally, the article {{calls into question the}} close association often posited between the enthusiasm Burke saw in the French Revolution and earlier religious <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century...|$|R
25|$|The {{revival of}} {{religious}} {{life and the}} zealous activity of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and Saint Francis of Assisi in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, together with the <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders returning from the Holy Land, gave a rise to devotion to the Passion of Jesus Christ and particularly to practices in honour of the Sacred Wounds.|$|E
25|$|The fall of Acre {{signaled}} {{the end of}} the Jerusalem crusades. No effective crusade was raised to recapture the Holy Land afterwards, though talk of further crusades was common enough. By 1291, other ideals had captured the interest and <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchs and nobility of Europe and even strenuous papal efforts to raise expeditions to retake the Holy Land met with little response.|$|E
25|$|Motivation. The {{conclusions}} of the report do not consider the motivations of the abusers; although {{the inclusion of a}} financial report by the accountancy firm of Mazars, and various financial references combine to create an impression of financial motivation, this is not discussed or challenged. The report refers to, but makes no attempt to explain, the <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary and the ISPCC for incarcerating children.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the public’s {{perspective}} on using the minimally invasive technique transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an enhancement tool, we analyzed and compared online comments in key popular press articles from two different periods (pre-commercialization and post-commercialization). The main conclusion drawn from this exploratory investigation is that public perception regarding tDCS has shifted from misunderstanding to cautionary realism. This change in attitude can be explained as moving from a focus on an emergent technology to a focus on its applications, benefits, and risks as the technology becomes more grounded within the public domain. Future governance of tDCS should include <b>the</b> concerns and <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public. Keywords: cognitive enhancement, neuroethics, public understanding, transcranial direct current stimulation, brain stimulation, public policy...|$|R

25|$|At the {{exhibition}} of 1910, {{a section of}} military history {{was presented to the}} public and met with great success. Given the <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, the authorities established a museum of the army. This was in a period of extreme tension which led to the Great War. The museum was originally installed at the Abdij Ter Kameren/Abbaye de la Cambre and moved to Jubelpark/Cinquantenaire Park in 1923.|$|E
25|$|The fiery <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gordons {{and other}} clans often carried the day, but Montrose relied more upon the disciplined {{infantry}} from Ireland. His strategy at Inverlochy, and his tactics at Aberdeen, Auldearn and Kilsyth furnished {{models of the}} military art, but above all his daring and constancy marked him out {{as one of the}} greatest soldiers of the war. His career of victory was crowned by the great Battle of Kilsyth on 15 August 1645.|$|E
25|$|As their {{communities}} grew, {{women and men}} shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and second Great Awakenings, the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: “The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.” The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in {{their communities}} knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, the {{experience}} of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hecker {{returned}} to his farm in Illinois. It was with great joy that he heard of the union of Germany {{brought about by the}} victory over France in 1870-71. It was then that he gave his famous address at St. Louis, in which he gave animated expression to the <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German Americans for their newly united fatherland. After the war, he became more and more involved in the German-language press and Republican Party activities. He received a less favourable impression when he visited Germany in 1873 for criticizing lack of individual rights and the size of government in the new German government organization. He died at his farm in Summerfield, Illinois on March 24, 1881.|$|E
25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E

25|$|Armies {{during the}} Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and {{combined}} with the new <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the First Coalition, occupied the Low Countries, {{the west bank of}} the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the Valois and Bourbon dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a Second Coalition, but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France's old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.|$|E
25|$|Once {{he decided}} to abandon {{unreliable}} and wavering Don Javier, Sivatte started to look for alternatives. In 1957 he held consultations with Don Antonio, representative of another Borbón branch considered legitimate heir by the Carloctavista faction, but the talks bore no fruit. Don Carlos Hugo, the oldest son of Don Javier, made a fulminant entry on Spanish political stage in May 1957 and was greeted by enormous <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd gathered on the Aplec of Montejurra; many Sivattistas concluded that the years of apathy were over. Some of them re-joined the Javieristas, {{though it is not}} clear to what extent Sivatte himself considered Don Carlos Hugo an alternative to Don Javier; he was suspicious about pro-Francoist tones of his addresses. When in late 1957 a large group of Traditionalists leaning towards dynastic accord with the Alfonsinos declared Don Juan the legitimate heir, Sivatte felt genuine Carlism should be immediately given new momentum.|$|E
