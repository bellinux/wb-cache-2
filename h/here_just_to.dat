When asked by Bob Pockrass about being on probation, Busch said, [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} you right now because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's {{improper}} to say as well. If you can talk about racing things, we'll talk about many things, Bob. It is not racing, you're <b>here</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> start stuff, you know that's you're all out here for!" [...] NASCAR immediately suspended Busch from the Pocono race as a result for violating their policy forbidding swearing publicly.|$|E

[...] Jiang Gan replied, [...] "I'm an old friend of yours but we've not been in contact for years. When I heard you have become famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now. I'll treat you to another meal again after I'm done with that." ...|$|E
