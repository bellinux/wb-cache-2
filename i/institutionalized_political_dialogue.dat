40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the cold}} war, interregional {{dynamics}} have become a fixture both of the global multilayered multilateral system, as well as of the EU's efforts to strengthen said international system. Such interregional arrangements are deeply rooted in the new regional associations which emerged at {{the end of the}} 1980 's. Since the collapse of the bipolar world order, various regional dynamics have flourished across the globe. This new wave of regionalism included a broad variety of forms and scopes of regional cooperation, nonetheless it allowed a growing number of regional entities - among first and foremost the EU - to develop multifaceted region-to-region relations. These complex multi-issued interregional arrangements have grown exponentially as they have come to meet functional and structural needs of their constituent members. Among the various roles such interregional initiatives can assume, one can distinguish between: power-balancing efforts, agenda-setting and cost-cutting concerns, protection against unwanted external pressures, <b>institutionalizing</b> <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and consultation, and reflexive region strengthening. All of these functions can be called upon in varying degrees according to the specific context and history of any given arrangement. A detailed study of two of the EU's core region-to-region relationships - the EU-Latin America and the EU-East Asia interregional arrangements - clearly illustrates the systemic foundations, the historical path-dependencies and the contextual factors, both the exogenous and endogenous, which have come to shape these different yet comparable interregional dynamics.

The Philippines was among the 33 countries who supported the creation of Israel and the only Asian country who voted for the resolution. Israel and the Philippines established full diplomatic relationships in 1957. Embassies were opened in Tel-Aviv and Manila in 1962. In 1997, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) <b>institutionalizing</b> the bilateral <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> between the respective foreign ministries.

25|$|On 29 November 1947, the Philippines (a U.S. {{territory}} until 1946) was {{the only}} Asian nation to support the partition resolution at the United Nations General Assembly recommending a Jewish State in Palestine.

40|$|Unlike the United States, the European Union (EU) did {{traditionally}} {{not have}} motivations to privilege {{its relations with}} Central America. 1 The economic, political and geostrategic {{interests in the region}} are modest, as compared with those existing in other groups of less developed countries (LDCs) such as the so-called African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP countries) and the Southern and Oriental Mediterranean countries (MEDA countries). Nevertheless, the threat of an internationalization of the Central American conflict after the victory of the Sandinista Front in Nicaragua in 1979, was able to attract EU’s attention towards the region and encourage a greater involvement in it. The EU took the initiative in <b>institutionalizing</b> a <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> –the San José Dialogue–, 2 which has facilitated the signing of three multilateral cooperation agreements between the two regions in 1985, 1993 and 2003. The subscription of the last <b>Political</b> <b>Dialogue</b> and Cooperation Agreement in 2003 opened the possibility of strengthening the bi-regional relations, which had been losing dynamism {{since the end of the}} Central American conflict. The chosen way has been the negotiation of an Association Agreement (AA), including –in addition to <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and cooperation – the establishment of a bi-regional free trade area. The results of this negotiation initiated in 2007, will condition the future of the relations between both regions. This paper aims at assessing the bi-regional economic relations in the context of the aforementioned negotiation. With this purpose, the paper is divided into four sections. The first two ones present respectively, the state of the trade and financial relations. After that, the third section analyzes the background to the negotiation of the AA and the major negotiation issues. The fourth and last section provides the main conclusions drawn from that analysis...|$|R
40|$|Do {{politicians}} talk to {{each other}} or talk past each other? In the last few years there has been renewed interest in the strategic thinking that drive politicians to engage in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> with peers from a different political color. Most of this research, however, has been limited to understanding <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the campaign trail or in Congress. The dynamics of daily <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the written media, by contrast, have received limited attention. This research explores the dynamics of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> through a statistical analysis of op-ed articles written by over 400 politicians in Venezuela. Using more than 6, 000 articles published in the Venezuelan media in 2004, I analyze the degree to which politicians engage in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue...</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{this type}} of <b>institutionalized</b> corruption, the <b>political</b> path in Mexico was very narrow. There were {{specified}} political participation channels (the party) and selective electoral mobilization (party members). These issues, deeply engrained in Mexico’s political culture after over half a century’s existence, have continued to generate and <b>institutionalize</b> <b>political</b> corruption in today’s Mexico.|$|R
40|$|Does the {{existence}} of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> signal the lack of party institutionalization? Research on <b>political</b> <b>dialogue,</b> and the dynamics of issue ownership and issue salience, argues that parties have no incentive to trespass on issues owned by opponents. This requires that parties have niches of advantaged issues, which are obtained through the specialization of parties and their members via their platform and experiences in office. This characteristic signals {{the existence}} of an institutionalized party system where the party label has a meaning the electorate can interpret. In a non-institutionalized system; however, the party label has no meaningful value. In this context parties lack the programmatic clarity and experience that gives them advantages on issues. Given this, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> should be more prevalent because politicians will be prone {{to talk to each other}} in order to set the agenda, attempt to control issues, and send signals to the electorate. As parties define themselves and become institutionalized, issues will become owned and parties will have more incentive to talk past each other, effectively diminishing <b>political</b> <b>dialogue.</b> In this paper I seek to understand these dynamics and the relationship of wining <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and party system institutionalization. I argue that following a party system collapse, and the subsequent de-institutionalization of the parties, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will be more frequent; however, as political actors adapt to their new environment instances of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will diminish, signaling that the new party system is institutionalizing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of party system institutionalization on the {{relevance}} of the personal income tax in the tax composition. Based on a fiscal contractualism approach, it is argued that <b>institutionalized</b> <b>political</b> party systems increase the capacity of political actors to credibly commit to fiscal contracts agreed with wealthy taxpayers. Consequently, in countries characterized by <b>institutionalized</b> <b>political</b> party systems wealthy taxpayers accept paying a bigger share of the tax burden, as reflected in a greater relevance of progressive tax types. The analysis of panel data for more than 90 countries from 1990 to 2010 supports this hypothesis, showing that party system institutionalization has an especially significant and strong positive effect on {{the relevance of the}} personal income tax where bureaucratic capacity is low. At high levels of bureaucratic capacity the effect disappears. The findings strongly support the claim that, particularly in developing countries, where bureaucratic capacity tends to be limited, taxation is best understood as a problem of credible commitment...|$|R
