50|$|The {{commissioner}} {{felt that}} unless Maguire could {{have access to}} the information {{in order to make a}} valid application, he was treated less favourably because of his blindness than a sighted person. SOCOG contested the charge of less favourable treatment by outlining that Maguire could have got a sighted person to read the document for him, and that Maguire had access to a phone helpline and to an electronic format of the booklet. The commissioner dismissed those arguments. Reading the booklet to Maguire would have meant an incomprehensible oral presentation of tabulations, a great feat of memory, a requirement to find a time of convenience and hours of explanations was considered by the commissioner to be treating Maguire less favourably than the sighted person who could access the material without assistance at his or her leisure, capable of referencing and cross-referencing from page to page and thereby ensuring the completion not only of a valid application complete with alternatives that reflected <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>respect</b> the final decided choices of That person. The commission raises the question as to how a person in the position of Maguire could acquire any primary information in the ticket book which could then be perfected or developed by the officer in the course of a telephone conversation. The dilemma indicated by the commissioner was that if the ticket book was produced in braille, Maguire would have not required the assistance of the helpline. The vital information in the ticket book was presented in tabular form in which the line of information scrolled off the right-hand edge of the screen, making it difficult for Maguire to comprehend when the material was presented in Braille form on the refreshable braille pad.|$|E

5000|$|The two veenas {{having the}} same qualities <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>respect</b> {{can be used to}} perform the Sarana Chatushtai {{experiment}} [...] Establish the Shadjagrama on both the similar sitars as per the methodology explained in Natya Shastra chapter 28 to keep shruties distance wise for the respective notes of the shadjagrama. Now we can measure the sruti value and hence provide 22 frets starting from the 5th sruti of second note [...] "Re". The assumption here which needs to be made to realize [...] Bharata Muni's shruti of first datum note being the sound of free string Sa, requires the assumption of 4 virtual shruties of Sa which are actually obtained in the higher octave after Ni. This assumption though not explicitly stated in the Natya Shastra needs to be made as was discovered by Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan and is required to prove the Sarana Chatushtai experiment. The shruti distances as per the compression factors are calculated for all the 34" [...] length of the string. 18 frets are required to reach up to the end note Ni of the saptak in both the instruments. When finally both the instruments are set in the Shadjagrama, one sitar is to be kept as [...] "Achala" [...] (Achala means that which does not change) i.e. the string tuning of this instrument remains unchanged during the entire experiment, whereas the other sitar is named as [...] "Chala" [...] i.e. the changes in tuning strings during the experiment are to be performed on this sitar (Chala means that which could change). The Panchama note of this Chala sitar is to be lowered by one [...] "Pramana-Shruti" [...] that is to bring this sitar in the Madhyamagrama. The procedure of Bharata states that the Achala sitar Re note is first played as Sa note and the Pa note of the Chala sitar is lowered down in sound to be played as Ma note of the Achala sitar's Re note(assumed as Sa note).|$|E
5000|$|In {{one of the}} Vachanamruts, one of the editors, namely, Nityanand Swami, {{presents}} 114 edited discourses to Swaminarayan for his approval. He {{was pleased}} with the efforts of the editors and authenticated their compilation. Not only the recitation by the master is truthfully recorded but even the criticism of their answers and their utter ignorance pointed by him are put down in writing by them. For example, in describing the company and qualities of worthy and unworthy sadhus, the master states, [...] "A sadhu who strictly observes religious vows with firm faith in God but does not sharply rebuke those who don't observe the rules and regulations and pampers them, then even if he is a greatly honoured sadhu like Muktanand Swami, his company must be given up." [...] 6. Similarly in another discourse Swaminarayan says that Gopalanand Swami and others have at present profound love for God but if they were to encounter adverse circumstances, their mind would be slightly affected. It means their foundation appears to be weak and if they were to face an extremely adverse situation, their love for God would not remain stable at all.7 But the most trenchant criticism of all the five editors comes in a discourse where the Teacher after praising the five editors, Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, Shukanand Muni, Brahmanand Swami and other disciples, states, [...] "All of you presently behave very well. However, if factors like desh, kal, sang and kriya were to become unfavourable, then there is no doubt at all that your enthusiasm would not remain as it is now." [...] And then he adds, [...] "It is precisely for the purpose of somehow instilling this gnan in your minds that I continuously deliver discourses."8 An equally important quality of the editors of the Vachanamrut is the keen sense of history and documentation. Disproving the common Western complaint that Indian religious history lacks firm and definite dates <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>respect,</b> every discourse of the Vachanamrut in the very beginning mentions the year, the month, the day, the time, the village, the location, the direction of the assembly and the speaker, the dress and the seat of the master and the names of important persons in the assembly. Even the village of the questioner and his caste is described. Thus, John Carman, former Prof. of School of Divinity, Harvard University, said, [...] "In this book, every discourse is precisely dated. This is a chapter of religious history which one might say is in the full light of day as far as our knowledge of history is concerned."9 Simultaneously {{it is clear that the}} purpose of writing down such minute details, especially about the Master was much more than merely recording them for history. It was to create almost a three-dimensional perspective of the whole situation with the object to facilitate the perception and meditation upon him.|$|E

[...] Respected Sir, With {{profound}} respect, I humbly recall {{your kind}} attention towards it is submitted that, the honourabale Mohtasib- (ombudsman) of Sindh, kind decision passed by dated 17-12-2013 on my complaint no. POS/1221/2012/DG-I on the subjected above. Honourable Sir, {{you have very}} kindly directed the defending party for submission of compliance report within 45 days. But that the period of 45 days has been expired MDA has not been implemented direction of In this regard, and {{in the light of}} honourable Mohtasib- (ombudsman) of Sindh, decision, I humbly submit that till to-date nothing has been heard from the defending party for allotment of an alternative plot of same size in the New Malir Housing Scheme-I, Malir Development Authority, nor the deposited amount with the interest accrued thereon has been given to me. Honourable Sir, MDA did not implement the decision of honourabale Mohtasib- (ombudsman) of Sindh. (Decision dated 17-12-2013 on my complaint No. POS/1221/2012/DG-I,). And MDA no department /person are authorized to take on charge the MDA as faulty institution. Apprehension I frequently agitating this matter, but MDA office is not taking seriously or avoid to considering the matter to me and mental worries torture and inconvenience, I am and other allottees of said scheme, are bona-fide citizens of Pakistan, although almost 18 years have lapsed, but no significant development works has so for been carried out. Initially, the MDA constructed a few roads and gave an impression that large-scale development works were underway, but this was another effort to hoodwink people, to collect huge amounts of money from allottees of said scheme and accumulate bank interest. The peoples, who have been allotted the plots in the said scheme, are much nuisance and the MDA does not take any positive response for the shelter-less peoples who have paid the huge amount in installments. However, it is submitted that the MDA have also announced this scheme to be completed within five (5) years (60) month, MDA as clarified, it was mentioned in Clause No.6 of terms and conditions for allotment of plots, which is reproduced as follows:- “The period of completion and delivery of possession is expected to be (60) month from the date of confirmation of allotment provided that the installments are paid within time by the allottees.” (2) Who is responsible for the delay in completion of development work deliver the physical possession of said plots to allottees? Unfortunately, it is responsibility of MDA and not the shelterless allottees of said scheme, Malir Development Authority Sindh is responsible <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>respect,</b> according to the terms conditions, MDA office is to duty bond for completion of development works within the time and to deliver the physical possession of said plots to allottees of MDA Scheme-1. But Malir Development Authority Sindh have passed almost 18-years and failed to complete the said scheme, because it was plan to complete the said scheme within 60 months, and MDA did not collect the utility charges on actual basis according to the terms & conditions. Sir, the circumstance has been narrated above for your kind perusal and you will kindly judge the height of inefficiency of MDA Management. The said scheme is still incomplete after 18-years lapsed; MDA works not in progress and MDA using the delaying tactics for completion of the scheme and handing over the possession of plots to the allottees Sir, please note the height of inefficiency {{on the part of the}} MDA Management. Many times I approached MDA officers in this connection with my requests/appeal but MDA no positive response has been given to me. They are using unfair tactics. I reserve the rights being law-abiding citizen of Pakistan. Please tell us to whom we should call for awarding justice to us. [...] By this mala-fide act, I have suffered a lot, and I am claiming the market value of the plot surrendered as well damages, MDA is under obligation to pay market value of plots well amount of damages details is below:- ...|$|E
