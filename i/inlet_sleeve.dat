These include offshore and arctic operations, where both space and weight are at a premium, and downhole processing where space is very limited. Compact separators often rely on centrifugal forces to enhance the separation process and are therefore highly dependent on inlet geometry. This paper investigates expanding the operational envelope of a compact Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone separator {{through the use of a}} novel inlet, which can be easily altered to respond to changing well conditions. To demonstrate the importance of inlet geometry, historical production from the Gloyd-Mitchell zone of the Rodessa Field in Louisiana was examined over a 40 -month period. As in most oil field production, there were significant changes in the water cut and GOR. This field data clearly shows that a compact separator equipped with single inlet geometry is not capable of performing effectively over the wide range of conditions exhibited in a typical oil field. This thesis considers the hydrodynamics of the separator inlet. Three different inlet geometries were investigated through the use of a changeable <b>inlet</b> <b>sleeve.</b> New experimental data were acquired utilizing a 7. 62 -cm I. D compact separator, which was 3. 0 m in height. The effect of inlet geometry on separator performance was investigated over a wide range of flow conditions. Fluid viscosities from 1 - 12 cp and the effect of fluid level within the separator were also examined. The results indicate that the operational envelope for liquid carry-over and gas carry-under can be expanded by more that 300 % by altering the inlet to respond to changing field conditions. A new model is proposed to define the operational envelope. This approximate method is simple to calculate, and offers a good approximation for the operability area for gas-liquid cylindrical cyclone compact separator. This study shows that efficient operability of the gas-liquid cylindrical cyclone is obtained when tangential acceleration of the incoming gas-liquid mixture is 50 to 100 times the acceleration of gravity (50 - 100 G's) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{safety system}} {{includes}} a sleeve fitted within a pool's suction {{line at the}} inlet thereof. An open end of the sleeve is approximately aligned with the suction line's <b>inlet.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> terminates with a plate that resides within the suction line. The plate has holes formed therethrough. A housing defining a plurality of distinct channels is fitted in the sleeve so that the distinct channels lie within the sleeve. Each of the distinct channels has a first opening on one end thereof and a second opening on another end thereof. The second openings reside in the sleeve. Each of the distinct channels is at least approximately three feet in length. The first openings are in fluid communication with {{the water in the}} pool, and are distributed around a periphery of an area of the housing that prevents coverage of all the first openings when a human interacts therewith...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Biochar is a {{valuable}} co-product with increasing agronomic and environmental values produced during pyrolysis, which is a thermochemical conversion process of biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen. Accumulation of biochar in the bed may result in poor fluidization performance and product quality. The efficient removal of the separated biochar from the fluidized bed is therefore crucial for economical reasons. This thesis is structured in three sections. Section 1, provides an introduction and literature review on biomass pyrolysis covering the main types of processes and reactors focusing on fluidized bed technologies. It section addresses the mechanisms associated with mixing and separation processes in fluidized beds are briefly discussed. The significance of biochar recovery is also emphasized and the various current recovery methods are reviewed and discussed. Section 2 describes the methodology, the operating conditions and the variables investigated and measured in this work to generate the experimental data and ensure process reproducibility and accuracy experimental findings. Following this section, the section 3, addresses the experimental results and analysis leading to the conclusions and recommendations for future research directions. The primary objective of this research is to describe, through experimental investigations, the effects of geometrical and operating parameters on the separation efficiency and the yield of the recovered biochar in a cold simulator laboratory scale bubbling fluidized bed. A section of the bed simulates the pyrolysis reactor bed, is fluidized at high gas velocity to provide intense mixing, and a second section operates at a lower gas velocity to promote particle separation. Biochar is continuously fed to the well mixed zone to simulate the production in the reactor bed. An automated pulsating feeding <b>inlet</b> regulated by <b>sleeve</b> valves allowed continuous feeding of biochar while overflow ports in the separation section allowed for the continuous discharge of the biochar. The lab scale bubbling fluidized bed unit, made it feasible for continuous segregation and removal of biochar at an optimized separation efficiency range of 96. 40...|$|R
