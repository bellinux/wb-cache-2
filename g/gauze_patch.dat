40|$|Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is an {{autologous}} fibrin glue, {{produced from}} patients' blood, which, besides intraoperative use, has {{applications in the}} treatment of infected wounds. The combination with antimicrobial agents results in a prolonged antibacterial effect allowing for wound dressing change intervals of seven days even in infected wounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate release kinetics of amikacin, teicoplanin or polyhexanide from a PRF-layer. PRF mixed with teicoplanin, amikacin or polyhexanide was sprayed on a silicon <b>gauze</b> <b>patch</b> and put on a colombia agar with bacteria with known minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and incubated for 24 hours and afterwards transferred to another agar with the same bacterial strain. Inhibition zones were measured every 24 hours. This was repeated on 7 consecutive days. Antibiotic concentrations were calculated by interpolation. More than 1000 mg/L teicoplanin were released within the first 24 hours and 28. 22 mg/L after 168 hours. Amikacin release was above 10, 000 mg/L within the first 24 hours and still 120. 8 mg/L after 120 hours. A release of polyhexanide could be verified for the first 24 hours only. Consequently teicoplanin and amikacin released from PRF showed antimicrobial in-vitro effects for almost a week, whereas an antimicrobial effect of polyhexanide could only be verified for the first 24 hours. Our Results show that a weekly dressing regimen may be justified in wounds treated with PRF plus amikacin or teicoplanin, since bacteria will be eradicated over a considerable period of time after a single application of PRF...|$|E
40|$|The contact {{hypersensitivity}} reaction (CHS) to haptens {{is a classic}} example of cell-mediated immune response. In the effector phase, two stages can be distinguished: an early component, that appears only 2 hours after subsequent contact with the hapten, and the late component that develops approximately 24 hours later which is mediated by TCRαβ+ cells. The effector lymphocytes may be CD 4 + T helper 1 (Th 1) cells or CD 8 + T cytotoxic 1 (Tc 1) cells, which depends on the employed hapten and/or mice strain. NKT lymphocytes play the crucial role in the CHS initiation, by supporting B 1 cells in the antigen-specific IgM antibodies production. The development of an early component is essential for the recruitment of T effector (Teff) cells to the side of hapten deposition and for the complete expansion of inflammatory reaction. The CHS reaction is under T regulatory (Treg) cells control, both in the induction phase as well as in the effector phase. A new view of a negative regulation of the Tc 1 mediated CHS response is based on the suppression induced by epicutaneous (EC) application of protein antigen. The DNP-BSA skin application, on a <b>gauze</b> <b>patch,</b> leads to a state of immunosuppression. This maneuver results in rising the population of Treg cells with TCRαβ+CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + phenotype. The mechanism of suppression requires direct contact between Treg cells and Teff cells and the participation of CTLA- 4 molecule is also necessary. The described method of evoking immune tolerance via EC immunization may contribute to elaborate a new method of allergic contact dermatitis therapy. This is because of its effectiveness, ease of induction and non-invasive protein antigen application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of two widely used topical haemostatic agents: oxidised regenerated cellulose <b>gauze</b> and Collagen-Fibrinogen-Thrombin <b>Patch</b> in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. Material of study: This was a prospective, comparative, non-randomised study in which consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign disease received standard treatment with no haemostatic agent, cellulose gauze, or CFTP. Main outcome measures were drainage volume 24 hours after surgical procedure and the occurrence of post-operative complications (haematoma, seroma, surgical-site infection). Results: Two hundred seventy-one (271) patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign disease: 65 received standard treatment, 60 received cellulose gauze and 146 received CFTP. Seroma was significantly reduced in the CFTP group compared with both the cellulose gauze group (p= 0. 006) and the standard treatment group (p= 0. 017). A significant reduction in drainage volume was also observed with CFTP compared {{with the other two}} groups (both p< 0. 001). Drainage volume was also significantly reduced with cellulose gauze versus standard treatment (p< 0. 001). No septic events were observed after application of CFTP. One hematoma was observed in the non haemostatic group. Conclusions: Both haemostatic agents reduced the amount of sero-hematic fluid during the first 24 hours post-surgery, with CFTP more effective than oxidized cellulose gauze. The use of haemostatic agents may increase the quality of thyroid surgery, improve patient comfort after surgery, and reduce hospital stay...|$|R
