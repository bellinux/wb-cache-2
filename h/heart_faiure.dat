40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to formulate and develop extended release drug delivery system of antihypertensive drug Metoprolol succinate. The major indications of Metoprolol succinate is treatment and management of hypertension, angina, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, congestive <b>heart</b> <b>faiure,</b> and migrane. Hypertension (HTN) is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. High blood pressure is said to be present if it is persistently at or above 140 / 90 mmHg pressure. The dosage for adults is 2 - 3 times a day, to reduce the dosing interval to one time a day Metaprolol succinate developed as extended release capsules. Which reduces the dosing interval. Preliminary studies with different polymers such as Surelase, Ethyl cellulose N 22, Kollicoat SR 30 D were performed. The results of in-vitro release data showed that Kollicoat SR 30 D can Extend the drug release upto 24 hr. The drug content was within the range, 98. 23 ± 0. 25 to 102. 03 ± 2. 45 %. The in-vitro metoprolol succinate release from the capsules was found Extended over 24 hours with korsmeyer-peppas kinetics of drug release and release pattern followed Super case- II transport. The Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses indicated that there was absence of any chemical interaction between the drug and the excipients. Thus the {{objective of}} extended release drug delivery system of antiHypertensive drug Metoprolol succinate with extended release profile was achieved.
