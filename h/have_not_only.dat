5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents {{argue that the}} zoos <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Some recent historians paint a more {{favourable}} {{picture of}} the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2012), doubts {{the reliability of the}} ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality {{played a role in the}} fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.|$|E

25|$|The Arabs' {{control over}} Balkh {{did not last}} long as it soon came under the rule of a local prince, a zealous Buddhist called Nazak (or Nizak) Tarkhan.

As per another account, when Balkh was conquered by the Arabs, the head priest of the Nava-Vihara had gone to the capital and became a Muslim. This displeased the people of the Balkh. He was deposed and his son was placed in his position.|$|E
25|$|However, the Amazonians <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{used these}} areas for crops; {{they have used}} their {{agricultural}} lands {{as a place to}} hunt as well. Many animals (rodents, tapirs and deer) are attracted to these areas for food. The Amazonians produce a surplus so that the animals do not over-consume their food resource. Though, if the animals do start to deplete their crops, they will then harvest higher numbers of animals. Additionally, Amazonians consume fish as a main source of protein. Indigenous peoples understand that, while flooded, the forest serves as an essential feeding ground that increases fish abundance. Because of this, many protect igapó forests from deforestation.|$|E
