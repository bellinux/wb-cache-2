5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

25|$|Appointment of an {{administrator}} follows a codified list establishing priority appointees. Classes of persons named {{higher on the}} list receive priority of appointment to those lower on the list. Although appointees named in the Will and relatives of the deceased frequently receive priority over all others, creditors of the deceased and 'any other citizen of ' may act as {{an administrator}} <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> cognizable reason or relationship to the estate. Alternatively, if no other person qualifies or no other person accepts appointment, the court will appoint a representative from the local public administrator's office.|$|E
25|$|Given {{a uniform}} {{space in the}} entourage sense, define a cover P to be uniform <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> entourage U such that for each x ∈ X, there is an A ∈ P such that U ⊆ A. These uniform covers form a uniform space as in the second definition. Conversely, given a uniform space in the uniform cover sense, the supersets of ⋃{A × A : A ∈ P}, as P ranges over the uniform covers, are the entourages for a uniform space as in the first definition. Moreover, these two transformations are inverses of each other.|$|E

25|$|However, {{subject to}} the {{requirements}} of fairness, a decision-maker should consider whether, on the particular facts of the case, reasons should be given. A failure by the decision-maker to provide reasons may justify an inference that its reasons are bad in law or that it has exercised its powers unlawfully. The rationale behind the argument that a decision-maker should provide reasons is that {{it is one of the}} cornerstones of a good administration. Furthermore, if some right or interest such as livelihood or property is at stake, or <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> legitimate expectation, reasons should be given when a decision is adverse to the applicant as a matter of fairness.|$|E
25|$|Dietary {{modification}} may {{be important}} for successful management. Both diarrhea and constipation can contribute to different cases, so dietary advice must be tailored to address the underlying cause {{or it may be}} ineffective or counter productive. In persons with disease aggravated by diarrhea or those with rectal loading by soft stools, the following suggestions may be beneficial: increase dietary fiber; reduce wholegrain cereals/bread; reduce fruit and vegetables which contain natural laxative compounds (rhubarb, figs, prunes/plums); limit beans, pulses, cabbage and sprouts; reduce spices (especially chilli); reduce artificial sweeteners (e.g. sugar free chewing gum); reduce alcohol (especially stout, beer and ale); reduce lactose <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> degree of lactase deficiency; and reduce caffeine. Caffeine lowers the resting tone of the anal canal and also causes diarrhea. Excessive doses of vitamin C, magnesium, phosphorus and/or calcium supplements may increase FI. Reducing olestra fat substitute, which can cause diarrhea, may also help.|$|E
