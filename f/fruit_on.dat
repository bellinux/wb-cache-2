S.esculentus mushrooms have thin, sharp cap margins and only <b>fruit</b> <b>on</b> fallen spruce cones. S.stephanocystis has a yellow-brown to reddish-yellow cap that is not hygrophanous. Baeospora myosura is another small agaric that grows on pine and spruce cones, but it fruits in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{commonly}} known as the admirable bolete, the bragger's bolete, and the velvet top, is an edible species of fungus in the Boletaceae mushroom family. The fruit body has several characteristics with which it may be identified: a dark reddish-brown cap; yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap; and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations. Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A.mirabilis sometimes appears to <b>fruit</b> <b>on</b> the wood or woody debris of Hemlock, suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, Aureoboletus mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms close mutualistic associations with hemlock roots.|$|E

5|$|The {{cockatoo}} feeds {{primarily on}} seeds of proteaceous {{plants such as}} Banksia, Hakea and Grevillea, and secondarily on seeds from myrtaceous plants such as Eucalyptus and Corymbia. Over fifty native plant species are commonly used for food, either as seed or flowers, and this includes western sheoak (Allocasuarina fraseriana), orange wattle (Acacia saligna), and balga (Xanthorrhoea preissii). Typically, Carnaby's black cockatoos sit in the crowns of trees cracking the seed pods or cones. First, a bird chews through the stem holding the item before holding it with its foot and tearing bits off and extracting the seed. Birds may move along the branches breaking stems at random as well. Occasionally they forage for fallen seed and <b>fruit</b> <b>on</b> the ground. This cockatoo acts as an agent in biological control, eating the larvae of invertebrates such as wood-boring insects and moths from rare plants.|$|E

The new level of escalation, however, proved too ominous for all involved. Neither Israel nor Egypt could secure a clear advantage, yet both could claim military achievements. American pressure to end a conflict with the potential to draw in both the United States and the USSR soon bore <b>fruit.</b> <b>On</b> August 7, 1970, a ceasefire agreement came into effect, ending the War of Attrition.|$|E

Pressure from Disque and the Wilson administration in Washington — the chief consumer of finished goods — was instrumental in ensuring a positive outcome, and the marathon session of lumbermen eventually yielded <b>fruit.</b> <b>On</b> the morning of March 1, 1918, Disque announced the adoption of the 8-hour day to the press.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa {{noted that}} many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya in modern-day India sailed to Mogadishu with cloth and spices, {{for which they}} in return {{received}} gold, wax and ivory.

25|$|The {{urban centers}} of Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, and their {{respective}} ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from {{the interior of the}} State. The farming communities of the hinterland brought their products to the coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia, India, Venice, Persia, Egypt, Portugal, and as far away as China. Vasco Da Gama, who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century, noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.

50|$|Laetiporus huroniensis is {{a species}} of polypore fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae.

500|$|Historically, {{there has}} been some {{confusion}} between Ficus obliqua and the related F. rubiginosa. F. obliqua can be distinguished by its smaller <b>fruit</b> <b>on</b> shorter stalks and its [...] (hairless) leaves; in addition, the petioles have ascending hyaline hairs. Some forms of F. rubiginosa have both leaves and petioles glabrous while others have both covered in fine fur. The syconia of F. obliqua are smaller, measuring 4.3–11.9mm long and 4.4–11.0mm in diameter, compared with 7.4–17.3mm long and 7.6–17.3mm diameter for F. rubiginosa. Ficus brachypoda is a lithophytic plant from arid northern and western Australia, with a short petiole and leaf shape aligning it with Ficus platypoda.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Egon Horak {{described}} the species Nivatogastrium baylisianum, N.lignicola, and N.sulcatum from New Zealand, {{all of which}} differ from Pholiota nubigena by microscopic characters. N.baylisianum and N.sulcatum <b>fruit</b> <b>on</b> the ground (the former among mosses), while N.lignicola fruits on rotten wood. The three New Zealand Nivatogastrum species lack the fruity odor present in P.nubigena. Thaxterogaster pingue [...] is somewhat similar in appearance to P.nubigena, but can be distinguished from the latter by its terrestrial habitat, autumn fruiting period and lack of odor. Some species of Weraroa are similar in morphology, but clearly distinct in their microscopic characteristics. Additionally, Weraroa species grow on hardwoods rather than conifer wood.|$|E
500|$|In some years, this waxwing irrupts {{south of}} its normal {{wintering}} areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The <b>fruit</b> <b>on</b> which the birds depend in winter varies in abundance {{from year to}} year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. In {{what may be the}} largest ever irruption in Europe, in the winter of 2004–2005, {{more than half a million}} waxwings were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock [...] wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.|$|E
