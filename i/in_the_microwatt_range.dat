40|$|Noise and {{time-dependent}} fluctuations {{are usually}} undesirable signals. However, {{they have many}} applications. This dissertation deals with two kinds of sensing applications of fluctuation and noise: soil bulk density assessment and bacterium sensing. The measurement of Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuations (VICOF) provides information about the bulk density and other parameters of soils. Bulk density is the physical property of soils {{that is important to}} both the agriculture and construction industries. The traditional measurements of soil bulk density are often time-consuming, expensive or destructive. To determine the soil bulk density without the above drawbacks, the VICOF measurement scheme was proposed. The research of VICOF in this dissertation includes two parts: the initial phase of study and the new methods and their theory. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> initial phase of study, the simple experiments, theory, and simulations of VICOF were tested for relations between the soil bulk density, wetness, salinity, and the VICOF data. Then, new measurement arrangements and their theoretical models were proposed to improve the weaknesses of the initial approach (such as large scattering of data due to loose and heavy contacts) and to calculate the relationship between the measured signals and the electromechanical transport parameters of the soils. The bacterium sensing study in this dissertation was proposed to explore simple, practical, rapid, sensitive, specific, portable, and inexpensive ways to detect and recognize bacteria by Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing (FES). One such potential way of bacterium sensing is to analyze their odor. The research of bacterium sensing also includes two parts: the initial phase of study and the new methods and their theory.

In a ternary full adder design, the basic building blocks, the positive ternary inverter (PTI) and negative ternary inverter (NTI) are developed using a CMOS inverter and pass transistors. In designs of PTI and NTI, W/L ratios of transistors have been varied for their optimum performance.

In this work, with the ultimate goal of establishing a rapid and real-time method to predict the proliferative capacity of human articular chondrocytes (HAC), we explored to use of IMC to characterize one of the crucial steps within the process of cartilage tissue engineering, namely the in vitro expansion of HAC. We first established an IMC-based model for the real-time monitoring of heat flow generated by HAC during proliferation. Profiles of the heat and heat flow curves obtained were consistent with those previously shown for other cell types. The average heat flow per HAC was determined to be 22. 0 ± 5. 3 pW. We next demonstrated that HAC proliferation within the IMC-based model was similar to proliferation under standard culture conditions, verifying its relevance for simulating the typical cell culture application. HAC growth and HAC heat over time appeared correlated for cells derived from particular donors. However, based on the results from 12 independent donors, no predictive correlation could be established between the growth rate and the heat increase rate of HAC. This was likely due to variability in the biological function of HAC derived from different donors, combined with the complexity of tightly couple metabolic processes beyond proliferation. In conclusion, IMC appears to be a promising technique to characterize cell proliferation. However, studies with more reproducible cell sources (e. g., cell lines) could be used before adding the complexity associated with primary human cells...|$|E

Such sensors might be asleep {{most of the time}} to conserve power, waking only occasionally to transmit a few bits. RFID tags for tracking or material control have similarly tight bandwidth constraints, and emerging nanotechnology devices will be even more limited. Since transmitted data is subject to spoofing, and since sensors might be located in uncontrolled environments vulnerable to physical tampering, the high-consequence data generated by such systems must be protected by cryptographically sound authentication mechanisms; but such mechanisms are often lacking in current sensor networks. One reason for this undesirable situation is that standard authentication methods become impractical or impossible when bandwidth is severely constrained; if messages are small, a standard digital signature or HMAC will be many times larger than the message itself, yet {{it might be possible to}} spare only a few extra bits per message for security. Furthermore, the authentication tags themselves are only one part of cryptographic overhead, as key management functions (distributing, changing, and revoking keys) consume still more bandwidth.

The study represents a compilation of approximately 10, 000 larvae and 7, 000 adults counted. The specific EM frequencies used in this study, 5. 0, 7. 3, 8. 0, and 9. 3 MHz at output power levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> approximately 1 <b>microwatt</b> <b>range,</b> were pro-duced by two small electronic devices of physically identical nature, but one was intentionally imprinted with specific information. Exposure peri-ods varied from 4 hours to one life cycle. Larval development time was sig-nificantly shortened (approximately 10 %) and the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio sig-nificantly increased (approximately 30 %) in a Faraday cage without the EMFs compared to a Faraday cage with the specific EMFs. The Faraday cage represents a shielded environment that facilitates exposure to both fewer and specific electromagnetic frequencies.

A major challenge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of such infrastructure is the need for low cost, integrated, self-contained, and non-invasive wireless sensor nodes. While an electric meter provides the utility company with information regarding the total energy consumption, no information is provided to the consumers regarding the energy consumed by individual appliances. Such visibility can provide consumers with the ability to better control and manage their energy usage leading to a reduced overall energy consumption. This work explores the design and development of a self-contained and non-invasive integrated system intended for real-time electricity monitoring within residential and commercial buildings. The proposed system includes an Energy Harvester, an electric current sensor, a Micro-controller Unit, and a wireless communication device. The proposed system is self-powered and non-invasive, which offers a promising solution in providing real time information regarding the energy distribution within buildings. <b>The</b> design featured <b>in</b> this work provides an innovative approach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of a customized interface circuitry that is designed to collect and regulate the energy from the Energy Harvester. The entire sensor node will operate under a power budget <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of <b>microwatts</b> collected by <b>the</b> Energy Harvester. A Wireless MCU is programmed to acquire, process, and transmit the data from the sensor to the central hub via Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. The real-time data transmitted to the central hub provides detailed information regarding the energy consumed by individual appliances within the building...|$|R
40|$|The superconducting {{properties}} are noticeably modified when the samples dimensions approach the nanoscale. This impacts the working regime of many current-biased thin-film devices. The low-temperature electrical transport behavior of niobium and niobium nitride nanostructures {{has been investigated}} in this context. Their current-carrying properties {{turn out to be}} mainly dictated by the Joule heating. This is evidenced by the numerous normal hotspot domains that are stabilized when the dissipation balances the heat removal capabilities. Importantly, the associated stepwise current-voltage characteristics are quantitatively related to the nanoscale modulations of the cross-section. This dissertation further describes the electrical behavior of the nanostrips under a continuous microwave irradiation. Incorporating <b>the</b> microwave dissipation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heat balance powerfully corroborates the prevailing role played by the heat exchanges. The present work succeeds <b>in</b> determining <b>the</b> tiny fraction of the total input power which is effectively absorbed by <b>the</b> nanostructures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal state, i. e. below <b>the</b> <b>microwatt</b> per cubic micrometer. Furthermore, the critical induction below which the magnetic vortices are completely expelled is determined for structures whose width amounts to a few tens of nanometers. Above this superheating field, the rearrangements of the vortices patterns interestingly go hand in hand with regularly spaced minima of <b>the</b> critical current. <b>In</b> conclusion, this study provides complementary tools to characterize narrow thin-film superconducting devices. The cross-section roughness, the power handling capabilities, and the critical field for vortex entrance are indeed accessible from their electrical transport properties.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to model and {{validate}} an inductive system {{in order to be}} able to power wirelessly a sensor. The design of the inductive system must be small and light enough to fulfil the requirements of a nano-quadcopter, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> system is going to be outfitted. Recent investigations about inductive systems added to the Energy Harvesting trend, predict a future based on wireless power. Thereby, the possibility to change the current "wire-dependence" of any device. At the beginning the bases of magnetic resonant induction are given in detail to understand how the energy can be transferred. Then, an inductive model based on two resonant coils is presented. Its main features are explained, as well as the behaviour of the coil variables and their effects. Some coils are defined to be tested using the most suitable resonant configuration. Hence, providing that our purpose is not to optimize efficiency, but to achieve higher receiver power levels. Once the model is defined, numerous measurements of the test coils, under different con- ditions, are performed to validate the model, and so select the most suitable coils for our inductive system. The architecture and design of the wireless power transfer system are studied separately; transmitter and receiver. While attempting to minimize the weight at transmitter's side, a recurring topic during the project, on the receiver side it is intended to efficiently acquire and manage <b>the</b> <b>microwatts</b> to milliwatts of power generated from the transmitter. At the end of the project a temperature sensor is introduced as a technology demonstra- tion. The experiment results shows successfully wireless power transfer for the resonant configuration selected, being able to completely charge the battery and to power the tem- perature sensor, at the same time...|$|R

Local optical excitations of <b>the</b> order of <b>microwatts</b> are found to produce lateral photovoltages as high as several hundred millivolts between contacts centimeters away from the exciting spot. The effect is attributed to the vertical photovoltage locally induced by {{the separation of the}} photocreated electrons and holes. Its strong position dependence as well as its saturability are shown to be attractive for technological applications...|$|R
