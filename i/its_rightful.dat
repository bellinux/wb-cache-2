5|$|Somerhill House is a Grade I listed Jacobean mansion {{situated}} near Tonbridge, Kent, United Kingdom. It {{was built}} for The 4th Earl of Clanricarde in 1611–13. The estate was sequestrated by Parliament in 1645, and restored to <b>its</b> <b>rightful</b> owner in 1660. The building had become derelict by the mid-eighteenth century but was later restored. Somerhill was painted by Turner in 1811. It was bought {{by a member of}} the Goldsmid family in 1849 and greatly extended between 1879 and 1897, making it the second largest house in Kent, after Knole House, Sevenoaks.|$|E

5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, {{would need to be}} restored to <b>its</b> <b>rightful</b> holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine for the right to marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E

With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to <b>its</b> <b>rightful</b> owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will need an infusion made of three herbs to wake the dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot.|$|E

5000|$|In 1898 Bozidar Knežević {{published}} his seminal work, a visionary treatise entitled [...] "Principi istorije" [...] (Principles of history) in two volumes. [...] "Since everything that exists", he argued, [...] "exists only in history, history {{takes over the}} fields of other sciences and offers the highest human understanding". In addition, [...] "history binds all peoples and leads to their reconciliation and overall harmony". Knežević’s optimism and belief in {{the progress of the}} human mind is tempered with his belief that [...] "the total quantity of time available to the living is limited: human civilization and even human life is thus bound to disappear". Proportion, he boldly states, is [...] "the Telos (philosophy) of history." [...] As both nature and humans strive after this ideal, [...] "proportion is used to explain the nature of truth, reason, good, progress, beauty, justice and freedom". Once elements achieve proportion and balance with each other, [...] "they live simultaneously" [...] in a great organic whole in which one can ultimately arrive at [...] "complete morality, freedom, justice and truth". Whereas academic philosophers repudiated this system as incoherent, many Serb avant-garde poets and writers found in it a congenial vision of the universe in which everything, including poetry and beauty, had <b>its</b> own <b>rightful</b> place in a world striving after proportion.|$|R

5|$|Al-Azhar was not {{unaffected}} by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections {{in the months following}} the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on <b>its</b> future and <b>rightful</b> role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.|$|R

In 2002, the museum discovered that Ludolf Backhuysen's A Man-O-War and Other Ships off the Dutch Coast, a 17th-century seascape painting under consideration for purchase by the museum, had been looted from a private European collection by the Nazis.

25|$|The Holocaust {{also had}} {{a major impact on}} works of art created before the Holocaust.

Although the original owners were in turn brutally murdered during the Holocaust, many of their relatives survived, and naturally would like to retrieve their long-lost family heirlooms. A current owner cannot simply plead ignorance of an artwork's terrible history, since a thief can never convey good title.

5000|$|In 1978 a {{temporary}} agreement regulating fishery in a 60000 km2 zone, named the [...] (Gråsonen) in some {{documents from the}} same time, was signed, which has since been renewed annually. From the Norwegian side, the agreement was negotiated by Labour politician Jens Evensen and his protégé Arne Treholt, who was later exposed as a Soviet spy and convicted of treason. The agreement was highly controversial in Norway. Many Norwegians believed that Evensen and Treholt gave too many concessions to the Soviet Union, {{and that they were}} motivated by Soviet sympathies. The agreement caused consternation in parliament and government, and Evensen had difficulty getting it accepted by his own government, where many held the opinion that he had exceeded his authority. The opposition parties criticized Evensen for using the term Grey Zone, because it implied that Norway did not maintain <b>its</b> claim on <b>rightful</b> Norwegian territory in their opinion. In an interview with Danmarks Radio in 1990, Treholt, who was then serving a 20-year sentence, admitted that he had acted as an informer for the Soviet negotiators. The arrest and conviction of Treholt in 1984-1985 had a devastating effect on Evensen, who withdrew completely from public life in Norway.|$|R
500|$|Since 1864, when he {{received}} a single unsolicited vote at the Democratic National Convention, Hancock had been a perennial candidate. As military governor of Louisiana and Texas in 1867, Hancock had won {{the respect of the}} white conservative population by issuing his General Order Number 40, in which he stated that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials performed their duties, then [...] "the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume <b>its</b> natural and <b>rightful</b> dominion." [...] He had a larger following at the 1868 convention, finishing as high as second place in some rounds of balloting. In 1876, Hancock again drew a considerable following, but never finished higher than third place at that year's convention. In 1880, another Hancock boom began, this time centered mostly in the South. [...] In March of that year, the New Orleans Picayune ran an editorial that called for the general's nomination, partly for who he was—a war hero with conservative political principles—and partly for who he was not—a known partisan of either side of the monetary or tariff debates. As Tilden and Bayard rose and fell in the estimation of Democratic voters, Hancock's bid for nomination gathered steam. [...] Some were unsure whether, after eight years of Grant, himself a former general, the party would be wise to give the nomination to another [...] "man on horseback", but Hancock remained among the leading contenders as the convention began that June.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: In Mr. Coleridge's masterly {{analysis}} and confutation of the physiocratic {{system of the}} early French revolutionists, in the Friend, he has the following passage {{in the nature of}} a reductio ad absurdum. [...] "Rousseau, indeed, asserts that there is an inalienable sovereignty inherent in every human being possessed of reason; and from this the framers of the Constitution of 1791 deduce, that the people itself is <b>its</b> own sole <b>rightful</b> legislator, and at most dare only recede so far from its right as to delegate to chosen deputies the power of representing and declaring the general will. But this is wholly without proof; for it has been already fully shown, that, according to the principle out of which this consequence is attempted to be drawn, it is not the actual man, but the abstract reason alone, that is the sovereign and rightful lawgiver. The confusion of two things so different is so gross an error, that the Constituent Assembly could scarce proceed a step in their declaration of rights, without some glaring inconsistency. Children are excluded from all political power; are they not human beings in whom the faculty of reason resides? Yes! but|in them the faculty is not yet adequately developed. But are not gross ignorance, inveterate superstition, and the habitual tyranny of passion and sensuality, equally preventives of the developement, equally impediments to the rightful exercise, of the reason, as childhood and early youth? Who would not rely on the judgment of a well-educated English lad, bred in a virtuous and enlightened family, in preference to that of a brutal Russian, who believes that he can scourge his wooden idol into good humour, or attributes to himself the merit of perpetual prayer, when he has fastened the petitions, which his priest has written for him, on the wings of a windmill? Again: women are likewise excluded; a full half, and that assuredly the most innocent, the most amiable half, of the whole human race is excluded, and this too by a Constitution which boasts to have no other foundations but those of universal reason! Is reason, then, an affair of sex? No! but women are commonly in a state of dependence, and are not likely to exercise their reason with freedom. Well! and does not this ground of exclusion apply with equal or greater force to the poor, to the infirm, to men in embarrassed circumstances, to all, in short, whose maintenance, be it scanty, or be it ample, depends on the will of others? How far are we to go? Where must we stop? What classes should we admit? Whom must we disfranchise? The objects concerning whom we are to determine these questions, are all human beings, and differenced from each other by degrees only, these degrees, too, oftentimes changing. Yet the principle on which the whole system rests, is that reason is not susceptible of degree. Nothing, therefore, which subsists wholly in degrees, the changes of which do not obey any necessary law, can be the object of pure science, or determinate by mere reason,"--Vol. i. p. 341, ED.] ...|$|R
