40|$|Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) {{pavement}} {{has served}} the State of Iowa well for many years. The oldest Iowa pavement {{was placed in}} LeMars in 1904. Beginning in 1931, many miles of PCC pavement were built to "get out of the mud". Many of these early pavements provided good performance without deterioration for more than 50 years. In the late 1950 s, Iowa was faced with severe PCC pavement deterioration called D cracking. Research identified {{the cause of this}} deterioration as crushed limestone containing a bad pore system. Selective quarrying and ledge control has alleviated this problem. In 1990, cracking deterioration was identified on a three-year-old pavement on US 20 in central Iowa. The coarse aggregate was a crushed limestone with an excellent history of performance in PCC pavement. Examination of cores showed very few cracks through the coarse aggregate particles. The cracks were predominately confined to the matrix. The deterioration was identified as alkali-silica reactivity (ASR) by a consultant. To investigate the cause of the deterioration, the Iowa DOT and Iowa State University jointly purchased a high resolution, low vacuum Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an energy <b>dispersion</b> <b>detector.</b> Subsequent evaluation identified no concentration of silica gel (silicon-Si), but did identify substantial amounts of sulfur-S and aluminum-AL (assumed to be ettringite) in the air voids. Some of these voids have cracks radiating from them leading us to conclude that the ettringite filled voids were a center of pressure causing the crack. The ettringite in the voids, after being subjected to sodium chloride (NaCl), initially swells and then dissolves. This low vacuum SEM research of PCC pavement deterioration supports the following conclusions: (1) A low vacuum SEM and an energy <b>dispersion</b> <b>detector</b> are very important for proper evaluation of PCC pavement deterioration; (2) There are instances today where PCC pavement deterioration is mistakenly identified as ASR; (3) Ettringite initially expands when subjected to NaCl; and the ettringite filled voids are a center-of-pressure that cracks the PCC; and (4) The deterioration of some current premature PCC pavement distress locations is caused by factors related to the formation of excessive ettringite...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A full {{modeling}} of deceleration of α-particles in SiC {{is carried out}} using a Monte-Carlo method. The distribution of energy losses in nuclear elastic collisions is calculated. The spectrum has a characteristic asymmetric form and the line width at half peak maximum is 4. 62 keV. The final form of a spectral line is obtained by convolution with a Gaussian peak, and including the contribution of ionization fluctuations and noise. The resulting value of the line width was 8. 75 keV (at a noise <b>dispersion</b> of <b>detector</b> and equipment of 1. 7 keV). The resolution of detectors reached in practice is twice the lowest calculated value. It is shown that charge losses during transport of non-equilibrium carriers through {{the volume of the}} detector are insignificant, while a resolution divergence may result from a non-optimized “entrance window”...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the signal detection for space-time block coding over time-selective fading channels. We derive a general maximum likelihood (ML) decision rule for space-time block coding (STBC). The resulting detector is valid {{for any number of}} receive antennas and for all STBC systems that have the linear <b>dispersion</b> property. The <b>detector</b> results in a quadratic minimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by sphere decoding or nulling-and-cancelling detection. For orthogonal STBC systems, we also propose a suboptimal detector using the principle of parallel interference cancellation (PIC) that is valid for systems with an arbitrary number of receive antennas...|$|R

In this paper, the compound powders of Mg-Zn-Y phases {{were obtained from}} as cast and as aged Mg- 6. 0 Zn- 1. 2 Y and Mg- 6. 0 Zn- 0. 6 Zr- 1. 0 Y magnesium alloys respectively by using of electrolysis extraction technology. Then several tests, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy <b>dispersion</b> X-ray <b>detector</b> (EDX), were performed to investigate the structure and morphology of these compound powders. The results proved that picric acid- acetic acid- ethanol electrolyte was useful than DDTC-CAS-carbinol electrolyte in the electron extraction for Mg-Zn-Y magnesium alloys.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and variable-wavelength optical rotatory (OR) detector for {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} is presented. This design is entirely {{different from that of}} conventional OR detectors consisting of a crossed polarizer pair. By placing a polarizing prism and a retardation plate into a commercial circular dichroism (CD) detector, the OR signal was obtained. The Mueller matrix approach was used to prove the principle of the OR signal appearance. Sugars and 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione were chosen as test compounds. The limit of detection was below 0. 5 μg of injected sucrose at 260 nm, which was superior to that obtained with a conventional OR detector. For 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione, which is CD active, and shows a large anomalous OR <b>dispersion</b> curve, our <b>detector</b> gave a large OR signal with approximately half the intensity of the CD signal at 340 nm. 2008 © The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry...|$|R

This paper {{presented}} a visible measurement method of dispersion spot at a four-quadrant detector based on {{digital image processing}} according {{to the problem of}} big measurement error and low efficiency in the existing production process used by the indirect measurement method of dispersion spot based on four-quadrant detector output signal. This method designed a visible measurement optical system and established a visible measurement mathematical model of four-quadrant <b>detector</b> <b>dispersion</b> spot, obtained the four-quadrant detector photosensitive surface and dispersion spot geometrical coordinates and size through digital image processing for the four-quadrant detector photosensitive surface and the dispersion spot, then got the adjustive parameter of out-of-focus distance automatically. The results of the experiment show that this method is intuitive and simple, measurement accuracy is improved from 0. 02 mm to 0. 004 mm and the measurement time is reduced from 15 minutes to 2 minutes...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the nature of}} the time <b>dispersion</b> in scintillation <b>detectors</b> caused by path length differences of the scintillation photons as they travel from their generation point to the photodetector. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we find that the initial portion of the distribution (which is the only portion that affects the timing resolution) can usually be modeled by an exponential decay. The peak amplitude and decay time depend both on the geometry of the crystal, the position within the crystal that the scintillation light originates from, and the surface finish. In a rectangular parallelpiped LSO crystal with 3 mm 3 mm cross section and polished surfaces, the decay time ranges from 10 ps (for interactions 1 mm from the photodetector) up to 80 ps (for interactions 50 mm from the photodetector). Over that same range of distances, the peak amplitude ranges from 100 % (defined as the peak amplitude for interactions 1 mm from the photodetector) down to 4 % for interactions 50 mm from the photodetector. Higher values for the decay time are obtained for rough surfaces, but the exact value depends on the simulation details. Estimates for the decay time and peak amplitude can be made for different cross section sizes via simple scaling arguments...|$|R
40|$|The Fresnel Interferometric Imager is a space-based astronomical {{telescope}} project yielding milli-arc second {{angular resolution}} and high contrast images with loose manufacturing constraints. This optical concept involves diffractive focusing and formation flying: a first "primary optics" space module holds a large binary Fresnel Array, {{and a second}} "focal module" holds optical elements and focal instruments that allow for chromatic dispersion correction. We have designed a reduced-size Fresnel Interferometric Imager prototype and made optical tests in our lab, in order to validate the concept for future space missions. The Primary module of this prototype consists of a square, 8 cm side, 23 m focal length Fresnel array. The focal module is composed of a diaphragmed small telescope used as "field lens", a small cophased diverging Fresnel Zone Lens (FZL) that cancels the <b>dispersion</b> and a <b>detector.</b> An additional module collimates the artificial targets of various shapes, sizes and dynamic ranges to be imaged. In this paper, we describe the experimental setup, different designs of the primary Fresnel array, and the cophased Fresnel Zone Lens that achieves rigorous chromatic correction. We give quantitative measurements of the diffraction limited performances and dynamic range on double sources. The tests have been performed in the visible domain, lambda = 400 - 700 nm. In addition, we present computer simulations of the prototype optics based on Fresnel propagation, that corroborate the optical tests. This numerical tool {{has been used to}} simulate the large aperture Fresnel arrays that could be sent to space with diameters of 3 to 30 m, foreseen to operate from Lyman-alpha (121 nm) to mid I. R. (25 microns). Comment: 10 pages, 13 figures; accepted for publication in Applied Optic...|$|R
40|$|In {{terrestrial}} television transmission multiple paths of various lengths can occur between the transmitter and the receiver. Such paths occur because of reflections from objects outside the direct transmission path. The multipath signals {{arriving at the}} receiver are all detected along with the intended signal causing time displaced replicas called 'ghosts' {{to appear on the}} television picture. With an increasing number of people living within built up areas, ghosting is becoming commonplace and therefore deghosting is becoming increasingly important. This thesis uses a deterministic time domain approach to deghosting, resulting in a simple {{solution to the problem of}} removing ghosts. A new video detector is presented which reduces the synchronous detector local oscillator phase error, caused by any practical size of ghost, to a lower level than has ever previously been achieved. From the new <b>detector,</b> <b>dispersion</b> of the video signal is minimised and a known closed-form time domain description of the individual ghost components within the detected video is subsequently obtained. Developed from mathematical descriptions of the detected video, a new specific deghoster filter structure is presented which is capable of removing both inphase (I) and also the phase quadrature (Q) induced ghost signals derived from the VSB operation. The new deghoster filter requires much less hardware than any previous deghoster which is capable of removing both I and Q ghost components. A new channel identification algorithm was also required and written which is based upon simple correlation techniques to find the delay and complex amplitude characteristics of individual ghosts. The result of the channel identification is then passed to the new I and Q deghoster filter for ghost cancellation. Generated from the research work performed for this thesis, five papers have been published. ...|$|R
