The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size <b>exclusion</b> <b>process.</b> This is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of a zeolite is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term [...] "8-ring" [...] refers to a closed loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and 8 oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of effects, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure, or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.|$|E

40|$|Simple <b>exclusion</b> <b>processes</b> for {{particles}} {{moving along}} two parallel lattices and jumping between them are theoretically investigated for asymmetric rates of transition between the channels. An approximate theoretical approach, {{that describes the}} particle dynamics exactly in any vertical cluster of two parallel sites and neglects {{the correlations between the}} different vertical clusters, is applied to calculate stationary-state density profiles, currents and phase diagrams. Surprisingly, it is found that asymmetry in the coupling between the channels leads to a very complex phase behavior that is very different from two-channel simple <b>exclusion</b> <b>processes</b> with symmetric coupling. There are seven stationary-state phases in the simple <b>exclusion</b> <b>processes</b> with asymmetric transition rates between the channels, in contrast to three phases found for the systems with symmetric coupling. In addition, a new maximal-current phase with a domain wall {{in the middle of the}} lattices, that has no analogs in other <b>exclusion</b> <b>processes,</b> is observed. Although the explicit calculations are presented only for the case of full asymmetry, when the particles can only jump between the channels in one direction, the properties of two-channel simple exclusion systems with general asymmetry are also discussed.

5000|$|The single-molecule {{dynamics}} {{are already}} well described {{but it seems}} that these nano scale machines typically work in large teams. Recent experimental research has shown that kinesins, while moving along microtubules, interact with each other, [...] the interactions being short range and weak attractive (1.6±0.5 KBT). One model that has been developed takes into account these particle interactions, where the dynamic rates change accordingly with the energy of interaction. If the energy is positive the rate of creating bonds (q) will be higher while the rate of breaking bonds (r) will be lower. One can understand that the rates of entrance and exit in the microtubule will be changed as well by the energy (See figure 1 in reference 30). If the second site is occupied the rate of entrance will be α*q and if the last but one site is occupied the rate of exit will be β*r. This theoretical approach agrees with the results of Monte Carlo simulations for this model, especially for the limiting case of very large negative energy. The normal totally asymmetric simple <b>exclusion</b> <b>process</b> for (or TASEP) results can be recovered from this model making the energy equal to zero.|$|E

50|$|In vertex {{operator}} theory Julius generalized {{results of}} Primc and Meurman {{and gave a}} classification of annihilated fields. As concerns complex polynomials, he tackled Sendov’s conjecture on zeros and critical points of complex polynomials in one variable. Using novel techniques, he proved the conjecture for polynomials of degree not exceeding 7. Earlier (1969) the conjecture had been proven for polynomials of degree not exceeding 5. At Stockholm University, Julius had a steady collaboration with Bøgvad and Boris Shapiro. They worked on rational approximations of algebraic equations, piecewise harmonic functions and positive Cauchy transforms, and the geometry of zeros of polynomials in one variable. Borcea and Brändén collaborated on a project on the geometry of zeros of polynomials and entire functions. They characterized all linear operators on polynomials preserving the property of having only real zeros, a problem {{that goes back to}} Laguerre and Pólya-Schur. These results were subsequently extended to several variables, and a connection to the Lee-Yang theorem on phase-transitions in statistical physics was made.
