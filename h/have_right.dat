5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} <b>have</b> <b>right</b> of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E

"The major {{objection}} to speaking of everyone's <b>having</b> a <b>right</b> to various {{things such as}} equality of opportunity, life, and so on, and enforcing this right, is that these 'rights' require a substructure of things and materials and actions; and other people may <b>have</b> <b>rights</b> and entitlements over these.

Midori Ito collided with Laetitia Hubert at the 1991 World Championships, while Oksana Baiul and Tanja Szewczenko collided at the 1994 Olympics, but all went on to compete.

25|$|The {{color of}} {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is blue. Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren <b>have</b> <b>right</b> of way over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance {{service and a}} few other, smaller services such as the blood bank and some lifeguard organizations. Dutch police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are STOP POLITIE (ordering a driver to pull over and stop) or VOLGEN POLITIE (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign {{on the front of}} the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words ‘Ambulance’ and ‘Spoed’ (‘urgent’). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for an other reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving.|$|E

500|$|Despite Pinkertons initial failure, during Weezer's hiatus {{the album}} amassed a cult following.

Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told Rolling Stone in 2001: [...] "The most painful thing in my life these days is the cult around Pinkerton.

500|$|Massa denied responsibility, {{and agreed}} with the stewards' decision: [...] "I think there's little to say: I had already entered the turn and he hit me from behind, {{spinning}} me round." [...] The penalty was largely criticized in the media. GrandPrix.com called the penalty [...] "bizarre", saying that Bourdais [...] "could not just disappear". James Allen of ITV said that in light of FIA race director Charlie Whiting's announcement prior to the race, which indicated that cars exiting the pit-lane would <b>have</b> <b>right</b> of way, the penalty was [...] "ridiculous". French sporting newspaper L'Équipe criticized the stewards for their intervention, saying that both drivers held their lines and the collision was just a racing incident. Mark Blundell, who drove in Formula One for five years, called for former drivers {{to be part of}} the stewards meetings which award penalties: [...] "You can examine pieces of paper, graphs, telemetry, but you don't know what's going on in a driver's brain until you've experienced it." [...] Blundell's suggestion eventually became fact - the 2010 season introduced a system whereby a former F1 driver acted as a steward during each Grand Prix.|$|E
