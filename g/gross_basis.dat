5000|$|Then, if the {{beneficial}} owner {{would like to}} use the reduced rate under GR-CH double tax treaty (10%), he would have to file a refund claim to the Swiss tax authorities. That claim would have to be accompanied by a certificate of tax residence issued by the Greek tax authorities. When requesting this certificate, {{the beneficial}} owner is effectively signalling to the Greek tax authorities {{the fact that he has}} earned or will earn income from a foreign source. Once he has filed the refund claim to the Swiss authorities, the Greek beneficial owner will be entitled to a refund for the difference between the anticipatory tax (500*0.35=175) and the maximum tax under the double tax treaty (500*0.10=50), which is 175-50=125. So, the actual tax burden in Switzerland after the application of the refund procedure is EUR 50. Now if the Greek domestic tax on the inbound interest income is 10%, it would in principle be levied on a <b>gross</b> <b>basis,</b> i.e. the tax base would be the full amount of interest income received (EUR 500). The Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50. However, under Art. 22 of the GR-CH Double tax treaty [...] "Where a resident of Greece derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Switzerland, Greece shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in Switzerland. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Greek tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Switzerland." [...] The Greek beneficial owner would therefore be entitled to credit the EUR 50 levied in Switzerland against his tax liability in Greece, which is also EUR 50. Therefore, after the application of the credit, the Greek beneficial owner would not owe any Greek tax on that interest income.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{we will see a}} {{pronounced}} increase in the speed at which payment transactions are executed and in the share of cross-border transactions, particularly in the euro area. Counterparty risks and liquidity needs connected with the transfer of funds continue to evolve and to provoke discussion. The fact that funds transfers occur and systems operate on a real-time and <b>gross</b> <b>basis</b> will significantly alter the operational character and technical solutions in this field. Systems following a daily timetable are being replaced by continuously operating systems, which will {{have a significant impact on}} banks' liquidity management. The trend toward immediate real-time payment transactions seems inevitable in the light of present trends. It is generally presumed that RTGS systems operating on a <b>gross</b> <b>basis</b> require more liquidity than netting systems. Liquidity needs depend on payment system structures and payment flows. An even flow of payments requires less liquidity than an uneven flow. Liquidity needs can be significantly reduced by choosing an appropriate payment system structure, taking measures to even out payment flows and agreeing on market practices. The pricing, collateral and reserve requirement policies of the central bank affect also the efficiency of alternative payment systems. Thus the overall efficiency of a gross or net system depends on many factors. Factors arguing for a gross system are differences in counterparty risks, lack of reciprocity, steady interday payment flows and stable liquidity needs, both within and between days. Factors favouring net systems are the existence of small and varying counterparty risks and structurally unsteady payment flows that result in large interday variations in liquidity, even though overnight variations may be moderate. Current, daily-oriented practices have focused on overnight liquidity needs. In a continuously operating environment, liquidity needs are continuously monitored across time-period borders. This means that banks' liquidity management will in the future operate under a new and broader time perspective. Significant liquidity needs and large counterparty risks are inherent parts of Finland's present funds-transfer solutions. Liquidity can be freed for other uses and counterparty risks reduced by changing the structures. The necessary changes have been agreed and soon we will see fundamental changes in Finnish payment systems. payment system settlement; gross settlement; RTGS; payment system counterparty risks; payment system liquidity needs...|$|E

Less familiar are wholesale payments systems, which consist of electronic networks used for sending large sums among banks. A feature common to all wholesale networks is that settlement is carried out by exchange of funds held in banks' reserve accounts at a central bank, though the rules for settlement vary. This article considers {{the question of what}} is the best design for a wholesale payments system, in particular whether it should settle on a net or a real-time <b>gross</b> <b>basis,</b> and some of the difficult policy questions facing both participants and regulators of wholesale systems.; The authors show that for the benchmark case in which bank asset quality is fixed and bank assets can always be liquidated at book value, the advantages of some type of net settlement dominate real-time gross settlement. However, the optimal net settlement scheme may necessarily involve some chance of default. The discussion also examines the case in which the quality of bank assets is a choice variable and finds that the potential costs of net settlement rise because of negative effects on bank asset quality. The authors conclude that the design of a wholesale payments system must take into account numerous policy trade-offs, the most critical being the one between the costs of liquidity versus the costs of default.

40|$|Cash pooling is a {{bank service}} that allows {{corporates}} to externalise the intra-group cash management, and thus manage their global liquidity effectively with lower costs. Although {{there is little}} quantitative information on {{the significance of the}} phenomenon, cash pooling appears to have become increasingly popular after the onset of the financial crisis when, in an environment characterised by limited access to capital markets, reduced bank lending, low returns and higher risks on banks' deposits, corporate groups started to maximise their use of internal sources of financing. In particular, cash pooling is currently very relevant in Western and Northern European countries, and is mainly offered in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. This paper first analyses cash pooling agreements with a focus on the aspects that are relevant from a statistical viewpoint. It then addresses their statistical recording in compliance with ESA 2010 and, specifically, the methodological framework of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) balance sheet item statistics. It is proposed that positions related to cash pooling shall be recorded on a <b>gross</b> <b>basis</b> vis- 0 -vis the actual beneficiaries and obligors of the corresponding accounts. However, the proposed treatment goes beyond MFI balance sheet statistics and affects other data domains as well, ranging from financial accounts to balance of payments and international investment positions. While the statistical approach may seem straightforward, applying it in practice is more difficult, not least because of the treatment of cash pooling contracts in accounting terms. The analysis is complemented by numerical examples and also includes data for the Netherlands, which show the importance of clarifying the statistical treatment of cash pooling in light of the large impact it may have on macroeconomic aggregates...|$|E

In accordance with Opinion 16, costs are assigned to all identifiable tangible and intangible assets at the consummation date, including any assets that resulted from R&D performed by the acquired entity or any assets to be used in R&D of the combined entity, based on their fair values. At the date the combination is consummated, all costs assigned to activities to be used in R&D (for example, unproven technologies) are charged to expense unless the assets have alternative future uses. This Issue addresses acquired R&D activities that do not have alternative future uses, otherwise known as “in-process R&D. ” This Issue assumes that in-process R&D has no underlying tax basis.

40|$|AbstractThe rise in GHG {{emissions}} {{from the oil}} sands industry has prompted government and industry to seek ways to reduce its CO 2 output. CCS is currently the leading option in Alberta. A key to making it viable {{is a system that}} allows multiple emitters to gather, capture, and transport their CO 2 to the best sinks, efficiently and economically. The oil sands are located in Northern Alberta. Geological formations suitable for CO 2 storage exist in the South-West region, ∼ 400  km from the sources. Implementing CCS will necessitate transporting roughly 30  megatonnes of CO 2 to suitable sinks. One of the best sinks is the underground aquifer in the Redwater Reef near Ft. Saskatchewan, with an estimated preliminary capacity of one gigatonne of CO 2, or 37 years of CO 2 {{emissions from}} oil sands, at 2007 rates. In this study, we compare two schemes to transport CO 2 from oil sands operations by capturing CO 2 and: (1) transporting it in its supercritical state to storage in the Redwater Reef and (2) transporting it in solution to Redwater, regenerating the solvent on-site and storing the CO 2 in the Redwater Reef. The fugitive emissions of Case 1 are consistently higher than those of Case 2. This is due to the former’s electricity demands {{and the fact that the}} emissions associated with energy for solvent regeneration are not captured. Case 1 is more susceptible to electricity cost fluctuations than Case 2, but the latter is more susceptible to changes in the price of fuel. Although the CAPEX is similar for both, Case 2 benefits more from economies of scale than Case 1; the OPEX for Case 1 is 3. 5 % higher.
