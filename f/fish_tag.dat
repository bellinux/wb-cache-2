50|$|Some {{well known}} tagging {{programs}} in the United States are the South Carolina Marine Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program and the Virginia Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program. The South Carolina Marine Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program began in 1974 {{and it is now}} the largest public tagging program in the Southeastern United States. Anglers are trained and then receive a tag kit with tags, applicator, and instructions. When they <b>tag</b> a <b>fish,</b> anglers use a reply postcard they receive in advance to send the information on the tag number, tag date, location, species, and size. This program issues anglers who tag and release 30 or more eligible species within a year a conservation award. When an angler recaptures a <b>tagged</b> <b>fish,</b> he then should report the recapture. If possible the tag number and the mailing address should be reported along with the location and date of the recapture as well with the measurement of the fish. The objective is to provide biologists with the necessary information to determine growth rate through an accurate measurement. The Virginia Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program started operations in 1995 and keeps records on recaptured fish since then. This is an annual program that starts in January and it is limited to 160 anglers. Anglers receive training workshops in February and March.|$|R

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} a recreational fisherman 2 ̆ 7 s choice to participate in citizen <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> programs by identifying factors that influence participation in these programs and by exploring three alternative causal models for explaining participation in <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> projects: a values-beliefs-norms (VBN) model, a values-attitudes-behavior (VAB) model, and a full theoretical model including socio-demographic and explanatory variables. One hundred recreational fishermen in Plum Island, Massachusetts were given a written survey designed to investigate their experiences with tagging programs, along with their attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs regarding such programs. Responses to the survey were compared between participants and non-participants. Survey items were then used to create behavioral variable indexes and were correlated to a willingness-to-participate index. Three psycho-social behavioral models (VBN, VAB, and the full model) were built and compared to determine which model best fits the data. Although few variables distinguished participants from non-participants in volunteer <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> programs, several important factors strongly influenced willingness to participate. Subjective norms, personal obligation, and personal commitment all strongly correlated with willingness to participate. A comparison of three alternative causal models showed that the use of a full theoretical model, including different psycho-social variables as well as demographic and situational factors, provided the best fit for this behavior. Additionally, the modeled data showed that the strongest direct influence of willingness to participate in a volunteer <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> program was personal commitment; while perceptions of positive outcomes were a result, rather than a determinant of participation. This suggests that attempting to increase fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge regarding <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> program through educational programs, as is commonly suggested in public engagement literature, is not an optimal strategy. Program scientists and managers could increase participation by reaching out through social networks in order to find fishermen who share a strong sense of personal commitment to their fishery and the areas in which they fish. ...|$|R

A total of 403 burbot were captured from 1993 through 2004 (primarily with baited hoop nets), of which 300 were tagged and released, 31 were not tagged, and 72 were recaptures of <b>fish</b> <b>tag</b> up to four years prior. Hoop net catch per unit of effort (CPUE) decline precipitously from 0. 054 CPUE in 1996 to 0. 008 CPUE in 2004. Mean burbot length increased about 8 mm/yr from 516 mm in 1993 to 629 mm in 2004. Two models were developed for capture-recapture analysis, one which included effort data through a series river reaches and one without effort data. The effort model appeared to be more reliable and suggested an average annual mortality of 63 %, an average annual recruitment of 77 fish, and an average estimate of 148 burbot in the Kootenai River from 1996 through 2004. Average declines in recruitment and population abundance were estimated to be 21 % and 14 % per year, respectively, resulting in estimates of only 20 recruits and a population size of only 50 burbot in 2004.

Scientific literature was reviewed to quantify the number and type of studies that have investigated behaviour and survival of anadromous forms of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). We examined three categories of tags including electronic (e. g. acoustic, radio, archival), passive (e. g. external marks, Carlin, coded wire, passive integrated transponder [PIT]), and biological (e. g. otolith, genetic, scale, parasites). Based on 207 papers, survival rates and behaviour in marine environments were found to be extremely variable spatially and temporally, {{with some of the most}} influential factors being temperature, population, physiological state, and fish size. Salmonids at all life stages were consistently found to swim at an average speed of approximately one body length per second, which likely corresponds with the speed at which transport costs are minimal. We found that there is relatively little research conducted on open-ocean migrating salmonids, and some species (e. g. masu [O. masou] and amago [O. rhodurus]) are underrepresented in the literature. The most common forms of tagging used across life stages were various forms of external tags, coded wire tags, and acoustic tags, however, the majority of studies did not measure tagging/handling effects on the <b>fish,</b> <b>tag</b> loss/failure, or tag detection probabilities when estimating survival.

For this project, two regions of the Hdcgene are being used for anti-sense riboprobe synthesis: one probe should bind to all Hdc mRNAs, and the other probe should bind specifically to a unique mRNA isoform. Using PCR, we amplified a 230 base pair fragment from the Hdc gene that is unique to only one mRNA isoform and used TA cloning to insert this fragment into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Then, the DNA from the transformant cells was isolated, sequenced, and linearized using specific restriction endonucleases. The linearized DNA template was subsequently used with the Invitrogen <b>FISH</b> <b>Tag</b> RNA kit to synthesize an amine-modified RNA that should bind to all Hdc mRNAs. Then, the amine-modified RNA was labeled with the fluorescent dye Alexa fluor 488. We are currently synthesizing the 230 bp isoform-specific riboprobe with Alexa fluor 594, so that double labeling experiments with both mRNA probes may be accomplished. To complete this project, both RNA probes will be hybridized to adult Drosophila tissue sections and the resultant signals can be detected using fluorescence microscopy. Results are expected to demonstrate that one mRNA isoform is solely expressed by histaminergic neurons in the CNS, while the other is only expressed in the peripheral tissues, such as photoreceptors.

40|$|This works {{describes}} {{the development of}} a miniature high accuracy, low power CT-DO sensor system for in-situ oceanographic measurements. The sensors were fabricated on glass wafers, using micro-fabrication techniques. Three chip designs were made. The sensors in designs 1 and 2 include a seven-electrode conductivity sensor set in a flow channel, a four-ring-electrode open conductivity sensor, a Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT) bridge temperature sensor, and a DO sensor based on a platinum electrode inset into five 25 ?m deep wells. A 16 -bit impedance measurement circuit was made to support the CT sensor. This has a typical battery life of one month with 10 s sampling interval. The initial CT accuracies are ± 0. 01 mS/cm and ± 0. 003 oC respectively. The seven-electrode conductivity sensor with channel suffered from a durability problem, which was discovered on a mid-Atlantic deployment. This problem was solved with the four-ringelectrode open conductivity and PRT bridge temperature sensor. Dock deployments and 8 -week test in a calibration lab showed that the monthly drift was 0. 02 mS/cm for the conductivity sensor, and less than 0. 01 oC for the temperature sensor. The DO sensor was calibrated to have an initial accuracy of ± 5 ?m. A simple analytical model is proposed to estimate the effect of fluid flow. Tests show that the measured flow effect leads to an error of 1 % DO, compared with an estimate of 10 %. The complete CT-DO sensor was tested during a 75 day Indian Ocean cruise. A novel method of bio-fouling mitigation was tested utilizing electro-chemical reactions on the electrodes of the conductivity and DO sensors, and first results are promising. The CT system was also modified to measure low-conductivity solutions. This system was deployed in Greenland and results showed that the CT sensor can also work in fresh water and harsh environments.

The buoy is submerged {{in the sea}} and will store any valid signals from tagged fish. The received information typically includes an ID and can include information such as salinity level, depth, temperature, acceleration data and more. The goal of this master thesis was to design and validate a system for a low power telemetry buoy which utilizes digital signal processing. This thesis is a continuance of the work, done by the same author, in the project described in Acoustic telemetry buoy project report [4]. The goal of the previous project was {{to answer the question}} ?is it possible to design a low power acoustic telemetry buoy which satisfies at least one year operation and 100 000 stored receptions based on digital signal processing??. The conclusion was that {{it should be possible to}} design as system which meets the requirements using the UC 3 B microcontroller. In addition it is recommended to design an external reception detector to wake up the microcontroller and initiate reception. While the previous project focused on the digital part of the system the master thesis focuses on designing a complete system. The main building blocks that have been designed are&# 61607;	Variable gain amplifier&# 61607;	Active analogue band pass filter&# 61607;	Reception detector&# 61607;	MCU with external flashSeveral design concepts have been discussed for each block whereas one complete system prototype have been fully designed, assembled and tested. The system has been proved to work by successfully receiving signals from a standard Thelma <b>fish</b> <b>tag.</b> The prototype has been thoroughly tested and adjustments to improve performance have been suggested. One of the most important criteria is low power consumption and the minimum of one year operation. Current measurements and energy consumption calculations conclude with an expected operation time of 1. 51 years. Calculations show that the expected operating time is further increased to 2. 21 years if the new Atmel AT 32 UC 3 L microcontroller is used in the final design. The design fulfils the other provided requirements with good margin. The final conclusion is therefore that the system design provided in this report, together with the suggested improvements and the UC 3 L microcontroller, provides Thelma with a good basis for developing the leading standalone ultra low power acoustic telemetry buoy on the market. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Fish is an {{excellent}} source of essential nutrients such as essential amino acids, bioactive latty acids, minerals, vitamins, chitin and antioxidants. The nutritional benefit of fish lies, predominantly, in its lipid Iraction which is mainly composed of phospholipids (PL) and triacylglycerols (TAG) exceptionally rich of n- 3 polyunsaturated latty acids (n- 3 PUFA). Recently, fish PLs have attracted {{a great deal of attention}} as they are considered more efficient carriers of n- 3 PUFA than <b>fish</b> <b>TAG</b> in terms of n- 3 PUFA absorption in different tissues. In addition, fish PLs have also exhibited antitumoral and anti-inllammatory effects. Unfortunately, lish PLs are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation and to thermal damage due to excessive heating. The n- 3 PUFA chains in PLs are the primary targets of oxidation which can take piace during cooking processes. Since most fish are consumed cooked, the nutritional value of the final cooked product is of major importance lor human health. Especially, the determination of the effects of frying (a very popular method utilized lor fish cooking) on the n- 3 PUFA rich lipid fraction of fish will provide uselul inlormation to consumers and to lood industry to establish the fish quality. Purpose. This study was, therelore, conducted to determine the inlluence of deep fat frying process on PL composition of edible muscle (fillet) of Sardina pilchardus, a fish species commonly consumed in Mediterranean countries. Design/methodology. The effects of deep-fat frying performed using different culinary lats (extra virgin olive oil, conventional sunflower oil and high-oleic sunfiower oil) and different frying temperatures (160 and 180 °C) on the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species composition (the preponderant fish phospholipid classes) were investigated. For each frying test, ten fish fillets were introduced into a deep fryer (capacity 2 L), in a closed environment, lor 5 min. The oil temperature prior to start frying has been set to established value (160 or 180 'C) and it was controlled by a specific digital thermometer. Each cooking procedure was done in triplicate. The PL molecular species composition was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a second order mass spectrometer (MS-MS) with electronebulization interface (ESI). Findings. The deep-fat frying process caused significative changes on PE and PC molecular species composition of the fish fillet. However, these changes were not related to the nature of the culinary fat and to the frying temperature. In all cases, the deep fat frying process caused a significative increase of the proportion of the PE and PC species formed by the combination of palmitic and docohexanoic acids and a significative decrease of the percentage of the PE and PC species formed by two docohexanoic acid residues.

We tested VIE on hatchery-reared red drum (standard length, 29. 6 – 38. 7 mm; SE, 0. 23) {{in a laboratory}} study to examine mortality, tag retention, and growth effects associated with the marking method. We examined two tagging locations and two control treatments in anesthetized and unanesthetized fish. Red drum were tagged below and parallel to the dorsal fin and above and parallel to the anal fin. Five fish were anesthetized, marked, and stocked into replicated tanks and held for 14 d. Tag retention was 100 %, and overall mortality was 10 %. The mortality of <b>fish</b> <b>tagged</b> below the dorsal fin was 0 %, whereas that of <b>fish</b> <b>tagged</b> above the anal fin was 40 % (SE, 30. 5). No significant difference in growth rates was observed between the marke...|$|R
