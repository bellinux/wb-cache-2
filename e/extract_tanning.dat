This research used lizard skins, cobra skins and kakap fish skins from dried preservation; woods extract of secang, tegeran, nangka, mahoni and tinggi; chrome and syntan as tanning agent; alum as mordant and material additives for tanning.

It should be <b>extracted</b> a <b>tanning</b> agent, which is water-soluble and contains a high concentration of pure tanning agent and a low concentration of none-tannins. This project was realised in co-operation with FH Anhalt, Bernburg and FILK gGmbH, Freiberg. nig GmbH realised a lot of investigations of processing of raw materials and of extraction of tanning agents (influence of extent of grinding, influence of enzymes, of difficult extracting agents {{on the quality of the}} <b>extracted</b> <b>tanning</b> agents) and for the preparation of the extracts (ultrafiltration, thermal concentration). nig developed a method to analyse the content of tanning agents in processed extracts with HPLC. A pilot plant for the production of difficult extracts for tannery at FILK was constructed and built as an result of the investigations in laboratory. Results of the investigations: the insert of additives to extraction, of enzymes and of ultrafiltration had no positive influence on quality and yield or quantity of tanning agents. The tanning agents should be produced in powder form for tannery. The extraction with solvent-water-mixtures delivered good suitable extracts for tannery. The results of the developed analysing method for tanning agents with HPLC are correlating with the values of the 'skin powder method' and the method of Folin. Because of this the discribed HPLC-method can be used as an analysing method for tanning agents while the process of extraction. The produced powders contained contents of pure tanning agents of 53 to 63 %, of none-tannins of 30 to 36 % and of insoluble substances of 5 to 14 %. Yields or quantities of 75 to 95 % was realised with the discribed processing method. 1 kg pure tanning agents from the roots of Reum can be produced with developed processing method for about 38. - DM under the mentioned conditions.

Diclofenac sodium and morphine were used as the reference standards in pharmacological assay. Test materials have significantly (p< 0. 01) inhibited paw edema after Carrageenan and histamine induction at higher doses. Administration of test materials of M. macrantha (250 and 500 mg/kg b. w.) significantly reduced abdominal writhing, formalin nociception, cotton pellet granuloma and vascular permeability in experimental animal. In addition to this, bark of M. macrantha showed chronic anti-rheumatic effect by suppressing the swelling volume, arthritis index, hematological and biochemical parameters (ESR, RA factor, CRP, liver transferase enzyme) in FCA-induced arthritis. It also significantly inhibited protein denaturation, heat-induced haemolysis of RBC and reduction in total leukocyte migration.

MOS capacitors with TaN/SiO 2 /Si/Al and Al/TaN/SiO 2 /Si/Al structures, and Schottky diodes with TaN/Si/Al and Al/TaN/Si/Al structures, were fabricated on the same substrates. These devices were electrically characterized by capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurements after sintering in a conventional furnace in a forming gas environment at 450 degrees C, for different times between 0 and 30 min. From C-V measurements of the MOS capacitors, the <b>extracted</b> <b>TaN</b> work function, effective charge densities, and flatband voltage values were found to be between 4. 23 and 4. 42 eV, - 10 (11) and - 10 (12) cm(- 2), and - 0. 12 and 0. 25 V, respectively. From I-V measurements of the Schottky diodes, work function and ideality factor values between 4. 40 and 4. 53 eV, and 1. 0 and 1. 9, respectively, were extracted. The variation of the <b>TaN</b> work function (<b>extracted</b> from C-V and I-V curves), flatband voltage, and ideality factor values were related to dipole variations (at the TaN/SiO 2 interface), Ta and N vacancies in the TaN film, and oxygen incorporation on the TaN film surface.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the at least {{partially}} substitution of chrom tanning agents by production of leather. This will be achieved by <b>extracting</b> of natural <b>tanning</b> agents from the roots of local species of the Polygonaceae plant familiy. The research project has been conducted in cooperation with NIG GmbH Magdeburg (processing of raw material) and FILK gGmbH (testing the tanning agents on leather). The FH Anhalt cultivates the species Rheum, Reynoutria and Rumex and examines and describes the tanning substances in these plants using chemical-analytical methods. Results: a growth period {{of at least two}} years is necessary for plants to develop enough biomass and tanning agents. In Reynoutria the tanning substances are located in leaves which are easier to harvest. The leaves can be harvested several times in the year over a period of up to ten years. The tanning substances were studied using HPLC and DC. The concentration of the tanning substances in raw material determined by calibration with tanning substances from Quebracho was insufficient. The combination of HPLC with other separation techniques such as HPTLC will be more efficient in developing analytical method for the on-line observation of the raw material. Further investigations involving larger quantities of extracts are necessary in order to consolidate the results obtained so far. These investigations should be extended to include the species Reynoutria and Polygonum.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg 2004. A new peat {{replacement}} product is being manufactured in South Africa. This product which is marketed under {{the brand name}} Fibregro is made from spent wattle bark originating from the <b>tanning</b> <b>extract</b> manufacturing process. Fibregro is currently being used in South Africa to dilute {{and in some instances}} replace local peat in mushroom and horticultural applications. In addition to its role as a peat replacement, Fibregro is in a position where it could also qualify to cany a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label. Once in full production it is estimated that the company will be able to produce more products than can be sold locally. As a result export opportunities need to be pursued. The United Kingdom (UK) was identified as a potential export destination on account of developments in this country in respect of the certification of forest products (especially FSC certification) and moves to reduce peat mining. A mail survey was undertaken amongst growing media producers in the UK to address two key issues relating to Fibregro, namely: • Whether Fibregro's peat free status could be exploited in the UK growing media and mushroom casing markets. • Whether enough advantages existed in the UK market to justify the extra effort and cost associated with qualifying Fibrego to carry an FSC label. Key findings arising from this survey indicate that a niche is developing in the UK growing media market for a good peat substitute. The addition of an FSC label will render the product unique in the growing media market in this country. A number of recommendations arise from this work. These are: • In order to penetrate the UK growing media market Fibrgro must be positioned as an effective peat reducing agent which is capable of extending the peat reduction levels beyond that of composts. • Fibregro distributors should be identified from amongst the larger growing media producers in the UK. • Potential use of Fibregro as a mushroom casing in the UK appears to be limited. • A combination of peat free and FSC labelling while capable of rendering Fibregro unique in the UK growing media market needs to be carefully considered on account of chain-of-custody requirements along the supply chain...|$|R
