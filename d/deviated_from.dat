5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E

5|$|Amid their {{prolific}} reggae output as sessions musicians, solo artists, {{and production}} duo, Sly and Robbie—drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare—opened their own record label Taxi Records and attained a distribution deal with Island Records {{during the early}} 1980s. After Island founder and executive Chris Blackwell hired them to work with singer Grace Jones, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with funk and dub influences. This <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> their past reggae work, {{as well as the}} genre's roots sound and light rhythms. Sly and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the newest}} {{building}} began on December 4, 1936. The third state capitol was completed in 1938 and is the fourth-newest capitol in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on October 1, 1938, with speeches from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leslie M. Scott, Robert W. Sawyer, and Oregon Governor Charles Henry Martin. Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition, {{the design of the}} new building <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> the normal design of state capitol buildings. The design was labeled a combination of Egyptian simplicity and Greek refinement. Overall it is Art Deco in style, and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Emotions is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was released on September 17, 1991 by Columbia Records. The album <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> the formula of Carey's 1990 self-titled debut album, as she had more creative control over the material she produced and recorded. Additionally, Emotions features influences {{from a range of}} genres such as gospel, R, soul and 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry infusion. On the record, Carey worked with a variety of producers and writers, including Walter Afanasieff, the only hold over from her previous effort. Additionally, Carey wrote and produced the album's material with Robert Clivillés and David Cole from C+C Music Factory and Carole King, with whom she wrote one song.|$|E

The series <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> its American predecessor in terms of style, storyline, and characterization, but only minimally retained the essential themes that made the original a success. The characters feature three junior high school students Momoko Akatsutsumi (Hyper Blossom), Miyako Gotokuji (Rolling Bubbles), and Kaoru Matsubara (Powered Buttercup) as the three heroes.

5|$|This brought Kenney into {{conflict}} with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify {{the administration of the}} RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were. However, Kenney <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia. Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus {{starred in}} the feature film , and began {{cultivating}} a more mature image with her EP The Time of Our Lives in 2009. In 2010, she released her third album Can't Be Tamed, which stands as the lowest-selling record of her career, and {{starred in the}} coming-of-age film The Last Song. Cyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances in 2011 and 2012. Her sexually explicit behavior generated widespread controversy while promoting her fourth album Bangerz (2013), her first under her recording contract with RCA Records. Cyrus' independently-released fifth studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> her traditional pop style for more psychedelic experimentation. The following year, she became a coach on the singing competition television series The Voice; she has since appeared on two of its thirteen seasons.

5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (also {{known as}} KAL007 and KE007) was a {{scheduled}} Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On September 1, 1983, the South Korean airliner serving {{the flight was}} shot down by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace {{around the time of}} a U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission. The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and proceeded to destroy it with air-to-air missiles, after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots. The Korean airliner eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Larry McDonald, a Representative from Georgia in the United States House of Representatives. The Soviets found the wreckage under the sea on September 15, and found the flight recorders in October, but this information was kept secret until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Originally, lay status did not bar {{election}} to the See of Rome. Bishops of dioceses were sometimes elected while still catechumens, such as the case of St. Ambrose, who became Bishop of Milan in 374. In {{the wake of the}} violent dispute over the 767 election of Antipope Constantine II, Pope Stephen III held the synod of 769, which decreed that only a cardinal priest or cardinal deacon could be elected, specifically excluding those that are already bishops. Church practice, however, <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> this rule as early as 817 and fully ignored it from 882 with the election of Pope Marinus I, the Bishop of Caere. Nicholas II, in the synod of 1059, formally codified existing practice by decreeing that preference was to be given to the clergy of Rome, but leaving the cardinal bishops free to select a cleric from elsewhere if they so decided. The Council of 1179 rescinded these restrictions on eligibility.|$|E

5|$|The Act of February 16 {{proclaimed the}} {{re-establishment}} (atstatyti) of the Lithuanian state, {{making it the}} successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (sudaryti) of a Lithuanian state. However, it was {{made clear that the}} new state would be quite different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.|$|E
5|$|The first Labor {{party in}} South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, {{born out of}} a trade union {{association}} that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union, later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP morphed into the Australian Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not <b>deviated</b> <b>from</b> this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

From Cambria to Lockport's eastern suburbs, the highway originally used NY425, Lower Mountain Road, Akron Road, and a series of streets in Lockport. NY93 was moved onto NY104 and Junction Road in Cambria in the 1940s, and altered to bypass Lockport to the south on a new highway and Robinson and Dysinger roads in 1991. In 2006, NY93 was realigned west of Lockport to continue south on Junction Road to NY31.

40|$|The {{effect of}} iodine {{sorption}} on the free-volume of three polymers, namely, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polycarbonate {{have been investigated}} by the positron annihilation Lifetime technique. Diffusion coefficients have been evaluated from the sorption curves using Crank's solution for Fick's second law of diffusion. The positron results are {{explained in terms of}} iodine filling the free-volume holes, swelling and conformational changes. It has also been found that the diffusion process in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and poly(ethylene terephthalate) <b>deviates</b> <b>from</b> Fick's law of diffusion whereas in polycarbonate, the diffusion process obeys Fick's law. Further, for polymers in which diffusion <b>deviates</b> <b>from</b> Fick's law, the sorption process has been separated into diffusion-controlled (Fickian) and relaxation-controlled (non-Fickian) parts using the dual-mode sorption model. Interestingly, the present results show that the polymers which <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> Fickian diffusion also <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> Fujita's free-volume theory of diffusion and vice versa. The positron results also indicate that sorbed iodine in the polymer acts as an inhibitor of orthopositronium. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
