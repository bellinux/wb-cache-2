2500|$|The American {{copyright}} {{status of}} [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] began to draw more attention {{with the passage}} of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Act in Eldred v. Ashcroft in 2003, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer specifically mentioned [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in his dissenting opinion. American law professor Robert Brauneis, who extensively researched the song, concluded in 2010 that [...] "It is almost certainly no longer under copyright." [...] In 2013, based in large part on Brauneis's research, <b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> Productions, a company producing a documentary about [...] "Good Morning to All", sued Warner/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, and not to its lyrics and melody. In 2016, Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, and the court declared that [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] was in the public domain.|$|E
2500|$|On June 13, 2013, {{documentary}} filmmaker Jennifer Nelson filed a putative {{class action}} suit {{in federal court}} for the Southern District of New York against Warner/Chappell {{in the name of}} her production company, <b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> Productions. As part of a documentary she was making about the song and its history, she had paid 1,500 to secure the rights. Her complaint relied heavily on Brauneis's research, seeking not only the return of her money but all royalties collected by the company from other filmmakers since 2009. A week later a similar case was filed in the Central District of California, Rupa Marya v. Warner Chappell Music Inc, Case No. 2:13-cv-04460. Five weeks later, Nelson refiled the case there, and the cases were combined. As of April 2014, Warner's motion to dismiss had been denied without prejudice, and discovery began under an agreed plan with respect to Claim One, declaratory judgment as to whether [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] is in the public domain. [...] The Motion Cut-Off as to Merits Issues on the Claim One deadline was November 7, 2014. After that, the court was expected to rule on the motion for summary judgment as to the merits issues on Claim One. A jury trial was requested.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] he replied. [...] "The old man {{was very}} anxious I should find out. You see, a lot of {{information}} seems to have got over on the other side, and we couldn't think where it had leaked out, except through your wireless. However, that isn't likely, of course, unless you've got one of these beastly Germans in your receiving-room. Now if I can borrow a cigarette, a cigar, or a pipe of tobacco--any mortal thing to smoke--I'll be off, if I may. The old man turned me out at an unearthly hour this morning, and in Sheringham all the shops were closed. Steady on, young fellow," [...] he laughed, as Gerald filled his pockets with cigarettes. [...] "Well, here's <b>good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Miss Fentolin. Good morning, sir. How long ought it to take me to get to Sheringham?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, my dear Jane, I {{believe we}} must be running away. The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most {{agreeable}} piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing. <b>Good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> my dear sir.

6000|$|... "A <b>good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> my worthy {{guard and}} protector! here is rare news for your loyal ears. It seems that our prisoners are enemies {{to the king}} in disguise; and, Cornet Fitzgerald--Captain Borroughcliffe, of the --th, permit me to make you acquainted with Mr. Fitzgerald of the --th light dragoons." [...] While the {{soldiers}} exchanged their salutations, the old man continued: [...] "The cornet has been kind enough to lead down a detachment of his troop to escort the rogues up to London, or some other place, where they will find enough good and loyal officers to form a court-martial, that can authorize their execution as spies. Christopher Dillon, my worthy kinsman, Kit, saw into their real characters at a glance; while you and I, like two unsuspecting boys, thought the rascals would have made fit men to serve the king. But Kit has an eye and a head that few enjoy like him, and I would that he might receive his dues at the English bar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly;--possibly," [...] said Wharton, [...] "but I do {{not think}} it probable. <b>Good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir. If I have said {{anything}} that has seemed to be unkind, put it down to my anxiety as a father and not to my conduct as a man." [...] Then the door was closed behind his visitor, and Mr. Wharton was left walking up and down his room alone. He was by no means satisfied with himself. He felt that he had been rude {{and at the same time}} not decisive. He had not explained to the man as he would wish to have done, that it was monstrous and out of the question that a daughter of the Whartons, one of the oldest families in England, should be given to a friendless Portuguese,--a probable Jew,--about whom nobody knew anything. Then he remembered that sooner or later his girl would have at least £60,000, a fact of which no human being but himself was aware. Would it not be well that somebody should be made aware of it, so that his girl might have the chance of suitors preferable to this swarthy son of Judah? He began to be afraid, as he thought of it, that he was not managing his matters well. How would it be with him if he should find that the girl was really in love with this swarthy son of Judah? He had never inquired about his girl's heart, though there was one to whom he hoped that his girl's heart might some day be given. He almost made up his mind to go home at once, so anxious was he. But the prospect of having to spend an entire afternoon in Manchester Square was too much for him, and he remained in his chamber till the usual hour.|$|E
