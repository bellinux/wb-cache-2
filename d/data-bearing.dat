The resulting receiver has no delay lines and has better performance compared to the traditional scheme.

We will formulate the EVM minimization problem as a convex linear optimization problem and obtain an EVM lower bound.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest in ultra-wideband (UWB) radio techniques. A promising UWB technique being widely considered for low data rate applications, such as those often encountered in sensor networks is the transmitted reference (TR) UWB scheme. However, the standard TR-UWB scheme, while often motivated by the simplicity of its receiver is still dogged by implementation concerns. In particular, the receiver requires an extremely wideband delay element, which is difficult to incorporate into low-power integrated systems. In this paper, a transmitted-reference scheme is proposed in which the separation between the data and reference signals, rather than being a time delay, is a slow rotation over the symbol interval. This provides a (slightly) frequency-shifted reference that, while orthogonal to the <b>data-bearing</b> pulse, still goes through a nearly equal channel.

We focus on the class of techniques that perform clustered-dot halftoning, as commonly used in both dry toner and liquid toner electrophotographic processes. The method takes as input any grayscale image and a payload of data to be encoded and produces a bitonal clustered-dot halftone of that image with selected halftone clusters shifted to carry varying numbers of bits from the payload.

40|$|Abstract- The frequency-shifted {{reference}} (FSR) ultrawideband (UWB) {{communication scheme}} has been recently {{proposed by the}} authors. The key idea of the FSR-UWB system is to employ a reference signal that is slightly shifted in frequency from the <b>data-bearing</b> signal, {{and it has been}} shown that this results in a very simple receiver architecture. In particular, such a scheme obviates the need for the delay element that greatly complicates implementation of the receiver in standard transmitted reference UWB (TR-UWB) systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-differential FSR-UWB system, where multiple data carriers employ a single reference carrier. This modification essential increases the number of (differential) degrees of freedom available for signaling in the system. However, unlike most communication systems that provide such a dimensionality increase, the large ratio between the UWB system bandwidth and the carrier separation allows the multi-differential FSR-UWB to achieve this significant increase in signal space dimensionality over the standard FSR-UWB system with only a negligible increase in bandwidth. After a general performance characterization, applications to parallel data signaling, multidimensional signaling, and narrowband interference cancellation are considered that demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme.

30|$|To {{alleviate}} this problem, many PAPR reduction {{techniques have}} been proposed in the literature[3] for an overview. One of the classical and most popular techniques is known as tone reservation (TR) since no data is transmitted over the dedicated subcarriers[11 – 17]. In[18], a tone reservation algorithm has been developed where several subcarriers are set aside for PAPR reduction. Since the subcarriers are orthogonal, the additive signal on unused subcarriers causes no distortion to the <b>data-bearing</b> subcarriers. The TR technique attracted much attention for reducing PAPR for current and future OFDM standard systems because TR provides good PAPR reduction performance without BER performance degradation and signal distortion. In addition, the TR technique is simple and effective, and it causes no interference to the data signal. TR {{does not require the}} exchange of side information between transmitter and receiver. However, one of the disadvantages of TR is the increase in mean power of the transmitted signal because of corrective signal addition. Also, the computational complexity of the optimization algorithm is to calculate the optimized corrective tones which reduce the original signal's PAPR[11 – 15]. Therefore, practically, it is not realizable for a large number of peak reduction tone (PRT) set. Moreover, for these schemes, either the performance in PAPR reduction is suboptimal or the computational complexity is still high.|$|E
30|$|For {{the methods}} {{in the second}} category, the data are {{completely}} embedded in an arbitrary digital halftone image, which means, there is no constraints of the image size and no extra patterns which {{do not belong to}} the original image. Therefore, compared to the methods that belong to the first category, the methods that belong to the second category usually produced data-embedded halftone images that have closer visual impression to the original images. However, unlike the mature infrastructures of QR code technology, for the methods in this category, the correct decode rate and the robust machine-readable are the main concern that there is still room for improvement. Moreover, there are no uniformly accepted alignment format for the methods that belong to the second category. Typically, the topic of hiding information in digitized multimedia data has been widely exploited in the recent decades and is commonly referred to as digital watermarking. Because digital data (e.g., image, audio, and video) are easily counterfeited, digital watermarking techniques effectively prevent illegal duplication and provide digital copyright management or authentication. However, technology for enabling <b>data-bearing</b> hard copy introduces a new challenge that has not been addressed by conventional watermarking. Because of the extreme bi-level quantization inherent in digital printing process, conventional watermarks are easily damaged and no longer exist. Therefore, methods for watermarking in ready-to-print halftone images becomes a new unique topic, called halftone-based watermarking [12].|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Computers {{using the}} tagged-token {{dataflow}} model {{are among the}} best candidates for delivering extremely high levels of performance required in the future. Instruction scheduling in these computers is determined by associatively matching <b>data-bearing</b> tokens in a Waiting-Matching Unit (W-M unit). At the W-M unit, incoming tokens with matching contexts are forwarded to an instruction while non-matching tokens are stored to await their matching partner. Requirements of the W-M unit are exacting. Necessary token storage capacity at each processing element (PE) is presently estimated to be 100, 000 tokens. Since the most often executed arithmetic instructions require two operands, the bandwidth of the W-M unit must be approximately twice that of the ALU. The contradictory requirements of high storage capacity and high memory bandwidth have compromised the M-W units of previous dataflow computers limiting their speed. However, tokens arriving at a PE exhibit strong temporal locality. This naturally suggests the use of some caching technique. Using a recently developed CAM memory structure as a base, a token caching scheme is described which allows rapid, fully associative token matching while allowing a large token storage capacity. The key to the caching scheme is a fast and compact, articulated, first-in, first-out, content addressable memory (AFCAM) which allows associative matching and garbage collection while maintaining temporal ordering. A new memory cell is developed {{as the basis for the}} AFCAM in an advanced CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) technology. The design of the cell is discussed as well as electrical simulation results, verifying its operation and performance. Finally, estimated system performance of a dataflow computer using the caching scheme is presented...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{communication}} {{systems have been}} considered for future short-range wireless communications due {{to a number of}} advantages. However, the high multipath resolution of a conventional UWB system makes receiver design challenging. In particular, the huge number of resolvable paths of a multipath fading channel makes a rake receiver type architecture difficult due to the realization complexity and the problems arising from channel estimation. The transmitted-reference (TR) scheme has been proposed to ease this burden on the receiver for an impulse radio UWB system. However, despite the simplicity at first glance of the architecture of the TR-UWB system, practical implementation is challenging due to the difficulty of building an ultra-wideband delay element in a low power circuit. ^ In this dissertation, a new type of transmitted-reference ultra-wideband system is proposed. Rather than separating the data and reference signals by a time delay as in a standard TR-UWB system, the proposed scheme uses a slightly frequency-shifted reference (FSR) that is orthogonal to the <b>data-bearing</b> signal over the symbol interval. The proposed FSR-UWB system not only significantly simplifies the receiver design by successfully avoiding the delay element, but also outperforms the standard TR-UWB system in error performance. A multi-differential (MD) FSR-UWB system is also introduced in this dissertation, where multiple data carriers employ a common reference carrier. Compared to the original single-differential FSR-UWB system, this modification essentially increases the number of (differential) degrees of freedom available for signaling in the system with only a negligible increase in bandwidth. Moreover, a higher data rate and an improved error performance are also achieved. Finally, a multiple-access (MA) FSR-UWB system is introduced. It will be shown in this dissertation that the receiver of the proposed MA FSR-UWB system achieves processing gain but does not require knowledge of the spreading code of the user of interest. Therefore, an extremely simple receiver structure can be implemented by avoiding the need for a costly de-spreading circuitry. In addition, synchronization of the proposed schemes is discussed. It is shown that the FSR-UWB systems can realize synchronization without difficulty - even in a multiple access environment. ...|$|E
