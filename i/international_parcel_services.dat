40|$|<b>International</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>services</b> {{as well as}} online {{retailers}} are planning to install their own delivery drone fleets in the foreseeable future. Given the typical volumes of such businesses {{it is likely that}} this poses huge demands on the urban airspace in terms of capacity and conflict resolution. Current UTM concepts devise means to automatically detect and solve conflicts in smaller scales. However, it is yet unanswered to what degree a conflict-free operation of hundreds or thousands of drones occupying the same airspace is possible. In this paper we present a generic simulation framework that can load a given urban airspace with a specified demand or frequency of delivery drones. Based on actual street map data the user can specify a delivery area, a regular or randomized delivery schedule and a number of logistic centers to start from. Random destinations are then picked from the street maps and drones are scheduled to service these destinations. Further, the system analyzes the pre-planned drone schedule for conflicts and tries to resolve these conflicts without delaying individual drones too much. We detail statistics on how responsive the system is to adding tasks last-minute, and to unexpected events like emergency helicopters. The results give first insights, to what degree automatical de-conflicting solutions may work in urban areas...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally {{transportation}} and materials handling services have been organized along the transport modes, {{but today the}} logistics service concepts address more directly the needs of typical customers and {{the efficiency of the}} whole integrated transportation chain. We have witnessed during the last thirty years the introduction of <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>services,</b> intermodalism and lines of huge container ships, value added services provided by third parties, and mega carriers integrating local and regional postal and private cargo services in land, sea and air. In the context of supply chain management, transfer capabilities mean the collective abilities of the industry to provide cargo handling, warehousing and transportation services dealing with the economies of scale and scope of routes, facilities and organizations, and the costs of actually serving customer. Despite the prevalence of integrated multimodal services in practice there are no matching theoretical models of general transfer capabilities available for the analysis of the logistics services sector. Recognizing the tremendous change taking place in the transportation sector through globalization, deregulation, telecommunication and standardization, this thesis is targeting novel conceptual and operational approaches in the development of transfer capabilities and service solutions and to find generalized principles for strategic level structures and efficient operation to be applied over the entire physical transfer chain. The normative framework developed for the classification and analysis of physical transfer capabilities defines different types of transport and materials handling needs and business organizations that provide the delivery channels for the transfer services. By describing the long term changes of transfer services and the associated public and market institutions, an efficient matching of different transfer capabilities with various existing and new types of channel organizations can be determined in general, and with particular concern for the technological and organizational innovations in container shipping which is used as a test environment. The investigation involves in addition to sea {{transportation and}} port operations also the land transportation phases and terminal handling in the container transportation chain. Advanced solutions and operational practices are searched by examining the organizational models with strong emphasis on the role of standardization and cargo handling, transportation and information technology as well as the redesign of the technological and organizational interfaces. The influence of economic development trends and globalization to transfer services is reviewed. The first contribution of the thesis is a new conceptual framework Transfer Service Matrix (TSM) for classifying different transportation and material handling needs and types of organizational channels to position current practices and to visualize future development of transfer services. The second contribution comes from the use and testing of the TSM for analysis and illustration of potential structures for container transfer in case studies of operational and technological development in ports, where interviews and practical investigations are also supported with mathematical and simulation models. The third contribution is the discussion of the various organizational challenges when implementing networked business models and interlinked transfer chains. The managerial implications deal with the organizational and channel redesign issues required for the conservative industry to really bring the technological and operational process innovations to serve the customers...|$|E

The service was difficult to introduce as in several countries the carriage of parcels was a monopoly of the railway companies, and Egypt, Great Britain, India, Canada and Italy all initially claimed that there was no <b>parcel</b> <b>service</b> in their country.|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} in 1913, in January, that the Post Office {{introduced}} domestic <b>parcel</b> post <b>service</b> (a belated development, given that <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> post <b>service</b> between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious {{that none of these}} stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series—20¢ - had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.|$|R
