5|$|Jaws is a 1974 {{novel by}} American writer Peter Benchley. It {{tells the story}} of a great white shark that preys upon a small resort town and the voyage of three men trying to kill it. The novel <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Benchley's {{interest}} in shark attacks after he learned about the exploits of shark fisherman Frank Mundus in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, a period when Benchley struggled as a freelance journalist.|$|E

25|$|The man {{is passed}} by two {{container}} ships, {{which do not}} see him, despite his use of signaling flares. He drifts out of the shipping lane with no food and water. On the eighth day, he writes a letter, puts it in a jar, and throws it in the water as a message in a bottle. Later that night, he sees a light in the distance. He tears pages from his journal along with charts to create a signal fire. The fire <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control and consumes his raft. He falls {{into the water and}} allows himself to sink. Underwater, he sees the hull of a boat with a search light approaching his burning raft. He swims up towards the surface to grasp an outstretched hand.|$|E

25|$|Josephus {{interpreted}} the Tabernacle and its furnishings {{to represent the}} universe. He saw the Tabernacle's two parts accessible to the priests (the Holy and the Courtyard) to denote {{the land and the}} sea, the third division set aside for God (the Holy of Holies) to represent heaven, inaccessible to people. He saw the 12 loaves to denote the year divided into months. He saw the Menorah divided into 70 parts, representing the 70 divisions of the planets, and the seven lamps on the Menorah to refer to the course of the seven planets (then known). He saw the veils, composed of four things, to declare the four elements: the fine linen signified the earth, because the flax <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the earth; the purple signified the sea, because purple was dyed by the blood of shellfish from the sea; the blue signified the air; and the scarlet signified fire.|$|E

From the age of 14, he helped form the Philadelphia branch of the Black Panther Party with Defense Captain Reggie Schell, and other Panthers.

Modern varieties typically grow to a height of [...] The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest {{about a quarter of}} the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a basal disc. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt was {{particularly}} interested in Caliban, in part because others thought the character vulgar or evil.

[...] "The character <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the soil where it is rooted, uncontrouled, uncouth and wild, uncramped by any of the meannesses of custom [...] Vulgarity is not natural coarseness, but conventional coarseness, learnt from others, contrary to, or without an entire conformity of natural power and disposition; as fashion is the common-place affectation of what is elegant and refined without any feeling of the essence of it." [...] Stephano and Trinculo are vulgar by comparison, and [...] "in conducting [...] to Prospero's cell", by understanding the [...] "nature" [...] by which it is surrounded, [...] "Caliban shews the superiority of natural capacity over greater knowledge and greater folly." ...|$|E

500|$|Cicadas are {{commonly}} eaten by birds and sometimes by squirrels, {{as well as}} bats, wasps, mantises, spiders and robber flies. In times of mass emergence of cicadas, various amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals and birds change their foraging habits so as {{to benefit from the}} glut. Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals like moles. In Australia, cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees, making them drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hindlegs, sometimes over a distance of a hundred metres, until they can be shoved down into its burrow, where the numb cicada is placed onto one of many shelves in a [...] "catacomb", to form the food-stock for the wasp grub that <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the egg deposited there.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented {{positively}} on {{the arrangement}} of Monteith's song, grading the performance [...] "A". His lowest grade went to [...] "Papa, Can You Hear Me?", which he gave a [...] "C". Benigno felt that both Michele and Colfer's solos were damaged {{by the fact that}} the songs' only link to the episode's plot were their titles, finding it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing [...] "I wanna be your man" [...] about his father. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their [...] relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt's performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, [...] "it genuinely <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad never stops being kind of weird." [...] Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode. She felt that [...] "I Look to You" [...] was the episode's weakest song, preferring Riley's [...] "more powerful" [...] rendition of [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley's songs, which left her [...] "strangely unmoved". She suggested that, [...] "Mercedes sang admirably, beautifully even, but she didnâ€™t seem truly transported by the music; so we weren't." ...|$|E
500|$|Awarding the {{character}} of Ianto the status of [...] "Cult Spy Icon", British entertainment news website Digital Spy describes him as a [...] "cult legend", citing his dour demeanour, one-liners and [...] "eye candy" [...] label. Gay men's website AfterElton placed Ianto as their seventh best gay and bisexual character in modern science fiction (encompassing television, film and comic books), with Torchwoods Jack, Ianto's love interest, receiving first place. Wired magazine {{was impressed with the}} way Ianto's romantic storyline was handled in the third series, and praised Davies's writing for the [...] "deft, sympathetic handling" [...] of the Harkness-Jones romance, compared with the [...] "clumsiness" [...] of the show's homoerotic overtones in previous series. Because Ianto's storyline <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the reality of the show, [...] "it plays with such genuine sympathy and pathos that Jones's eventual fate is easily the miniseries' most powerful moment." [...] Wired describes David-Lloyd's performance as Jones as [...] "a key element in the success of the five-episode story arc." [...] One AfterElton contributor disliked the death scene partially for the loss of a [...] "beloved gay character", and because Ianto's death was caused by Jack's stupidity, goading on the aliens. They compared the death scene to that of Tara (Amber Benson) in Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer which he felt was more satisfying, although [...] "unbearably sad" [...] because of its pivotal role in {{the character}} arc for Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and as being [...] "possibly the single most significant event in the whole seven-season series." [...] He feels that both Joss Whedon and Russell T Davies toyed with their LGBT fans' affections, and claim [...] "neither Whedon nor Davies seem aware of the impact that these characters were having on viewers starved for such representations." [...] Later, AfterElton published an opposing view, which analysed the character's death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that, instead of being an expression of homophobia, the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of victimhood. In 2012 David Brown of the Radio Times described Ianto's demise as one of televisions five most shocking death scenes and [...] "surely [...] finest hour".|$|E

500|$|A {{common law}} rule from Great Britain permits {{searches}} incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule {{has been applied}} in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that [...] "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when [...] "there is no possibility" [...] that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that [...] "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been {{considered to be a}} strictly limited right. It <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the inherent necessities of the situation {{at the time of the}} arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." [...] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the [...] "immediate control" [...] of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to [...] "modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," [...] and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain [...] "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives â€” from the mundane to the intimate." ...|$|E

Many of the motivational theories that arose during the 1950s and 1960s were either based on Hull's original theory or were focused on providing alternatives to the drive-reduction theory, including Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which emerged as an alternative to Hull's approach.|$|E
