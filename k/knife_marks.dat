50|$|In October 1993, a local man, Bruce Pryor, {{discovered}} a human skull and femur {{in a particularly}} remote section of the forest. He returned with police to the scene and two more bodies were quickly {{discovered a}}nd identified as Deborah Everist and James Gibson. Gibson's skeleton showed 8 stab wounds. A large knife had cut through his upper spine causing paralysis. Stab wounds to his back and chest would have punctured his heart and lungs. Everist had been savagely beaten. Her skull fractured in two places, her jaw was broken and there were <b>knife</b> <b>marks</b> on her forehead. She had been stabbed once in the back.

40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} of vitrified ultrathin sections allows cell ultrastructure to {{be studied}} in the hydrated state. Sectioning of the frozen material is, however, a limiting step, since the cutting forces cause severe mechanical deformation. In order to address this problem, we have investigated the surface of cryosections. It is shown that cryosections have two fundamentally different surfaces. One surface is rough, deformed by cutting-induced deformation lines which are orientated perpendicular to the cutting direction. The other surface, in comparison, is not affected by those deformation lines. Except for <b>knife</b> <b>marks</b> it is smooth. In order to explain the observations, the following model is proposed. The rough relief corresponds to the former block face. Its roughness originates from material that is squeezed out of the section plane when the section is compressed in the cutting direction and bent away from the specimen block. The smooth section surface is the surface {{in contact with the}} knife during the sectioning. This contact keeps the surface smooth while imprinting the <b>knife</b> <b>marks...</b>|$|E
50|$|Swordmakers in Toledo, Spain, {{developed}} {{a market in}} the 1920s for gold plated automatic leverlock knives with pearl handles and enamel inlaid blades. Italian knifemakers had their own style of knives including both pushbutton and leverlock styles, some bearing design characteristics similar to the early French Châtellerault knife. Prior to World War II, hand crafted automatic <b>knives</b> <b>marked</b> Campobasso or Frosolone were often called Flat Guards because of the two-piece top bolster design. Some Italian switchblades incorporated a bayonet-type blade equipped with a blade lock release activated by picking a lever at the hinge end, and were known as picklocks. These were later supplanted by newer designs which incorporated the blade lock release into a tilting bolster, which released a spearpoint or bayonet-style blade.|$|R
5000|$|Testing {{confirmed}} that the existing M1917 and M1918 designs were in need of improvement. [...] Therefore, a replacement trench knife designated the U.S. Trench <b>Knife,</b> <b>Mark</b> I was jointly developed by officers of the AEF and the Engineering Division of U.S. Ordnance. [...] This knife was entirely different from the M1917, bearing a flat double-edged blade, a unique metal scabbard, and a cast-bronze handle with built-in guard for individual fingers. [...] The AEF stated that the Mark I {{was a combination of}} all of the best features of the trench knives evaluated, and the Mark I's double-edged blade was taken directly from the Couteau Poignard Mle 1916 (known as Le Vengeur), a trench knife design then currently in service with the French Army.|$|R

30|$|The {{specimens}} {{were determined}} to be of Hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl.). The block-shaped specimens with the annual ring inclinations of 0 ° (tangential direction), 45 ° (angle between tangential and radial direction), and 90 ° (radial direction) against the tensile direction were collected from the sapwood part. Thin cross-sectional specimens with the thickness of about 0.1  mm (longitudinal direction) and with the dimensions of 3.4  mm in width ×  20  mm in length {{were used for the}} tensile breaking test. This shape of specimen was selected because the most reliable results were obtained within the load range of the test device in pretest and the origin of the fracture could be clearly observed at cellular level. Furthermore, the thin specimens were prepared with extreme care not to generate scratches or <b>knife</b> <b>marks</b> which could be the origin of fracture. For the creep test, specimens in the same shape as that for the tensile breaking test were used.|$|E
40|$|Cryo-electron {{microscopy}} of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) {{has recently}} been shown to provide images of biological specimens with unprecedented quality and resolution. Cutting the sections remains however the major difficulty. Here, we examine the parameters influencing {{the quality of the}} sections and analyse the resulting artefacts. They are in particular: <b>knife</b> <b>marks,</b> compression, crevasses, and chatter. We propose a model taking into account the interplay between viscous flow and fracture. We confirm that crevasses are formed on only one side of the section, and define conditions by which they can be avoided. Chatter is an effect of irregular compression due to friction of the section of the knife edge and conditions to prevent this are also explored. In absence of crevasses and chatter, the bulk of the section is compressed approximately homogeneously. Within this approximation, it is possible to correct for compression by a simple linear transformation for the bulk of the section. A research program is proposed to test and refine our understanding of the sectioning process...|$|E
40|$|Toolmark {{analysis}} involves examining marks {{created on}} an object {{to identify the}} likely tool responsible for creating those marks (e. g., a knife). Although a potentially powerful forensic tool, knife mark analysis {{is still in its}} infancy and the validation of imaging techniques as well as quantitative approaches is ongoing. This study builds on previous work by simulating real-world stabbings experimentally and statistically exploring quantitative toolmark properties, such as cut mark angle captured by micro-CT imaging, to predict the knife responsible. In Experiment 1 a mechanical stab rig and two knives were used to create 14 knife cut marks on dry pig ribs. The toolmarks were laser and micro-CT scanned to allow for quantitative measurements of numerous toolmark properties. The findings from Experiment 1 demonstrated that both knives produced statistically different cut mark widths, wall angle and shapes. Experiment 2 examined <b>knife</b> <b>marks</b> created on fleshed pig torsos with conditions designed to better simulate real-world stabbings. Eight knives were used to generate 64 incision cut marks that were also micro-CT scanned. Statistical exploration of these cut marks suggested that knife type, serrated or plain, can be predicted from cut mark width and wall angle. Preliminary results suggest that knives type can be predicted from cut mark width, and that knife edge thickness correlates with cut mark width. An additional 16 cut marks walls were imaged for striation marks using scanning electron microscopy with results suggesting that this approach might not be useful for knife mark analysis. Results also indicated that observer judgements of cut mark shape were more consistent when rated from micro-CT images than light microscopy images. The potential to combine micro-CT data, medical grade CT data and photographs to develop highly realistic virtual models for visualisation and 3 D printing is also demonstrated. This is the first study to statistically explore simulated real-world <b>knife</b> <b>marks</b> imaged by micro-CT to demonstrate the potential of quantitative approaches in knife mark analysis. Findings and methods presented in this study are relevant to both forensic toolmark researchers as well as practitioners. Limitations of the experimental methodologies and imaging techniques are discussed, and further work is recommended...|$|E

30|$|According to Koch [5], {{quality of}} peripheral-planed {{surfaces}} is generally improved by short wavelengths (or feed per knife) and low height of <b>knife</b> <b>marks.</b> This is generally accomplished {{by increasing the}} cutting circle diameter, number of jointed knives, or by reducing feed speed. Indeed, reduction in feed speed decreases the normal cutting force [5, 6] by reducing chip dimensions. Rake angle and jointing operation are also important factors influencing surface quality during planing process. For several species, better surface quality is observed as rake angle decreases from 30 ° to 15 ° [7 – 9], whereas the effect of jointing operation depends on wood species and knife wear [3, 10, 11]. On the other hand, Carrano et al. [6] reported an increase in surface quality when decreasing the depth of cut. However, Iskra and Hernández [12] found that surface quality is not affected by depth of cut during routing paper birch wood with different grain orientations. Difference between these two studies {{could be related to}} the efficiency of feeding systems used for conducting the experiments (vibrational effects).|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} preparing single cells for freeze-fracture has involved freezing a cell pellet on a carrier. Then, the specimen is cleaved {{with a cold}} knife to expose the fracture faces. This method has several disadvantages. First, by {{the formation of a}} cell pellet, the information on the orientation of individual cells is lost and, consequently, {{it is difficult to determine}} the location of the fracture face with respect to the whole cell. Second, the cleaving process often leaves <b>knife</b> <b>marks</b> on the fracture face, and at these positions the morphological information is completely lost. Thus, the exposure of large intact fracture faces is a fortuitous event and difficult to reproduce, Recently, several workers have reported alternative methods for freeze-fracturing cells in tissue culture or in monolayer (2, 3, 7). All these methods involve growing or plating the cells on a piece of thin metal or coverglass. A second metal piece is then applied to the top, and the whole sandwich with the cells in the middle is frozen. The top part is ripped away and this produces the fracture. Although this method works satisfactorily on flat cell layers, it has only limited use on spherical cells because the contact area between these cells and the substratum is very small. In this paper, we present a simple and selective method to freeze-fracture large spherical cells with a diameter greater than 70 k~m. We have used this method successfully to study the development of the fucoid egg (6) ...|$|E
5000|$|In France, 19th-century folding <b>knives</b> <b>marked</b> Châtellerault were {{available}} in both automatic and manually opened versions in several sizes and lengths.
