Attentiveness, responsiveness, and adaptation are also what characterises good care (Tronto; Mol).

40|$|Organic {{animal feed}} {{is the basic}} element for organic animal production. In our country, in organic animal feed farming, farmers {{generally}} prefer forage crops as by-products and do not follow an alternation system for animal feed production. They make feed production either as inter-crop or as second crop. For this reason, there is no production based on an alternation {{system in which the}} animal can meet all nutritional needs. In the same season in the production of organic animal feed, roughage, energy feed and protein feed are needed to meet all animal nutritional values. The cultivation of these feed plants can be achieved with a good rotation system. However, most of the farmers do not know which rotation system give more organic feed. For this reason, yields of some plants suitable for Aegean Region conditions have been examined in 2 different rotation systems. In this study carried out in Menemen Plain, in Aegean Region, Izmir, Turkey during a period of 4 years between 2013 and 2016 the effect of two different rotation systems on the roughage, energy and protein feed yields in organic feed cultivation was studied. According to the results of soil analysis, organic fertilizer containing 2 % N, 2. 5 % P 2 O 5, 2. 5 % K 2 O, 60 % organic matter and 9 / 12 C/N was given to the plots.

40|$|Crop {{rotation}} has a {{key role}} in improving the soil and increasing the yield. Crop rotation with legumes, recycling of crop residues and the application of organic manure must form the basis of nutrient management in organic farming. Presence of legumes in rotation may serve as the primary source of nitrogen for subsequent crops. Most deficiencies in the soil are directly linked to low organic matter content. Organic matter has a very crucial significance for soil fertility improvement. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of some plants used in animal feeding on soil organic matter (SOM). For this purpose some certain plants have been selected and tested in two different rotation systems. This study was carried out in Menemen Plain, in Aegean Region, Izmir, Turkey during a period of 5 years between 2012 and 2016. Trial was set up in a randomized block design with four replications. According to the results of soil analysis, organic fertilizer containing 2 % N, 2. 5 % P 2 O 5, 2. 5 % K 2 O, 60 % organic matter and 9 / 12 C/N was given to the plots. Fertilization was carried out so as not to exceed 170 kg / ha nitrogen as stated in the organic <b>farming</b> <b>law.</b> In the study, the fertilizer applications required by the plants were made considering the residual nitrogen from the plant roots. In the first rotation system Persian clover - silage maize, vetch/triticale mixture– cotton, Persian clover - silage maize, vetch/triticale mixture – cotton, in the second rotation system Persian clover - silage maize, triticale (grain) – second crop soybean, Persian clover - silage maize, triticale (grain) – second crop soybean were consecutively cultivated for five years. Soil organic matter (SOM) in soil samples taken from 0 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm in rotation system mentioned above was analyzed.

Highly contagious maladies like foot-and-mouth disease threaten international livestock. Some {{of the most promising}} scientific breakthroughs designed to expand and improve food production raise fundamental questions about safety, ethics and environmental impact. The 13 th annual Red Clay Conference, an environmental law symposium sponsored by the University of Georgia School of Law 2 ̆ 7 s Environmental Law Association (ELA), will focus upon the critical concern of the world 2 ̆ 7 s food supply in 2 ̆ 2 Farming the Environment: Issues in Sustainable Dining, 2 ̆ 2 a day-long seminar to be held Friday, March 16 at Dean Rusk Hall. The conference is open free to the public. Keynote speakers include former U. S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Professor J. B. Ruhl of Florida State University. Both keynote lectures, as well as lunch and receptions, will be held on the fourth floor of Dean Rusk Hall. 2 ̆ 2 The need for good food and clean water is perhaps the most universal reason that people become interested in environmental issues, 2 ̆ 2 said Jenny Culler, ELA president. 2 ̆ 2 We hope to explore with this year 2 ̆ 7 s Red Clay Conference the processes that bring the food to our plates, the problems surrounding these processes, and ways we can all work to ensure healthful and sustainable dining. 2 ̆ 2 The Red Clay Conference begins at 8 : 30 a. m. with a welcome from the man widely regarded as the father of ecosystem ecology, Professor and Director Emeritus of the University of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s Institute of Ecology Eugene Odum. Five segments of panel discussions follow, addressing implications of the new USDA organic labeling regulations, genetically modified foods, irrigation and clean water issues, animal rights, cloning, fish consumption guidelines, and pesticide use. Speakers include representatives from the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, leading researchers like UGA 2 ̆ 7 s renowned cloning expert Steve Stice, Georgia Legal Watch, Georgia Organics, attorneys and professors specializing in environmental issues, and many others. Dan Glickman 2 ̆ 7 s presents the afternoon keynote address at 2 p. m. As Secretary of Agriculture under President Bill Clinton, Glickman led the USDA during a time of tremendous challenge and transition for America 2 ̆ 7 s farming and rural communities. The turbulent farm economy surged to record highs in commodity prices and agricultural exports, then plunged to record lows. Glickman pursued a balanced approach to federal land management through the U. S. Forest Service - also under the USDA 2 ̆ 7 s umbrella - striving to ensure that environmental and sustainability concerns were critical parts of the federal policy that governed nearly 200 million acres of public lands. Glickman had 10, 000 employees overseeing food safety functions around the country and, under his watch, the USDA replaced antiquated food safety regulations with a new science-based meat and poultry inspection system that reduced outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. In addition, Glickman served as a strong voice on the issue of genetically modified foods. He advocated biotechnology and its potential to increase agricultural productivity and preserve natural resources; at the same time, he took steps to ensure that the new technology is governed by a thorough, untainted regulatory approval process which is based on sound science. J. B. Ruhl, an environmental law scholar and teacher at Florida State University, presents the morning keynote address on <b>farming</b> <b>law</b> and its environmental impact at 11 a. m. Ruhl is a prolific author in the environmental field and serves as the executive editor of Natural Resources and the Environment, a quarterly publication sponsored by the Section of Natural Resources, Energy and Environmental Law of the American Bar Association. He was formerly an attorney in Washington, D. C. and Austin, Texas. The Red Clay Conference is graciously underwritten by the Turner Foundation. Additional support for Glickman 2 ̆ 7 s address is provided by the UGA School of Law, College of Agricultural and Environmental Science, Institute of Ecology, and Warnell School of Forest Resources. The Red Clay Conference was the first annual law school-sponsored environmental symposium in the eastern United States. Each year, a full spectrum of views from the private legal sector, corporate/business sector, government and public interest groups is represented. The Environmental Law Association is a non-profit law school student organization whose members are concerned about promoting environmental awareness. Although the conference is free to the public, those who pre-register on the ELA website will have the option of purchasing lunch and a bound copy of the conference proceedings for 15 (www. lawsch. uga. edu/ redclay).
