This new technique of surgery may also be useful for patients in whom blood products are not acceptable. Chiang Mai Medical Journal 2007; 46 (4) : 147 - 152. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a com-mon orthopedic surgery that can result in considerable blood loss.

40|$|Abstract Background Bone wax is {{traditionally}} used {{as part of}} surgical procedures to prevent bleeding from exposed spongy bone. It is an effective hemostatic device which creates a physical barrier. Unfortunately it interferes with subsequent bone healing and {{increases the risk of}} infection in experimental studies. Recently, a water-soluble, synthetic, hemostatic compound (Ostene ®) was introduced to serve the same purpose as bone wax without hampering bone healing. This study aims to compare sternal healing after application of either bone wax or Ostene ®. Methods Twenty-four pigs were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Ostene ®, bone wax or no hemostatic treatment (control). Each animal was subjected to midline sternotomy. Either Ostene ® or bone wax was applied to the spongy bone surfaces until local hemostasis was ensured. The control group received no hemostatic treatment. The wound was left open for 60 min before closing to simulate conditions alike those of cardiac surgery. All sterni were harvested 6 weeks after intervention. Bone density and the area of the bone defect were determined with peripheral quantitative CT-scanning; bone healing was displayed with plain X-ray and chronic inflammation was histologically assessed. Results Both CT-scanning and plain X-ray disclosed that bone healing was significantly impaired in the bone <b>wax</b> <b>group</b> (p Conclusion Bone wax inhibits bone healing and induces chronic inflammation in a porcine model.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: New {{production}} {{methods have}} been developed for metal ceramic restorations. Different production methods may show different surface roughness and fit, which may affect retention and long-term success. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to examine 3 different production methods with regard to surface roughness, marginal and internal fit, and retention of cobalt-chromium alloy single-crown copings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A master abutment of a premolar mandibular tooth preparation with 4 -mm height and a 0. 6 -mm deep 120 -degree chamfer finish line with a 12 -degree angle of convergence was replicated in die stone and scanned. Thirty-six cobalt-chromium alloy copings were produced using 3 different production techniques. Twelve copings were produced by laser-sintering, 12 by milling, and 12 by milled wax/lost wax. The surface microstructure of 2 copings in each group was analyzed using interferometry. The remaining 10 copings in each group were used to evaluate marginal and internal fit by using an impression material replica method, and retention was evaluated by using a uniaxial tensile force pull-off test. The copings from each test group were cemented with zinc phosphate cement onto resin abutments. Statistical analyses of differences in marginal and internal fit were performed using 1 -way ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in surface topography were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for nonparametric data. Differences in retentive values were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data (all α=. 05). RESULTS: Differences in surface microstructure were seen. The laser-sintered copings showed increased surface roughness compared with milled and milled wax/lost wax copings. Differences in marginal and internal fit were noted. Laser-sintered showed significantly smaller spaces between coping and abutment than milled wax/lost wax copings (P=. 003). At the margins, laser-sintered copings showed significantly smaller spaces than either the milled wax/lost <b>wax</b> <b>group</b> (P=. 002) or the milled group (P=. 002). At the chamfer, laser-sintered copings showed significantly smaller spaces than milled wax/lost wax copings (P=. 005). At the center of the axial walls, laser-sintered copings showed significantly smaller spaces than those in the milled wax/lost wax (P=. 004) and milled copings (P=. 005). No significant differences were noted between milled and milled wax/lost wax copings (P>. 05). No significant differences were detected regarding retentive forces in the pull-off tests (P>. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Laser-sintered Co-Cr crown copings showed increased surface roughness and better internal and marginal fit than copings produced by milling or milled wax/lost wax technique. However, the crown pull-off tests did not reveal any significant differences...|$|R

5000|$|The {{collective}} {{method of}} work follows other Chinese art {{groups such as}} the Big Tail Elephants. The Yangjiang Group's works are noted for their apolitical content, non-representational method of expression, and unabashed refutation and criticism of political analysis of Chinese contemporary art. Xiao Fengxia attributed the aniconism of their works to a degree of political autonomy from Beijing in Guangdong Province: [...] "Far away from the hierarchal chronotope of Beijing, southern China drifts away from the center…the local people's innovative spirit, lifestyles, and political feelings are unique, and do not completely follow Beijing…Southern China's economic boom. especially in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta Region...led to unprecedented growth in prosperity that overturned orthodox Socialist thought." [...] The Yangjiang Group work primarily with calligraphy, but also other mediums such as video and <b>wax</b> sculpture. The <b>group</b> frequently combines various mediums that engages many different senses, and with special attention to the relationship among the work of art, the audience, and the gallery space. Their works are often done impromptu to erase the distance between a work of art and the lived experience, where [...] "life itself becomes an integral part of their art." ...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal {{features}} were studied in all 17 species of Passerina, a genus endemic to southern Africa. Leaves in Passerina are inversely ericoid, the adaxial surface concave and the abaxial surface convex. Leaves are inversely dorsiventral and epistomatic. The adaxial epidermis is villous, with unicellular, uniseriate trichomes and relatively small thin-walled cells, promoting flexibility of leaf margins owing to turgor changes. In common {{with many other}} Thymelaeaceae, abaxial epidermal cells are large and tanniniferous with mucilaginous cell walls. The cuticle is adaxially thin, but abaxially well devel­oped, probably enabling the leaf to restrict water loss and to tolerate high light intensity and UV-B radiation. Epicuticular waxes, present in all species, comprise both soft and plate waxes. Epidermal structure proves to be taxonomically impor­tant at family, genus and species levels. Interspecific differences include arrangement of stomata and presence or absence of abaxial epidermal hair. Other diagnostic characters of the abaxial epidermal cells are arrangement,size and shape, cutic- ular ornamentation and {{presence or absence of}} <b>wax</b> platelets. Two <b>groups</b> of species on the basis of abaxial epidermal cell orientation are recognised. Many leaf epidermal features in Passerina are interpreted as structural adaptations to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape...|$|R
