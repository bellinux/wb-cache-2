25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He {{admitted}} that Dravo Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) but rather on the mere fact that a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be no end to unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E

5000|$|Appellant's {{attack is}} {{based solely on}} {{decisions}} of this Court holding that a tax on the [...] "privilege" [...] of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity {{that is part of}} interstate commerce. See, e. g., Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, 340 U.S. 602 (1951); Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U.S. 249 (1946).

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has also}} struck down {{attempts}} by states to control or direct {{the affairs of}} federal institutions. McCulloch v.

Marshall wrote that [...] "the States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control, {{the operations of the}} constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government." [...] United States property is wholly immune to state taxation, as are government activities and institutions.

60|$|Such was the {{beginning}} of the war of independence. Many American writers have declared that previous to that battle there was no desire for independence on the part of the colonists, but this is emphatically contradicted by the language used at the meetings and in the newspapers which have come down to us.

But experience has shown that when the spark of revolution is once lighted, when resistance to the law has once commenced, things are carried to a point far beyond that dreamed of by the first leaders.|$|E
6000|$|These Roman confiscators, {{who were}} yet {{only in the}} {{elements}} of tyranny, and were not instructed in the rights of men to exercise all sorts of cruelties on each other without provocation, thought it necessary to spread a sort of color over their injustice. They considered the vanquished party as composed of traitors, who had borne arms, or otherwise had acted with hostility, against the commonwealth. They regarded them as persons who had forfeited their property by their crimes. With you, in your improved state of the human mind, {{there was no such}} formality. You seized upon five millions sterling of annual rent, and turned forty or fifty thousand human creatures out of their houses, because [...] "such was your pleasure." [...] The tyrant Harry the Eighth of England, as he was not better enlightened than the Roman Mariuses and Syllas, and had not studied in your new schools, did not know what an effectual instrument of despotism was to be found in that grand magazine of offensive weapons, the rights of men. When he resolved to rob the abbeys, as the club of the Jacobins have robbed all the ecclesiastics, he began by setting on foot a commission to examine into the crimes and abuses which prevailed in those communities. As it might be expected, his commission reported truths, exaggerations, and falsehoods. But truly or falsely, it reported abuses and offences. However, as abuses might be corrected, as every crime of persons does not infer a forfeiture with regard to communities, and as property, in that dark age, was not discovered to be a creature of prejudice, all those abuses (and there were enough of them) were hardly thought sufficient ground for such a confiscation as it was for his purposes to make. He therefore procured the formal surrender of these estates. All these operose proceedings were adopted by one of the most decided tyrants in the rolls of history, as necessary preliminaries, before he could venture, by bribing the members of his two servile Houses with a share of the spoil, and holding out to them an eternal <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation,</b> to demand a confirmation of his iniquitous proceedings by an act of Parliament. Had fate reserved him to our times, four technical terms would have done his business, and saved him all this trouble; he needed nothing more than one short form of incantation:--"Philosophy, Light, Liberality, the Rights of Men." ...|$|E
50|$|The Farm Credit Act of 1933 created various lending institutions, {{including}} {{banks for}} cooperatives, which are designated as federally chartered instrumentalities of the United States. CoBank ACB is {{the successor to}} all rights and obligations of the National Bank for Cooperatives. In 1996, CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of that bank, requesting an exemption from all Missouri corporate income taxes and refunds on the taxes it paid for 1991 through 1994. CoBank asserted that the Supremacy Clause accords federal instrumentalities <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> state <b>taxation</b> unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity, which the Act did not expressly do. The state of Missouri denied the request, but the Missouri State Supreme Court reversed, stating that because the Act's current version is silent as to the banks' tax immunity, Congress cannot {{be said to have}} expressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, the banks are exempt.|$|R

40|$|This Note {{discusses}} the attempts by states to tax entities {{which have a}} distinguishing connection to the federal government. Two competing interests are at stake. First, {{from the perspective of}} the federal government, such taxation by the state involves the power to destroy or at least the power to substantially interfere with the functions of federal law and thus subvert the operation of the Supremacy Clause. Second, because the taxing power is an essential instrument of every sovereign government, the judicial denial of a state 2 ̆ 7 s right to exercise this power would deprive it of a much needed source of revenue. This Note is specifically concerned with how these interests relate to state taxation of recipients of federal loan and equity financing and argues that in this particular area the judicial is not the proper forum for weighing these complex policy issues because Congress is in a better position to decide this question. Section II of this Note traces the constitutional history of the doctrine of federal immunity. Section III sets out the various tests which have been use to determine when a private entity may be considered a federal instrumentality for purposes of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> state <b>taxation.</b> Section IV {{discusses the}} doctrine as it presently exists in relation to loan and equity finance programs of the federal government.

40|$|I do {{not know}} whether to call myself a utility infielder or a garbage man, but I have a number of widely {{disparate}} cases to talk about, all of which affect state and local governments in a very significant way. I want to start with Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation, the retroactivity case, because this one produced an interesting split between the so-called conservative judges. I {{do not know}} if there are Federalists out there, but two basic propositions of Federalist doctrine were at issue here. One was the extent of state <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> federal <b>taxation,</b> and the other was the whole question of retroactivity. To a Federalist, {{it is very important that}} state governments not be imposed upon by federal courts and federal tax problems. On the other hand, they like to think of courts as always discovering the law, not making the law. If you were a possible candidate for a federal judgeship and you went to the Justice Department in the Reagan and Bush. Administration, the very first question they would ask you is, “are you in favor of judges making law or do you think judges simply discover law?” You had better get that question right or you are not going to go any further. And, of course, the doctrine is that judges never make law, they discover law. Problems of retroactivity implicate that very key issue. Under what circumstances should a court, having made either a constitutional or a non-constitutional determination, say that a law applies in this case and in future cases, but it does not apply backwards. Any governmental body that says, “This is the law from now on,” is making law. I do not know how else to describe it. Judges are not supposed to do that, they are supposed to say, “Oh, we were blind, but now we can see. We did not know what the law was. Now we know. It is the law and oh, by the way, it always was the law. ” If there is one strong Federalist doctrine, it is that judges should not make law and therefore a decision should always apply retroactively. The Harper case involved that issue in a very significant way for state and local governments...|$|R
40|$|In Florida, the {{ad valorem}} {{property}} tax {{is the single}} most important source of revenue for local governments. Considerable revenue is lost to local governments when property that should be taxed is not taxed because of mistaken application of the governmental immunity doctrine. Most governmentally owned property is used by the governmental entity for governmental purposes and remains nontaxable. However, when governmentally owned property is used by a nongovernmental person for a nonexempt use, the property no longer enjoys governmental immunity and is taxable. After all, such property is being used for private, profit-seeking purposes in competition with nongovernmentally owned property being used for similar purposes; the privately owned property is taxable, and so too is the governmentally owned property. It is a matter of compelling public interest that Florida 2 ̆ 7 s tax system is applied in a fair, evenhanded manner [...] that similarly situated taxpayers be taxed in the same manner. When property is being used for private, nonexempt purposes, it should be subject to ad valorem taxation, regardless of who owns the underlying fee interest in the property. Part II of this article briefly discusses the governmental immunity doctrine and the circumstances under which it has been waived. Part III explores the waiver of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> ad valorem <b>taxation</b> in Florida when governmentally owned property is used by a nongovernmental entity for a nonexempt use.

40|$|In Michelin Tire Corp. v.

The provision forbidding the states from laying 2 ̆ 2 any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports 2 ̆ 2 was never intended to prohibit such a levy, the Court now tells us, and the case first suggesting that it did, Low v.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> {{execution of}} state property in execution proceedings of arbitral awards. In this study, I aim {{to consider the}} extent of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution in these execution proceedings. This includes considerations of current rules in public international law on <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution {{and the application of}} these rules on national execution proceedings of arbitral awards. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution protects state property <b>from</b> execution measures. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution is based on equality of states and the upholding of friendly relations between states. States have in the 20 th century started to participate in commercial transactions and dealings with individuals. This has led to the revision of the traditionally absolute notion of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution has been limited in certain instances. The view on the extent of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution is not always coherent in the international community. There is no universal international convention in force that regulates the matter. National courts interpret the rules on <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution, which means that there can be quite incoherent and unexpected decisions in this area of public international law. The certainty of execution is of crucial importance in relation to arbitral proceedings. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution is a factor that compromises this certainty. As arbitration is time-consuming and costly, uncertainty relating to the execution of arbitral awards can mean that individuals refrain from arbitrating against states. This, again, can impact trade and investment involving states. The Sedelmayer saga is an excellent illustration of the implications that <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution can have on execution of mixed arbitral awards. Sedelmayer is an investor whose investment was expropriated by the Russian Federation. An arbitral award was subsequently rendered against Russia. Sedelmayer has sought execution against Russian property in both Germany and Sweden over the last 13 years, without fully succeeding to satisfy the award. He also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the ground of the German proceedings. In this thesis, I will critically consider the implications that <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution can have on execution of arbitral awards. Regard will be taken to sources of public international law, especially treaties and customary international law. I will also examine domestic legislation and case law in order to accurately consider national perceptions and tendencies of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution. I will especially use the Sedelmayer saga as an illustrating and exemplifying series of case law...|$|R
