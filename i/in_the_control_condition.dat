500|$|Smeets used {{name and}} {{birthday}} matching in a product liking experiment. He made up product names for a DVD that matched both {{part of the}} participant's name {{and his or her}} birthday. For example, a participant named Mariëlle, born on 14 May would get an ad for a DVD-player named [...] "DVD-Ma 14" [...] in the self-relevant condition and [...] "DVD-Pu 30" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> He found that high self-esteem participants liked products more if the product names were self-relevant than if they were not. He also found the opposite happened among low self-esteem participants: they liked products better if they were not self-relevant.|$|E
500|$|Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers {{keep track of the}} profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code [...] "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. [...] "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers. Relative to participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> participants in the birthday-association condition could {{at the end of the}} test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people. Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers. They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.|$|E

50|$|Research on the DITF {{effect in}} {{internet}} fundraising {{indicates that the}} DITF technique works in an electronic context. This study looked at donations for children victims of mine injuries. The homepage of the website provided pictures of children with injuries. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> the homepage asked for donations and redirected participants to a page with a picture and several links to outside charitable organizations. In the DITF condition, the homepage asked participants to help {{the children in the}} photographs. The link redirected participants to a page that asked them to spend several hours a week finding people to donate to the site. There were links to respond to the question on the page. After a refusal, the participants were redirected to the same page as the control group, which had links to outside charities. The researcher measured numbers of clicks on these links, not actual donations.

50|$|Beyond {{addictive}} behavior, opponent-process {{theory can}} in principle explain why processes (i.e. situations or subjective states) that are aversive and unpleasant {{can still be}} rewarding. For instance, after being exposed to a stressful situation (cold pressor test), human participants showed greater physiological signs of well-being than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> Self-report measures and subjective ratings show that relief from physical pain can induce pleasant feelings, and a reduction of negative affect. Accordingly, opponent-process theory can also help to explain psychopathological behavior such as non-suicidal self-injury.|$|E

40|$|Background Standardised {{effect sizes}} {{have been criticized}} because they are {{difficult}} to interpret and offer little clinical information. This meta-analyses examine the extent of actual improvement, the absolute numbers of patients no longer meeting criteria for major depression, and absolute rates of response and remission. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of 92 studies with 181 conditions (134 psychotherapy and 47 <b>control</b> <b>conditions)</b> with 6937 patients meeting criteria for major depressive disorder. Within these conditions, we calculated the absolute number of patients no longer meeting criteria for major depression, rates of response and remission, and the absolute reduction on the BDI, BDI-II, and HAM-D. Results After treatment, 62 % of patients no longer met criteria for MDD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> psychotherapy conditions. However, 43 % of participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> and 48 % of people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> care-as-usual conditions no longer met criteria for MDD, suggesting that the additional value of psychotherapy compared to care-as-usual would be 14 %. For response and remission, comparable results were found, with {{less than half of}} the patients meeting criteria for response and remission after psychotherapy. Additionally, a considerable proportion of response and remission was also found <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> psychotherapy conditions, scores on the BDI were reduced by 13. 42 points, 15. 12 points on the BDI-II, and 10. 28 points on <b>the</b> HAM-D. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>conditions,</b> these reductions were 4. 56, 4. 68, and 5. 29.

The self-interest bias among recipients was particularly strong when talent rather than effort attributions were imposed oil them. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{possible}} effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well-known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, {{all of whom were}} familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition. Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> fell in-between the two experimental conditions. This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of studies {{concerning}} the foot-in-the door technique and charitable donations.

Others were not asked to sign a petition before making a donation (control condition). The request to sign a petition was made two weeks prior to the request to make a donation. They found that a greater percentage of people made a donation in the foot-in-the-door condition than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> Also, they found that making the small request to sign a petition resulted in more money being donated than not making this request.|$|E

The study involved male and female confederates who ordered lemonade at a restaurant and engaged in conversation before the male announced loudly that he was leaving to buy a part for his bicycle. After he left the female confederate expressed aloud that the male did not pay and asked the participant sitting near her to pay the total bill. In the DITF condition, the female confederate asked if the participant would pay part of the bill after a refusal to pay the total bill from every participant. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> the female confederate only made the second smaller request. The DITF technique yielded significantly more behavioral compliance than the control, which shows that the DITF technique works {{for more than just}} verbal agreement.|$|E
