Later, in July, it was confirmed that a book entitled Out of the Blue: The Traci Lords Story was in development. However, the project was shelved due to problems with the publishing deal. On November 4, 2000, when Lords was a guest on The Howard Stern Show, she was again asked about the book but said she had no intentions of putting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> that time.|$|E

The oldest were in Newcastle and Durham, South Wales, the Central Belt of Scotland and the Midlands, such as those at Coalbrookdale. The oldest continuously worked deep-mine in the United Kingdom was Tower Colliery in the South Wales coalfield. This colliery was developed in 1805, and its miners bought <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} 20th century, to prevent it from being closed.

That night, Revis was charged for aggravated assault, robbery, terroristic threats and conspiracy stemming. Revis turned himself into police the following day and was released on non-monetary bond. All charges were dismissed March 15 after a friend of Revis testified that he was responsible for knocking the two men out.|$|E
25|$|Ripburger flees in a {{semi-trailer}} truck, but as Ben and Maureen {{ride away}} he reappears and rams them.

25|$|Despite his {{relative}} {{successes in}} his near abroad, Swa still had {{little control over}} his own vassal Toungoo. He never trusted Gov. Pyanchi of Toungoo, who was educated in Pegu and had been contact with Pegu during Ava's brief war with Maw. As a first step, in 1374, Swa asked Toungoo's eastern neighbor Lan Na not to interfere. Chronicles say after he had threatened to send a sizable force to the frontier, Chiang Mai sent an embassy to Ava, and agreed to a peace treaty. But Chiang Mai might have simply let Ava and Pegu fight <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> any rate, Pyanchi now recognized that Ava was trying to isolate him, and asked Pegu for military aid. Despite the 1370 non-aggression pact, Binnya U sent a sizable force consisting of infantry, cavalry and war elephants to Toungoo.|$|E

25|$|CaixaForum Madrid is a post-modern {{art gallery}} in {{the centre of}} Madrid. It is {{sponsored}} by the Catalan-Balearic bank La Caixa and located next to the Salón del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most-visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, who took an unused industrial building and hollowed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the base and inside and then added additional floors encased with rusted steel. Next to the gallery is an art installation by French botanist Patrick Blanc of green plants growing {{on the wall of the}} neighbouring house. The red of the top floors with the green of the wall next to it form a contrast. The green is in reflection of the neighbouring Royal Botanical Garden.|$|E
25|$|Empress Matilda and {{her party}} took refuge at Arundel Castle {{where they were}} welcomed by King Henry's widow Adeliza and her new husband William d'Aubigny. Robert of Gloucester rode to Bristol to rally support for the empress. Stephen quickly {{assembled}} an army and surrounded Arundel Castle, demanding that the empress be handed over to him. Though her garrison was weak, Adeliza sent word that she would fight <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> this point Stephen committed an astonishing blunder by giving Empress Matilda a safe-conduct pass to Bristol and withdrawing his army. When his enemy reached safety, the civil war broke out in full fury. While London and the east remained loyal to Stephen, the west declared for the empress. Stephen hired a body of Flemish mercenaries under William of Ypres, antagonizing his English subjects. The system of justice established under Henry I went to pieces and the common people suffered under the harsh demands of local noblemen and officials.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, {{the plans}} of Wagenknecht, Reed & Co. to fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the 1919 Emergency National Convention {{continued}} apace. With {{the most radical}} state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan), and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including John Reed and his sidekick Benjamin Gitlow, {{made an effort to}} occupy chairs on the convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called the already present police to their aid, and the officers of the law obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the Credentials Committee firmly {{in the hands of the}} Regulars from the outset, the outcome of the gathering was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers downstairs in a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering which established itself as the Communist Labor Party on August 31, 1919.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, Fazekas recalled the potential story revolving around Carter having a girls night out, saying that they realized that [...] "once Peggy is on the mission, it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life...we kept sort of punting that scene because every time we tried to do it, it was like, 'She's not going to stop to go out to dinner. She has the world to save.'" [...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret. Angie sort of figures <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the first}} season but Ana and Rose—there is no need to hide the truth from them. So it makes it a lot easier for her to confide in them." ...|$|E
500|$|The film drew {{a number}} of {{negative}} reactions from the film critics. Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express, saying [...] "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the [...] "equivalent of getting a root canal". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his [...] "in-your-face flamboyance", Khan for playing an [...] "urban rich kid slumming <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> a dress-up party" [...] and both for [...] "rat-a-tat punch lines", but praised Sonali Bendre's cameo as Mumtaz. Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the [...] "lacklustre chemistry", remarking that the film [...] "lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel".|$|E
500|$|The ATV News Network {{said the}} Chris's coming out should be praised {{for the way}} it has been handled. They added that the {{decision}} to play <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> a school would have viewers in a similar situation identifying with the storyline. Alan McKee, a university film and television professor, said that usually subscription television channels take risks in portraying storylines like Chris's. He added [...] "Commercial TV is not about risk taking, it is about entertainment for the broadest possible audience. But attitudes have changed and commercial networks like to reflect that". Holy Soap said Chris's most memorable moment was [...] "Announcing to his entire class that he was gay." [...] Anthony D. Langford from website, AfterElton said he found it [...] "humorous" [...] that Neighbours emphasizes what a gentleman Chris is compared to Andrew. He said [...] "It's like they're almost saying if you're a nice guy who's not all over your girlfriend you must be gay. But on television that's usually the case". Langford hoped that Chris would not vanish and {{that he would not be}} relegated to monitoring the relationship between Andrew and Summer and not having a romance of his own.|$|E

2500|$|Colonel Clyde Russell (SOG's first commander) had {{difficulty}} in creating an organization {{with which to}} fulfill his mission since, at the time, United States Special Forces were unprepared either doctrinally or organizationally to carry <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> this point {{the mission of the}} Special Forces was the conduct of guerrilla operations behind enemy lines {{in the event of an}} invasion by conventional forces, not in the conduct of agent, maritime, or psychological operations.

His expectations and assumptions were incorrect. The contribution of the South Vietnamese came in the form of SOG's counterpart organization (which used a plethora of titles, finally ending with the Strategic Technical Directorate [...] ).|$|E
