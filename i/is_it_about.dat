500|$|Although {{he never}} {{formally}} studied music, Caymmi taught himself to play guitar {{in the late}} 1920s and began to compose, sing, and play his own songs on Bahian radio programs around 1930. He first achieved widespread recognition in 1933, when at age 16, he composed the song [...] "O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?" [...] ("What <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>About</b> Bahian Women?") for singer Carmen Miranda. In 1936, at age 22, he won a songwriting contest at Salvador's annual Carnaval celebration. His prize was a pink satin lampshade. Despite his early musical success, he moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1938 with intentions to pursue a law degree and to return to working as a journalist. While employed there by the newspaper Diários Associados, he spent his spare time composing and singing songs on the radio show Dragão da Rua Larga. His popularity began to grow with the show's audience.|$|E

In July 2015, she was revealed to be physically appearing in the second season, and Verbeek was cast in the role by October 2015. Verbeek was in Europe when she auditioned for and got the part, and Agent Carter had not yet begun airing there, so Verbeek [...] "didn't really know anything. I just talked to the showrunners, what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about,</b> what is the character about." [...] Verbeek wanted to play more than just [...] "the wife of", and noted that her take on the character is [...] "somewhat unexpected with Jarvis being who he is ... Ana just brings a whole different dimension to him." [...] Verbeek, who is Dutch, has [...] "spent {{a lot of time}} in Budapest", which helped with the character's Hungarian accent.|$|E

[...] Of her [...] "Rose's Turn", Gans wrote: [...] "...her rendition of this song may be the highlight of a career already filled with many highlights: She has taken a song that has been delivered incredibly by others and brought it to a new level." [...] Of her performance on the recording of Follies (2011), Steven Suskin wrote in Playbill.com: [...] "This is a fine Sally, the sort of Sally you'd expect to get from an actress like – well, Bernadette Peters. The performance on the CD is compelling; either this is simply the magic of the recording studio or Peters has changed what she does and how she does it." ...|$|E

Donoghue writes in Language Arts: Integrating Skills for Classroom Teaching that the story should be utilised {{in the course of}} primary education. In their work Success in Reading and Writing, authors Barbara J. Blackford, Helen Cappleman and Betty Cramer suggest the book be read aloud to children in kindergarten, and the teacher should subsequently quiz members of the class {{to see if they can}} recall items from the boy's shopping list. Authors Diane Stirling, Linda McKay, Georgia Archibald and Shelley Berg recommend the story in their book Character Education Connections: For School, Home and Community, in order to teach children the character trait of responsibility: [...] "A willingness to be accountable for your own actions without blaming others." ...|$|E

Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it shallow, effective club fodder, describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title".

500|$|Fearing that {{introducing}} the character as an [...] " [...] to the boys" [...] would hinder {{their chances of}} successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be [...] "a character in [...] own right" [...] and deemed her an antagonist [...] "with [...] own interests and [...] own motives" [...] rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, [...] "If the chemistry is there, {{and we see the}} sparks, and we want it to happen, and the fans want it to happen, it'll happen." [...] Due to [...] "protective and occasionally nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in [...] "small doses".

Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media.

500|$|... "O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?" [...] gained {{even more}} fame in Brazil when Miranda {{performed}} {{it in the}} 1939 film Banana da Terra, {{and it was this}} song that garnered her international attention and helped launch her career. After this success, Caymmi began to focus more on making music, and he wrote songs that appeared in other Brazilian films. In late 1939, he signed with Odeon Records and recorded his first three singles, [...] "Rainha do Mar/Promessa de Pescador" [...] ("Queen of the Sea/Promise of the Fisherman"), [...] "Roda Pião" [...] ("Top Wheel"), and [...] "O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?/A Preta do Acarajé" [...] ("What <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>About</b> Bahian Women?/The Dark Woman from Acarajé")."] (in Portuguese). Dicionário Cravo Albin da Música Popular Brasileira. Instituto Cultural Cravo Albin. Retrieved August 17, 2011. He came to more attention in the early 1940s when he performed as a regular on the Brazilian radio network Rádio Nacional. He recorded [...] "Samba da Minha Terra" [...] ("Samba of My Homeland") in 1940 and [...] "A Jangada Voltou Só" [...] ("The Raft Returned Alone") in the following year. In 1944, he performed his own [...] "Acontece Que Eu Sou Baiano" [...] ("It Just So Happens That I'm Bahian") in the movie Abacaxi Azul (Blue Pineapple). In the late 1940s, {{he was a member of}} the samba-canção movement largely founded by his sometime creative rival, composer Ary Barroso. Other prominent Brazilian musicians of the day covered several of his songs, including Dick Farney, who famously recorded Caymmi's [...] "Marina" [...] (1944) in 1947. In 1957 Caymmi wrote [...] "Suíte do Pescador", which appeared in the film The Sandpit Generals.|$|E

500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> {{the four of them}} cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode this year because it really kind of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E
