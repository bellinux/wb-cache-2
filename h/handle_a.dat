One of 13 children, Hensley lived in Tennessee in Hawkins County and Loudon County in the 1880s.

5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E
5|$|Route 37 was {{proposed}} in the late 1960s as a freeway that was to run from Route 29 in the Trenton area to Seaside Heights. It was suggested that this freeway be completed by 1975 in order to <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> rapid growth of population in Central New Jersey. In 1967, this proposal was altered to build a road that compromised with the proposed Route 38 freeway between Camden and Wall Township. It soon received federal funding and was built as Interstate 195, running from Trenton to Wall Township.|$|E
5|$|Shadow of Mordor was Monolith's first third-person open world {{video game}} for the eighth {{generation}} consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and de Plater considered its development an educational experience for the studio. In Monolith's introduction to the genre, many core mechanics were built from scratch and the studio were inspired by successful video games such as the Batman: Arkham series created by Rocksteady Studios; those games inspired Shadow of Mordor stealth and free-flow combat mechanics. The studio considered Rocksteady's games good examples of how to <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> licensed title.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E

The Italians promised to provide all necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they could <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> vessel as large as the Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, {{and as a result of}} limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette {{continued}} to work for order in the coming months. On 28 February 1791, Lafayette {{and part of the}} National Guard left the Tuileries to <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> conflict in Vincennes. While he was gone, hundred of armed nobles arrived at the Tuileries to defend the king; however, there were rumors that these nobles had come to take the king away and place him {{at the head of a}} counter-revolution. Lafayette quickly returned to the Tuileries and disarmed the nobles after a brief standoff. The event, later called the Day of Daggers, boosted Lafayette's popularity with the French people for his quick actions to protect the king.|$|E
5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E

In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret.

5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> large {{number of cases of}} a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts {{in some parts of the}} world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high courts in collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average pendency of a case in High courts in India is 3 years.|$|E
