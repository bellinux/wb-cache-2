50|$|The Skink’s four 20 mm guns could fire 650 rounds {{per minute}} per gun. A {{modified}} Oilgear hydraulic traverse with two pumps could rotate the turret at up to 65 <b>degress</b> per second and - crucially for a quick response- - accelerate from rest to 60 degrees in 2 seconds. The guns’ elevation was also hydraulically assisted so the guns could move at up to 45 <b>degress</b> per second in an arc from -5 to +80. The gunner controlled both elevation and rotation with a joystick, and used a Mk.IX reflector sight. Initially it had been planned to build 300 Skink turrets for the Canadian and British armies.
