5|$|The {{difference}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids may {{be explained}} by the difference in their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E

If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E

According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries. The rest of the challenges were held in public libraries or the location of the challenges were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District to ban the books was broadcast by C-SPAN. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing,</b> most of the parents and children felt the books should not be banned, and the school district's book review committee decided to keep the books.|$|E

The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), {{appears to be}} both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E

The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition from conservative activists based on Berry's homosexuality. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of how hearing loss influences speech perception, the influence of phonetic context on vowel identification was tested under simulated hearing loss conditions. Participants (n= 17) were presented vowels along the /ε/ - /∧/ acoustic continuum in /bVb/ and /dVd/ contexts and instructed to indicate which vowel they heard in normal hearing, and mild and severe simulated hearing loss conditions. It was hypothesized that a phonetic context effect would be observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>hearing</b> condition, diminish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mild <b>hearing</b> loss condition, and disappear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe <b>hearing</b> loss conditions. <b>The</b> percent of /ʌ/ responses were calculated and the categorical boundary was estimated for each context and compared for differences within and across conditions. Contrary to expectations, no context effect was found for <b>the</b> normal <b>hearing</b> and mild hearing loss conditions. However, an unexpected phonetic context effect was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe <b>hearing</b> loss condition. These results were difficult to interpret given the lack of a significant context effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>hearing</b> condition and suggested possible interference introduced by test or stimulus procedures. It should be noted, however, that 9 of the 17 participants did demonstrated <b>the</b> effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>hearing</b> condition, with many maintaining the effect across both hearing loss conditions...|$|R
