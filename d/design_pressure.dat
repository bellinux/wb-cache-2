However, the VVER-440-type has a {{significant}} more vulnerable containment, in form of a so-called bubble condensor with relatively low <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Stirling engine uses a {{single-phase}} {{working fluid}} that maintains an internal pressure {{close to the}} <b>design</b> <b>pressure,</b> and thus for a properly designed system the risk of explosion is low. In comparison, a steam engine uses a two-phase gas/liquid working fluid, so a faulty overpressure relief valve can cause an explosion.|$|E
25|$|Closing the {{variable}} stators progressively, as compressor speed falls, reduces {{the slope of}} the surge (or stall) line on the operating characteristic (or map), improving the surge margin of the installed unit. By incorporating variable stators in the first five stages, General Electric Aircraft Engines has developed a ten-stage axial compressor capable of operating at a 23:1 <b>design</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio.|$|E

40|$|The spray {{penetration}} is {{of prime}} importance for combustion chamber design. Over {{penetration of the}} spray leads to impingement of the fuel on the combustion chamber wall and if the walls are cold it causes the fuel wastage. Optimum engine performance is obtained when the spray penetration is matched to the size and geometry of the combustion chamber and methods for calculating penetration. The present work describes the <b>design</b> of <b>pressure</b> swirl nozzle for half spray cone angle of 30 ° and outline detail of experimental setup, to investigate effect of pressure on penetration length and spray cone angle. <b>Designed</b> <b>pressure</b> swirl nozzle experimentally investigated at different pressures ranging from 3 bar to 18 bars in the step of 3 bars. In gas turbine combustor, spray angle has strong influence on ignition performance, flame blowout limits and pollutants, emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and smoke. The results for penetration length and spray cone angle suggest that at <b>designed</b> <b>pressure,</b> pressure swirl nozzle gives best performance...|$|R

25|$|In wind engineering, {{wind tunnel}} tests {{are used to}} measure the {{velocity}} around, and forces or pressures upon structures. Very tall buildings, buildings with unusual or complicated shapes (such as a tall building with a parabolic or a hyperbolic shape), cable suspension bridges or cable stayed bridges are analyzed in specialized atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels. These feature a long upwind section to accurately represent the wind speed and turbulence profile acting on the structure. Wind tunnel tests provide the necessary <b>design</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements in use of the dynamic analysis and control of tall buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrays of}} {{airfoils}} {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 <b>design</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E

2500|$|There {{is simply}} no [...] "perfect" [...] {{compressor}} for this wide range of operating conditions. Fixed geometry compressors, like those used on early jet engines, are limited to a <b>design</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio of about 4 or 5:1. As with any heat engine, fuel efficiency is strongly related to the compression ratio, so there is very strong financial need to improve the compressor stages beyond these sorts of ratios.|$|E
50|$|Maximum {{allowable}} {{operating pressure}} or MAOP {{refers to the}} wall strength of a pressurized cylinder such as a pipeline or storage tank and how much pressure the walls may safely hold in normal operation. The MAOP {{is less than the}} MAWP (maximum allowable working pressure). MAWP being the maximum pressure based on the design codes that the weakest component of a pressure vessel can handle. Commonly standard wall thickness components are used in fabricating pressurized equipment, and hence are able to withstand pressures above their <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>Design</b> <b>pressure</b> is the maximum pressure a pressurized item can be exposed to. Due to the availability of standard wall thickness materials, many components will have a MAWP higher than the required <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b> Relief valves are set at the <b>design</b> <b>pressure</b> of the pressurized item and sized to prevent the item under pressure from being over-pressurized. Depending on the design code that the pressurized item is designed, an over-pressure allowance can be used when sizing the relief valve. This is +10% for PD 5500, and ASME Section VIII div 1 & 2 (with an additional +10% allowance in ASME Section VIII for a fire relief case). ASME have different criteria for steam boilers.|$|E

50|$|The ASME code requires, in {{addition}} to very conservative design of the vessel and its fittings, the installation of a code-stamped safety valve set at the <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b> This valve is safety-wired to prevent changes in its setting and will pop open whenever the pressure in the autoclave exceeds the <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b> While this triggering of the valve will relieve any possible overpressure in the vessel, {{it must also be}} able to keep the pressure source, whatever it is, from pushing enough air, inert gas, or steam in to bring the pressure back up to an unsafe level even with the safety valve wide open.|$|E

50|$|Hydrotesting of pipes, {{pipelines}} and vessels {{is performed}} to expose defective materials that have missed prior detection, ensure that any remaining defects are insignificant {{enough to allow}} operation at <b>design</b> <b>pressures,</b> expose possible leaks {{and serve as a}} final validation of the integrity of the constructed system. ASME B31.3 requires this testing to ensure tightness and strength.|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is presented of a technique for the optimization of airfoil pressure distributions using an interactive inverse boundary-layer program. This program allows {{the user to}} determine quickly a near-optimum subsonic pressure distribution which meets his requirements for lift, drag, and pitching moment at the desired flow conditions. The method employs an inverse turbulent boundary-layer scheme for definition of the turbulent recovery portion of the pressure distribution. Two levels of pressure-distribution architecture are used - a simple roof top for preliminary studies and a more complex four-region architecture for a more refined design. A technique is employed to avoid the specification of pressure distributions which result in unrealistic airfoils, that is, those with negative thickness. The program allows rapid evaluation of a <b>designed</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution off-design in Reynolds number, transition location, and angle of attack, and will compute an airfoil contour for the <b>designed</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution using linear theory...|$|R

50|$|The nozzle {{operates}} in two distinct modes: open and closed. In closed wake mode, the exhaust gas fills the entire nozzle exit area. The ambient pressure {{at which the}} wake changes from open to closed modes is called the <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b> If the ambient pressure reduces any further, additional expansion will occur outside the nozzle much like a standard bell nozzle and no altitude compensation effect will be gained. In open wake mode, the exit area {{is dependent on the}} ambient pressure and the exhaust gas exits the nozzle as an annulus as it does not fill the entire nozzle. Because the ambient pressure controls the exit area, the area ratio should be perfectly compensating to the altitude up to the <b>design</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} focused on {{calibration}} of fatigue <b>design</b> wind <b>pressure</b> for sign, luminaire and traffic signal support under natural and truck-induced wind gusts. The design of the support structures in Canada is governed by the current Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). However, the code is not specific on the fatigue <b>design</b> wind <b>pressure</b> (natural or truck-induced) for these structures. Although there are equivalent static natural and truck-induced wind <b>pressures</b> for fatigue <b>design</b> recommended in {{the provisions of the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), none of relevant studies discussed the implied reliability by using these <b>design</b> <b>pressures</b> based on Canadian practice. Code calibration analyses of the sign, luminaire and traffic signal support under natural and truck-induced wind gusts were carried out in the study. For the calibration, the support structures were approximated by a linear elastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, structural response with selected natural frequencies, damping ratios under natural and truck-induced wind gusts was estimated. A target reliability index of 4. 25 for a service period of 75 years was adopted for the calibration. The calibration results were used to recommend fatigue <b>design</b> wind <b>pressure</b> for sign, luminaire and traffic signal support under both natural and truck-induced wind gusts. The recommended values could be directly adopted by the CHBDC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} known for some time that many {{proteins}} are marginally stable. This has inspired several explanations. Having noted that the functionality of many enzymes is correlated with subunit motion, fl exibility, or general disorder, some have suggested that marginally stable proteins should have an evolutionary advantage over proteins of differing stability. Others have suggested that stability and functionality are contradictory qualities, and that selection for both criteria results in marginally stable proteins, optimised to satisfy the competing <b>design</b> <b>pressures.</b> While these explanations are plausible, recent research simulating the evolution of model proteins has shown that selection for stability, ignoring any aspects of functionality, can result in marginally stable proteins because of the underlying makeup of protein sequence-space. We extend this research by simulating the evolution of proteins, using a computational protein model that equates functionality with binding and catalysis. In the model, marginal stability is not required for ligand-binding functionality and we observe no competing <b>design</b> <b>pressures.</b> The resulting proteins are marginally stable, again demonstrating that neutral evolution is suffi cient for explaining marginal stability in observed proteins...|$|R
