6000|$|... "Major Fitz-David {{brings you}} some news, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "Your mother-in-law, Mrs. Macallan, is coming <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|KNOX. I say, old man, I don't want to dash your fond hopes, but {{in point}} of fact we didn't come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{out of the}} house," [...] Macheson answered, {{with one}} breathless glance around the room. [...] "Will you come quietly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mother, I know him. Captain Bayley has {{had some}} {{business}} with him, and asked me <b>to</b> come down <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>You</b> are <b>to</b> sit down until he comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] said Syme serenely, [...] "the {{truth is}} I am a Sabbatarian. I have been {{specially}} sent <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> show a due observance of Sunday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{decline to}} apologise," [...] Kendrick said. [...] "The fact of it is, we're here for your good, Wingate. We are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> do not die of ennui and {{loneliness}} in this stony-hearted city." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had a {{pleasant}} fortnight's yachting," [...] he answered. [...] "Then I went with Hennibul to Wiesbaden, and I came on <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "He will be {{back this}} evening," [...] Edie went on apologetically, {{answering}} aloud his unspoken thought. [...] "I--I'm sorry he isn't <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Evan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we didn't come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> Rovers," [...] {{broke in}} Asa Lemm stiffly. [...] "Not but what I have an account to settle with you," [...] he {{continued}} significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Jenny,' exclaimed Miss Adeline, {{as the two}} {{entered the}} drawing- room. 'You have had such a loss; Rotherwood has been <b>here</b> waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> for an hour, and such an {{agreeable}} man he brought with him!' ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK [turning in {{his chair}} from his writing, but not rising] <b>Here,</b> and charmed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> You come like a breath of spring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know all}} about spoons, for I {{used to be in}} the plating business. I only asked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> would say. That man next door tried to sell my friend some single plated ones for triple plated. I brought him in <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> had <b>to</b> say about your stock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] {{said his}} wife sharply. [...] "Suppose you take it yourself, I should have to be <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> were looked after. I’m sure Mrs. Fillson isn’t going home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' he said. 'I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{win this}} {{championship}} and I won't have you taking any risks. Besides, {{even if it}} was important, a few minutes won't make any difference.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a gentleman}} <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{who says that}} he made an {{appointment}} by telephone, sir," [...] he announced. [...] "His name is Sidney--the Reverend Horatio Sidney, he calls himself." ...|$|E
60|$|DORA. Tell {{him that}} I {{and the lady}} <b>here</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> she is lamed, and cannot go down to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have brought}} us our lives, Carsluith, but God knows I {{would rather have}} stayed on <b>here</b> forever than <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> come like this," [...] said Dane.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the very}} thing I have in mind," [...] chuckled Tommy. [...] "I've come over <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>you</b> won't come along with me. I've been up to his house so often that he won't think half {{so much of a}} visit from me as he will from you. Will you do it?" ...|$|R
60|$|ALEX. I have no mother now but Russia, {{my life is}} hers to take or give away; but to-night I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> They tell me you {{are leaving}} for Novgorod to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|Acton smiled dryly. [...] "Any way," [...] he said, [...] "they're as {{straight}} as most. It's not a business that's conducive to unswerving rectitude. Hutton has come up <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> about the thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{inspector}} is <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> sir," [...] he announced. [...] "He did mention {{something about}} the lights. I'm sure we've all been most careful. Even her ladyship has only used a candle in her bedroom." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this moment, a groom of the {{chambers}} advanced and drew Egremont aside, {{saying in a}} low tone, [...] "Your servant, Mr Egremont, is <b>here</b> and wishes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> instantly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's bad. That'll worry me. But, Lassiter, now you're <b>here</b> I'm glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> And--and my {{companion}} {{here is not}} a young fellow!... Bess, this {{is a friend of}} mine. He saved my life once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{know that}} I've done right, sir," [...] she remarked, doubtfully. [...] "There {{was a young}} person <b>here,</b> waiting about <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> been waiting {{the best part of}} an hour. I let her into your sitting-room." ...|$|R
60|$|HILLMAN. It's this way, doctor. We notice Mr. Pindar comin' in <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{every day}} or so,--like {{the rest of}} Foxon Falls. And we thought you could make him see this thing straight, if any man could.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will set}} him above their mercies very soon. I left him {{climbing}} to the window, and I came to tell you. There {{is no one}} <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>You</b> may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, many, many spirits. My grandpa is here; he is {{treating}} my mamma so {{that she}} will not be sick. Some one is <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> but is too weak to speak. My grandpa says 'we are trusting you.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] he said, [...] "but {{there is a}} young man <b>here</b> who wants <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> at once. He would not give his name, but he says that his {{business}} is urgent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She's {{a friend}} of Cynthia's. Cynthia asked me <b>to</b> come down <b>here</b> with her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> I came, <b>to</b> oblige her. And now, without a word of apology, she leaves me stranded. She has no manners whatever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, from my sister. But I {{was very}} unwilling to mention it, because she {{particularly}} requests {{that her name}} may not be used. I came <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether <b>you</b> had heard of Guy lately, so as to judge whether it was needful to speak of it. This convinces me; but I must beg, in the first instance, {{that you will not}} mention her, not even to my aunt.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't, then," [...] {{she said}} contemptuously. [...] "You know I {{never had much}} use for Cromwell Biron. I {{think he had a}} face of his own to come down <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> uninvited, after the way he treated you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} come down <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> unless I hear good {{accounts}} of your conduct," [...] she said, with {{an attempt to}} speak playfully. [...] "Well, good-bye, Cuthbert. I hope you will not try to do too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{told you}} about seeing Paris may be called polite fiction," [...] he said. [...] "I came over <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> I have been afraid to say it until to-day, and I am afraid to say it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're <b>here</b> <b>to</b> interfere, <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> Now <b>you</b> vote right, do you hear?--or else there'll be a double-barreled inquest {{here when}} this trial's off, and your {{remainders}} will go {{home in a}} couple of baskets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah, Brill! Come down <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us defeat <b>you,</b> eh?" [...] And a merry looking student, {{wearing the}} colors of Roxley on his cap, and waving a Roxley banner in his hand, grinned broadly at Tom and the others.|$|R
6000|$|... "I slipped in. Nobody knows I am <b>here.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> I came <b>to</b> {{tell you}} I {{have been very}} foolish. I came because I could no longer stay away, because my heart {{compelled}} me to come, because--because I wanted to come." ...|$|R
