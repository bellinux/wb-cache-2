She encouraged chefs to remove the item from their menu and urged consumers to boycott it. In 2015, Winslet lent her support to the UNICEF campaign World’s Largest Lesson, which creates awareness among children about sustainable development and global citizenship. Teased as a child for her weight, Winslet takes a stand against body-shaming and bullying. She narrated an Australian animated short film named <b>Daisy</b> <b>Chain</b> (2015), about a victim of cyber-bullying. In 2017, Winslet teamed with Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental foundation for a fundraiser on global warming. Also that year, DiCaprio and Winslet auctioned off a private dinner with themselves to raise money for a British mother's cancer treatment.|$|E

25|$|Believed to {{have been}} built around 1905, the wall {{was part of the}} {{original}} gardens of Wardown House before it was made into a public park. The condition of the <b>Daisy</b> <b>Chain</b> Wall had deteriorated over the years until many of its features were damaged and destroyed, however with extensive re-construction the wall now appears as it did one hundred years ago. The wall separates the main park from the pleasure garden, which was formerly an ornamental garden containing trees such as giant redwoods and an avenue of limes.|$|E

40|$|A paper {{describes}} advanced ceramic column {{grid array}} (CCGA) packaging interconnects technology test objects that {{were subjected to}} extreme temperature thermal cycles. CCGA interconnect electronic package printed wiring boards (PWBs) of polyimide were assembled, inspected nondestructively, and, subsequently, subjected to ex - treme-temperature thermal cycling to assess reliability for future deep-space, short- and long-term, extreme-temperature missions. The test hardware consisted of two CCGA 717 packages with each package divided into four daisy-chained sections, {{for a total of}} eight <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> to be monitored. The package is 33 33 mm with a 27 27 array of 80 %/ 20 % Pb/Sn columns on a 1. 27 -mm pitch. The change in resistance of the daisy-chained CCGA interconnects was measured {{as a function of the}} increasing number of thermal cycles. Several catastrophic failures were observed after 137 extreme-temperature thermal cycles, as per electrical resistance measurements, and then the tests were continued through 1, 058 thermal cycles to corroborate and understand the test results. X-ray and optical inspection have been made after thermal cycling. Optical inspections were also conducted on the CCGA vs. thermal cycles. The optical inspections were conclusive; the x-ray images were not. Process qualification and assembly is required to optimize the CCGA assembly, which is very clear from the x-rays. Six <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> were open out of seven <b>daisy</b> <b>chains,</b> as per experimental test data reported. The <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> are open during the cold cycle, and then recover during the hot cycle, though some of them also opened during the hot thermal cycle. ...|$|R
25|$|Some {{products}} that implement SPI may be connected in a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> configuration, the first slave output being {{connected to the}} second slave input, etc. The SPI port of each slave is designed to send out during the second group of clock pulses an exact copy of the data it received during {{the first group of}} clock pulses. The whole chain acts as a communication shift register; daisy chaining is often done with shift registers to provide a bank of inputs or outputs through SPI. Such a feature only requires a single SS line from the master, rather than a separate SS line for each slave.|$|E

The council and the Friends of Wardown Park, have replaced the old refreshment kiosk with a building mirroring the design of the boathouse. Across the lake from the kiosk is the original boathouse which also underwent restoration {{with the rest of the}} buildings of the park. At the same time the Edwardian <b>Daisy</b> <b>Chain</b> wall and drinking fountain were restored using the original designs and old photographs. The drinking fountain is an exact replica of the original based on a photograph from 1907 on display in the museum, however it is a non-working replica.|$|E

In the film, she portrayed Hazel, {{one of the women}} in the life of a theatre director (Hoffman) whose extreme commitment to a realistic stage production begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality. As her character ages from 30 to 64 over the course of the story, Morton used full-face prosthetic makeup. She discovered that she was pregnant during the filming, which had a schedule that took up to 20 hour a day. The film was a box office bomb, but garnered praise from critics, appearing on many top ten lists of the year. Morton and her co-stars were eventually nominated for the Best Emsemble Performance award at the 18th Gotham Independent Film Awards. Also in 2008, she starred in The <b>Daisy</b> <b>Chain,</b> an Irish horror film about a couple who after the death of their daughter, take in an orphaned girl, only to become involved in a series of strange occurrences. It premiered at the 16th Raindance Film Festival (London; October 2008), and went straight-to-video in the US in 2010.|$|E

40|$|This {{tutorial}} review {{summarizes the}} progress made towards mechanically interlocked <b>daisy</b> <b>chains.</b> Such materials {{can be seen}} as a further development in polymer science, where the conventional covalent interlinking bonds are replaced by supramolecular binding concepts. Materials in which the mechanical bond is an integral part of the polymeric backbone are expected to possess unique macroscopic properties and are therefore the synthetic aim in an ever growing research community. After introducing general considerations about <b>daisy</b> <b>chains,</b> the most common analytic methods to get insight into the aggregation behaviour of such self-complementary monomers are presented. Cyclodextrins/aromatic rods, crown ethers/cationic rods and pillararenes/alkyl chains are systems used to achieve daisy chain-like molecular arrays. By comparison of the reported systems, conclusions about an improved structural design are drawn...|$|R
