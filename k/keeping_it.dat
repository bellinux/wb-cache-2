5|$|In February 1864, {{her family}} sent {{her and her}} brother to Melbourne {{to live with her}} sister, with the {{intention}} of helping to improve Baeyertz's health. By the time that the siblings arrived by ship in Melbourne, Baeyertz had already recovered and she quickly integrated herself into the Australian social life. She soon met Charles Baeyertz, a bank manager at the Richmond branch of National Bank of Australasia and a practising Anglican. The couple started a relationship, <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> secret from both their families.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica, Governor Weatherby Swann, his {{daughter}} Elizabeth, and Lieutenant James Norrington encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner.

Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy it receives from its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2.|$|E
5|$|The First Triumvirate did {{not approve}} {{the use of the}} flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was {{initially}} unaware of that. He had the flag blessed by the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta, on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. When he found out the flag was not approved, he put it away. When asked, he would say that he was <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> for a great victory.|$|E
5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E

It was a 1360 kg satellite with 2200W of power (1300W available for the payload) on an unpressurized bus.

5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{several groups}} were {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} relocate the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New Orleans, Louisiana. The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis had lost its National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with the mortgage on the Target Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge would cost about $6.16 million, while <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was not convinced that it would be sufficient.|$|E

Jean-Ralphio encourages Tom to come work with him on the company, but Tom is reluctant to leave his city hall job. Meanwhile, the extremely health-conscious Chris (Rob Lowe) finds out he has tendonitis, and takes the news so seriously that he questions his own mortality. Leslie and Ben (Adam Scott) continue their romance despite a no-dating policy at city hall, but they have difficulty <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> a secret.

5|$|Reflector sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but {{the south end of}} the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor <b>keeping</b> <b>it</b> flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.|$|E

Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E

Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS.
