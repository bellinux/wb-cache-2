40|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>cell</b> {{count is}} a key method used to {{evaluate}} the quality of milk in today’s growing dairy sheep industry. <b>Somatic</b> <b>cells</b> are body cells, primarily the white blood cells, found in a milk sample. If an infection such as mastitis is present, the number of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the milk increases (Gonzalo, et al. 1992). Producers routinely perform <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts on cow and goat milk. For dairy cattle in the United States, the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count can not exceed 750, 000 cells per milliliter, for commercial milk. For dairy goats the accepted limit is 1, 000, 000 cells per mL of milk. <b>Somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count procedures on sheep milk however, have not been widely tested and limits are highly debatable, ranging from 250, 000 cells per mL to 1, 000, 000 per mL (Pengov 2001). This project will focus on obtaining valuable information about <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts in lactating ewes. There are several methods for determining <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count. Currently sheep milk is evaluated by cow milk standards using the methylene blue stain. However, cows and sheep have different secretory systems. Sheep shed more cellular debris in their milk than cows do, and the blue stain can sometimes falsely mark these <b>cell</b> particles as <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> (Gonzalo et al 2003). Goats have the same secretory system as sheep, and the stain {{used to evaluate the}}ir milk’s <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count is better at differentiating between cells and cellular debris. The green stain is the only officially acceptable method to directly measure <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count in goat milk (Haenlein 1997). This points to the conclusion that comparisons using dyes with higher tint specificity, such as pyronin Y-methyl green, would be of great use in sheep milk (Gonzalo et al. 2003). For this project milk samples were collected from lactating ewes at the University of Rhode Island’s Peckham farm. Several samples were taken from each ewe and collected in a plastic tube. The milk was then refrigerated and later pipetted in small aliquots onto slides. The slides were then dried and stained with either methylene blue or pyronin Y-methyl green stain. Once the slides were stained, they were examined under the oil immersion objective lens of the microscope and a direct microscopic <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count was taken. Our preliminary results have shown that milk stained with pyronin Y-methyl green has a lower <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count than the same sample stained with methylene blue. This indicates that the blue stain does not only stain <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> but extracellular components as well, making it less suitable for use in sheep milk. For this reason, we recommend that the green stain be used for <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count in sheep rather than the blue stain...|$|R

However, reprogramming induced by fusion with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and by exposure to pluripotent cell extracts has not been well studied, especially in human cells. Data presented in this thesis first optimized hESC-somatic cell fusion condition by applying three conventional fusion methods and the results provide direct evidence that hESCs have the ability to reprogram human <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> Using a combination of immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, I also demonstrated that hESC extracts can reprogram human <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> towards pluripotency. Reprogramming was confirmed by morphological changes and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis on pluripotency related genes. When <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> were pre-treated with DNMT and HDAC inhibitors before exposing to hESC extracts, changes in global epigenetic states were observed and morphological analysis revealed a higher rate of hESC-like colony formation than without pre-treatment. qPCR demonstrated that pluripotency genes were upregulated to higher levels as compared to those of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> treated with hESC extracts alone. Thus, pre-modifying the epigenetics of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> could be used to improve the efficiency of reprogramming process.

Also, the mastitic milk is not proper for human consumption due to its contribution to spreading of certain diseases and food poisoning. According to these effects, EU Regulations established the maximum threshold of admitted <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in raw milk to 400000 cells / mL starting with 2014. The {{purpose of this study}} was carried out in order to examine the raw milk samples provided from small farms, industrial type farms and milk processing units. There are several ways to count <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in milk but the reference accepted method is the microscopic method described by the SR EN ISO 13366 - 1 / 2008. Generally samples registered values in accordance with the admissible limit. By periodical monitoring of the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count, certain technological process issues are being avoided and consumer’s health ensured. </p...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> that support regulation of SSCs are Sertoli <b>cells</b> Various other <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the interstitial tissue support Sertoli cells such as Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells therefore indirectly influencing SSCs {{and the location}} of their niche.|$|R
50|$|The {{methods of}} {{determining}} Grade A milk quality are well established, and {{are based on}} the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count and the bacteria plate count. Generally a lower <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count indicates better animal health, while the bacteria plate count indicates improved equipment sanitation.|$|R
50|$|As {{multicellularity}} evolved many times, sterile <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> did too. The {{evolution of}} an immortal germline producing specialized <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> involved {{the emergence of}} mortality, and can be viewed in its simplest version in volvocine algae. Those species with a separation between sterile <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> and a germ line are called Weismannists. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., vertebrates, arthropods, Volvox), as {{a great number of}} species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g., land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).|$|R
40|$|The <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count (SCC) is {{commonly}} used {{as a measure of}} udder health and milk quality. Thus, to determine the milk quality standards in many countries, it legally determined as an indicator of <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count raw milk and determines the level of payments to milk producers. The present study investigated that the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count is an indicator of udder health status, diagnosis of subclinical mastitis, health and quality of milk and milk products, its importance and effect factors on it...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (<b>Somatic</b> <b>Cell</b> Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell,</b> referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell's</b> nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|R
