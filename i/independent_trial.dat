5000|$|Following the {{realisation}} that a {{new material}} was needed, Brain looked {{at a number of}} options; polyvinyl chloride was too rigid and synthetic foam did not lend itself to re-use. Silicone prototypes looked promising as what was produced was an ellipse with a flat central web which, if cut correctly, could be used to create an aperture bar to prevent the epiglottis falling into the distal aperture. The silicone prototype was also smooth and deflated into a wafer thin ellipse, however, the silicone mask was unable to retain the desired bowl shape and it was no longer possible to make rapid adjustments to the design. The silicone Dunlop prototype was superior to the Goldman prototype, one of Brains first prototypes created from the cuff of a latex Goldman dental mask, however Brain needed a material that would give him design flexibility before the next set of silicone moulds were cast. In 1986, Brain continued to make prototypes from latex with a range of modifications; the inclusion of an inflation line, a thin-walled elliptical ring in the cuff which resulted in equal expansion of the cuff, the creation of a larger size to increase the reliability of cuff seal pressure and a moulded back plate for the cuff. By December 1986, Brain was ready to conduct the first wholly <b>independent</b> <b>trial</b> and chose Dr John Nunn to be the recipient of the silicone prototypes to conduct the trial.

40|$|Background: Multisystemic Therapy (MST) is an intensive, home-based {{intervention}} for families of youth with social, emotional, and behavioral problems. Masters-level therapists engage {{family members in}} identifying and changing individual, family, and environmental factors thought to contribute to problem behavior. Intervention may include efforts to improve communication, parenting skills, peer relations, school performance, and social networks. Most MST trials were conducted by program developers in the USA; results of one <b>independent</b> <b>trial</b> are available and others are in progress. Objective: To provide unbiased estimates of the impacts of MST on restrictive out-of-home living arrangements, crime and delinquency, and other behavioral and psychosocial outcomes for youth and families.

40|$|Multi-arm {{clinical}} trials assessing multiple experimental treatments against a shared control group can offer efficiency advantages over <b>independent</b> <b>trials</b> through assessing an {{increased number of}} hypotheses. Published opinion is divided on the requirement for multiple testing adjustment to control the family-wise type-I error rate (FWER). The probability of a false positive error in multi-arm trials compared to equivalent <b>independent</b> <b>trials</b> {{is affected by the}} correlation between comparisons due to sharing control data. We demonstrate that this correlation in fact leads to a reduction in the FWER, therefore FWER adjustment is not recommended solely due to sharing control data. In contrast, the correlation increases the probability of multiple false positive outcomes across the hypotheses, although standard FWER adjustment methods do not control for this. A stringent critical value adjustment is proposed to maintain equivalent evidence of superiority in two correlated comparisons to that obtained within <b>independent</b> <b>trials.</b> FWER adjustment is only required if there is an increased chance of making a single claim of effectiveness by testing multiple hypotheses, not due to sharing control data. For competing experimental therapies, the correlation between comparisons can be advantageous as it eliminates bias due to the experimental therapies being compared to different control populations...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo methods provide {{approximate}} numerical {{solutions to}} problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve exactly. The defining characteristic of Monte Carlo simulations {{is the use of}} multiple <b>independent</b> <b>trials,</b> each driven by some stochastic (random) process. The results of the <b>independent</b> <b>trials</b> are then combined to extract the average answer, relying on the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as more trials are combined, the average answer will converge on the true answer. The <b>independent</b> <b>trials</b> are inherently parallelizable, and they typically consist of dense numeric operations, so GPUs provide an almost ideal platform for Monte Carlo simulations. However, a key component within Monte Carlo simulations is the random number generators (RNGs) that provide the independent stochastic input to each trial. These generators must meet the conflicting goals of being extremely fast while also providing random number streams that are indistinguishable from a true random number source. There is an extensive body of literature devoted to random number generation in CPUs, but the most efficient of these make fundamental assumptions about processor architecture and performance: they are often not appropriate for use in GPUs.

40|$|International audienceWith the genomic {{revolution}} and the era of targeted therapy, prognostic and predictive gene signatures are becoming increasingly important in clinical research. They are expected to assist prognosis assessment and therapeutic decision making. Notwithstanding, an evidence-based approach is needed to bring gene signatures from the laboratory to clinical practice. In early breast cancer, multiple prognostic gene signatures are commercially available without having formally reached {{the highest levels of}} evidence-based criteria. We discuss specific concepts for developing and validating a prognostic signature and illustrate them with contemporary examples in breast cancer. When a prognostic signature has not been developed for predicting the magnitude of relative treatment benefit through an interaction effect, it may be wishful thinking to test its predictive value. We propose that new gene signatures be built specifically for predicting treatment effects for future patients and outline an approach for this using a cross-validation scheme in a standard phase III trial.

40|$|It {{is often}} useful for a robot to {{construct}} a spatial representation of its environment from experiments and observations, in other words, to learn a map of its environment by exploration. In addition, robots, like people, make occasional errors in perceiving the spatial features of their environments. We formulate map learning as the problem of inferring from noisy observations {{the structure of a}} reduced deterministic finite automaton. We assume that the automaton to be learned has a distinguishing sequence. Observation noise is modeled by treating the observed output at each state as a random variable, where each visit to the state is an <b>independent</b> <b>trial</b> and the correct output is observed with probability exceeding 1 = 2. We assume no errors in the state transition function. Using this framework, we provide an exploration algorithm to learn the correct structure of such an automaton with probability 1 Γ ffi, given as inputs ffi, an upper bound m on the number of states, a disti [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A coupled {{finite element}} (FE) method and meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method for {{analyzing}} two-dimensional potential problems {{is presented in}} this paper. The analysis domain is subdivided into two regions, a finite element (FE) region and a meshless (MM) region. A single weighted residual form is written for the entire domain. <b>Independent</b> <b>trial</b> and test functions are assumed in the FE and MM regions. A transition region is created between the two regions. The transition region blends the trial and test functions of the FE and MM regions. The trial function blending is achieved using a technique similar to the ‘Coons patch ’ method that is widely used in computer-aided geometric design. The test function blending is achieved by using either FE or MM test functions on the nodes in the transition element. The technique was evaluated by applying the coupled method to two potential problems governed by the Poisson equation. The coupled method passed all the patch test problems and gave accurate solutions for the problems studied...|$|E
