5|$|In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the {{daughter}} of a Toorak stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909. His first child was born on 29 June 1910, and named Charles Middleton after a friend of Blamey's who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shooting accident; but the boy was always called Dolf by his family. A second child, a boy named Thomas, was born four years later.|$|E

5|$|Loder's {{younger brother}} taught her three guitar chords {{when she was}} 14, and she {{received}} her first guitar later that year. She began writing songs at age 16. Her first song, which was about a cousin who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> traffic accident, used lyrics from a poem by one of their mutual friends. With encouragement from her family, Loder concentrated on her singing and songwriting and performed this in addition to another she subsequently wrote for a friend's graduation.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, John {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Ireland in 1185, which was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry's representatives, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John offended the local Irish rulers, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish, and finally returned to England within the year. In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed {{the balance of power}} between Henry and his remaining sons.|$|E
5|$|Helena saw {{relatively}} little of her surviving siblings, and continued {{her role as}} a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented. She and Christian led a quiet life, but did carry out a few royal engagements. On one such occasion, the elderly couple represented the King at the silver wedding anniversary, in 1906, of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Helena's nephew) and his wife Augusta Victoria (Christian's niece). During the Edwardian period, Helena visited the grave of her son, Prince Christian Victor, who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War. She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha, but Jan Smuts refused to meet her, partly because he was bitter that South Africa had lost the war and partly because his son <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> British concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Himmler and Hitler met for {{the last}} time on 20 April 1945—Hitler's birthday—in Berlin, and Himmler swore unswerving loyalty to Hitler. At a {{military}} briefing on that day, Hitler stated that he would not leave Berlin, in spite of Soviet advances. Along with Göring, Himmler quickly left the city after the briefing. On 21 April, Himmler met with Norbert Masur, a Swedish representative of the World Jewish Congress, to discuss the release of Jewish concentration camp inmates. As a result of these negotiations, about 20,000 people were released in the White Buses operation. Himmler falsely claimed in the meeting that the crematoria at camps had been built to deal with the bodies of prisoners who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> typhus epidemic. He also claimed very high survival rates for the camps at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, even as these sites were liberated and it became obvious that his figures were false.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mental hospital. Meckel was {{thought to have been}} looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fire 8 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war. William's second son, Richard, <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father {{at the time of}} his death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E

5|$|Loder {{wrote her}} first song at age 16 about a cousin who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> traffic accident. She was {{studying}} nursing at the Grenfell Campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland when she released The Way in August 2009. Also that year, {{she won a}} talent-search contest hosted by YC Newfoundland, a Christian youth conference, and, {{as part of the}} award, was given time with music professionals who helped her with Imperfections & Directions, which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase Imperfections & Directions by touring. Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards, and then as Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. Imperfections & Directions was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards.|$|E
5|$|Lucan met {{his future}} wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963. She {{was born in}} 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife Thelma. Her father <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car {{accident}} {{while she was still}} very young, following which the family had moved to South Africa. Her mother remarried, and when her new step-father became manager of a hotel in Guildford, the family returned to England. Along with her sister, Christina, she was educated at StSwithun's School, Winchester, and after displaying a talent for art she went on to study at an art college in Bournemouth. The two sisters later shared a flat in London, where Veronica worked as a model and later as a secretary. Christina's marriage to the wealthy William Shand-Kydd introduced her to London high society, and it was at a golf-club function in the country that Veronica and Lucan first met.|$|E
