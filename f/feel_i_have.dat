500|$|Shackleton's February 1907 {{announcement}} {{that he intended}} to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a sort of right to my own field of work," [...] he wrote, adding: [...] "anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.|$|E

A rep from Disney told TMZ: [...] "This is an {{unauthorized}} use of Brenda Song's image and her personal attorney has issued a cease and desist to the advertiser." [...] Song filed a libel suit seeking $100,000 in damages. Song said: [...] "As a role model to millions of young people, I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to take a stand}} against this company in regard to its exploitation of my image." [...] The settlement was announced in March 2009.|$|E
500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ... I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ...

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no need to do so.

500|$|Although xx {{had been}} highly {{anticipated}} by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound {{would have been}} entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was [...] "baffled" [...] by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made [...] "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to be a bit}} more private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E
500|$|The Hendrix {{defense team}} did not dispute that the drugs {{were found in}} his bag. They instead {{developed}} a strategy intended to demonstrate {{that he was not}} aware of its contents. Further, they offered substantiated accounts of how common it was for him to receive gifts from fans, which often included drugs. Hendrix was called as the first witness for the defense; he testified that fans showered gifts on him, including teddy bears, scarves, clothing, and jewelry. He explained that while in Beverly Hills, California, a female fan had given him a vial of what he thought was Bromo-Seltzer—a legal medication—which he put in his bag without knowledge of the illegal substances contained therein. Malone countered: [...] "You are charged with a serious offense, and your evidence is you don't really know how it got there, or who put it there", to which Hendrix responded: [...] "Yes." [...] The prosecutor then held up the aluminum tube in which the hashish was found and asked Hendrix to explain what he thought it was, he replied: [...] "A pea shooter", drawing uproarious laughter from the court. When asked about his drug use, he denied that he had ever used heroin or amphetamines, but admitted to smoking cannabis and hashish. He also admitted that he had used cocaine twice and LSD five times. He testified that his cannabis use had declined over the previous year, stating: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> outgrown it". Hendrix admitted that he had seen people use heroin, but denied any further knowledge of the drug. He testified that he was given some gifts at a fan club meeting for the Beatles that were intended for the English group; when he opened them he found several joints as well as what appeared to be doses of LSD.|$|E

500|$|Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on {{a one-year}} {{contract}} following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; [...] "I am back here because I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> unfinished business. I played well for a year here and I {{want to do the}} same again". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2–0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1–0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2–0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007–08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2–2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2–0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Sontag {{became aware}} of her {{bisexuality}} during her early teens and at 15 wrote in her diary, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lesbian tendencies (how reluctantly I write this)".

She herself confessed, [...] "I may have made mistakes in some dates or minor incidents but…I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> held to the spirit of my statement if not to the letter". Nevertheless, Karen Swenson, a Garbo biographer, and Schanke identified and corrected significant errors in de Acosta's account. While the memoir was initially unsuccessful, it was rediscovered in the late 1960s and widely read in the underground gay community. In spite of its inaccuracies, it is now recognized as an important contribution to gay and lesbian history.|$|E

Bassey then announced to the press that she and Finch would not be marrying, telling the press: [...] "It simply wouldn't work out. Just now I am not ready for marriage to anyone. I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to be free." [...] A year later, Hume sued the actor and another man, John McAuliffe, for being [...] "indiscreet" [...] with the singer. Both Finch and McAuliffe were cited as co-respondents in the Hume–Bassey divorce. For her part, Bassey was named as co-respondent in 1965 when Finch's wife, South African actress Yolande Turner, divorced the actor.|$|E
