He defeated Yan Yan and captured him alive. Zhang Fei said to Yan Yan, [...] "When my army showed up, {{why did you}} put up resistance instead of surrendering?" [...] Yan Yan replied, [...] "You people launched an unwarranted attack on my home province. There may be generals in my province who will lose their heads, but there are none who will surrender."

2500|$|When Gan Ning {{brought his}} {{followers}} to Wu, Zhou Yu and Lü Meng recommended him to serve their lord, Sun Quan. Sun Quan felt that Gan Ning was extraordinary and treated <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old acquaintance. Gan Ning proposed, [...] "The Han Empire is declining day by day. Cao Cao is becoming increasingly arrogant and he'll eventually usurp the throne. The southern territories in Jing Province are accessible in terms of travelling by land or water. The western domain of the Empire lies there. Based on my observation of Liu Biao, he'll not last long while his sons are of inferior quality and cannot inherit his jurisdiction. My lord, you should take control of these lands soon, lest Cao Cao seizes them later. The best plan now is to attack Huang Zu first. Huang Zu is old and muddleheaded. He lacks funding and supplies, cheats those around them, and is only concerned with making personal gains. His subordinates are already unhappy with {{him because of his}} overbearing demands. His warships and military equipment are damaged and have not been repaired; he neglects agriculture; his army is ill-disciplined. If you attack him now, you'll surely win. After defeating him, you can move west further and take control of Chu Pass (楚關) and expand your domain and influence. After that, you can prepare to attack Bashu (巴蜀; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing)." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Germany, Italy and France many clergyman and {{university}} professors gave speeches saying all of Europe owed a huge debt to ancient Greece, {{that the modern}} Greeks were entitled to call upon the classical heritage {{as a reason for}} support and Greece only achieve progress with freedom from the Ottoman Empire. A young medical student in Mannheim wrote that hearing his professor lecture on the need for Greek freedom went through <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> electric shock, inspiring to drop his studies and head to Greece while a Danish student wrote: [...] "How could a man inclined to fight for freedom and justice find a better place than next to the oppressed Greeks?". In France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the United States and many other places [...] "Greek committees" [...] were established to raise funds and supplies for the revolution. The classicist Edward Everett, professor of Greek at Harvard, was active in championing the Greek cause in the United States and in November 1821 published an appeal from Adhamantios Korais reading [...] "To the Citizens of the United States, it is your land that Liberty has fixed her abode, so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the Europeans", going on to call for American intervention, in several American newspapers. In 1821, the Greek committee in Charleston, South Carolina sent the Greeks 50 barrels of salted meat while the Greek Committee in Springfield, Massachusetts sent supplies of salted meat, sugar, fish and flour. Newspapers in the United States gave the war much coverage and were overwhelmingly pro-Greek in their stance, which explains why American public opinion was so supportive. In New York City, one ball put on by the Greek committee raised $8, 000 dollars. In Russia, the St. Petersburg Greek committee under Prince Alexander Golitsyn had raised 973, 500 roubles by August 1822. By the end of the war, millions of roubles had been fund-raised in Russia for the relief of refugees and to buy Greeks enslaved freedom (through the government forbade buying arms for the Greeks), but no Russian is known to have gone to fight with the Greeks.|$|E
