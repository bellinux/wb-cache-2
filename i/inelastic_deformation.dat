30|$|Investigating the ULS {{distribution}} in Fig.  10 {{reveals that the}} structural system has the greatest repair cost of the fragility groups. The structural system accounts for 26 % of the total repair cost. Brace damage {{is responsible for the}} majority of this cost. Structural damage is anticipated for the ULS event, as conventional seismic design relies on structural members experiencing <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations.</b> These large <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> are concentrated in members designed to dissipate seismic energy in a controlled manner. Although the <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> damage the structural members, life safety of building occupants is achieved. Nonstructural systems are often omitted or treated in an oversimplified manner during the design of a structure. However, 74 % of the ULS repair costs can be attributed to these systems. This demonstrates the need to consider nonstructural systems during structural design.|$|R

50|$|Polymers are {{viscoelastic}} by nature, {{and exhibit}} mechanical hysteresis even at moderate strains due to continuous elongation and contraction. Some of this <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> energy is dissipated as heat within the polymer, and consequently the materials temperature will rise {{as a function}} of frequency, testing temperature, the stress cycle and the type of polymer. As the temperature within the polymer rises, the stiffness and yield strength will fall, and thermal failure becomes a possibility as deformation levels become excessive.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanical}} behaviour of arterial tissue {{is vital to}} the development and analysis of medical devices targeting diseased vessels. During angioplasty and stenting, stress softening and permanent deformation of the vessel wall occur during implantation of the device, however little data exists on the inelastic behaviour of cardiovascular tissue and how this varies through the arterial tree. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the magnitude of stress softening and <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> due to loading throughout the arterial tree and to investigate the anisotropic inelastic behaviour of the tissue. Cyclic compression tests were used to investigate the differences in inelastic behaviour for carotid, aorta, femoral and coronary arteries harvested from 3 - 4 month old female pigs, while the anisotropic behaviour of aortic and carotid tissue was determined using cyclic tensile tests in the longitudinal and circumferential directions. The differences in inelastic behaviour were correlated to the ratio of collagen to elastin content of the arteries. It was found that larger <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> occurred in muscular arteries (coronary), which had a higher collagen to elastin ratio than elastic arteries (aorta), where the smallest <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> were observed. Lower magnitude <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> were observed in the circumferential tensile direction than in the longitudinal tensile direction or due to radial compression. This may be as a result of non-collagenous components in the artery becoming more easily damaged than the collagen fibres during loading. Stress softening was also found to be dependent on artery type. In the future, computational models should consider such site dependant, anisotropic inelastic behaviour in order to better predict the outcomes of interventional procedures such as angioplasty and stenting...|$|R

In particular, the influence of <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> and delamination at the interfaces of the lamina on the macroscopic and local response of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }/Al plates are studied. The work is carried out using a recently developed plate theory which models both delamination and localized history-dependent effects such, as inelasticity. A linear debonding model for the interface is employed for the current work. The theory models both the initiation and growth of delaminations without imposing any restrictions on the location, size, or direction of growth of the delamination. In the current work {{the response of the}} individual lamina in the plate are modeled using the Method of Cells (MOC) micromechanical model. The inelastic behavior in the matrix is modeled using the unified viscoplastic theory of Bodner and Partom. The {{behavior of}} a Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }/Al plate under dynamic cylindrical bending subjected to a ramp and hold type of loading is examined. For simplicity, the plate is assumed to be composed of a cross-ply layup. It is shown that both <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> and delamination have a strong influence on dynamic plate behavior.

50|$|Uncured {{natural rubber}} is sticky, deforms easily when warm, and is brittle when cold. In this state, it {{is a poor}} {{material}} when {{a high level of}} elasticity is required. The reason for <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> of unvulcanized rubber can be found in its chemical structure — rubber is composed of long polymer chains. These chains can move independently relative to each other, which lets the material change shape. Crosslinking introduced by vulcanization prevents the polymer chains from moving independently. As a result, when stress is applied the vulcanized rubber deforms, but upon release of the stress it reverts to its original shape.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{conductor}} steel-reinforced cable (ACSR) {{is a type}} of high-capacity, high-strength {{stranded conductor}} typically used in overhead power lines. The outer strands are high-purity aluminium, chosen for its excellent conductivity, low weight and low cost. The center strand is steel for additional strength to help support the weight of the conductor. Steel is higher strength than aluminium which allows for increased mechanical tension to be applied on the conductor. Steel also has lower elastic and <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> (permanent elongation) due to mechanical loading (e.g. wind and ice) as well as a lower coefficient of thermal expansion under current loading. These properties allow ACSR to sag significantly less than all-aluminium conductors. Per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association or CSA) naming convention, ACSR is designated A1/S1A.|$|E
50|$|Designers {{pioneering}} {{the use of}} SPWs did {{not have}} much experience nor existing data to rely upon. Typically, web plate design failed to consider post-buckling behaviour under shear, thus ignoring the advantage of the tension field and its added benefits for drift control and shear resistance. Furthermore, the <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> capacity of this highly redundant system had not been utilized, also ignoring the significant energy dissipation capability that is of great importance for buildings in high-risk seismic zones. One of the first researchers to investigate the behaviour of SPWs more closely was Kulak at the University of Alberta. Since the early 1980s, his team conducted both analytical and experimental research focused on developing design procedures suitable for drafting design standards (Driver et al., 1997, Thorburn et al., 1983, Timler and Kulak, 1983, and Tromposch and Kulak, 1987). Recent research in the United States by Astaneh (2001) supports the assertion by Canadian academia that unstiffened plate, post-buckling behaviour acts as a capable shear resisting system.|$|E

30|$|The inelastic {{strain pattern}} {{correlates}} with {{the behavior of}} active faults as shown in Fig.  3.

The Futagawa–Hinagu and Beppu–Haneyama fault zones in the Kumamoto and Beppu regions correspond to areas with high inelastic strain rates. Active faults also create <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation.</b> Long-term <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> caused by active fault behavior {{is similar to the}} present <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> due to seismic activity.

The reasons for this appear to be (a) in the actual structural materials the level of energy needed to cause fracture is orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding surface energy, and (b) in structural materials there are always some <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> around the crack front {{that would make the}} assumption of linear elastic medium with infinite stresses at the crack tip highly unrealistic.|$|R
40|$|Typically, beams {{that form}} part of {{structural}} systems are subjected to vertical distributed loading along their length. Distributed loading affects moment and shear distribution, and consequently spread of inelasticity, along the beam length. However, the finite element models developed so far for seismic analysis of frame structures either ignore the effect of vertical distributed loading on spread of inelasticity or consider it in an approximate manner. In this paper, a beam-type finite element is developed, which is capable of considering accurately the effect of uniform distributed loading on spreading of <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformations</b> along the beam length. The proposed model consists of two gradual spread inelasticity sub-elements accounting explicitly for inelastic flexural and shear response. Following this approach, the effect of distributed loading on spreading of inelastic flexural and shear deformations is properly taken into account. The finite element is implemented in the seismic analysis of plane frame structures with beam members controlled either by flexure or shear.

30|$|The {{paradox of}} {{deformation}} {{is well known}} in the Northeast (NE) Japan Arc; short-term deformation observed by geodetic techniques and long-term deformations estimated from geomorphic/geologic data differ both in rate and direction (e.g., Hashimoto 1990; Ikeda 1996). The discrepancy between the short- and the long-term deformations is expected to be balanced by a super-cycle earthquake along the Japan Trench (Ikeda 1996), but it was not balanced by the co-seismic deformation of the 2011 Tohoku-oki mega earthquake (Mw 9.0) (e.g., Ozawa et al. 2011; Ikeda et al. 2012; Nishimura 2014). A few revised models have suggested that the paradox may be resolved by taking into account post-seismic deformation (e.g., Ikeda et al. 2012). For solving the paradox comprehensively, that is, for creating a more detailed understanding of the strain buildup/release process in an arc-trench system, it is essential to discriminate between elastic and <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> from geodetic data; elastic deformation is canceled by earthquake cycles, whereas <b>inelastic</b> <b>deformation</b> contributes to orogenesis (e.g., Ikeda 2014).

This procedure is illustrated {{as an example of}} application using Buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) as metallic structural fuses. To verify and validate the developed design procedure, an experimental project was conducted on the shaking table at University at Buffalo, which consists of a three-story frame designed with BRBs working as metallic structural fuses.
