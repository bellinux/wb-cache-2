5000|$|A bullbar or push bumper (also roo bar or {{nudge bar}} in Australia, moose bumper in Canada, and push bar, bull bar, brush guard, <b>grill</b> <b>guard</b> or cattle pusher in the United States) is a device {{installed}} {{on the front of}} a vehicle to protect its front from collisions, whether an accidental collision with a large animal in rural roads, or an intentional collision with another vehicle in police usage. They range considerably in size and form, and are normally composed of welded steel or aluminium tubing, or, more recently, moulded polycarbonate and polyethylene materials. The [...] "bull" [...] in the name refers to cattle, which in rural areas sometimes roam onto rural roads and highways.|$|E
5000|$|A minor {{facelift}} to the Countryman {{was unveiled}} at the 2014 New York International Auto Show. [...] Changes include a new {{structure of the}} hexagonal radiator <b>grill,</b> underride <b>guard</b> elements for the Cooper S Countryman ALL4 and additional body colour options. It went on sale in July 2014. All variants carried over. US variants include Cooper, Cooper S, Cooper S ALL4, John Cooper Works (with ALL4), with 6-speed manual transmission or optional 6-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
2500|$|Styling {{changes for}} 1938 were modest, with a longer hood {{extending}} to a now nearly vertical <b>grill,</b> taller bumper <b>guards</b> and redesigned hubcaps, {{but the effect}} was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four {{times the size of}} any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. [...] The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new [...] "turbulator" [...] pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141.|$|R
25|$|The {{residential}} second-story is accessed thorough {{an original}} double-door wooden gate facing Paseo Atocha. Beyond the entrance, an imposing zaguan (hallway), with 17-foot high with exposed beams and rafters ceiling and richly stenciled decorated walls, surprised the visitor. Midpoint in the zaguan, a Roman arch, painted to simulated marble, creates a transition point and serves to visually frame a magnificent eight risers, bronze handrails, marble flared stair. At the stair's landing, {{there are two}} identical richly crafted iron <b>grilled</b> gates. One <b>guards</b> {{the entrance to the}} second floor, while the other one does the same to and from the patio. At the gate's upper portion that faces the zaguan, within a golden painted circle, the metal is curved to form the letters CV, the initials of Carlos Vives, the 1860s owner of the house. A northerly left turn at the landing guides the visitor into an impressive marble straight staircase with bronze handrails, up to the second floor.|$|R
5000|$|... 1967 was {{the final}} year that Corgi issued Monte Carlo Rally cars, and the famous Mini Cooper S (339) {{appeared}} yet again in March, this time with four jewelled rally lamps in the <b>grill,</b> a sump <b>guard</b> and two spare wheels on a roof rack borrowed from the 'Surfing' Mini Traveller (485) from 1965. The 1967 Monte Carlo Rally Mini Cooper S stayed in the Corgi range until 1972, spanning two different castings. Another Mini Cooper S (333) was released in February 1967 carrying the same red and white paintwork, but as campaigned in the 1967 RAC/Sun rally by Tony Fall and Mike Wood, along with another Rover 2000 (322) from the same event finished in white with a matt black bonnet. The final Monte Carlo Rally car was the Sunbeam Imp (340) issued in March 1967, which featured four jewelled rally lamps and was finished in blue with a white flash and front panel. In December 1965 a Volkswagen 1200 Beetle was issued in East African Safari finish (256). This model featured an opening boot and engine cover and steerable front wheels operated by a spare tyre {{on the roof of}} the car. The colourful packaging was completed with the inclusion of a model of a charging rhinoceros. Three years later in July 1969 Corgi issued the winning Hillman Hunter from the 1968 London to Sydney Marathon (302), complete with Take-Off Wheels, roof mounted tool box and a plastic kangaroo guard across the front of the car. This time the packaging included a model kangaroo and details of the event, and in February 1970 a model of the unique 4wd Ford Capri 3-Litre rally car (303) driven by Roger Clark was released. A model of the successful Datsun 240Z rally car in East African Safari Finish (394) was issued in October 1972 and in May 1973 the Datsun 240Z was also issued in [...] "US Rally" [...] finish (396). This, in fact, was an authentic model of John Morton's 300 bhp BRE-Datsun 240Z which won the 1970 and 1971 SCCA class C/P championships. The Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona as raced at the 1973 Le Mans 24 Hours race, with JCB and Corgi sponsorship (324), was released in June 1973 along with another in white/red/blue livery inspired by a 1972 Le Mans entry (323). In July 1973 the Porsche-Audi 917/10 (397) from the Can-Am race series was issued with L&M cigarette sponsorship.|$|R
