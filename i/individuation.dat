25|$|Xu & Chun (2009) {{propose the}} neural-object file theory, which posits {{that the human}} visual system {{initially}} selects a fixed number of roughly four objects from a crowded scene based on their spatial information (object <b>individuation)</b> before encoding their details (object identification). Under this framework, object <b>individuation</b> is generally controlled by the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), while object identification involves the superior IPS and higher-level visual areas. At the object <b>individuation</b> stage, object representations are coarse and contain minimal feature information. However, once these object representations (or object-files, to use the theory's language) have been 'set up' during the object <b>individuation</b> stage they can be elaborated on over time during the object identification stage, during which additional featural and identity information is received.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} discussed {{throughout this}} period are {{the relation of}} faith to reason, the existence and simplicity of God, the purpose of theology and metaphysics, and the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of <b>individuation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jung {{established}} {{a school of}} psychology which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and unconscious components of the psyche) through a process called <b>individuation.</b> Through studying folklore, world mythologies, and the dreams of his patients, Jung identified these components of the psyche as expressions of instinctual patterns (or archetypes). The role of the psychoanalyst in the Jungian approach is to assist the analysand from being overwhelmed by unconscious material or being {{cut off from the}} meaning offered by these suprapersonal forces. Jungian analysts typically believe that the psyche is the source of healing and the drive toward <b>individuation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of <b>individuation,</b> i.e., of numerical distinction of one individual from another {{with the same}} specific nature, is matter designated by quantity. Thus in pure spirits there cannot {{be more than one}} individual in the same specific nature.|$|E
25|$|In April 1661 he {{enrolled}} in his father's former university at age 15, and completed his bachelor's degree in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his Disputatio Metaphysica de Principio Individui (Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of <b>Individuation),</b> which addressed the principle of <b>individuation,</b> on 9 June 1663. Leibniz earned his master's degree in Philosophy on 7 February 1664. He published and defended a dissertation Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum (An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right), arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law, in December 1664. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665. His dissertation was titled De conditionibus (On Conditions).|$|E
25|$|Independently from Marx, {{the romantic}} novelist Jean Paul {{also used the}} concept, in portraying the human {{problems}} of <b>individuation.</b> In Jean Paul's aesthetics, the Charaktermaske is the observable face or appearance-form of a hidden self. It is Jean Paul's definition which is cited in the Deutsches Wörterbuch compiled by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm from 1838 onward.|$|E
25|$|In 1944 Jung {{published}} Psychology and Alchemy, {{in which}} he analyzed the alchemical symbols {{and came to the}} conclusion that there is a direct relationship between them and the psychoanalytical process. He argued that the alchemical process was the transformation of the impure soul (lead) to perfected soul (gold), and a metaphor for the <b>individuation</b> process.|$|E
25|$|To {{contend that}} {{there is at least}} some {{disagreement}} between Jung and Gnosticism is at least supportable: the Jungian process of <b>individuation</b> involves the addition of unconscious psychic tropes to consciousness in order to achieve a trans-conscious centre to the personality. Jung did not intend this addition to {{take the form of a}} complete identification of the Self with the Unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Jung's work {{on himself}} and his {{patients}} convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep innate potential. Based on his study of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Taoism, and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called <b>individuation,</b> is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self {{and at the same}} time to meet the Divine. Unlike Freud's objectivist worldview, Jung's pantheism may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to our well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole. Jung's ideas on religion gave a counterbalance to the Freudian scepticism of religion. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to <b>individuation</b> has been quite popular and is still treated in modern textbooks on the psychology of religion, though his ideas have also been criticized.|$|E
25|$|The Ring {{has been}} the subject of myriad interpretations. For example, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect Wagnerite, argues for a view of The Ring as an {{essentially}} socialist critique of industrial society and its abuses. Robert Donington in Wagner's Ring And Its Symbols interprets it in terms of Jungian psychology, as an account of the development of unconscious archetypes in the mind, leading towards <b>individuation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between object <b>individuation</b> and identification in the neural object-file theory {{is supported by}} evidence such as that from Xu's & Chun's fMRI study (as cited in Xu & Chun, 2009). In this study, they examined posterior brain mechanisms that supported visual short-term memory (VSTM). The fMRI showed that representations in the inferior IPS were fixed to roughly four objects regardless of object complexity, but representations in the superior IPS and lateral occipital complex (LOC) varied according to complexity.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{proceeding}} by tenet #1 in Answer to Job, Jung interprets Yahweh as an archaic {{form of the}} self, Job as the ego, and Satan as {{the principle}} of <b>individuation.</b> Jung interprets {{the evolution of the}} god-image portrayed in the Old and New Testaments as a process of psychological development: In the Book of Job, the archaic self is prompted to develop toward consciousness by the more conscious ego, a process attended by dreams and prophesies (e.g. the Old Testament prophets). The self enters ego-consciousness (the incarnation of God in Jesus of Nazareth), followed by the emergence of the transcendent function (when the Holy Ghost comes to the disciples at Pentecost).|$|E
25|$|Later, Marxist {{political}} thinker Louis Althusser was {{a student}} at ENS and taught there for many years, and many of his disciples later became known for their own thought: among them were Étienne Balibar, philosopher Alain Badiou, who still teaches at the school as an emeritus professor, and Jacques Rancière. Still later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the world-renowned thinker Michel Foucault, founder of the history of systems of thought and future professor at the Collège de France {{was a student}} a few years ahead of the founder of deconstruction, Jacques Derrida and the thinker of <b>individuation</b> Gilbert Simondon. The tradition continues today through such philosophers as Jacques Bouveresse, Jean-Luc Marion, Claudine Tiercelin and Quentin Meillassoux, and the school has also produced prominent public intellectuals like Stéphane Hessel and such New Philosophers as Bernard-Henri Lévy and Benny Lévy.|$|E
25|$|Avicenna's {{psychology}} {{requires that}} {{connection between the}} body and soul {{be strong enough to}} ensure the soul's <b>individuation,</b> but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.|$|E
500|$|Janáček {{established}} {{a school of}} composition in Brno. Among his notable pupils were Jan Kunc, Václav Kaprál, Vilém Petrželka, Jaroslav Kvapil, Osvald Chlubna, Břetislav Bakala, and Pavel Haas. Most of his students neither imitated nor developed Janáček's style, which left him no direct stylistic descendants. According to Milan Kundera, Janáček developed a personal, modern style in relative isolation from contemporary modernist movements but was {{in close contact with}} developments in modern European music. His path towards the innovative [...] "modernism" [...] of his later years was long and solitary, and he achieved true <b>individuation</b> as a composer around his 50th year.|$|E
500|$|However, other {{scholars}} think Kierkegaard adopts Kantian themes {{in order to}} criticize them, while yet others think that although Kierkegaard adopts some Kantian themes, their final ethical positions are substantially different. George Stack argues for this latter interpretation, writing, [...] "Despite the occasional echoes of Kantian sentiments in Kierkegaard's writings (especially in Either/Or), the bifurcation between his ethics of self-becoming and Kant's formalistic, meta-empirical ethics is, mutatis mutandis, complete ... Since radical <b>individuation,</b> specificity, inwardness, {{and the development of}} subjectivity are central to Kierkegaard's existential ethics, it is clear, essentially, that the spirit and intention of his practical ethics is divorced from the formalism of Kant." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{evolution}} and maturation of the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, {{is central to}} the story. This journey of maturation, where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world, may be seen as a Bildungsroman rather than a traditional quest. The Jungian concept of <b>individuation</b> is also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves. Thus, while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on, it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party, a fact the dwarves could not bear to acknowledge. The analogue of the [...] "underworld" [...] and the hero returning from it with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic archetypes regarding initiation and male coming-of-age as described by Joseph Campbell. Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from the Ancrene Wisse (which Tolkien had written on in 1929) and a Christian understanding of Beowulf.|$|E

2500|$|... lack of <b>individuation</b> {{inherent}} {{to the system}} of Spinoza, which represents individual creatures as merely accidental.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Individuation.</b> [...] The {{problem of}} <b>individuation</b> is {{to explain how}} we individuate or numerically {{distinguish}} the members of any kind {{for which it is}} given. [...] The problem arose when it was required to explain how individual angels of the same species differ from one another. [...] Angels are immaterial, and their numerical difference cannot be explained by the different matter they are made of. [...] The main contributors to this discussion were Aquinas and Scotus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Individuation</b> – {{the process}} of {{fulfilment}} of each individual [...] "which negates neither the conscious or unconscious position but does justice to them both".|$|E

2500|$|More recently, Heidegger's thought has {{considerably}} {{influenced the}} work of the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume magnum opus, La technique et le temps (volume one translated into English as [...] ). Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing {{that there can be no}} access to [...] "originary temporality" [...] other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of Being and Time as an account of psychic <b>individuation,</b> and his later [...] "history of being" [...] as an account of collective <b>individuation.</b> He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two.|$|E
2500|$|The {{maternal}} {{bonds between}} Sethe {{and her children}} inhibit her own <b>individuation</b> and prevent the development of her self. Sethe develops a dangerous maternal passion that results {{in the murder of}} one daughter, her own [...] "best self", and the estrangement of the surviving daughter from the black community, both in an attempt to salvage her [...] "fantasy of the future", her children, from a life in slavery. However, Sethe fails to recognize her daughter Denver’s need for interaction with this community in order to enter into womanhood. Denver finally succeeds {{at the end of the}} novel in establishing her own self and embarking on her <b>individuation</b> with the help of Beloved. Contrary to Denver, Sethe only becomes individuated after Beloved’s exorcism, at which point Sethe can fully accept the first relationship that is completely [...] "for her", her relationship with Paul D. This relationship relieves Sethe from the ensuing destruction of herself that resulted from the maternal bonds controlling her life.|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas Jolley has {{surmised that}} Leibniz's {{reputation}} as a philosopher is now perhaps higher {{than at any time}} since he was alive. Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of identity, <b>individuation,</b> and possible worlds. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century ideas has revealed more clearly the 17th-century [...] "Intellectual Revolution" [...] that preceded the better-known Industrial and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, in The Concept of Anxiety (1844), {{described}} {{anxiety or}} dread {{associated with the}} [...] "dizziness of freedom" [...] and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In Art and Artist (1932), the psychologist Otto Rank wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, <b>individuation,</b> and differentiation.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{authenticity}} takes Dasein {{out of the}} [...] "They," [...] in part by revealing its place {{as a part of}} the They. Heidegger states that Authentic being-toward-death calls Daseins individual self out of its [...] "they-self", and frees it to re-evaluate life from the standpoint of finitude. In so doing, Dasein opens itself up for [...] "angst," [...] translated alternately as [...] "dread" [...] or as [...] "anxiety." [...] Angst, as opposed to fear, does not have any distinct object for its dread; it is rather anxious in the face of Being-in-the-world in general — that is, it is anxious in the face of Daseins own self. Angst is a shocking <b>individuation</b> of Dasein, when it realizes that it is not at home in the world, or when it comes face to face with its own [...] "uncanny" [...] (German Unheimlich [...] "not at home"). In Daseins <b>individuation,</b> it is open to hearing the [...] "call of conscience" [...] (German Gewissensruf), which comes from Daseins own Self when it wants to be its Self. This Self is then open to truth, understood as unconcealment (Greek aletheia). In this moment of vision, Dasein understands what is hidden as well as hiddenness itself, indicating Heidegger's regular uniting of opposites; in this case, truth and untruth.|$|E
2500|$|Archetypes seek actualization {{within the}} context of an individual's {{environment}} and determine the degree of <b>individuation.</b> Jung also used the terms [...] "evocation" [...] and [...] "constellation" [...] to explain the process of actualization. Thus for example, the mother archetype is actualized {{in the mind of the}} child by the evoking of innate anticipations of the maternal archetype when the child is in the proximity of a maternal figure who corresponds closely enough to its archetypal template. This mother archetype is built into the personal unconscious of the child as a mother complex. Complexes are functional units of the personal unconscious, in the same way that archetypes are units for the collective unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|Process Work's {{contention}} of {{a link between}} dreams and body symptoms is a viewpoint similar to shamanism, 'mankind's oldest medicinal doctrine, where illness reflects one's spiritual condition'. [...] Mindell's theory has also been compared to another Jungian, Meredith Sabini, who similarly recognises a symbolic relationship between dream images and physical symptoms, and values their role in bringing awareness of a person's <b>individuation</b> process, {{the development of the}} Jungian Self. Mindell is recognised for providing a method of working psychologically with body symptoms using the technique of 'amplification'; this involves intensifying the experience of a symptom or a dream and following its expression through the various 'channels' of perception until the meaning of the 'dreambody' is revealed to the client.|$|E
2500|$|The One and the Indefinite Dyad are the {{ultimate}} ground of everything because the realm of Plato's Forms and the totality of reality derive from their interaction. The whole manifold of sensory phenomena rests in the end on only two factors. [...] Form issues from the One, which is the productive factor; the formless Indefinite Dyad serves as the substrate for {{the activity of the}} One. Without such a substrate, the One could produce nothing. All Being rests upon the action of the One upon the Indefinite Dyad. This action sets limits to the formless, gives it Form and particularity, and is therefore also the principle of <b>individuation</b> that brings separate entities into existence. A mixture of both principles underlies all Being.|$|E
2500|$|Other European {{philosophers}} {{have criticized}} Deleuze's theory of subjectivity. [...] For example, Manfred Frank claims that Deleuze's theory of <b>individuation</b> {{as a process}} of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness. [...] Slavoj Žižek claims that Deleuze's ontology oscillates between materialism and idealism, and that the Deleuze of Anti-Oedipus ("arguably Deleuze's worst book"), the [...] "political" [...] Deleuze under the [...] "'bad' influence" [...] of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as [...] "the ideologist of late capitalism". Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to [...] "just another" [...] substance and thereby failing to grasp the nothingness that, according to Lacan and Žižek, defines subjectivity. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, Žižek finds, are precisely those concepts closest to Žižek's own ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Philosophers such as Aquinas use {{the concept}} of <b>individuation.</b> They argue that {{abortion}} is not permissible from {{the point at which}} individual human identity is realized. Anthony Kenny argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say [...] "if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me" [...] then one can reasonably infer that at six months the [...] "me" [...] in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of monozygotic twinning can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Altruism {{is central}} to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, {{especially}} in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain. From biblical to medieval Christian traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of [...] "disinterested love", as in the Pauline phrase [...] "love seeks not its own interests." [...] In his book Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative <b>individuation</b> of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.|$|E
2500|$|Interactivity {{has become}} a term {{for a number of}} new media use options {{evolving}} from the rapid dissemination of Internet access points, the digitalization of media, and media convergence. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information. Such a definition replaces the [...] "one-to-many" [...] model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a [...] "many-to-many" [...] web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses. Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In [...] "What is new media?" [...] Vin Crosbie (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as [...] "one to one", Mass media as [...] "one to many", and finally New Media as <b>Individuation</b> Media or [...] "many to many".|$|E
2500|$|The persona, he argues, is a mask for the [...] "{{collective}} psyche", a {{mask that}} 'pretends' individuality, so that both {{self and others}} believe in that identity, {{even if it is}} really no more than a well-played role through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the [...] "persona-mask" [...] as a complicated system which mediates between individual consciousness and the social community: it is [...] "a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be". But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a character mask in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) {{the true nature of the}} individual. The therapist then aims to assist the <b>individuation</b> process through which the client (re)gains his [...] "own self" [...] – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the persona, and from the power of unconscious impulses.|$|E
2500|$|Giddens {{introduces}} 'reflexivity' and {{in information}} societies information gathering is {{considered as a}} routinised process for the greater protection of the nation. Information gathering {{is known as the}} concept of 'individuation.' [...] Individuality comes as a result of <b>individuation</b> as people are given more 'informed choices.' [...] The more information the government has about a person, the more entitlements are given to the citizens. [...] The process of information gathering helps government to identify 'enemies-of-the-state,' singling out individuals that are suspected of plotting activities against the state. [...] The advent of technology has brought national security to a completely new level. [...] Historically, the military relied on armed force to deal with threats. [...] With the development of ICT, biometric scans, language translation, real time programs and other related intelligent programs have made the identification of terrorist activities much easier compared to the past. The analysing of algorithm patterns in biometric databases have given government new leads. [...] Data about citizens can be collected through identification and credential verification companies. [...] Hence, surveillance and ICT goes hand-in-hand with information gathering. [...] In other words, the collection of information is necessary as 'stringent safeguards' {{for the protection of the}} nation, preventing it from imminent attacks.|$|E
