50|$|The {{main task}} of the EBA is to contribute, through the {{adoption}} of binding Technical Standards (BTS) and Guidelines, {{to the creation of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook</b> in banking. The Single Rulebook aims at providing a single set of harmonised prudential rules for financial institutions throughout the EU, helping create a level playing field and providing high protection to depositors, investors and consumers.|$|E

40|$|Th is paper, {{based on}} presentations before audiences in Lisbon, {{provides}} an overview of the causes of the credit crisis and discusses one of the reports issued in the wake thereof, the De Larosière Report. Its main findings in respect of financial sector regulation are reviewed: a <b>single</b> <b>European</b> <b>rulebook,</b> colleges of supervisors, deposit guarantee schemes, bank resolution regimes and ‘living wills’ as well as transparent corporate structures of banks. The proposals {{for the establishment of a}} European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) are described and subjected to critical reviews, both from a legal angle and from a broader perspective. Emphasis is given to the European Banking Authority (EBA), as one of the agencies within the ESFS. Suggestions are made to broaden the legal underpinning of the proposals in order to place the new bodies on a firm footing. This paper argues that, even though major steps toward a stronger Union-wide response to difficulties in the financial sector, the De Larosière proposals and the Commission’s legislative follow-up do not provide an adequate response to the lessons from the crisis. Federal authority for overseeing the financial sector is required: this implies Treaty change...|$|R
50|$|One {{pillar of}} the banking union is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which would grant the European Central Bank (ECB) a {{supervisory}} role to monitor {{the implementation of the}} <b>single</b> <b>rulebook</b> and the financial stability of banks based in participating states.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the change}} in the {{directive}} (2014/49/EU), which was part of <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook,</b> the regulatory foundations for Banking Union, the fund had changed from ex-post to anex-ante system. The fund would eventually joined a single deposit guarantee scheme of the EU. However, in a near future, the fund would only re-insuranced by European Deposit Insurance Scheme.|$|R
50|$|The 4th {{edition of}} Starfire is called Galactic Starfire. This edition {{combines}} {{all the rules}} (Tactical and Strategic) back into a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook,</b> and replaces the earlier system of Technology Levels with Tech Trees. It {{is one of the}} few printed products released by the Starfire Design Studio. Elite (PDF) is a supplement to Galactic Starfire.|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} that a banking union at the European level is a gain, {{but it is not}} a {{solution}} for all the problems that have been revealed by the last financial crisis. Although the <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook</b> uniforms banks' risks management and micro-prudential supervision, the macro-prudential components contained are reduced and academically challenged. The question of Member States outside the Eurozone on the participation within the Single Supervisory Mechanism is when is the right moment and not if, since there is an implicit horizon for joining the Eurozone and thus to the mechanism. For these Member States, where the banking system is dominated by banking groups supervised by the European Central Bank, entering into a close cooperation with the Single Supervisory Mechanism does not appear to be a necessity, given that national supervision authorities are applying the <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook,</b> and cooperation between national authorities and the European Central Bank is clearly established...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second edition}} of Villains & Vigilantes, {{created by the}} same authorship team and also {{published}} by Fantasy Games Unlimited, was released in 1982 in two formats, both as a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook</b> and in a box set format that contained the revised rulebook, GM's screen, dice and character sheets. These were followed by a line of adventure module and rule supplements published through the 80's until the final supplement published in 1987, [...] "For the Greater Good".|$|R
50|$|In April 2015, EPEX SPOT {{and former}} APX Group {{announced}} {{the integration of}} their businesses in order to form a Power Exchange for Central Western Europe (CWE, encompassing Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) and the UK. The integration of EPEX SPOT and APX Group reduced barriers in power trading in the CWE and UK region. Market participants benefit from harmonized trading systems, one <b>single</b> <b>rulebook</b> and one admission process for the entire region, therefore reducing trading costs and lowering entry barriers for new participants. Moreover, {{they have access to}} a wider range of products and benefit from best-of-both standards and reliable customer support. Overall, the integration led to a more effective governance and further facilitated the creation of a <b>single</b> <b>European</b> power market fully in line with the objectives of the European electricity regulatory framework. Since 31 December 2016, all former APX Group entities act under the EPEX SPOT name.|$|R

40|$|The European Parliament has {{probably}} won a Pyrrhic victory with {{its position on}} bank bonuses, argues CEPS CEO Karel Lannoo in this new Commentary. In return, EU member states got what they wanted with the new Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) : no binding leverage ratio; mortgage risk weightings and capital add-ons {{to be determined by}} member states; and no obligatory consolidated capital position for bank-insurance companies. In other words, Banking Union will start out with capital rules that are more like Emmental cheese than a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook.</b> This is a huge encumbrance for a well-functioning Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and makes a single resolution mechanism impossible...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to study}} the ongoing {{construction}} of the European Banking Union through an analysis structured in three parts. First, it will describe {{the functioning of the}} Banking Union, focusing on each of its components: the <b>single</b> <b>rulebook,</b> the <b>Single</b> Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism and the harmonisation of national deposit insurance schemes. Second, it will consider the main legal challenges the European legislator had to deal with in the implementation of the project: the limits of the legal basis, the possible conflict between monetary and supervisory policy and the balance between independence and accountability. Lastly, the article will analyse how the Banking Union project can successfully be completed, while highlighting the need for a common fiscal backstop...|$|R

40|$|The {{rationales}} {{for the creation}} of the European Banking Union (“EBU”), what its objectives are and the main pillars of support for such a scheme, are worthy of investigation.   This article means to critically discuss the various elements of the EBU and determine whether the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism, the main pillars underpinning the structure, are robust enough to avert another debt crisis in Europe. At the EBU’s heart lies the <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook</b> (“SR”), which aims to counter the risk of fragmentation and nationalist tendencies. This inward looking trend became apparent in the recent financial crises, and contributed greatly to them. In an effort to avoid repeating the divisive and disjointed mistakes of the past, the SR is instead looking to provide unity and harmonisation across all participating member states...|$|R
50|$|Ysgarth is {{generally}} noted, both positively and negatively for the extreme detail of its game mechanics. It {{was one of}} the first roleplaying systems to rely heavily on skills and discard the idea of character classes and also one of the first games to rely solely on the use of 10 sided dice for percentile rolls in resolving actions. Ysgarth also emphasizes realistic combat resolvable in minute detail. Some have praised the mechanics as innovative and others have damned them as cumbersome. This issue of excessive mechanics is made more complex by the fact that each edition of Ysgarth featured fairly radical changes in the implementation of the basic rule concepts varying in their level of complexity. The 5th edition actually included three completely different versions of the mechanics in a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The main {{addition}} in the Regulation is the [...] "Single Rulebook", {{which aims}} to provide a single set of harmonised prudential rules which institutions throughout the EU must respect. The term <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook</b> was coined in 2009 by the European Council in order {{to refer to the}} aim of a unified regulatory framework for the EU financial sector that would complete the single market in financial services. This will ensure uniform application of Basel III in all Member States, it will close regulatory loopholes and will thus contribute to a more effective functioning of the Internal Market. The new rules remove a large number of national options and discretions from the CRD, and allow Member States to apply stricter requirements only where these are justified by national circumstances, needed on financial stability grounds or because of a bank's specific risk profile.|$|R
