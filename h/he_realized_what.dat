5|$|On 16 October 2010, Diarra was {{involved}} in a controversial dispute, which resulted in the player being banned from playing league football for six matches. After receiving a yellow card booking from referee Wilfriend Bien in the team's 1–0 win over Auxerre, Diarra responded by pushing the referee with both hands. He was immediately shown a red card and dismissed from the match. After walking off the field, Diarra turned back, walked over to Bien and apologized for the confrontation. After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> he did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches. Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1–1 draw with Lille.|$|E

500|$|The lodge's {{structure}} {{made it a}} stronghold. [...] The lodge, {{named after}} nearby Mount Asama, was a three-story wood and concrete edifice built {{into the side of}} the hill atop an exposed base of steel-reinforced concrete. [...] The upper floor was slightly larger than the two below, giving the lodge a mushroom appearance. [...] The building towered over the steep, snow-covered slopes below and the lodge's windows had heavy outer storm shutters. The building's maze-like floor plan and narrow staircases made it easy for the defenders to block off movement inside the building. [...] The radicals would spend most of their time on the uppermost floor, which contained a kitchen, dining room, tatami-mat sleeping room, and a commanding view of the surrounding valley and hills. The radicals placed large pieces of furniture and futon bedding around the doors and windows and secured them in place with wire. [...] When Muta's husband returned and saw the barricades <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> had happened and quickly notified police. [...] The police immediately set up roadblocks and surrounded the lodge to cut off any avenues of escape for the radicals inside.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{significant}} casualties of May 12, Grant was undeterred. He telegraphed to the Army's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, [...] "The enemy are obstinate {{and seemed to}} have found the last ditch." [...] He planned to reorient his lines and shift the center of potential action {{to the east of}} Spotsylvania, where he could renew the battle. He ordered the V and VI Corps to move behind the II Corps and take positions past the left flank of the IX Corps. On the night of May 13–14, the corps began a difficult march in heavy rain over treacherously muddy roads. Early on May 14, elements of the VI Corps occupied Myers Hill, which overlooked most of the Confederate line. Col. Emory Upton's brigade skirmished most of the day to retain possession of the high ground. Grant's command was too scattered and exhausted to undertake an assault against Spotsylvania Court House on May 14, which was unfortunate because Lee had left it practically undefended for most of the day. When <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> Grant was up to, Lee shifted some units from Anderson's First Corps to that area. Grant notified Washington that, having endured five days of almost continuous rain, his army could not resume offensive operations until they had 24 hours of dry weather.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{a common}} {{practice}} {{on the part of}} the Indian women to offer marriage and sometimes just sex in exchange for fur traders not trading with their rivals. Radisson described visiting one Ojibwa village in the spring of 1660 where during the welcoming ceremony: [...] "The women throw themselves backwards on the ground, thinking to give us tokens of friendship and wellcome [...] ". Radisson was initially confused by this gesture, but as the women started to engage in more overtly sexual behavior, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> was being offered. Radisson was informed by the village elders that he could have sex with any unmarried women in the village provided that he did not trade with the Dakota , who were the enemies of the Ojibwa at the time. Likewise, the fur trader Alexander Henry in visiting an Ojibwa village in what is now Manitoba in 1775 described the [...] "facility with which the women abandoned themselves to my Canadiens" [...] to such an extent that he believed it would cause violence as the Ojibwa men would become jealous, causing him to order his party to leave at once, though it is likely that the women were in fact acting with the approval of their menfolk. Henry claimed that he had leave at once out of the fear of violence from jealous Ojibwa men, but it seemed more likely that he was afraid that his French-Canadian voyageurs might enjoy themselves too much with the Ojibwa women at this one village and would not want to travel further west. The American historian Bruce White described the way in which the Ojibwa and the other Indian peoples sought to [...] "use sexual relations as a means of establishing long-term relationships between themselves and people from another society was a rational strategy, one that has been described in many parts of the world". One fur trader who married an Ojibwa woman himself described how the Ojibwa would initially shun a fur trader until they could give gauge his honesty and provided he proved himself an honest man, [...] "the chiefs would take together take their marriageable girls to his trading house and he was given the choice of the lot". If the fur trader married, the Ojibwa would trade with him as he became part of the community and if he refused to marry, then the Ojibwa would not trade with him as Ojibwa only traded with a man who [...] "took one of their women for his wife".|$|E
