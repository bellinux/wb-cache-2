50|$|In business, {{demurrage}} is a {{delay in}} delivery of a product via delivery truck. When a delay occurs with product delivery, the delivery party can elect to claim a no fault delay by submitting a <b>demurrage</b> <b>charge.</b> Criteria for allowable demurrage, payment conditions, and payment terms for demurrage are typically prenegotiated and accepted by the vendor via contract prior to conduct of business. Some vendors allow free no-cost time for limited hour(s) when demurrage occurs, others do not allow free time for delays. The <b>demurrage</b> <b>charge</b> is normally an hourly rate. Unforeseeable until delivery, costs of delays are sometimes separately invoiced from the cost of deliverable.|$|R

5000|$|Congress gave Pérez {{a mandate}} to rule by decree for 100 days - and then for a further 100 days. He also had a fiscal fortune in his hands such as no Venezuelan {{president}} ever had. And Pérez didn’t lose time to start spending it. He commissioned a report on government, which was prepared and carried out by Arnoldo Gabaldón. It contained a blueprint for further large scale bureaucratic expansion. Gabaldón himself was named to a super-ministry, which combined public works and communications. Since {{it was impossible to}} hire every Venezuelan, Pérez decreed that all public places should have bathroom attendants and that every elevator the country over should have an operator, although Venezuela had only had one or two hand-operated elevators before the Pérez Jiménez building euphoria. Contracts were handed out with abandon, and Venezuelans applauded with gusto. Pérez proclaimed that the oil wealth would not be squandered and founded a huge fund for [...] "productive investments". This fund was exhausted very quickly. Congress had surrendered its power of fiscal oversight, one of the historical bases of democracy. Corruption went up incalculably, and there was even a case in which Venezuela bought a meat-freezing ship named the Sierra Nevada, which was anchored to store part of the immense quantity of imports that were being handled. The commissioner's fee here was well known as well as its recipient, who was never even tried. Ferries were bought in Scandinavia for routes between Venezuelan and the offshore Dutch free ports. Their windows could not be opened, and they were not equipped for the Venezuelan heat. On any given day, one could see dozens of ships queuing to unload in all Venezuelan ports, which meant that <b>demurrage</b> <b>charges</b> were huge and were obviously passed on to consumers. But consumerism was the whole point of it all. The bolivar, Venezuela's currency, was so over-valued that almost anybody in Venezuela with a minimum of initiative could go to Miami and bring a suitcase-load of goods which were sold to customers, usually friends or neighbors. Even servant quarters were in the net of this informal import economy. In Miami, Venezuelans became known as [...] "gimme two" [...] (of anything, at any price).|$|E

40|$|The Data mining {{methods have}} a plenty of {{applications}} in various fields of engineering. The present application {{area is the}} Port operations and management. Conventionally port performance was assessed by the ship turnaround time, a marker of cargo handling efficiency. It is a time used up at port for transshipment of cargo and servicing. During the transshipment and servicing, delays were inevitable and occur predominantly; The major delay happening at port {{was due to the}} non-availability of trucks for evacuation of cargo from port wharf to the warehouses. Hence, modeling the delay occurrences in port operations had to be done, so as to control the ship’s turnaround time at the port to prevent additional <b>demurrage</b> <b>charges.</b> The objective of this paper was to study the variety of delays caused during the port processes and to model it using Data mining techniques...|$|E

50|$|The {{bill of lading}} {{sometimes}} {{contains a}} clause as to the shipowner's lien. Without any express provision for it, the shipowner has by common law a lien for freight. If it is desired to give the shipowner a lien for <b>demurrage</b> or other <b>charges,</b> it must be expressly provided for. The lien is {{the right of the}} shipowner to retain the goods carried until paid the freight <b>charges,</b> <b>demurrage,</b> or other <b>charge</b> for which a lien has been given. The lien may be waived, and ends with delivery of the goods, or by any dealing with the consignee inconsistent with a right of the shipowner to retain possession of the goods until payment has been made. The shipowner may preserve his lien by landing the goods and retaining them in his own warehouse, or by storing them in a public warehouse, subject to the conditions required by the Merchant Shipping Act (1894).|$|R

A descriptive survey design was used on freight forwarding firms. The researcher used purposive sampling to select firms for the study. Interview guides were used as data collection instruments. The study found out that; <b>demurrage</b> <b>charges</b> through delays, wars, loss from fire out breaks, piracy, damage and destruction of goods, sinking of vessels and fraud by employees in position of authority were the major factors hindering the success of this industry in facilitating imports and exports. The government should also make use of the latest technologies so as to increase the speed of clearing goods such that they reach their final point of consumption within the shortest possible time. The freight forwarding industry should also engage professionals who have adequate knowledge and experience in clearing of goods...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} demurrage policies and charges of selected shipping companies and terminal operators in the Lagos ports {{and the implications}} {{in the economy and}} shipping industry in Nigeria. It adopted the survey approach to gather data from the dominant container operators (carriers) and the terminal operators. Demurrage duration and categorization of the demurrage periods and charges for each period by the selected operators were collected and compared using the statistical tool of analysis of variance to determine if there are differences among the charges and charging systems. It was found that, significant differences do not exist in the average rate of <b>demurrage</b> <b>charges</b> per container per day among the shipping companies and terminal operators in Lagos seaports. The study also found that there is {{no significant difference in the}} average amount charged as demurrage among the shipping companies and terminal operators in the three differing periods of demurrage duration in Lagos ports, Nigeria. It was recommended among other things that, the Nigerian shippers’ council as the governmental body responsible for freight regulation and protection of shippers 2 ̆ 7 interest should by policy fix a uniform container demurrage rate for all terminal operators and carriers operating in Nigeria...|$|E

50|$|In some instances, the <b>demurrage</b> fee is <b>charged</b> by {{some sort}} of central authority, and is paid into a fund. The {{application}} of this fund varies widely among both historical and proposed systems. In some cases, {{it is used to}} pay the costs of administering the tax. If the currency in question is run by the government, the demurrage fee can contribute to general tax revenue; this parallels a proposed tax on the holding of bank deposits proposed by some economists. Other systems have been proposed which involve redistributing this pool equally to all users of the currency.|$|R
40|$|The ship-berth link {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} aspects to be managed at port operations. Until now, simulation models have considered the impact of queue priorities, such as size and type of ships, on waiting times. This research differentiates from previous studies not only by considering another variable - the demurrage cost for each type of ship -, but also by considering the possibility of different berth allocation policies. It reports on a simulation study on small Brazilian private container terminal, where different berth allocation policies and queue priorities have been tested. Results and further analyses conducted via MANOVA indicate that the demurrage cost ratio between large and small ships and the critical waiting time in queue, after which <b>demurrage</b> costs are <b>charged,</b> impact on the choice of most adequate combination of policies and priorities. The analysis presented in this paper may help port authorities in determining a more precise figure for total demurrage cost...|$|R
