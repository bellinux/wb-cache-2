5|$|The Commission, {{as part of}} its mandate, is {{responsible}} for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally. To this end, the war <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> commemorated by name on a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. War <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> commemorated uniformly and equally, irrespective of military or civil rank, race or creed.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} cairn {{was erected}} near {{the crash site}} by the regiment in 1987. A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010. The CNR has also raised a monument {{near the site of}} the disaster. The names of the military <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> inscribed in the Korea Book of Remembrance and are also on the Wall of Remembrance in Brampton, Ontario; they may also be found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery. Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E

50|$|She {{was born}} in Story City, Iowa {{and now lives in}} {{southern}} California. Her debut novel about a girl dealing with having overly large breasts, Unexpected Development, was published in 2004. She wrote a teen fiction series which contains the books <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> the New Black, <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> a State of Mind, and <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> so Last Year. <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> Just a Rumor was published in April 2011 and <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> Not an Option was published in July 2012. She is now writing the next two books in the series. She has also written Love in the Corner Pocket and The Comeback. Her books Bella Goes to Hollywood, Bright Lights for Bella (both part of the Star Sisterz series), and Figure in the Frost (part of the Knights of the Silver Dragon series) are written under the name Lana Perez.|$|R
50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, the Absoute (or {{absolution}} of the <b>dead)</b> <b>is</b> {{a symbolic}} ablution of the deceased's body following the Requiem Mass. While specific prayers are said, the coffin is incensed and sprinkled with holy water. The absolution of the <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> only performed in {{context of the}} Tridentine Mass. Following the Second Vatican Council, the absolution of the <b>dead</b> <b>was</b> removed from the funeral liturgy of the Mass of Paul VI.|$|R
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} <b>dead)</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|Arad has 22 synagogues, {{of which}} 11 are Ashkenazi, 9 are Sephardi, one is Yemenite, {{and one is}} Ethiopian. Both the central Ashkenazi and Sephardi synagogues {{are located in the}} Ye'elim neighborhood. There are Gerrer synagogues in Avishur and Halamish, and a Chabad synagogue in Ye'elim. There are two mikvehs in the city–in the Tlalim and Ayanot neighborhoods. The city also has a small Messianic {{community}} that is being accused of illegal missionary activities by the Haredim and certain right-wing groups. Arad's <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> mostly buried in the local cemetery, located in the northeastern outskirts of the city, close to the road to Masada.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war <b>dead,</b> <b>are</b> targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
2500|$|Offerings for the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> {{known to}} ancient Jewish {{practice}}, {{and it has}} been speculated that Christianity may have taken its similar practice from its Jewish heritage. [...] In Christianity, prayer for the <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> attested since at least the 2nd century, evidenced in part by the tomb inscription of Abercius, Bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia (d. c. 200). [...] Celebration of the Eucharist for the <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> attested to since at least the 3rd century.|$|R

5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of the <b>Dead</b> <b>are</b> found in hieratic script. The {{calligraphy}} {{is similar to that}} of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} that Brooks uses World War Z as a {{platform}} to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. At {{one point in the}} book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe the <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Above the course, zones {{four and}} five, as {{identified}} by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many {{of the figures}} survive and many {{have been identified in}} the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement. Although naked, some of the <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional version of the Shibuya {{shopping}} district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> brought to an alternate plane of existence called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other Reapers to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a marble column topped by a sculpture of Saint George slaying a dragon, an image Lutyens used on two other public war memorials. At the base of the column, the names of the village's war <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> inscribed on stone panels. The memorial is flanked by identical rubble walls in local stone, on top of which grows a yew hedge. Low stone benches protrude from the walls to allow wreaths to be laid. Additional panels were fixed to the wall after the Second World War to commemorate that conflict. The memorial was unveiled on 26 June 1921 by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, whose brother is among those commemorated on it. It is a grade II* listed building and since 2015 has been part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.|$|E
5|$|Zombiepowder. {{is set in}} a western-themed {{environment}} with inconsistent levels of technology, similar to that found in Yasuhiro Nightow's manga series, Trigun. The most prominent characters in the series are powder hunters, individuals who seek the titular zombie powder. The zombie powder is a life-giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force, grant them immortality, and even raise people from the dead. Zombie powder can only be obtained from the Rings of the Dead. These rings are dangerous magical artifacts that, individually, devour the life force of anyone they touch, rendering them comatose. This stolen life energy is converted into the zombie powder, which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of the <b>Dead</b> <b>are</b> brought together.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that the}} {{differentiation}} between [...] "nature" [...] and [...] "state" [...] makes sense {{when talking about}} the states of life and death: Él está vivo (He is alive), Él está muerto (He <b>is</b> <b>dead).</b> Estar <b>is</b> used for both alive and <b>dead,</b> since they <b>are</b> both states, although being <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> considered a permanent state.|$|R

5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} {{by all of}} his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him how}} he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo You Love Her Coz She's <b>Dead</b> <b>are</b> playing, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.|$|E
