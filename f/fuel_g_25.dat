40|$|The {{increasing}} environmental concern, {{the demographic}} {{and economic growth}} of the emerging economies and the progressive reduction in the world reserves of crude oil forced the transportation sector to consider the use of alternative fuels (natural gas and hydrogen enriched methane) and renewable sources (bio-gases). The processes employed for biogas production are responsible for blends made up by different percentages of methane, CO, H 2 and inert gases. Such a variety results into {{a wide range of}} heating values as well as chemical and physical properties and inevitably affects the engine combustion process and performance.

40|$|Pharmacological {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the choline analog <b>G</b> <b>25</b> is a potent inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum growth in vitro and in vivo. Although choline transport has been suggested to be the target of <b>G</b> <b>25,</b> the exact mode of action of this compound is not known. Here we show that, similar to its effects on P. falciparum, <b>G</b> <b>25</b> prevents choline entry into Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and inhibits S. cerevisiae growth. However, we show that the uptake of this compound is not mediated by the choline carrier Hnm 1. An hnm 1 Δ yeast mutant, which lacks the only choline transporter gene HNM 1, was not altered in the transport of a labeled analog of this compound. Eleven yeast mutants lacking genes involved in different steps of phospholipid biosynthesis were analyzed for their sensitivity to <b>G</b> <b>25.</b> Four mutants affected in the de novo cytidyldiphosphate-choline-dependent phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway and, surprisingly, a mutant strain lacking the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase-encoding gene PSD 1 (but not PSD 2) were found to be highly resistant to this compound. Based on these data for S. cerevisiae, labeling studies in P. falciparum were performed to examine the effect of <b>G</b> <b>25</b> on the biosynthetic pathways of the major phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Labeling studies in P. falciparum and in vitro studies with recombinant P. falciparum phosphatidylserine decarboxylase further supported the inhibition of both the de novo phosphatidylcholine metabolic pathway and the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine from phosphatidylserine.

For x < x 0, we show that while the appearance of the spin glass state at low temperatures is dependent on the relative signs of the exchange interaction, the details of the phase boundaries are controlled by the relative strength of the exchange interactions.

An ∼ 0. 4 ^∘ diameter sub-region of one has a photon index of Γ = 1. 53 ± 0. 15; and is spatially coincident with HESS J 1837 - 069, likely a pulsar wind nebula. The other parts of the extended sources have a photon index of Γ = 2. 1 ± 0. 2 without significant spectral curvature. Given their spatial and spectral properties, they have no clear associations with sources at other wavelengths. Their γ-ray properties are similar to those of the Cygnus cocoon SFR, the only firmly established γ-ray detection of an SFR in the Galaxy.

40|$|Two {{strains of}} Ixodes spirochetes, one {{isolated}} in the United States (B 31) {{and the other in}} Sweden (<b>G</b> <b>25),</b> were examined by electron microscopy. Cells of strain <b>G</b> <b>25</b> were 11 - 25 Am long with a wavelength of 2. 1 - 2. 4 Am and an amplitude of 0. 4 Am. Eleven flagella were inserted subterminally {{at each end of the}} cell. Cells of strain B 31 were similar but had eleven or seven flagella. Cytoplasmic tubules were not seen in cells of either strain. Although not identical, both strains showed ultrastructural details characteristic of the genus Borrelia. Spirochetes can be grouped according to morphological characteristics [3], and the ultrastructure, as seen by electron microscopy, is of value in determining the genus and species of a particular spirochete [3, 6]. In the present study two strains of Ixodes spirochetes, one {{isolated in the}} United States and the other in Sweden, were studied. These preliminary results suggest that the strains are similar and belong to the genus Borrelia. MATERIALS AND METHODS The two isolates examined were strain <b>G</b> <b>25</b> Danderyd, which was recovered in Sweden in 1982 from the tick Ixodes ricinus by B.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a sobrevida e complicações associadas à prematuridade em recém-nascidos com menos de 32 semanas. MÉTODOS: Estudo prospectivo do tipo coorte. Foram incluídos os nascidos vivos, com idade gestacional entre 25 semanas e 31 semanas e 6 dias, sem anomalias congênitas admitidos em UTI Neonatal, entre 1 º de agosto de 2009 e 31 de outubro de 2010. Os recém-nascidos foram estratificados em três grupos: <b>G</b> <b>25,</b> 25 a 27 semanas e 6 dias; G 28, 28 a 29 semanas e 6 dias; G 30, 30 a 31 semanas e 6 dias, e acompanhados até 28 dias. Foram avaliadas a sobrevida aos 28 dias e a morbidade associadas à prematuridade. Para análise dos resultados, utilizou-se o teste do c², análise de variância, teste de Kruskal-Wallis, razão de risco com intervalo de confiança (IC) e regressão logística múltipla, com significância em 5 %. RESULTADOS: A coorte compreendeu 198 prematuros, sendo <b>G</b> <b>25</b> = 59, <b>G</b> 28 = 43 e G 30 = 96. O risco de óbito foi significativamente maior em <b>G</b> <b>25</b> e <b>G</b> 28, em relação ao G 30 (RR= 4, 1; IC 95 % 2, 2 - 7, 6 e RR= 2, 8; IC 95 % 1, 4 - 5, 7). A sobrevida encontrada foi, respectivamente, 52, 5, 67, 4 e 88, 5 %. A partir da 26 ª semana e peso > 700 g, a sobrevida foi {{superior}} a 50 %. A morbidade foi inversamente proporcional à idade gestacional, exceto para enterocolite necrosante e leucomalácia, que não diferiram entre os grupos. A análise de regressão logística mostrou que a hemorragia pulmonar (OR= 3, 3; IC 95 % 1, 4 - 7, 9) e a síndrome do desconforto respiratório (OR= 2, 5; IC 95 % 1, 1 - 6, 1) foram fatores independentes de risco para óbito. Houve predomínio das lesões cerebrais hemorrágicas graves em <b>G</b> <b>25.</b> CONCLUSÕES: Sobrevivência superior a 50 % ocorreu a partir da 26 ª semana de gravidez e peso > 700 g. A hemorragia pulmonar e a síndrome do desconforto respiratório foram preditores independentes de óbito. Há necessidade de identificar e instituir práticas para melhorar a sobrevida de prematuros extremos. PURPOSE: To {{evaluate the}} survival and complications associated with prematurity of infants {{with less than}} 32 weeks of gestation. METHODS: It was done a prospective cohort study. All preterm infants with a gestational age between 25 and 31 weeks and 6 days, born alive without congenital anomalies and admitted to the NICU between August 1 st, 2009 and October 31 st, 2010 were included. Newborns were stratified into three groups: <b>G</b> <b>25,</b> 25 to 27 weeks and 6 days; G 28, 28 to 29 weeks and 6 days; G 30, 30 to 31 weeks and 6 days, and they were followed up to 28 days. Survival at 28 days and complications associated with prematurity were evaluated. Data were analyzed statistically by c² test, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, odds ratio with confidence interval (CI) and multiple logistic regression, with significance set at 5 %. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 198 preterm infants (<b>G</b> <b>25</b> = 59, <b>G</b> 28 = 43 and G 30 = 96). The risk of death was significantly higher in <b>G</b> <b>25</b> and <b>G</b> 28 compared to G 30 (RR= 4. 14, 95 %CI 2. 23 - 7. 68 and RR= 2. 84, 95 %CI: 1. 41 - 5. 74). Survival was 52. 5 %, 67. 4 % and 88. 5 %, respectively. Survival was greater than 50 % in preterm > 26 weeks and birth weight > 700 g. Neonatal morbidity was inversely proportional to gestational age, except for necrotizing enterocolitis and leukomalacia, which did not differ among groups. Logistic regression showed that pulmonary hemorrhage (OR= 3. 3, 95 %CI 1. 4 - 7. 9) and respiratory distress syndrome (OR= 2. 5, 95 %CI 1. 1 - 6. 1) were independent risk factors for death. There was a predominance of severe hemorrhagic brain lesions in <b>G</b> <b>25.</b> CONCLUSION: Survival above 50 % occurred in infants with a gestational age of more than 26 weeks and > 700 g birth weight. Pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory distress syndrome were independent predictors of neonatal death. It is necessary to identify the best practices to improve the survival of extreme preterm infants...|$|R
