500|$|In Japanese, [...] means [...] "clump" [...] or [...] "clod" [...] and Damashii is the rendaku form of [...] {{which means}} [...] "soul" [...] or [...] "spirit". Therefore, the phrase approximates to [...] "clump soul". The two kanji {{that form the}} name look similar (sharing the same right-side element [...] ), {{in a kind of}} visual alliteration. The name is officially transliterated as Katamari Damacy in most releases.

500|$|Diane Warren wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] in 1995. When {{asked about}} her songwriting process, she said that songs usually come to her from a title, a chorus, or a drum beat. [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it popped <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and I thought, 'I don't think I've heard that before, that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, {{because that was the}} way she heard it. She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, West {{received}} a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 {{he dropped out of}} college to pursue his musical dreams. This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, [...] "It was drummed <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing critical reception. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{called the}} episode [...] "one {{of the most}} intense things I've seen in ages." [...] She specifically cited the final flashback as noteworthy, noting that [...] "The final scene, where Marceline and Ice King have this weird duet, made me lose my shit and keeps popping <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into your brain like that, but especially a kid's cartoon." [...] She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the [...] "immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War" [...] and allowed the viewers to see [...] "the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss {{of the end of}} the entire world" [...] following the war.|$|E
500|$|By now Blenheim {{was under}} assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had {{happened}} on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off. Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – [...] "...it came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to beat parley", he later wrote, [...] "which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms." [...] Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, {{it was not until}} 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.|$|E
500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E

500|$|In early 1989, Zomba asked Dickinson {{to produce}} a track for the movie , {{providing}} a budget, a studio, and a producer, Chris Tsangarides. Dickinson took up the opportunity and called {{an old friend of}} his, former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had [...] "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter" [...] ready for the studio, then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio. [...] "I wrote it in about three minutes", states Dickinson, [...] "I don't know where the title 'Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter' came from, but it just popped <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I thought, 'Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!' And I thought, Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, that'll do.' Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well. With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson's solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990, followed by a supporting tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Gold Coat" [...] was Chinese Nü Yrs lead single, {{released}} on 7 October 2015. Six days later, the label Brainfeeder announced they would release the EP on 30 October 2015. Two {{days before the}} release of the EP, [...] the music blog Pigeons & Planes premiered [...] "Xiangjiao". Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked really weird and for some reason the word Chinese New Year came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E
500|$|The book, {{which was}} Rowling's debut novel, was written between {{approximately}} June 1990 and {{some time in}} 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, [...] "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head...</b> A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy {{became more and more}} of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." [...] Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to an agent and a publisher, and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book, and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was [...] "so much better than anything else".|$|E

[...] Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men [...] "to the prisoner Wells's house" [...] at about 4am on the morning of 2January. [...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E

Instead, I immediately focused on a much more recent obsession: Chrismukkah. Created by The O.C.s Seth Cohen ...." [...] The reviewer continued, saying that [...] "A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes, but it's a sadness that begs to be redeemed {{by the end of the}} hour. Chrismukkah is really about traditional Christmas togetherness and your standard happy ending; it's the everyday miracle of people coming together to create something magical." ...|$|E
