While the plan is under way Homer decides to stay in the Springfield Retirement Castle with his father, posing as {{resident}} Cornelius Talmidge. Homer enjoys his stay at the home immensely, until the real Cornelius returns, at which point he flees. He returns home and gets <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Marge.

25|$|As {{the seventh}} season begins in September 1986, Blake stops short of killing Alexis, {{whom he had}} been {{strangling}} in the previous season's cliffhanger, after learning she had bought his mansion and was evicting him and Krystle. Claudia has died in the fire she set, and Amanda (now played by Karen Cellini) is rescued by a returning Michael Culhane, Blake's chauffeur from the first season. Blake turns the tables on Ben and Alexis and recovers his wealth, but loses his memory after an oil rig explosion. Alexis finds Blake and, with everyone believing he is dead, perpetuates the belief {{that they are still}} married. Living with a clean slate, Alexis finds herself softening to Blake but ultimately tells him the truth as he reunites with Krystle. Krystina receives a heart transplant but is later temporarily kidnapped by Sarah Curtis (Cassie Yates), the mother of the dead girl from whom Krystina received her new heart; Sammy Jo's marriage to Clay crumbles and she falls <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Steven; Amanda leaves town; and Ben's daughter Leslie (Terri Garber) arrives. Adam's season-long romance with Blake's secretary Dana Waring (Leann Hunley) culminates in a wedding, which is punctuated in the May 6, 1987 season finale by Alexis's car plunging off a bridge into a river and the violent return of a vengeful Matthew Blaisdel. Although the first episode of season seven premiered with a high Nielsen rating of a 20.1, the competition with Magnum, P.I., now in the same time slot, and the constant storyline changes led to Dynasty falling out of the top 20 to #25.|$|E

NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E
500|$|Nick Keppler, {{writing for}} Nerve.com, listed [...] "The Host" [...] {{as one of}} the [...] "gayest" [...] episodes of the {{franchise}} and described the twist {{at the end of the}} episode with the gender of Odan's new host as [...] "sapphic". He criticised the reaction of Crusher at the end of the episode, saying that she would [...] "get <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> shifty aliens with weird ridged foreheads but for some reason draws the line at space ladies". Zack Handlen gave the episode a rating of B+ in his review for The A.V. Club, saying that the idea at the core of the episode was better than the execution. But he said that the ending made [...] "perfect sense" [...] as he said that love wasn't solely spirtual but that [...] "we fall in love with features, with shapes, with bodies, as well as with minds." [...] He added that Odan's reaction was also right, as [...] "everyone has a line, and if you love them, you won't ask them to cross it." ...|$|E
500|$|In the pilot, Monica is dumped almost {{immediately}} after sleeping with her new date Paul {{on the night of}} their first date. Monica is tricked <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him after Paul lies to her about his sex life, falsely alleging that he has not slept with anyone {{in the two years since}} his wife left him. At first, NBC executives worried that audiences would react to Monica's role unfavorably, thus they decided to survey the studio audience and ask them whether or not they thought that having Monica sleep with someone on their first date made her character too promiscuous. Don Ohlmeyer, then-president of NBC's west coast division, was particularly adamant about his stance against Monica's role in the pilot, which he considered [...] "casual sex", and created a [...] "stacked" [...] questionnaire asking audience members if they thought Monica was a whore. Kauffman recalled Ohlmeyer specifically expressing that Monica deserved to be dumped, a statement by which the writer was greatly offended, dismissing Ohlmeyer as a misogynist. Ultimately, the results returned in favor of Monica; audiences liked the character nonetheless, and the episode aired unchanged.|$|E

500|$|Jennifer Salke, the {{president}} of the entertainment division of NBC, encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after the cancellation of Lone Star. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. Korman was so impressed by the script that, though it was after midnight, he went into the room where his sick wife was sleeping, and got <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her. Korman phoned Salke, and stated that the script was [...] "remarkable", and praised Killen claiming that [...] "for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life", he is [...] "making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it successfully made its way into the lower executive branches of the company, the script was declined by entertainment president Kevin Reilly, who felt apprehensive upon reading it. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with cable television networks. Newman believed that it should be a network show, and did not accept that the difference between cable and network dramas was their degree of intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} themes in How the García Girls Lost Their Accents is that of the fragmented concept of the self. The fragmentation of one's personal identity is a serious issue suffered by all four García girls throughout the course of the novel. Their immigration has left them as multiple beings, torn between their Dominican and American identities. As a college student, Yolanda encounters a boy named Rudy Elmenhurst, who is relentless in his attempts to pressure her <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him. [...] When he can bear frustration no longer, Rudy lashes out and ends their relationship, leaving Yolanda devastated and hoping for his return. The inner turmoil evoked in Yolanda by this traumatic episode is evident through her realization of [...] "what a cold lonely life awaited [...] in this country. [...] would never find someone who would understand [...] peculiar mix of Catholicism and agnosticism, Hispanic and American styles". Julie Barak, of Mesa State College, has described this passage as a poignant and elegant reprisal of the recurrent sense of being divided selves and speaking divided languages found throughout the majority of the text.|$|E

[...] They later said Mercedes is invincible, as [...] "no matter evils she perpetrates, somehow she still manages to come out smelling of roses". Hollyoaks international broadcaster BBC America has described Mercedes stating: [...] "Cocky, confident, and mean with a right hook, Mercedes McQueen isn't afraid of anyone, especially not a man. She knows what effects her assets have on the opposite sex, and she always gets what she wants". What's on TV described her as the [...] "man-eater of the McQueen clan" [...] who will not [...] "take any nonsense" [...] and is not [...] "shy {{when it comes to a}} scrap!" [...] Digital Spy described Mercedes as [...] "known for her fiery temper and sharp tongue". Mercedes has also been described as [...] "mouthy", a [...] "minx", a [...] "bitchy maneater", [...] "feisty", [...] "troubled", [...] "gorgeous", a [...] "sultry siren" [...] and [...] "spirited" [...] by various media sources.|$|E

500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E

The story involves several hunters in Morgan County who play a prank on an Irishman who had invited himself into their camp. The story relies on Irish stereotypes common at the time. In [...] "A Sleep-Walking Incident," [...] also published in 1846, Harris claimed to have once spent the night with a farm family in northeastern Tennessee, during which he sleep-walked his way <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> the farmers' daughters.

But, as the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford to move to better surroundings, first to Beckenham and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of Hersham. The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews' maternal grandmother had served as a maid.|$|E

The Prince's thoughts vacillate between anticipation and guilt, between disgust with his wife (who crosses herself whenever they make love) and admiration of her prudery. Two hours later, his thoughts run a similar course, {{with the addition of a}} kind of disgusted satisfaction with the prostitute and a satisfied disgust with his own body.

Jules' best friend and neighbor Ellie tries to prevent her from going out while her son is constantly being embarrassed by both of his parents. The show was originally about older women ("cougars") dating younger men, as Jules begins dating Josh (Nick Zano) and Barb is often seen [...] "hunting".

[...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature.
