25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild water buffalo, <b>Indian</b> <b>hog</b> deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, barasingha, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{species of}} large mammal {{occur in the}} delta, but their populations are small and scattered, with the {{possible}} exceptions of the Malayan sambar deer (Cervus unicolor equinus), <b>Indian</b> <b>hog</b> deer (C. porcinus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa), which have been reported from all Reserved Forests.

50|$|A mature hog deer stag stands about 70 cm at the {{shoulder}} and weighs approximately 50 kg while hinds are much smaller, standing about 61 cm and weighing {{in the vicinity of}} 30 kg. They are very solidly built with a long body and relatively short legs and the line of the back slopes upward from {{the shoulder}}s to a high rump. The ears are rounded; older animals tend to become light coloured in the face and neck.The <b>Indian</b> <b>Hog</b> Deer's coat is quite thick and generally a uniform dark-brown in winter except for the underparts of the body and legs which are lighter in colour. During late spring, the change to a summer coat of rich reddish brown commences although this may vary between individuals. Many hog deer show a dark dorsal stripe extending from the head down {{the back of the neck}} and along the spine. In summer, there is usually a uniform row of light-coloured spots along either side of the dorsal stripe from the shoulders to the rump. The tail is fairly short and brown but tipped with white. The underside of the tail is white and the deer can fan the white hairs out in a distinctive alarm display.|$|E
50|$|Kaziranga {{is one of}} the few wild {{breeding}} areas outside Africa {{for multiple}} species of large cats, such as Bengal tigers and leopards. Kaziranga was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 and has the highest density of tigers in the world (one per five km2), with a population of 118, according to the latest census.

50|$|Mehrano Wildlife Sanctuary is an {{enhanced}} riverine forest privately preserved by the Talpur Mir royal family of Khairpur Princely state with endorsement by the Sindh wildlife department. It comprises agricultural land, forest, and hunting area and {{is home to}} various flora and fauna.Mehrano Forest is the home to approximately 4,000 big game animals, including blackbuck, <b>Indian</b> gazelle, <b>hog</b> deer, wild boar. Additionally the forest lake boasts resident and migratory birds from Siberia and Europe. There is a reserved place for Tourist to see furious wild boars, which are called upon in a unique way by the caretaker, who wears an orange Russian cap. H. H. Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur II, head of the royal house, has forbidden all hunting except of the jackal and an annual culling of wild boars which become a mortal threat to adjacent farmers and their families when boar population becomes too large for the forest to hold. The Mehrano reserve shares its boundary with the Cholistan desert.|$|R
25|$|The Indian {{trade was}} {{generally}} an exchange between the colonies and Native Americans of the commodities each party desired {{but did not}} produce. The company was a major buyer from the <b>Indians</b> of <b>hogs</b> and cattle: either live on the hoof, as smoked or salted meat, or as skins. It also purchased indigo plants, hides, furs, corn, cattle, tallow, pitch, tar, hickory nut oil, tobacco, myrtle wax, salted wild beef, sassafras, canes and truck produce in exchange for weapons, gunpowder, tools, cloths, dyes, liquor, and various trinkets. Packhorse trains were outfitted with European-made goods—primarily guns, powder, flint, rum, and various dry goods—at Pensacola and the company's other warehouses, then sent to Indian villages in the interior, from which they returned with deerskins, furs, bear oil, honey, and foodstuffs. The company's agents ran stores in Indian villages scattered from the St. Johns River in East Florida to the Mississippi, and from the Gulf coast to Tennessee. The depot at Pensacola comprised a store and warehouses where the furs and skins were sorted and packed for shipment to foreign markets in schooners or brigantines belonging to the firm's fleet of fifteen vessels.|$|R
50|$|Some of the non-threatened mammal species {{includes}} the nilgai, red fox and wild boar, bird species of Alexandrine parakeet, barn owl, black kite, myna, hoopoe, Indian peafowl, Indian leopard, red-vented bulbul, rock pigeon, shelduck and shikra, reptile species of Indian cobra, Indian star tortoise, Sindh krait and yellow monitor and amphibian species of Indus Valley bullfrog and Indus Valley toad. Some of the threatened mammal species include the axis deer, <b>Indian</b> elephants, blackbuck, <b>hog</b> deer, dholes, Punjab urial and Sindh ibex, bird species of white-backed vulture and reptile species of {{black pond turtle}} and gharial. Grey partridge {{is one of the}} few birds that can be found in the Cholistan desert. The Tharparkar desert supports a fair population of the chinkara. The Indian wild ass migrates from the Indian part of the Great Rann of Kutch to the part in Pakistan in search of food. Wild boar numbers have increased because of the immunity they enjoy in a Muslim society that forbids its consumption by humans.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The sclera {{maintains}} {{and protects}} the eye ball, which receives visual inputs. Although the sclera does not {{contribute significantly to}} visual perception, scleral diseases such as refractory scleritis, scleral perforation and pathological myopia are considered incurable or difficult to cure. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify characteristics of the human sclera as one of the connective tissues derived from the neural crest and mesoderm. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have demonstrated microarray data of cultured human infant scleral cells. Hierarchical clustering was performed to group scleral cells and other mesenchymal cells into subcategories. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed similarity between scleral cells and auricular cartilage-derived cells. Cultured micromasses of scleral cells exposed to TGF-betas and BMP 2 produced an abundant matrix. The expression of cartilage-associated genes, such as <b>Indian</b> hedge <b>hog,</b> type X collagen, and MMP 13, was up-regulated within 3 weeks in vitro. These results suggest that human 'sclera'-derived cells can be considered chondrocytes when cultured ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our present study shows a chondrogenic potential of human sclera. Interestingly, the sclera of certain vertebrates, such as birds and fish, is composed of hyaline cartilage. Although the human sclera is not a cartilaginous tissue, the human sclera maintains chondrogenic potential throughout evolution. In addition, our findings directly explain an enigma that the sclera and the joint cartilage are common targets of inflammatory cells in rheumatic arthritis. The present global gene expression database will contribute to the clarification of the pathogenesis of developmental diseases such as high myopia...|$|R
5000|$|Following the Indian {{surrender}} {{at the end}} of the Great Sioux War of 1876, the Cheyennes were forcibly {{deported to}} reservations in Oklahoma. There they found that the hunting grounds they had been allocated were devoid of the large game they needed to survive, and the supplies promised by the U.S. government failed to arrive, or were stolen by the Indian agents. Facing starvation, chiefs Dull Knife and Little Wolf in 1878 led the Northern Cheyenne on an epic fighting journey back to their homeland in Montana, more than a thousand miles away. [...] Porcupine took part in this Northern Cheyenne Exodus. [...] Dull Knife surrendered at Fort Robinson in Nebraska. His band was imprisoned there and denied food and heating (with temperature well below freezing) for not agreeing to return to Oklahoma. Nearly half were killed (but not Dull Knife himself) in a desperate escape from Fort Robinson. Little Wolf surrendered in March 1879 at Fort Keogh in Montana. Little Wolf's band was permitted to stay and Dull Knife then joined them there.A number of Kansas settlers had been killed during the Indians' journey north. There were calls to put the whole band of Cheyenne on trial as a group, but this had dubious legal standing. As a compromise, the military sent seven <b>Indians,</b> Wild <b>Hog,</b> a war chief of the Northern Cheyenne Elk warrior society, Porcupine, and five others (Old Crow, Tangled Hair, Blacksmith, Noisy Walker, and Strong Left Hand) for trial in a civilian court for these killings. A number of items taken from homes in Kansas had been found in the Indians' possession. They were sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas at the beginning of 1879 to await trial. They were to be tried in Dodge City and were escorted there by lawman Bat Masterson. It was not an easy journey; large, sometimes unruly, crowds turned out to view the Indians. In Lawrence, Masterson found it necessary to hit the city marshal to keep order. The trial began in Dodge City on 24 June. The defence lawyer successfully argued that local prejudice would prevent a fair trial in Dodge City and requested the trial be moved to Lawrence, a request that was granted. [...] The defence built a case intended to expose the iniquities of the reservation system. They intended to embarrass Washington, and had issued subpoenas for, amongst others, General Nelson Miles, General John Pope, and Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz. Meanwhile, the prosecution was having problems persuading witnesses to make the long journey to Lawrence. When the chief prosecutor failed to turn up on 13 October, all charges were dismissed.|$|R
