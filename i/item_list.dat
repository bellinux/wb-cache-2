50|$|In the 2nd {{edition of}} AD&D, each normal magic item again has an {{experience}} value, which {{is given to}} the player character for successfully finding or creating it. This edition has a similar <b>item</b> <b>list</b> to that of 1st edition, although the second edition core rules include many of the items that were introduced in the first edition rulebook Unearthed Arcana.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{improvements}} to this game. The player no longer {{needs to take}} rations, allowing the player to explore the map longer before returning to a town. When {{a piece of equipment}} is equipped, it will show up on the equipment list, freeing up the space so that another item can be carried. One space in the <b>item</b> <b>list</b> can carry up to nine of the same item.|$|E
5000|$|In Winter of 2010, it was {{revealed}} that MUNSU executive pre 2010 had claimed car repair payments and the like as executive expenses hidden within their budgets.

50|$|A {{secondary}} {{definition of}} Content design {{is the creation}} of any aspect of the game that is not required for the game to function properly and meet the minimum viable product standard. In essence, content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value. An example of this is the <b>item</b> <b>list</b> from Final Fantasy. None of the items are necessary for the game to function, but they add value and complexity to the game as a whole.|$|E
50|$|The Moldvay Basic Set revises the <b>item</b> <b>list,</b> {{removing}} {{such things}} as the now-useless Troll Slayer (trolls did not appear till the Expert Set in this version). Cursed armor now raises the wearer's AC to 9 (the same as an unarmored human in the Basic game), rather than having a fixed negative enchantment. The cursed sword is still -1. In addition, cursed swords add their enchantment to both hit rolls and damage, as in the Advanced game; the old Basic set followed the Original rules in this regard.|$|E

5000|$|The word slots {{are chosen}} to be as culture- and borrowing- free as possible. The {{original}} Swadesh lists are most commonly used but many others have been devised for particular purposes. Often these are shorter than Swadesh's preferred 100 <b>item</b> <b>list.</b> Kessler {{has written a book}} on [...] "The Significance of Word Lists [...] while McMahon and McMahon carried out studies on the effects of reconstructability and retentiveness. The effect of increasing the number of slots has been studied and a law of diminishing returns found, with about 80 being found satisfactory. However some studies have used less than half this number.|$|E
50|$|By {{completing}} quests and defeating bosses, {{the player}} gains access to various weapons, spells, mounts, {{and pieces of}} armor which may aid them on their adventures. The items they equip are displayed on their avatars. Some of the items gained {{can be used in}} the Craft where you complete Crafting Recipes. Clicking on the Craft or Collect buttons will show you what items you have accumulated. Once one of every item is collected, you can click on the blue Craft or Create arrows to gain your prize; which will help you in future quests. Weapons and armor can be dragged and dropped from the <b>item</b> <b>list</b> to the avatar. Make sure you check your quests to see if certain weapons or armor are needed for future quests. If not, you may sell them at the Bazaar. Players can also obtain items that can't be purchased in the Bazaar by receiving gifts from other players, or by gaining Planet Coins; which can be purchased or won by completing offers or surveys.|$|E
5000|$|Dice and Light-Williams {{took the}} {{opportunity}} to establish some unique style to their localization efforts for Recettear. They modified the original Japanese script to replace some of the unique aspects of Japanese to ones that made more sense in Western regions. For example, as the game is set in a seemingly European village, the original script's mention of rice and tofu felt out of place, and Carpe Fulgur replaced these with more appropriate foods. They also modified Recette's repetitive use of the word [...] "yatta", a Japanese expression similar to [...] "yay" [...] in English, with variations on the word [...] "yay", like [...] "Yayifications!", or other made-up affirmations, such as [...] "Yeperoni!". Much of the time in translation was taken by the <b>item</b> <b>list,</b> and specifically the addition of plural nouns which do not exist in the Japanese language. Dice was initially worried that some changes to the general script necessitated by localization would be criticized, but found after release that their resulting script was well received. Dice admits that they did not fully explain the keyboard control well enough (such as the [...] "Z" [...] key being the default action key for most dōjin soft games but uncommon in Western titles), and believes that some possibles were lost because of this.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{bankruptcy}} prediction models developed {{so far have}} in common that {{they are based on}} quantitative data or more precisely financial ratios. However, useful information can be lost when disregarding soft information. In this work, we develop an automated content analysis technique to assess {{the bankruptcy}} risk of companies using XBRL tags. We develop a list of potential red flags based on the U. S. GAAP taxonomy and assign the elements to 2 categories and 7 subcategories. Then we test our red flag <b>item</b> <b>list</b> based on U. S. GAAP annual reports of 26 companies with Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings and a control group. The empirical results show that in total, the red flag <b>item</b> <b>list</b> has predictive power of bankruptcy risk. Logistic regression results also show that the predictive power increases the nearer the bankruptcy filing date approaches. We furthermore observe that the category 2 red flags (bankruptcy characteristics and influencing factors) have higher discriminatory power than category 1 red flags (earnings management indicators) for one year before the bankruptcy filing date. This difference narrows for two years before the bankruptcy filing date and may turn in favor of category 1 red flags for three years before the bankruptcy filing date...|$|E

In this paper, we present absolute worst-case analysis for on-line algorithms. Then we consider an related problem: how to design k different bin sizes such that for any <b>item</b> <b>list</b> the waste space of bins used is minimized. A best possible off-line algorithm is showed for arbitrary k and a best possible on-line algorithm is derived for any fixed number k...|$|E

Under this format, distractors from several items are pooled into a single list which appears {{at the end of}} the test. The examinees are asked to match one correct answer to each of the items in the test. An experiment is described in which the lengths of the <b>item</b> <b>list</b> and the distractor pool were manipulated. It is shown that construction of MM tests is technically feasible and that these tests achieve satisfactory results in terms of reliability, validity, and reduction of random guessing...|$|E
