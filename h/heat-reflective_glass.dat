5000|$|Thermique Technologies is {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of Engineered Glass Products (EGP), {{which was founded}} in 1947 in Chicago. EGP is best known for manufacturing <b>heat-reflective</b> <b>glass</b> panels for use in high-temperature home appliances such as self-cleaning ovens. In 2002, EGP introduced a glass panel that not only reflected heat but also generated it. These glass panels {{could be used as a}} heating element in home appliances and other commercial applications. EGP marketed these glass panels under the brand name [...] "Thermique heated glass". The first commercial use of Thermique heated glass was in a display case for warm foods. In 2005, EGP introduced a towel warmer with a glass heating element called the Thermique Towel Warmer. That same year, EGP became the first company to earn UL approval to manufacture a heated glass pane for architectural window units. In 2006, EGP created Thermique Technologies as a separate entity in charge of its heated glass products and product development. EGP also continues to manufacture <b>heat-reflective</b> <b>glass</b> under another subsidiary, Marsco Glass Products.|$|E
40|$|A highly {{reflective}} {{insulating material}} developed to protect NASA spacecraft from intense solar radiation {{is now being}} used in a commercially-available window-insulating product which offers significant energy savings. Called Nunsun, it is a thin metallized film adhesively bonded to windows of homes, office buildings, schools, industrial plants and other facilities; the film reflects the sun's heat and glare outward, thereby cutting down on energy costs for cooling. Trained dealer personnel can affix the film to windows of any size in minutes (right), converting ordinary <b>glass</b> to <b>heat-reflective</b> mirror <b>glass</b> {{at a fraction of}} the cost. Manufactured by National Metallizing, a division of Standard Packaging Corporation, Cranbury, New Jersey, Nunsun is also available in windowshade form...|$|R
