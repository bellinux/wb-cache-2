40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that {{changes over time}} in cognitive performance are associated with changes in driver perceptions, attitudes and self-regulatory behaviors among older adults. Healthy older adults (n= 928) underwent cognitive assessments at baseline with two subsequent annual follow-ups, and completed scales regarding their perceptions, attitudes and driving behaviours. Multivariate analysis showed small but statistically significant relationships between the cognitive tests and self-report measures, with the largest magnitudes between scores on the Trails B (seconds), perceptions of <b>driving</b> <b>abilities</b> (β=- 0. 32) and, situational driving avoidance (β= 0. 55), and (p< 0. 05).

A study assessing driving skills of sedative hypnotic users found the users of nitrazepam to be significantly impaired up to 17 hours after dosing, whereas users of temazepam did not show significant impairments of <b>driving</b> <b>ability.</b> These results reflect the long-acting nature of nitrazepam.|$|E
25|$|Benaud {{was not a}} large spinner of the ball, but he {{was known}} for his ability to extract {{substantial}} bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and top spinner which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket {{at a time when he}} was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in a silly position. As a batsman, he was tall and lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted <b>driving</b> <b>ability</b> from the front foot.|$|E

25|$|Importing and {{exporting}} of any classified drug is {{a serious}} offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is hard drug trade, maximum 4 years for import or export of large quantities of cannabis. It is prohibited to operate a motor vehicle while {{under the influence of}} any drug that affects <b>driving</b> <b>ability</b> {{to such an extent that}} you are unable to drive properly. (Section 8 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act section 1). The Dutch police have the right to do a drug test if they suspect influenced driving. For example, anybody involved in a traffic accident may be tested. Causing an accident that inflicts bodily harm, while under influence of any drug, is seen as a crime that may be punished by up to 3 years in prison (9 years in case of a fatal accident). Suspension of driving license is also normal in such a case (maximum 5 years). Schiphol, a large international airport near Amsterdam, has long practiced a zero tolerance policy regarding airline passengers carrying drugs. In 2006 there were 20,769 drug crimes registered by public prosecutors and 4,392 persons received an unconditional prison sentence The rate of imprisonment for drug crimes is about the same as in Sweden, which has a zero tolerance policy for drug crimes.|$|E

We hypothesized that this self-regulation might exist only if older drivers have accurate insight into their own age-related functional and cognitive decline. This study aims to evaluate how well self-estimation of cognitive ability of older corresponds to their actual driving performance, as assessed under in-traffic conditions. Seventy five current older drivers, men and women aged 70 and more, were recruited from a 1200 cohort study according three cognitive profiles: 25 drivers who correctly estimated their cognitive abilities, 25 drivers who under estimated and 25 drivers who over estimated their cognitive abilities. Driving performance (objective data) was assessed in on-road traffic situation under both driving instructor and experiment evaluations. Auto-estimation of <b>driving</b> <b>abilities</b> was evaluated trough several questions (subjective data) such as: Compared with when you were aged 40 years, how do you drive today? Participants had to respond on a 5 -points scale from worse to better. Crossing objective and subjective data will allow to determine if drivers estimate correctly or not their driving performance.

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to {{investigate}} the influence of subclinical sleep disturbances on driving practices and driver perceptions in a large cohort of healthy older drivers. Participants from the Candrive II prospective cohort study were investigated. Self-reported measures of sleep problems {{were used to determine}} the influence of sleep disturbance on self-reported driving practices and perceived <b>driving</b> <b>abilities,</b> as measured by the Situational Driving Frequency, Situational Driving Avoidance, and Perceived Driving Abilities scales. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to estimate whether mild self-reported sleep problems were predictive of driving restrictions and perceived abilities, while controlling for a variety of health-related factors and demographic variables known to mediate sleep problems or to impact driving. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Candrive II study suggests that subclinical sleep problems do not significantly influence self-reported driving patterns or perceived <b>driving</b> <b>abilities</b> in older drivers once control variables are considered. The relationship between sleep problems, driving frequency, avoidance and perceived abilities is better explained by mediating demographic, health, and cognitive factors. Further research examining sleep disturbances and driving should include objective measures of driving practices (exposure, patterns) and outcomes (crashes, violations) and should take in consideration the severity of sleep problems.
