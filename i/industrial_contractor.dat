The paper discusses the power of the <b>industrial</b> <b>contractor</b> over the defense buyer in terms of a hold-up problem.

40|$|On February 13 th 2012, the LARES {{satellite}} of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) {{was launched}} into orbit with the qualification {{flight of the}} new VEGA launcher of the European Space Agency (ESA). The payload was released very accurately in the nominal orbit. The name LARES means LAser RElativity Satellite and summarises {{the objective of the}} mission and some characteristics of the satellite. It is, in fact, a mission designed to test Einstein's General Relativity Theory (specifically 'frame dragging' and Lense-Thirring effect). The satellite is passive and covered with optical retroreflectors that send back laser pulses to the emitting ground station. This allows accurate positioning of the satellite, which is important for measuring the very small deviations from Galilei-Newton's laws. In 2008, ASI selected the prime <b>industrial</b> <b>contractor</b> for the LARES system with a heavy involvement of the universities in all phases of the programme, from the design to the construction and testing of the satellite and separation system. The data exploitation phase started immediately after the launch under a new contract between ASI and those universities. Tracking of the satellite is provided by the International Laser Ranging Service. Due to its particular design, LARES is the orbiting object with the highest known mean density in the solar system. In this paper, it is shown that this peculiarity makes it the best proof particle ever manufactured. Design aspects, mission objectives and preliminary data analysis will be also presented.

30|$|As Canada’s leading {{producer}} of oil, gas, and petrochemicals, Alberta {{is home to}} four ethane-cracking plants, including two of the world’s largest, with combined annual capacity to produce 8.6 billion pounds of ethylene. In the foreseeable future, new refining capacity {{will be added to}} produce ethane from bitumen upgrading, which will directly source feedstock from downstream oil sands mining (Government of Alberta 2010). New construction and turnaround activities at industrial process plants consume substantial resources and involve diverse stakeholders who work closely towards delivering a project under a finite time window and a tight cost budget. In general, work items such as a pipe spool, a valve or a storage tank undergo a sequence of tasks which take place in a fabrication shop, at a module yard and on an industrial site. Each task is conducted by a specialist crew in a confined work space with the assistance of temporary facilities and equipment such as scaffolding, rigging system and cranes. A newly engineered rigging system was designed by a major <b>industrial</b> <b>contractor</b> to handle super modules with a maximum 160 -ton lift capacity. The rigging frame system is made of steel and subjected to bending under loadings (Westover et al. 2012). Length-adjustable slings connect the rigging frame and an overhead plate to form a rigging system. The sling length measurements are critical to balance the frame. This ensures the load is evenly spread and carried by each sling. However, direct measurement of sling lengths such as using measurement tape is not feasible due to safety hazards and the dynamic movement of the rigging system.|$|E

This Masters project {{contributes to the}} verication of the optical design of MATSlimb-viewing instrument. The verication is performed in parallel and in collaboration with optical designwork carried out at Omnisys Instruments, a main <b>industrial</b> <b>contractor</b> for the MATS-project. Themajor objective is to verify the fullment of the scientic requirements and the imaging quality for theinstrument. The optical design {{was developed in the}} software OSLO by Omnisys Instruments and the vericationof the optical design is performed in the optical software Zemax. The results from Zemax simulationsconrm the results obtained by OSLO, with only minor dierences. A sensitivity study is performed onthe design to nd how the imaging quality is aected by various uncertainties in the instrument mechanicse. g. positioning of mirrors and CCDs. Such uncertainties can be induced during manufacture, launchetc. It is concluded that resulting requirements on accuracy of the instrument optics can be fullled withgood margin by available mechanical design and manufacturing techniques. Even in the most sensitivecases the mounting uncertainty is a factor 10 less than what is required by the image quality. Theimaging limitations give rise to various spot distributions when projecting an object on the CCD. Thisis important to take into account in the retrieval algorithm. To examine how these imaging issues andother limitations in the optics aect the tomographic retrieval results, the spot distributions are appliedto the retrieval using simulated measurement data. By insertion of optical aberrations into the forwardmodel which is a central part of the retrieval algorithm, it is observed that the sharpest forms may notbe visualized at the imaging limit.

40|$|In late 2010, the DLR Space Administration {{invited the}} German {{industry}} {{to submit a}} proposal for a study about a Mobile Payload Element (MPE), which could be a German national contribution to the ESA Lunar Lander Mission. Several spots in the south polar region of the moon come into consideration as landing site for this mission. All possible spots provide sustained periods of solar illumination, interrupted by darkness periods of several 10 h. The MPE is outlined to be a small, autonomous, innovative vehicle in the 10 kg class for scouting and sampling the environment {{in the vicinity of the}} lunar landing site. The novel capabilities of the MPE will be to acquire samples of lunar regolith from surface, subsurface as well as shadowed locations, define their geological context and bring them back to the lander. This will enable access to samples that are not contaminated by the lander descent propulsion system plumes to increase the chances of detecting any indigenous lunar volatiles contained within the samples. Kayser-Threde, as prime <b>industrial</b> <b>contractor</b> for Phase 0 /A, has assembled for this study a team of German partners with relevant industrial and institutional competence in space robotics and lunar science. The primary scientific objective of the MPE is to acquire clearly documented samples and to bring them to the lander for analysis with the onboard Lunar Dust Analysis Package (L-DAP) and Lunar Volatile Resources Analysis Package (L-VRAP). Due to the unstable nature of volatiles, which are of particular scientific interest, the MPE design needs to provide a safe storage and transportation of the samples to the lander. The proposed MPE rover concept has a four-wheeled chassis configuration with active suspension, being a compromise between innovation and mass efficiency. The suspension chosen allows a compact stowage of the MPE on the lander as well as precise alignment of the solar generators and instruments. Since therefore no further complex mechanics are necessary, the active suspension significantly contributes to the lightweight MPE design. The thermal control system enables the MPE to operate in shaded areas for about 2 h and hibernate darkness periods of about 14 h. Increasing the hibernation capability requires additional battery capacity and thus increases the MPE mass. As operational modes teleoperations from earth and autonomous navigation are foreseen. The MPE payload includes navigation cameras, a close-up imager and a mole as sampling device. The MPE phase 0 /A study finished in early 2012. This article describes the resulting MPE rover concept with focus on its scientific benefit for the Lunar Lander Mission...|$|E

In addition, it might be advisable to establish a round table in which different concepts are discussed and a consensus reached about the main goals and required steps to reach them.|$|R
