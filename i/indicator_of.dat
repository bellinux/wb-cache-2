5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> asteroid origin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{difficulties}} in measuring maternal mortality {{have led to}} a shift in emphasis from <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> health to <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> use of health care services. Furthermore, the recognition that some women need specialist obstetric care to prevent maternal death has led to the search for indicators measuring the met need for obstetric care. Although intuitively appealing, the conceptualization and definition of the need for obstetric care is far from straightforward, and there is relatively little experience so far in the use and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> service use or need for obstetric care. In this paper we review <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> service use and need for obstetric care, and briefly discuss data collection issues...|$|R
