We made it into a medley and kinda put them both in the same key and just made it work, and people responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September 11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and {{talking to me about}} 'Never Too Far,' 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured {{that it would be a}} nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. ... I feel like it's our responsibility to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> right now in terms of music, just being artists and being human beings." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{conversation}} with Woods, Biko {{insisted that the}} BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism [...] "because it isn't a negative, hating thing. It's a positive black self-confidence thing involving no hatred of anyone". He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to restrain that, but frankly it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko {{argued that it was}} the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E
500|$|The actress led {{an active}} private life, {{reportedly}} swimming and playing tennis every morning. In her eighties {{she was still}} playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, [...] "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person." [...] The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported abortion. She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of [...] "Reverence for Life", but {{did not believe in}} religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, [...] "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> for other people." [...] Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.|$|E

"Woman, here is Avignon, {{where you}} tell us {{there are those who}} will befriend you, so now let us part. <b>We</b> have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> for you and it is not safe either for you or for us that we should be seen {{together}} in this Christian city." ...|$|R

We would appreciate your prayers." ...|$|R

2500|$|During her {{remarks to}} the college in 2004, alumna Coretta Scott King stated that [...] "Antioch {{students}} learn that it’s not {{enough to have a}} great career, material wealth and a fulfilling family life. We are also called to serve, to share, to give and to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to lift up the lives of others. No other college emphasizes this challenge so strongly. That’s what makes Antioch so special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Hitchens {{argued that}} Pullman pursues an anti-Christian agenda, citing an {{interview}} in which Pullman is quoted as saying: [...] "I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief." [...] In the same interview, Pullman acknowledges that a controversy {{would be likely to}} boost sales, but continues [...] "I'm {{not in the business of}} offending people. I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important, such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We should <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to increase the amount of wisdom in the world." [...] Hitchens also views the His Dark Materials series as a direct rebuttal of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia; Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda. Hitchens' brother Christopher Hitchens, author of God Is Not Great, praised His Dark Materials as a fresh alternative to Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, describing the author as one [...] "whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction". However, he was more critical of The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, accusing Pullman of being a [...] "Protestant atheist" [...] for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion.|$|E
5000|$|According to Bell, the AEA was a [...] "co-operative {{scientific}} association, not for gain but for {{the love}} of the art and <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to help one another." [...] Although the association had no significant commercial impact, one of its members, Glenn Curtiss, later established the large and successful aeronautical manufacturing company Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. The AEA was disbanded on 31 March 1909.|$|R
5000|$|In 1907, Glenn Curtiss was {{recruited}} by the scientist Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, {{to be among the}} founding members of Bell's Aerial Experimental Association (AEA), with the purpose of helping establish an aeronautical research and development organization.

She {{left the}} room and was absent {{half an hour or}} more, during which time he saw a full-grown tree hauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots. Then a hurdle knocked against the wall, caught on an iron foot-scraper just outside, and made a square-headed ripple. The cascade through the cellar-windows diminished.|$|R

2500|$|The same day, Theresa May {{said in the}} House of Commons {{that there}} had been a [...] "failure of the state – local and {{national}} – to help people when they needed it most", adding, [...] "As Prime Minister, I apologise for that failure. As Prime Minister I have taken responsibility for <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to put things right. That is why each family whose home was destroyed is receiving a down payment from the emergency fund so they can buy food, clothes and other essentials. And all those who have lost their homes will be rehoused within three weeks." ...|$|R

[...] "We have been <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> for them, for it was grievous that so many men should be wandering, without means or employment, in a strange country. But the number was too great for our money to go far among them, and I know {{that many of them}} are {{destitute}} and well-nigh starving. We had hoped to ship some of them back to Scotland, and have been treating with the captain of a vessel sailing, in two or three days, to carry them home." ...|$|R

5000|$|Although Doncaster offered Roberts a new deal, he {{opted to}} join Derby instead. Of the deal, Doncaster manager Sean O'Driscoll said: [...] "We have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{to keep him}} but we are still far away from what he has been offered. Since we (O'Driscoll and his {{management}} team) walked through the door, {{he has been a}} first class professional and got better. That is football and I think that he has found the decision difficult and at his age you understand that if he wants to move to pastures new, not to push him away as I would love him to have stayed, you have to be practical." ...|$|R
5000|$|... Philippine Deputy Presidential {{spokesperson}} Abigail Valte {{called for}} a peaceful end to the strife in Egypt.

I expect it is run by the authorities of the place, and as <b>we</b> are <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> for them, they need not grudge us <b>what</b> <b>we</b> take; and faith, the boys will be quiet and contented enough, so that they do but get enough to keep their pipes going, and know that they will march in the morning with a bit in their knapsacks." ...|$|R

60|$|Eustacia had got {{beyond the}} vision of some {{marriage}} of inexpressible glory; yet, though her emotions were in full vigour, she cared for no meaner union. Thus we see her in a strange state of isolation. To have lost the godlike conceit that <b>we</b> may <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> will, and not to have acquired a homely zest for <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> shows a grandeur of temper which cannot be objected to in the abstract, for it denotes a mind that, though disappointed, forswears compromise. But, if congenial to philosophy, it is apt to be dangerous to the commonwealth. In a world where doing means marrying, and the commonwealth is one of hearts and hands, the same peril attends the condition.|$|R

5000|$|The United Kingdom has levied a {{value-added}} tax (17.5% VAT) on sanitary products since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973.

[...] This is the lowest rate possible under the European Union's value added tax law, which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The UK Independence Party raised the issue in the 2015 general election with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister David Cameron commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was [...] "long-standing" [...] and a complicated issue within the European Union.|$|R
