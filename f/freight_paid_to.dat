For financial reporting purposes such period costs as purchasing department, warehouse, and {{other operating expenses}} are usually not treated as part of inventory or cost of goods sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, some of these period costs must be capitalized as part of inventory. [...] Costs of selling, packing, and shipping goods to customers are treated as operating expenses related to the sale. Both International and U.S. accounting standards require that certain abnormal costs, such as those associated with idle capacity, must be treated as expenses rather than part of inventory.|$|E
5000|$|Article 12 {{the only}} {{alteration}} {{was in the}} last sentence. The sentence read “The subjects or citizens of the two nations shall be protected by the government or commandants {{of the places where}} they may be, and not by the other authorities of the country. In case the Government of Tunis shall have need of an American vessel for its service, the captain shall freight his vessel, and the <b>freight</b> shall be <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> him according to the agreement of the Government, without his being allowed to refuse.” The only change was in the wording and a phrase was added. It now reads “The subjects of the two contracting powers shall be under the protection of the Prince and {{under the jurisdiction of the}} chief of the place where they may be, and no other persons shall have authority over them. If the commandant of the place does not conduct himself agreeably to justice, a representation of it shall be made to us In case the Government shall have need of an American merchant vessel, it shall cause it to be freighted, and then a suitable <b>freight</b> shall be <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the captain, agreeably to the intention of the Government, and the captain shall not refuse it.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Cutty Sark {{was destined}} for the tea trade, then an {{intensely}} competitive race across the globe from China to London. Though the [...] "premium" [...] or bonus <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the ship that arrived with the first tea {{of the year was}} abandoned after The Great Tea Race of 1866, faster ships could usually obtain a higher <b>freight</b> (the price <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> transport the cargo) than others. Her first round trip voyage under captain George Moodie began 16 February 1870 from London with a cargo of wine, spirits and beer bound for Shanghai. The return journey, carrying 1,305,812 lbs of tea from Shanghai, began 25 June, arriving 13 October in London via the Cape of Good Hope.|$|R
25|$|Tea was {{introduced}} from China to Europe in the 17th century, but, as a luxury item, was not transported in significant quantities until the 19th century. China {{was the main}} centre of production {{until late in the}} 19th century. The British East India Company's monopoly of the tea trade from China to Britain ceased in 1834. This opening to competition meant that faster ships were needed, as merchants vied to be first in the market with each new crop of tea. Unlike the slower East Indiamen that had carried tea during that company's monopoly, the tea clippers were designed for speed. Those that had achieved particularly fast passages could usually command a higher <b>freight</b> (the price <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> transport the cargo) than others. Tea wholesalers would mention in advertisements which ship had carried the different batches being sold. It was often the case that tea that was loaded early in China was of somewhat poorer quality than that which became available a few weeks later in the season. Yet this was what was carried by the first ships home and sold to the public with the cachet of a fast passage.|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsChristine WilsonThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} opportunity cost, both financial and efficiency, of inbound railcars of wheat that are not optimally loaded and shipped to ConAgra Mills’ facilities. In performing an analysis of data showing actual versus optimal weights, a cost will be assigned to determine how much “dead freight” or extra <b>freight</b> is being <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> railroads for space not utilized. Throughout the analysis, it can be determined which shippers are lacking efficiencies in loading {{as well as those who}} are meeting ConAgra Mills’ expectations. To accomplish this objective, data were extracted from various sources for an entire fiscal year and 22, 351 data observations were analyzed. The information was specific to both individual railcars as well as the shipments as a whole. These data points were analyzed in two ways, financial and capacity/efficiency. Financially, a cost was assigned to each railcar that was under the railcar’s goal weight. From a capacity perspective, railcars were analyzed on a shipment basis to indicate if equipment could be saved by more efficient loading. The study determined that savings could be found in every situation analyzed. It was determined that in addition to inbound shipments from outside shippers, inter-mill shipments between ConAgra Mills facilities were affected by loading inefficiencies. There could be an opportunity for further analysis to determine the full scope of savings beyond the limitations of this study. The main limitation of this thesis was the primary source of data...|$|R
