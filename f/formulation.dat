The former two <b>formulations</b> were the only <b>formulations</b> whose well-posedness in Lipschitz domains was rigorously established. We establish the well-posedness of the latter two <b>formulations</b> in appropriate functional spaces of boundary traces of solutions of transmission Helmholtz problems in Lipschitz domains.

40|$|Objectives: Although liquisolid <b>formulations</b> {{can show}} a fast {{dissolution}} rate, loading factor {{is not very}} high {{due to lack of}} good flowability and compactibility. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to improve flow, compactibility and dissolution of piroxicam liquisolid <b>formulations</b> by incorporating different types of microcrystalline cellulose. Methods: Several <b>formulations</b> were prepared and their physico-mechanical and dissolution behaviors were investigated. In the present study, propylene glycol, silica and sodium starch glycolate were used as non-volatile solvent, coating material and disintegranting agent respectively. Physical stability of the liquisolid <b>formulations</b> was also investigated to see the effect of aging on hardness and dissolution. Results: Comparing all hardness data showed that liquisolid compacts containing avicel PH 101 and 200 showed superior compactibility than those <b>formulations</b> containing avicel 102. Although avicel PH 200 on its own had better flowability than other grades, in liquisolid <b>formulations</b> avicel PH 101 showed better performance than other grades in terms of flowability. The results showed that a better dissolution rate was obtained with liquisolid <b>formulations</b> containing avicel PH 101 and 102 compared to the <b>formulations</b> containing avicel PH 200. The results showed these liquisolid <b>formulations</b> were stable under the stored conditions and hardness and dissolution behaviours of liquisolid <b>formulations</b> were not significantly affected by aging. Conclusion: It could be concluded that by choosing the right type of carrier flow and hardness of liquisolid <b>formulations</b> can be improved without any significant negative effect on dissolution performance of piroxicam liquisolid compacts...|$|R
