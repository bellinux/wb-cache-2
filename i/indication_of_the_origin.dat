His son William Ogden Niles published the newspaper from Washington, D.C. until it ceased publication in 1849; the Odgen family had longstanding connections with the Chicago area. Alternatively, soldiers from Niles, Michigan reinforced Fort Dearborn during the Black Hawk War, and afterward may have sent word back about the rich farmland to the north. Three early families of settlers came from Niles, Michigan with troops or had relatives at Fort Dearborn. An early history of Cook County, Illinois reported that every two weeks a half-breed Indian traveled to Niles, Michigan for mail. By 1834 a twice-weekly stage connected Chicago and Niles.

Here, we report hat NPs of animal influenza viruses of non-human origin (isolated from pigs, equids, seals, whales, birds) exhibited proteolytic resistance in infected cells and did not undergo a change in mol. wt. {{in the course of}} infection. The resistance of the animal virus NPs to proteolytic cleavage was shown to be a virus-specific property and not the consequence of a low level of proteolysis n infected cells.

40|$|Limited {{knowledge}} about the 3000 -year period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age in central Anatolia, Turkey, prevents any understanding of change or continuity in crop production, consumption and crop husbandry techniques. This research aims to address this bias through the examination of archaeobotanical remains from the four central Anatolian Chalcolithic sites of Çatalhöyük West, Çaml&# 305;bel Tarlas&# 305;, Canhasan I and Kuruçay and the consequent investigation of their crop economies. This work draws on multiple methods and techniques to understand the plant-related activities that occurred at the sites. The four chosen sites bookend the Chalcolithic period (c. 6000 - 3000 cal BC) and provide the opportunity for exploring the interrelationship between crop choice, crop husbandry, settlement size, surrounding environment and social organisation. Differences in crop species such as hulled barley, glume wheats and pulses, particularly lentil and bitter vetch occur at all four sites with species choice community specific. Multiple methods are used to disentangle the depositional processes, such as dung burning, that formed the assemblages, providing an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the archaeobotanical material and allowing inferences {{about the nature of}} weed seeds found. Crop processing activities are evident at all sites, with the dehusking of glume wheat contributing significantly to the archaeobotanical assemblage. The analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of crops coupled with the functional ecology of arable weeds, indicate that crop husbandry techniques/regimes were site specific and were influenced by site size/population as well as environmental conditions. The identification of the crops grown and the methods used to cultivate and process them have implications for understanding the social context of such activities, and the broader socio-economic background of a period preceding the great changes in social structure seen in the Bronze Age. </p...|$|E
40|$|Coal bed and {{shale gas}} {{can be of}} thermogenic, {{microbial}} or of mixed origin with the distinction made primarily {{on the basis of}} the molecular and stable isotope compositions of the gases and production waters. Methane, ethane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are the main constituents of coal bed and shale gases, with a general lack of C 2 + hydrocarbon species in gases produced from shallow levels and more mature coals and shales. Evidence for the presence of microbial gas include δ 13 C-CH 4 values less than - 50 ‰, covariation of the isotope compositions of gases and production water, carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionations consistent with microbial processes, and positive δ 13 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon in production waters. The CO 2 -reduction pathway is distinguished from acetate/methyl-type fermentation by somewhat lower δ 13 C-CH 4 and higher δD-CH 4, but can also have overlapping values depending on the openness of the microbial system and the extent of substrate depletion. Crossplots of δ 13 C-CH 4 versus δ 13 C-CO 2 and δD-CH 4 versus δ 13 C-H 2 O may provide a better <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the gases and the dominant metabolic pathway than the absolute carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions of methane. In the majority of cases, microbial coal bed and shale gases have carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionations close to those expected for CO 2 reduction. Primary thermogenic gases have δ 13 C-CH 4 values greater than - 50 ‰, and δ 13 C values that systematically increase from C 1 to C 4 and define a relatively straight line when plotted against reciprocal carbon number. Although coals and disseminated organic matter in shales represent a continuum as hydrocarbon source rocks, current data suggest a divergence between these two rock types at the high maturity end. In deep basin shale gas, reversals or rollovers in molecular and isotopic compositions are increasingly reported in what is effectively a closed shale system as opposed to the relative openness in coal measure environments. Detailed geochemical studies of coal bed and shale gas and related production waters are essential to determine not only gas origins but also the dominant methanogenic pathway in the case of microbial gases...|$|E

40|$|Enclaves {{of natural}} {{vegetation}} in suburbia have an importance far beyond their area. The sprawling cities of materialistic Australia {{are in fact}} surprisingly well endowed with the lost values of rural beauty and natural scene. Sydney has its large national parks which provide an impediment to northern and southern suburban expansion {{as well as a}} large number of reserves in at least a near natural state around the margins of its magnificent harbours. Melbourne has Studley Park, a semi-natural area in a river setting {{within walking distance of the}} CBD, as well as a considerable extent of coast in a more or less natural condition. Adelaide has its pastoral parks which ring the CBD. Brisbane has the Mount Coot-tha Reserve. Perth is fortunate to have King's Park and Hobart its Domain and numerous other reserves, all in a close to natural state. Despite a rapidly growing and vocal conservation movement, which is largely centred on the cities, almost all of these natural and semi-natural reserves are suffering from a steady encroachment of other uses. They are regarded as the best sites for freeways and planned recreational expansion, and are even occasionally suffering commercial encroachment. Their natural qualities are also being steadily destroyed in a more subtle manner consequent upon the intensive land use that is found on their margins. Some of the symptoms and probable causes of such subtle change have been described in an earlier article in this journal (Kirkpatrick, 1974) in relation to the Sandringham Foreshore Reserve in Melbourne. This article completes the consideration of the reserve, in discussing the changes that have occurred in the vegetation with the suburbanization of its hinterland, the vegetation in 1971, and the problems of conserving the vegetation of the reserve in the future. In this paper the term 'native' is used to denote that a species to the best of my knowledge would have occurred in the Sandringham area before white settlement. The terms 'alien', 'introduced' and 'exotic' denote that a species has been introduced into the area since white settlement. A more detailed <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of all species mentioned in this article can be found in Kirkpatrick (1974) along with authorities for the nomenclature used. The word 'natural' is used to imply that vegetation is similar to that which would have probably been found in the area before white settlement. Thus, the most natural area of vegetation in the reserve would be composed of native species, have a structure that could be found in similar environments less intensively used by man, and would not owe its genesis to actions of European man. Similarly the word 'disturbance' is used purely in relation to the actions of European man. Normal environmental events and processes may lead to the creation of habitats suitable for the establishment of exotics, but are excluded from the definition of disturbance for the purposes of this article...|$|E

40|$|Context. Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were discovered, {{including}} SNe Iax. <b>The</b> suggested progenitors <b>of</b> SNe Iax {{are relatively}} massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, {{which can cause}} white dwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially occur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single and/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions have different nucleosynthesis yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar mass explosions. Aims. We test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic chemical signatures. Methods. <b>The</b> two sub-classes <b>of</b> SNe Ia {{are expected to be}} rarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood; however, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shorter delay time and/or weaker metallicity dependence, they could influence <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> metalpoor systems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical evolution model for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Results. The model predicts a butterfly-shape spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity and - at the same time - a decrease of [alpha/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than in the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed abundances in stars of Ursa Minor. Conclusions. The surprising agreement between our models and available observations provides a strong <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> these new sub-classes of SNe Ia.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{based on}} point-like sources is discussed, enabling a reliable estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pioneer 10 and 11 probes caused by thermal effects. A sensitivity analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> several parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model {{allows for a}} clear <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible thermal <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called Pioneer anomaly.

2500|$|For the South Korean release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, it was retitled Big Hero, {{to avoid}} <b>the</b> {{impression}} <b>of</b> being a sequel, and edited to remove <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters' Japanese <b>origin.</b> This is {{owing to the}} tense relations between Korea and Japan. For instance, the protagonist's name, Hiro Hamada, was changed to [...] "Hero Armada," [...] and Japanese-language signage onscreen was changed to English. Nonetheless, the film caused some online controversy in South Korea, because of small images resembling the Rising Sun Flag in the protagonist's room.|$|R
5000|$|Railway agent Mike Flannery {{wants to}} charge the {{livestock}} rate for a shipment of two guinea pigs and refuses to accept the lower pet rate, saying [...] "pigs is pigs". Flannery believes that the [...] "guinea" [...] is an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pigs' national <b>origin.</b> He argues that they should bear the higher freight charge of 30¢ for livestock, rather than the lower 25¢ for domestic pets. In support of this, he submits {{that if they were}} [...] "dago pigs" [...] or [...] "paddy pigs", there would be no question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals' status.|$|R
40|$|A {{history and}} {{development}} status assessment is presented for {{the hypothesis that}} <b>the</b> great extinction <b>of</b> living species 65 million years ago, at {{the boundary between the}} Tertiary and Cretaceous geological ages, was due to <b>the</b> collision <b>of</b> a meteoroid, asteroid, or comet with the earth. The initial, deeply suggestive <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extraterrestial <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extinction-initiating mechanism was <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> an exceptionally high concentration <b>of</b> iridium at <b>the</b> stratigraphic position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extinction. Detailed computer modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmospheric effect <b>of</b> such a bolide impact has shown that the earth would have first grown intensely cold during a period of darkness due to particulate debris clouds in the upper atmosphere, followed by an enormous increase in global temperatures as the debris cleared, created by <b>the</b> persistence <b>of</b> greenhouse-effect gases; this heating would have been especially lethal to numerous forms of life...|$|R
