Also, most of these rules have a defeasible character {{in the sense that they}} hold for the normal case, but can be overruled in exceptional circumstances. The results from this logical analysis could contribute to the discussion about the role of deontic and defeasible logics in the representation of and reasoning about legal domains. We also describe how, based on our logical analysis, a legal advisory system for the Incoterms can be implemented in Prolog. This implementation could be further developed into a legal advisory system that could offer advice to commercial users about the choice of the most suitable Incoterms to include in their commercial contracts. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{increase}} the understanding of foreign market entry among SMEs. The model of a French established company entering the Scandinavian market supports this research. Theoretical Framework - The entry modes, the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), the standardization or adaptation dilemma of the products are presented. The entry modes are crucial to analyze the way corporations choose to enter a foreign country. As the case study used is a French SME, it is necessary to include their advantages and disadvantages. Standardization or adaptation are related to the chosen entry mode and the chosen market. Methodology - Theory supported by a case study: the French company Krampouz entering and expanding the Scandinavian market of cooking equipment. A number of business research methods are used in this thesis, such as a semi-structured interview with the company itself, a self-completion questionnaire with potential retailers and a secondary data analysis. Empirical Investigation - The information collected about Krampouz through the interview and the secondary data are split into the company background and its export strategy. Then the relevant data from the Scandinavian retailers are included. Finally information about the Single European Market and the <b>International</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Terms</b> (Incoterms) are combined to narrow down the trends of export. Findings - Entering the Scandinavian market as an European SME has to be pursued through exporting. Direct export appears to be the most relevant method to make business for SMEs in Scandinavia.

40|$|The subject. This informational {{article is}} devoted to the peculiarities of {{recognition}} and enforcement of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> arbitration awards according to different countries’ legislation and international legal regulation. The purpose of the article is to identify legal patterns of recognition and enforcement of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> arbitration awards in different countries. Methodology. The study is based on comparative law and formal law methods, analysis and synthesis. Results, scope of application. Enforcement of arbitral awards in foreign countries is ensured and guaranteed by multilateral conventions, bilateral treaties and national legislation. The New York Convention 1958 in a certain way limits the scope of legal protection of arbitral awards and leaves the procedure for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards for consideration of the state court. The author analyses of differentiation of the recognition and enforcement regime of so-called "domestic" and "foreign" solutions of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> arbitration in <b>terms</b> of doctrinal approaches and practice of foreign countries. Special attention is given to the analysis of foreign arbitral awards of recognition and enforcement procedures is given to a denial of recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and their reasons. In spite of the explicit grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in New York Convention 1958, some countries try to establish certain exceptions to the rule in the national legislation. Results may be applicable in improvement of international legal regulation. Conclusions. The courts of the countries – participants of the New York Convention 1958 cannot cancel the foreign arbitral award or revise it substantially. The refutation of this award is possible only in the court of the state in whose territory the relevant arbitral award was made, and such court is not formally bound by the rules of the New York Convention 1958, when deciding whether to cancel or modify the award. </p...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> {{arbitration}} {{has long}} been the preferred means of resolving cross-border business disputes, the international corporate community has become increasingly concerned about increasing costs, delays and procedural formalities. As a result, parties are looking for other means of resolving cross-border business disputes. One of the more popular alternatives is mediation. Advocates of mediation extol its many benefits, including its ability to resolve disputes more quickly and with fewer costs and formalities than other alternatives. However, very little research exists on how mediation operates in the <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> context. This Essay therefore considers whether and to what extent <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> mediation can be said to be superior to <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> arbitration. That question is answered in a three-step analysis. First, this Essay outlines the unique characteristics of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> disputes to determine whether such matters are amenable to mediation. The discussion then considers what might motivate parties to use <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> mediation if savings of time, cost and procedural formality are taken out of the equation. Finally, the Essay describes how public international law might be used to improve certain deficiencies in <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> mediation. In so doing, the discussion aims to help parties conduct a realistic evaluation of the prospects of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> mediation {{and find a way to}} ensure the procedure’s long-term success...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (<b>International</b> <b>Commercial</b> Law) The {{principle}} of party autonomy {{is a fundamental}} characteristic of private international law. The contracting parties’ freedom of choice regarding the law governing their contract is one which optimises the fundamental {{principle of}} party autonomy. It is generally accepted that a choice of a governing law by the parties should be respected by adjudicating bodies such as domestic courts and arbitral tribunals. It would often benefit contracting parties to choose a neutral legal system so {{that there will be}} a “fair playing field” in case a dispute arises between them. However, some domestic legal systems and regional, supranational and <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> instruments limit the choice of law to that of a recognised domestic legal system. Accordingly, choosing the UNIDROIT Principles on <b>International</b> <b>Commercial</b> Contracts as governing law will, in most cases, not be a viable option for the parties concerned. Such a limitation on the choice of a governing law does not promote the fundamental principle of party autonomy, which is characteristic of private international law. Parties to an <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> contract should be able to choose a non-state system of law to govern their contract. The UNIDROIT Principles of <b>International</b> <b>Commercial</b> Contracts provide a comprehensive, complete and easily obtainable system of law compiled by legal experts in the various fields which form part of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> law. It follows a via media system of law with regards to Civil Law and Common Law legal systems. This paper will discuss the principle of party autonomy, as well as the possibility of a choice of non-state law, in particular the UNIDROIT Principles of <b>International</b> <b>Commercial</b> Contracts, as the law governing an <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> contract. The choice of law will be discussed with reference to the position taken in domestic courts as well as that in international arbitration. To review the impact and success of the UNIDROIT Principles in the realm of <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> contracting, various <b>international</b> <b>commercial</b> instruments will be discussed...|$|R
