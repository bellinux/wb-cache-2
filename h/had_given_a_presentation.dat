50|$|After {{assessing}} expectancy, violation valence, and communicator reward valence of <b>a</b> <b>given</b> situation, {{it becomes}} {{possible to make}} rather specific predictions about whether the individual who perceived the violation will reciprocate or compensate the behavior in question. Guerrero (1996) and Burgoon (2000) noticed that predictable patterns develop when considering reward valence and violation valence together. Specifically, if the violation valence is perceived as positive and the communicator reward valence is also perceived as positive, the theory predicts individuals will reciprocate the positive behavior. For example, your boss <b>gives</b> you <b>a</b> big smile after you <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation.</b> Guerrero and Burgoon would predict that you would smile in return. Similarly, if you perceive the violation valence as negative and perceive the communicator reward valence as negative, the theory again predicts that you reciprocate the negative behavior. Thus, if a disliked coworker is grouchy and unpleasant towards you, you will likely reciprocate and be unpleasant in return.|$|R

Certain nesting properties of the Rμ which correspond to the dominance order of partitions then translate themselves into combinatorial inequalities involving the Kλ,μ(q).

The responses I received indicated that people liked the fact that I <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> “how-to” <b>presentation,</b> and that the information could be used to develop similar activities elsewhere. There seemed to be a need to show people how to use blogging in a language learning/ESL environment. More generally, this presentation and the panel discussion in which I participated as “one of the four Alberta Universities”, both helped me get the message out there that AU does have ESL programming, and that our courses are innovative (more so than many) and on a par as far as general quality is concerned with those offered elsewhere. I was also able to meet with others at the conference who are interested in CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning). The positive responses I received (there were no negatives) encourage me to continue with the various blogging activities that I have been attempting to introduce to my courses. While the one type of blogging that I have been doing with students will remain essentially the same, I will continue to explore other types of blogging that could be used to assist students with the language learning/writing aspects of the courses that I coordinate. Blogging allows educators and students to connect in new ways to enhance the learning experience. There are various reasons for including blogging activities including building audience awareness and a sense of community.

40|$|Almost {{half of all}} {{graduate}} students leave their doctoral programs without finishing. Who leaves, taking which skills and strengths with them, is still poorly understood, however, because {{it is hard to}} measure exactly what {{graduate students}} learn in their doctoral programs. Since the expertise required of a PhD holder is highly dependent on discipline, the development of a better understanding of graduate education and attrition requires studying the process at the departmental level. This is a qualitative study of the cultural values and norms of academic astronomy, as transmitted through the socialization of graduate students into giving talks, asking questions, and participating in departmental speaking events. This study also looks at the conflicts that arise when implicit cultural norms, which are practiced but remain unacknowledged, are inconsistent with the official, explicit values and norms for speaking in astronomy. Doctoral students and faculty members in a single astronomy department, at a large western university, filled out a short survey about the stakes involved in astronomy speaking events. A subset of these individuals was interviewed in-depth about the goals of, and their experiences with, five departmental speaking events: Coffee Hour, Journal Club, research talks, Thesis defense talks, and Colloquia. These interviewees were: (1) graduate students who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> verbal <b>presentation</b> at one of these events, and (2) graduate students and faculty members who were in the audience at <b>a</b> graduate student's <b>presentation.</b> The desired outcomes which were expressed for these speaking events included: (1) lively, informal discussion among all participants, (2) increasing graduate student verbal participation in these events as they "learn to speak like astronomers," and (3) the utility of these events in helping graduate students learn and practice their speaking and reasoning skills related to astronomy research. In practice these goals were not achieved due to: (1) the ubiquitous, but unacknowledged practice of judging others' speech performance to come to negative conclusions about those individuals' intentions, intellectual abilities or efforts, (2) a lack of feedback for graduate students on their verbal performances, and (3) a lack of faculty members making explicit their own solutions to the inherent dilemmas of academic speaking...|$|R

40|$|Persuasion is {{the process}} of guiding people toward the {{adoption}} of an idea, attitude, or action by rational and symbolic (though not always logical) means. Persuasion is as old as humanity itself, and records exist to show that the available technology of the day has been used to assist with persuasion for many thousands of years, and has evolved over the centuries to become more effective. Generally, persuasion technology is used to augment a human face-to-face or voice interaction. One of the most commonly forms of persuasion technology used today is PowerPoint slides. Despite somewhat widespread criticism of the use of PowerPoint in presentations, supporters and critics generally agree that the ease of use of presentation software can save a lot of time for people who otherwise would have used other types of visual aid [...] hand-drawn or mechanically typeset slides, blackboards, whiteboards or overhead projections. Ease of use also encourages those who otherwise would not have used visual aids, or would not <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> at all, to make presentations. Although PowerPoint's style, animation, and multimedia abilities have become more sophisticated, and the application has generally made it easier to produce presentations, there are still many parts of the presentation composition and execution processes that lacks ease of use. This is especially evident when the presenter wants to include multimedia data of various file formats. As the persuasion technology have evolved over the centuries, it has also become more complex. Complex technologies are more fault prone than simpler technologies. When the persuasion technology fails during <b>a</b> <b>presentation,</b> it becomes <b>a</b> big drawback instead of an aid. This is because the failure will draw much more attention than the message the presenter is trying to convey. Additionally, it may cause a big delay and possibly project the presenter as unprofessional. The fear of such events may be the reason that some professional presenters completely avoid presentation software and are still using the old overhead projector. If that is the case, then the evolution of modern persuasion technology needs {{to take a step back}} and correct itself. New features that makes the persuasion technology more effective are welcomed by the users, but not at the cost of ease of use. This project has focused on creating a solution that covers the common problems often experienced by presenters when using presentation software on computers connected to presentation equipment, such as projectors. The project proposes a software system called Extended Presentation System (EXPRESS), which is a distributed system for planning, management and execution of seminars and presentations with digital presentation content. Its design is based on an analysis of the current persuasion technology and its problem areas, consisting of software, hardware and organizational problems. This was done by interviewing experienced presenters and seminar administrators, writing down own experiences and researching problems with common presenter software and presentation equipment. Based on this research, an architecture was developed and a prototype implemented. The prototype was tested and further developed in two real-scenario test iterations. The first field test of the prototype was on the 28 th of April, 2008, at the information meeting for the fifth year MSc students of the Communication Technology MSc programme at the department of Telematics, NTNU. The second was at the Fifth European PKI Workshop, which had participants from all over the world. It took place on the 16 th and 17 th of June, 2008, at NTNU. A survey on the user experience of the EXPRESS system was made and distributed to the participants of the PKI Workshop. Qualitative interviews were performed with both the information meeting presenters and the PKI workshop administrator. The results were collected, analyzed, presented in this thesis and used in considerations for further work and development. The authors participated in the business plan competition Venture Cup with the EXPRESS system. An excerpt of this business plan is presented in chapter 9. This master thesis, along with the market considerations, in the business plan will form a basis for a commercialization of the EXPRESS system in cooperation with NTNU Technology Transfer. The new company is planned founded in August 2008 and will have office at the Innovation Center Gløshaugen. This project has shown that the current <b>presentation</b> technology have <b>a</b> big potential for improvement, especially in making the technology more user friendly. The project has shown that the problems arise when many different technologies have to work together in the same environment. It has shown that file conversion and adaption to current industry standards is a potential solution for these problems. The project also shows that there are willingness to change the current common routine of presenting from ones own laptop to a system specialized for this task, such as EXPRESS.

40|$|Virtual reality {{exposure}} therapy (VRET) {{is already}} used {{for treatment of}} phobias like fear of flying, heights and small places. It is shown {{to be effective in}} these areas prompting research into new phobia treatment possibilities. Current papers concerned with social phobia and the use of VRET do not seem to focus on person to person interaction. One of the problems that might have caused this is the difficulty of automating the interaction between a human and a computer character. In this thesis the focus lies on evaluating a possible technique for automating the interaction between a human and a computer for use in a therapeutic setting. The chosen method used avatars which behaviour was simulated using various artificial intelligence techniques. Some of the techniques used in this thesis were borrowed from research related to chatbots and embodied conversational agents. Because these type of conversational agents are not used in a therapeutic setting, the techniques had to be altered to fit this extra requirement. This produced a semi-scripted dialogue structure that would be executed. The user was asked a question and in return the computer would respond on the <b>given</b> answer. <b>A</b> speech recognizer was used, {{to figure out what the}} user had said in his free speech response, to choose a predefined response for the computer to utter. These predefined sentences encapsulated human intelligence in response to the computer to improve the realism of the conversation. The dialogues were developed in an iterative process where the dialogues were used in a chatbot like interaction with a test group. The semi-scripted dialogue was tested with four conditions; (1) using only a speech detector, (2) using a speech recognizer to detect a limited set of words, (3) some keywords added to this list and (4) using a human as the controller. The human controller was used as a benchmark point for the automatic techniques to strive for. The experiment put 24 participants in a situation where they <b>had</b> to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> in front of four avatars after which they asked questions about a specific topic. This was repeated four times with four different dialogues resulting in a within-subject comparison of the four possible conditions. The experiment showed that the realism of the dialogue was influenced by two important factors: (1) the speed of the avatar responses and (2) the correctness of these responses. The automated techniques could not yet compete with the human control but were sufficient enough to make them hard to distinguish from the human control condition. To verify the potential usefulness of the program in a therapeutic setting a case study was conducted with one therapist and two clients. The human control condition has a higher workload than the automated conditions. The therapist therefore preferred the automatic conditions because she could actually spend time observing the clients and work on the therapy. The therapist remarked that the dialogues should be focused more on therapy purposes than correctness of the responses.
