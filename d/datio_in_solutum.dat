50|$|A non-variation clause does {{sometimes}} have unacceptable consequences, and its application is limited. It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits {{the principle of}} freedom of contract. Cancellation of the contract and certain forms of waiver of rights (e.g. waiver of an accrued right arising from a breach of contract, <b>datio</b> <b>in</b> <b>solutum,</b> release of the debtor, and a pactum de non petendo) do not amount to variations. A non-variation clause is not enforced where its enforcement is against public policy or where estoppel can be raised. Neither defence has successfully been raised on the facts in any reported case.|$|E
5000|$|The buyer is {{required}} to pay the purchase price in the manner agreed upon in the contract. This is certainly his most important duty. Should the contract say nothing specific in this regard, the obligation must be established {{in terms of the}} previous course of dealings between the parties, or by relevant trade usage. Failing these, as Mackeurtan notes, [...] "he must pay it in legal tender." [...] Payment may be made by cheque, depending upon its being honoured. Performance other than of what is due (called substituted performance, or <b>datio</b> <b>in</b> <b>solutum)</b> may be rendered if the creditor consents; if he does consent, and the payment is so rendered, the obligation is validly discharged.|$|E

40|$|And ' well-known, {{to use the}} {{expression}} employed by an authoritative doctrine that "the private acts much more than regulate" and face it, what's more, without worry of classification dogmatic for their actions. Starting from this basic premise, imbued with significant implications on the dogmatic, this description is intended to offer some thoughts {{on the role of}} private autonomy in the execution phase of the contract. In this light polarizing means, in particular, on the concept of private autonomy procedural that interacts with the well-known phenomenon so-called "Liberalizing effect" in our legal system. Following this line, you will use a different methodological approach to clarify some controversial issues relating to the nature and the character of the place of performance in compliance with art. 1197 c. c. In particular, moving from a flexible and relativistic dogmatic reconstruction of the notion of enforcement activity in private law and the relationship between the conceptual categories of effect, efficacy (when the second one adopts a different concept and a different content than the first), and execution, will face, including a survey of the major doctrinal and jurisprudential addresses three problem areas that interact with each other. The first is structural in nature, relates to the note interpretative controversy {{about the nature of the}} contract or consensual real performance instead of performance. The second of functional matrix, is inherent in the nature of act capable to satisfy the creditor's interest or not the execution of the service. Finally, it is considered, on the floor effectual qualifications in key extinctive, or, alternatively, the amending of the case. To these questions we intend to answer here using the landing construction reached by the modern doctrine in the analysis of the processes of bargaining, moving, in particular, from the conceptual category of the so-called configurative effect. Will face, and then, at a later time, the reflections practical application of the landing constructive achieved. The historical evolution of the institution actually showed a progressively increasing vitality in practical operation. So much is clear not only from the recognition of certain offenses traditionally recurring repertoires in case law, such as, for example, in the datio sulutum of bank checks and drafts, the bankruptcy petition in the place of performance of the service as a means of payment abnormal, agreements on crisis marital called translational in fulfillment of the obligation to maintain in a single solution, and, finally, the so-called <b>datio</b> <b>in</b> <b>solutum</b> testamentary on which, for the sake of brevity, we do not linger here. It should be pointed out that in fact the issues underlying the institution denote also considerable importance in the understanding of a situation recently introduced by the regional planning legislation in the wake of the information provided by the Community case-law formed the subject of expropriation. It is, more precisely, of the so-called sale agreement in solutum of real estate and development rights to the owner of land expropriated in a pecuniary compensation, on which we will focus extensively in the last part of this work...|$|E
