25|$|Gingrich is an {{advocate}} of space exploration technology, and has stated that the United States should place more emphasis on realizing landmark achievements in space exploration. He has been a vocal critic of NASA, which he has described as too bureaucratic, inefficient, and {{no longer able to}} foster ambitious projects such as the 1969 moon landing. He has cited the building of the International Space Station {{as an example of a}} program that developed too slowly and was too expensive and the Space Launch System as a pork barrel project. Gingrich advocates greater reliance on the private sector and recommends incentivizing innovation through tax credits and by allocating 10 percent of the Nasa budget for prizes. He also supports initiating federally regulated commercial launch services. According to Gingrich, these changes would allow NASA to focus on advanced technological development and <b>exploratory</b> <b>research.</b> Gingrich's vision for the future of American space programs includes further solar system exploration, space travel for consumers and a sustained civilization beyond earth. He got the nickname of Newt Skywalker for his ideas.|$|E

25|$|There is {{flexibility}} of the focus group research in {{being used as a}} qualitative method or a combination of the former with quantitative techniques (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).The moderator is permitted to inquire into and examine unforeseen issues due to this kind of format. Has high face validity and naturalistic- as it includes storytelling, joking, disagreements, boasting and more (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library & Morgan). It is relatively inexpensive/relatively low cost (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). Provides relatively fast results (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).Consumes lesser time unlike structured interviews in order to increase sample sizes and resource investment (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). It is helpful and important for needs assessment and project evaluation projects (Savithiri, 2009).Regarding the facts and numbers in research, meaning behind these facts can also be found and confirmed through surveys as it is qualitative in nature(Savithiri, 2009). It is relatively simple to carry out (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement). It consumes less time as large sample size can be studied (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement).Information is gained from group interaction due to group dynamics (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement). It helps in obtaining and gathering contracted and incisive data of specific topic (Morgan).Many new perspectives and opinions are obtained which results in insights (Morgan). Sensitive topics can be discussed leading to personal disclosures (Silverman, 2004).Often these interactions result in creating ‘synergistic effects’ (Silverman, 2004).Vocabulary and language used can be observed (Silverman, 2004). It is much more efficient when the data being gathered is very much related to the researcher’s interests(Morgan).The moderator keeps the discussion in sync with the topic and makes sure one individual does not dominate the other; hence follows an ‘egalitarian’ method(Silverman, 2004 & n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). Non-verbal behavior as well plays a role in the moderator’s decision making and research results (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). High possibilities in resulting in rich and in-depth information or data (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages & Deem, 1997). It is useful for <b>exploratory</b> <b>research</b> (Deem, 1997). Group interaction can be observed in a controlled setting(Deem, 1997). The reactions of participants towards each other can be analyzed (n.d., Southalabama Education: Strengths and Weaknesses of Focus Groups). Previously neglected or unnoticed phenomena can be drawn towards the researcher’s attention(Silverman, 2004).Helps to inform the development of survey instruments(Silverman, 2004).Opportunistic use of focus groups results in improvised research design and impoverished data(Silverman, 2004).|$|E

These new variables can be depicted from in-depth interviews and informal discussions with intervening actors, through a process of identification, conceptualization (obtaining theoretical definitions), and operationalisation (suggesting ways for the measurement of the identified variables).

Our main research question is ‘What is the role and agency of girls/women in and around gangs?’. For this research we implement a qualitative methodology, starting from an Informed Grounded Theory perspective, conducting (in-depth) interviews as well as focus groups and (participatory) observations. The study involves several field researches: one three-month <b>exploratory</b> field <b>research</b> (March – May 2017), and two six-month in-depth field researches (2018 & 2019). After the <b>exploratory</b> field <b>research</b> we decided to focus on Honduras. We will discuss the reason of this choice, along with other experiences from the field. During the <b>exploratory</b> field <b>research</b> over 30 interviews were conducted, as well as focus groups and observations. Notwithstanding the focus of this preliminary research was on experts in the field, we also had the opportunity to visit female and male prisons, talk to (former) gang members, and participate (as observers) in some activities with youngsters/prisoners/(ex) gang members.

These disruptions can incur failure of system and thus bring a more extensive loss to the whole society. The concept of resilience was introduced into transportation system since it concerned about the performance of system under disruptions. Resilience has been initially described as the ability of system to become healthy and strong again after a disruptive event. On transportation resilience, a number of scholars have carried out <b>exploratory</b> <b>researches</b> from different perspectives. However, the definitions and the connotations within it they recommended were quite multifarious. This paper took a summative review of these definitions and connotations and tried to develop an integrated description about what a resilient transportation system is, and what aspects of characters it should have.
