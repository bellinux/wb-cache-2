Analytical persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing messages that are overtly persuasive, such as most lessons in science books, news reports, and speeches. However, narrative persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing narrative messages that are not overtly persuasive, such as novels, movies, or video games. Addressing the strength and duration of the persuasive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> stories, narrative transportation is a mental state that produces enduring persuasive effects without careful evaluation of arguments.

This research {{aimed to}} explore the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> on cardiac efficacy of alkaloids in Aconitum tubers. First, the chemical ingredients in unprocessed and processed Aconitum tubers were identified and compared by using high performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF/MS) and multivariate pattern recognition methods. Then the representative alkaloids in Aconitum tubers, aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine, which belong to diester-diterpenoid alkaloids, monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids, and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids, respectively, were selected for further validation of attenuated mechanism. Subsequent pharmacological experiments with aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine in SD rats were used for validate the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> on cardiac functions. After processing the Aconitum tubers, {{it was found that}} the contents of diester-diterpenoid alkaloids were reduced, and those of monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids were increased, suggesting that diester-diterpenoid alkaloids were transformed into monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids. Through further decocting the aconitine in boiling water, it was confirmed that the three alkaloids could be progressively transformed. Pharmacological experiments with aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine in SD rats showed that aconitine at a dose of 0. 01  mg/kg and aconine at a dose of 10  mg/kg enhanced the cardiac function, while benzoylaconine at a dose of 2  mg/kg weakened the cardiac function. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> is attributed to the transformation of the most toxic diester-diterpenoid alkaloids into less toxic monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and amine-diterpenoid alkaloids...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is a systematic study exploring a new fabrication methodology for long-fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) using a novel additive manufacturing technology. The {{research is}} devoted to the manufacture of long-fiber-reinforced MMC structures using the Ultrasonic Consolidation (UC) process. The main objectives of this research are to investigate the bond formation mechanisms and fiber embedment mechanisms during UC, and further to study the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> parameters on bond formation and fiber embedment, and the resultant macroscopic mechanical properties of UC-made MMC structures. From a fundamental research point of view, bond formation mechanisms and fiber embedment mechanisms have been clarified by the current research based on various experimental observations. It has been found that atomic bonding across nascent metal is the dominant bond formation mechanism during the UC process, whereas the embedded fiber are mechanically entrapped within matrix materials due to significant plastic deformation of the matrix material during embedment. From a manufacturing process point of view, the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> parameters on bond formation and fiber embedment during the UC process have been studied and optimum levels of parameters have been identified for manufacture of MMC structures. An energy-based model has been developed as a first step toward analytically understanding the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> parameters on the quality of ultrasonically consolidated structures. From a material applications point of view, the mechanical properties of ultrasonically consolidated structures with and without the presence of fibers have been characterized.

40|$|Thin Film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} that has been around {{since the beginning of the}} twentieth century and has become an integral part of the microfabrication and nanofabrication industries. Sputter deposition is a method of physical vapor deposition (PVD) in which a target is bombarded with ions and atoms are ejected and deposited as a thin film on a substrate. Despite extensive research on the direct process of sputtering thin films from targets to substrates, not much work has been done on studying the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> on the microstructure of a target. In the first part of this work, the development of a PVD chamber is explored along with a few modifications and improvements developed along the way.
