Four experiments were designed to study the effects of water velocity, photoperiod, substrate and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocking</b> on the survival, growth and habitat preference of subyearling crayfish. Water velocities ranging from 4 cm/sec to 10 cm/sec were found to {{have a positive effect on}} both survival and growth. Survival was greatest under light-dark conditions, while the maximum growth was attained in total darkness, The optimal <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocking</b> was found to be between 50 and 100 subyearlings per m². A habitat consisting of 3 - 8 cm gravel and alder leaves was found to be a preferred habitat...|$|E

Different types of ponds, small or large, seasonal or perennial, shallow or deep, are used as nurseries; and different methods of preparation of the ponds are followed. There is, however, very little reliable information about these practices, {{most of which are}} known only to a few farmers who keep the information as family secrets handed down from generation to generation. On such important aspects like the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocking</b> and percentage of survival, also, our information is meagre.

40|$|China has a {{long history}} of aquaculture. Since the 1980 s, {{mariculture}} has been considered by the government as an increasingly important sub-sector of aquaculture. Mariculture provides nutritional and economic benefits, and decreases the intensity of exploitation on declining wild living resources. China now has the highest mariculture production in the world. Kelp made up 50 - 60 % the total Chinese mariculture production in 1967 - 1980. Production of Laminaria japonica Aresch, the leading species, reached 252, 907 t (dry wet) in 1980. The percentage of kelp production decreased after 1981 because of proportionally greater production of molluscs, shrimps and finfish. Marinefinfish and mollusc production increased sharply after 1990. In 2001, the total mariculture production reached 11, 315, 000 t from a production area of 1, 286, 000 ha. The rapid development and changes in mariculture species have aroused increasing concern about mariculture's impact on the coastal environment. The impact of coastal aquaculture, such as water quality deterioration and contaminants, will have a significant bearing on the expansion of mariculture. The key of improving and maintaining the long-term health of mariculture zones lies in adopting sustainable culture systems. It is imperative that the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocking</b> fish and other economically important organisms such as oysters, and scallops, be controlled, in addition to restricting the total number of net-cages in the mariculture zones. The authors suggest moving rafts (cages) periodically and to development of a fallow system in which area fish culture will be suspended for 1 - 2 years to facilitate recovery of the polluted sediment. Moving fish culture offshore into deeper waters is also suggested. The authors also believe that large-scale seaweed cultivation will reduce eutrophication in coastal culture zones in China...|$|E

We propose a new family <b>of</b> probability <b>densities</b> that can be used as substitutes and have the property of closed form integrability. This is especially advantageous in cases where either the complexity of a problem makes numerical function evaluations very costly, or fast information extraction is required for nonparametric maximum likelihood density estimation and may thus find a variety of applications, two of which are illustrated briefly:- Estimation of 'Value at Risk' based on approximations to the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> returns. - Recovering risk neutral densities for the valuation of options from the option price - strike price relation. ...|$|R
40|$|Experiment is {{the main}} tool of a researcher. The effect of factors or {{treatments}} can be assessed only by testing them experimentally. Several factors like composition <b>of</b> <b>stock,</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock,</b> feeding level, depth of water and salinity come into play in aquaculture experiments. Sometimes the problem {{may be one of}} developing a low-cost technology which can be gainfully employed by small and marginal farmers. Here again a number of factors under study act and interact. The main difficulty in such situations is that effects of extraneous factors very often mask the real treatment effect. One way to overcome this difficulty is to use homogeneous experimental material. However there are very many practical limitations to achieve such an end. A statically planned experiment attempts to minimise effects of heterogeneity in experimental units from treatment comparison, reduce experimental error, provide unbiased estimates and ensure validity of test of significance. The paper discusses at length the various statistical requirements in experimentation with special reference to coastal aquaculture systems...|$|R

Using several sophisticated frequency domain tests to look for specific patterns in the periodograms of returns series we find nothing or, more precisely, less than nothing. Actually, there is a striking power deficiency, which implies that these series exhibit even fewer patterns than white noise. To unveil the source of this "super-whiteness" we design a simple frequency domain test for characterless, fuzzy alternatives, which are not immediately usable for the construction of profitable trading strategies, and apply it to the same data. Because the power deficiency is now much smaller, we conclude that our puzzling findings may be due to trading activities based on excessive data snooping...|$|R

40|$|Recently, Drăgulescu and Yakovenko {{proposed}} an analytical formula for computing the probability <b>density</b> function <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> log returns, {{based on the}} Heston model, which they tested empirically.

In brief, the Heston model outperformed the Gaussian model only at high frequencies and even so {{does not provide a}} statistically acceptable fit to the data.

Observations which are consistent with recruitment being highly localized.

In the period of 24. 4. [...] 27. 9. 2012 feeding tests in rearing of carp fry (mirror carp) in the ponds system in Milevsko were conducted. The feed mixture with the increased content of nitrogenous compounds at the level of more than 18 % was used in the test. According to results, increasing of individual growth was found at 197 g (45 %), resp. 52 g (25 %) in the higher stocking density when using the Carp - Feed, which is caused by increased growth intensity by 6. 1, resp. 2. 2 % in the relative daily growth and by 0. 22 %, resp. 0. 044 % per day in SGR. The production efficiency of food fluctuated in the range of 0. 95 - 1. 86 in FCR, 0. 54 - 1. 05 in FCE, 0. 45 - 0. 92 in FCR / SGR and 1. 774 - 2. 311 % per day in specific growth rate SGR. The influence of feeding method and stock density on length and weight parameters, exterior and on chemical composition of muscle was statistically significant (P - 0. 05). There was not proved any significant influence on fitness indicators. According to the observed results, it is suitable to use the Carp-Feed feeding system, but higher food consumption and lower individual weights at higher <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>stock</b> have to be considered. That is why the aim of rearing should be set in advance.

40|$|Stochastic {{volatility}} models decompose {{the time}} series of financial returns into {{the product of}} a volatility factor and an iid noise factor. Assuming a slow dynamic for the volatility factor, we show via nonparametric tests that both the index as well as its individual stocks share a common volatility factor. While the noise component is Gaussian for the index, individual stock returns turn out to require a leptokurtic noise. Thus we propose a two-component model for stocks, given by the sum of Gaussian noise, which reflects market-wide fluctuations, and Laplacian noise, which incorporates firm-specific factors such as firm profitability or growth performance, both of which are known to be Laplacian distributed. In the case of purely Gaussian noise, the chi-squared probability for the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>stock</b> returns is typically on the order of 10 - 20, while it increases to values of O(1) by adding the Laplace component...|$|R
40|$|Triploid (sterile) trout {{potentially}} {{offer a more}} risk-averse {{option for}} stocking popular non-native sport fish; however the relative performance (e. g., survival and growth) of triploid versus diploid fish in natural settings is not well understood. I evaluated the relative performance of triploid versus diploid brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) stocked in high mountain Uinta lakes in response to food availability and lake morphology. I chose a set of 9 lakes that included a range of elevation and lake morphology. I observed no difference in CPUE or relative weight (Wr) of both types of trout in all lakes. Food availability (e. g., zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) varied substantially among lakes; however I observed no discernible difference between diploid and triploid diets, diet preference, or isotopic trophic signatures. Physical lake characteristics (e. g., dissolved oxygen [DO, mg/L] and temperature [°C]) were within or near optimal brook trout conditions (metabolically beneficial range) during the summer, but over-winter DO reached near lethal levels under the ice. In sum, between the two strains, I did not observe any significant differences in relative performance measured across a number of indices; however the size distribution of diploid fish was marginally (20 mm) skewed towards larger fish (a difference likely not great enough to be detectable by the average angler). In contrast to the similarity in performance between strains, I did observe considerable variability in performance of brook trout across lakes {{as a function of}} lake productivity, food availability, and most importantly fish density. Fish performance was greater in lakes with a lower <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocked</b> fish. Overall, the results from this study indicate triploid brook trout offer a viable and risk-averse alternative to stocking diploid fish in Uinta mountain lakes.
