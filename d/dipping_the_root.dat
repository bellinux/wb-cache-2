40|$|Silicon (Si) {{is known}} to reduce the {{incidence}} of pathogens on many plants. Little information is available on the potential positive effects of Si on the susceptibility of banana (Musa acuminata) to pathogens. Root-rot fungi of the genus Cylindrocladium have been reported, along with endoparasitic nematodes, to be the causal agent of toppling disease and severe yield loss. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of Si supply on Cylindrocladium spathiphylli infection on banana. Plantlets inoculated by <b>dipping</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> system in a conidial suspension of the pathogen were grown on a desilicated ferralsol and amended, or not, with 2 mM of soluble Si under greenhouse conditions in Guadeloupe. The root lesion severity was evaluated using the image analysis program WinRHIZO 7, 14 and 21 days after inoculation. A reduction of about 50 % of root necrosis was observed 14 days after inoculation for the Si-supplied plants compared with those not supplied with Si. The Si amendment also alleviated growth reduction caused by the pathogen. These results suggest that Si could have a positive effect on banana resistance to C. spathiphylli and provide an environmentally friendly alternative to pesticides for the integrated control of an important crop disease.

5000|$|Management {{practices}} {{consist of}} exclusion, preventive measures, and post-planting nematicide applications. All growers should avoid contaminated nursery rootstocks and use certified nematode-free soil and nematode-free rootstock (it is obligatory in some areas). Nematodes {{can easily be}} removed from seedlings by <b>dipping</b> <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> in 45 C water for 25 min, this kills the nematodes but does not harm the plant. For cultural practices, the container-grown citrus can be treated with steam and soil solarization. Fumigation and nematicides are used to reduced initial population densities. Halogenated hydro-carbons ( [...] MBr,1-3-D and chloropicin) are the most effective. Resistant rootstocks are available and this management strategy is the most useful to suppress nematode population density. Recently, the hybrid rootstock called Swingle citrumelo (Citrus paradisi x P. trifoliata) is highly resistant to the citrus nematode.|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} system {{widely used in}} New Zealand for planting out Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings minimises handling and facilitates the smooth flow of tree stocks from nursery to field, reducing the time between lifting and planting. However, some instances of desiccation have been reported, especially in seedlings {{at the top of}} cartons, and so various methods of minimising this problem were evaluated. Where soil conditions are dry, irrigation of nursery beds can help minimise the early afternoon water deficit. Seedlings lifted early in the morning or late in the afternoon, with their roots dipped in water, and with overnight cool storing, gave the best growth after planting. In one trial, <b>dipping</b> <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of <b>the</b> seedlings from the top third of the carton in water, spraying <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> with water, and folding plastic flaps over <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> in cartons were all beneficial compared with no watering.

40|$|Six {{commercial}} rootstock varieties {{were tested}} for resistance to bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) by <b>dipping</b> <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of seedlings in the bacterial suspension at seedling stage. ‘Shincheonggang’ and ‘B-Blocking’ ranked top and second in resistance to bacterial wilt, respectively. For disease {{index of the}} grafted plants, ‘Dotaerang’ grafted onto ‘Shincheonggang’ was the least, followed by ‘Ultra’, ‘Fighting’, ‘B-Blocking’, ‘Special’, and ‘Connection’ grafts. Thus, disease development on the grafted plants was correlated with resistance of rootstocks. The effect of rootstocks on horticultural characteristics including days to flower of scion was minimum or negligible. In correlation between horticultural characteristics of rootstocks and scions grafted thereon, statistically significant negative correlation was observed in days to flower and fruit height but no significant correlation was observed in yield per plant, fruit diameter and soluble solid content in the fruits. Thus, selection of resistant rootstock varieties that support the growth and yield of scion well is necessary for effective control {{of the disease and}} yield increase...|$|R

The resistance degrees of nine commercial cabbage cultivars to the disease were evaluated. Among them, five cultivars (YR-honam, Ogane, Greenhot, Redmat, and Ccoccoma) showing different resistance to the fungus were selected. Then development of Fusarium wilt of the cultivars according to several conditions including root wounding, dipping period of roots in spore suspension, inoculum concentration, and incubation temperature to develop the disease was investigated. Highly resistant cultivars such as ``YR-honam`` and ``Ogane`` hardly showed change of resistance to <b>the</b> disease by <b>root</b> wounding, dipping period, and inoculum concentration, while disease severity of Fusarium wilt on the cultivars was changed with incubation temperatures (20 ℃, 25 ℃ and 30 ℃).

To start with methods were standardized to rear the insect in the laboratory. Insecticidal crystal protein was extracted from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis grown on the sporulation medium. The specific activity of the insecticidal protein in 50 ml 48 h old culture containing 10 - 9 cells was 2. 5 Î¼g mL- 1. Bioassay was standardized in replicated sets to test the insecticidal property of the toxic protein on Myllocerus larvae by soil drenching and <b>root</b> <b>dip</b> methods.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} to establish an efficient screening method for resistant cucumber to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. The isolate KR 5 was identified as F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum based on molecular analyses of ITS and TEF genes and host-specificity test on cucurbits including melon, oriental melon, cucumber, and watermelon. Then four cucumber and two rootstock cultivars showing different resistance degrees to the Fusarium wilt pathogen KR 5 were selected. And development of Fusarium wilt of the six cultivars according to several conditions, including incubation temperature after inoculation, inoculum concentration, root wounding, and growth stages of seedlings, was investigated. Disease severity of Fusarium wilt on the resistant cultivars was changed with incubation temperatures after inoculation. The resistant cultivars showed the higher resistance when inoculated plants were kept at 25 or 30 oC than at 20 oC. Among four different growth stages of the seedlings, seven-day-old seedling represented the most difference of resistance and susceptibility to Fusarium wilt. From above results, we suggest that an efficient screening method for resistant cucumber to F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum is to <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> non-cut <b>roots</b> of seven-day-old seedlings in spore suspension of 1. 0 × 106 - 1. 0 × 107 conidia/ml and to transplant the seedling into a non-infected soil, and then to incubate the inoculated plants in a growth room at 25 oC for 3 weeks to develop Fusarium wilt...|$|R

40|$|The slug {{parasitic}} nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is {{a lethal}} parasite of several slug species {{and has been}} formulated into a biological agent for farmers and gardeners. The potential effect of P. hermaphrodita to non-target organisms such as earthworms was investigated. P. hermaphrodita did not cause mortality to the earthworms and is a host specific molluscan parasite. In further studies P. hermaphrodita was shown to utilise earthworms to increase dispersal in soil columns. The response of P. hermaphrodita to an array of slug cues was assessed. The nematode responded well to slug mucus (foot and mantle) and faeces but responded weakly to volatile cues. Further experiments exposed P. hermaphrodita to mucus from different molluscan hosts. The nematode responded best to Arion subfuscus but {{the reasons for this}} were not discovered. The slug species Deroceras reticulatum, Milax gagates and Limax pseudoflavus were exposed to P. hermaphrodita. D. reticulatum and M. gagates were highly susceptible to P. hermaphrodita and feeding was strongly inhibited. L. pseudoflavus was not suscepticble to the nematode and did not exhibit signs of feeding inhibition. Nematodes were found in the shell of L. pseudoflavus which may be a defence mechanism to encapsulate invading parasites. Bacterial communities inside P. hermaphrodita grown on different slug species were profiled using PCR and DGGE. P. hermaphrodita did not associate exclusively with one bacterium but with an array of bacterial species. Each profile was different with each batch of nematodes. Field trials were conducted to test novel application strategies aimed at reducing cost of application and decreasing the numbers of nematodes applied. Three applications of 5 nematodes per cm - 2 applied at fourteen day intervals reduced slug damage on day 14, 28 and 35. <b>Dipping</b> of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> plug into a nematode and adhesive agent as well as spraying around plant bases also reduced slug damage.
