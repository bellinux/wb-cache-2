500|$|Ray Winstone plays George [...] "Mac" [...] McHale, a British agent whom Jones worked {{alongside}} in World War II, but has now {{allied with}} the Soviets to resolve financial problems. The character acts as a spin on Sallah and René Belloq – Jones's friend and nemesis, respectively, in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg cast Winstone as he found him [...] "one of the most brilliant actors around", having seen Sexy Beast. Winstone tore his hamstring during filming. [...] "I keep getting these action parts as I’m getting older", he remarked. Like John Hurt, Winstone wished to see the script prior to committing to the film. In interviews on British TV Winstone {{explained that he was}} only able to read the script if it was delivered by courier, who waited while he read the script, and returned to the U.S. with the script once Winstone had read it. His reasoning for wanting to read the script was, [...] "If I'm gonna be in it, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> it." [...] He gave suggestions to Spielberg, including the idea of Mac pretending to be a double agent. He also stated that once filming was completed he had to return the script, such was the secrecy about the film. He was later presented with a copy of the script to keep.|$|E
500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E

She said: [...] "I’m not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I’m {{going to have to}} get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a position where I don’t have to work.

Recording of Easy Come, Easy Go commenced in New York City on 6 December 2007; the album was produced by Hal Willner who had previously recorded Strange Weather in 1997.

A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the Guinness Book of World Records." [...] Monáe's signature look harkens back to dandyism. Citing Grace Jones and Josephine Baker as role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th century look in the classical white and black pattern. Monáe's signature look can also {{be attributed to the}} early days in her career when she was employed as a maid as she revealed in her 2012 Black Girls Rock! Young, Gifted, and Black award acceptance speech. Monáe has been known to distribute her Ten Droid Commandments which encourages her fans to be individuals. The Telegraph also commented on her image as an artist saying [...] "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes." [...] She has described her tuxedos as being a uniform for her career. She also featured in the [...] "Style 100" [...] of InStyle magazine.|$|E
