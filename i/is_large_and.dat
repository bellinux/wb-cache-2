5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale and large-toothed, crinitus is large, dark and large-toothed, regillus <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> dark, and albiventer <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> relatively pale.|$|E
5|$|Both monogamous and {{polygamous}} marriage are practiced, {{and the average}} Cameroonian family <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> extended. In the north, women tend to the home, and men herd cattle or work as farmers. In the south, women grow the family's food, and men provide meat and grow cash crops. Like most societies, Cameroonian society is male-dominated, and violence and discrimination against women is common.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|Immature {{chorionic}} villi <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> {{have more}} central blood vessels; thus, the diffusion distance for gas <b>and</b> nutrient exchange <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, placental function is impaired.|$|R

5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in nine movements, {{three of them}} choral (1, 7, 9), the others alternating arias and recitatives. The orchestra <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> representative, with four trumpets, timpani, two recorders and three oboes, in addition to strings and basso continuo. Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performance.|$|E
5|$|The letters Η, Μ, Ν, and Π, are square, {{the letters}} Ε, Θ, Ο, Σ, and Φ have a round shape. The letters Δ, Ε, Θ, Ο, and {{especially}} Ψ in cruciform, {{are of the}} form characteristic for the late uncial script. Φ <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> bevelled at both ends. The letters were written by an 'elegant and careful' hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E

5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ford {{published}} a complete description of ankylosaurian osteoderms, {{in which he}} recognized the group Struthiosaurinae. Ford's description of Struthiosaurinae {{was based on the}} genus Struthiosaurus. Ford found that Struthiosaurus transylvanicus lacked any remains of the jugal, which makes a jugal scute unknown. The skull roof of T. transylvanicus <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind the orbits. Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the cranium.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> robust. The nasal {{bones are}} short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend {{about as far}} back as the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is an {{important}} element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake {{may lead to a}} condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> includes oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD).|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is fairly}} narrow-bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head lack distinct lobes. The eyes are oval and widely spaced; closely behind are crescent-shaped spiracles with large, boxy projections inside their anterior rims. Each nostril <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels; the outer barbel is thin, while the inner barbel has a spoon-like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base. The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners. There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws, separated by a gap in the middle; the teeth are small, narrow, and pointed. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than}} a third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E

5|$|The {{large size}} of the {{olfactory}} bulbs, {{as well as the}} terminal and olfactory nerves, suggest that Tarbosaurus had a keen sense of smell, as was also the case with Tyrannosaurus. The vomeronasal bulb <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> differentiated from the olfactory bulb, which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed Jacobsen's organ, which was used to detect pheromones. This may imply that Tarbosaurus had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers, since they are not present in any living archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The locust <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> easy {{to breed}} and rear, {{and is used}} as an {{experimental}} model in research studies. It {{has been used in}} evolutionary biology research and to discover to what degree conclusions reached about other organisms, such as the fruit fly (Drosophila) and the housefly (Musca), are applicable to all insects. It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and the ease with which it can be grown and handled.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of the {{lacrimal}} is a rounded square with both faces of the bone are concave. Its contact with the nasal is rather limited in both species. The oval-shaped antorbital fenestra is small, being only 9% the length of the eye socket; its presence is unique to both species of the genus among atoposaurids. Meanwhile, the eye socket <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> oval, being 54% longer than it is tall. The drop-shaped palpebrals project out from the tops of the eye sockets. In both species, the back two-thirds of the inner surface of the palpebral is slightly concave. Both species have a squamosal in which the back third is bevelled; in K. langenbergensis, the outer margin is somewhat convex.|$|E
