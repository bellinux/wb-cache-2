5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Starosta was {{unveiled}} as one of ten new signings made by Colin Todd at League Two side Darlington following their spell in administration. With the club still in financial difficulty however, he left by mutual consent before the season <b>even</b> <b>started</b> as Darlington tried to cut the wage bill. Starosta then spent a spell with Conference North side Alfreton Town, before, seeking a new club, he took up an offer from Australian Victorian Premier League side Dandenong Thunder, where he played on non-contract terms for a period, but soon left citing the poor quality of football on offer. Starosta returned to the UK and signed a short term deal with Frickley Athletic of the Northern Premier League in March 2011, but failed to make an appearance for the club.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs' closer for 1981, Dick Tidrow, had a 3–10 {{season with}} a 5.06 ERA, and as a result, in 1982 Smith, Willie Hernández and Bill Campbell shared closing duties. Smith pitched well and <b>even</b> <b>started</b> five games from mid-June to early July. Significantly, former Cubs star pitcher Ferguson Jenkins {{returned}} to the team in 1982, and became {{a major influence on}} the young reliever; Smith credited Jenkins with simplifying his delivery, introducing him to the slider and forkball, and teaching him how to set up hitters. In what would be the last start of his career, Smith picked up his first major league hit, a home run off eventual Hall of Famer Phil Niekro. Smith managed only two singles {{for the rest of his}} career. He saved 17 games during that season and performed as the regular closer for the Cubs, a position he held for the next five years.|$|E

5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work <b>even</b> <b>started.</b> The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} interorganizational {{collaboration}} has increasingly been emphasized {{as an important}} step for addressing inefficiencies {{in the delivery of}} human services. Among the many benefits of collaboration described by human service authors are the creation of a more consumer-friendly service system, more efficient use of available resources, and avoiding service duplication. During the Spring and Summer of 1996, six focus groups were conducted in Oregon to assess the quality of collaboration between local social service providers and <b>Even</b> <b>Start,</b> a federally funded family literacy program. The federal <b>Even</b> <b>Start</b> legislation required that all <b>Even</b> <b>Start</b> programs collaborate with social service providers in their local communities to improve services for families and avoid duplication of services. This study examined data from the <b>Even</b> <b>Start</b> focus groups using a three-level hierarchical model to determine the approximate level ofcollaboration that existed in each of six <b>Even</b> <b>Start</b> communities.
