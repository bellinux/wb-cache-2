40|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted agreement on how <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> to be used. Many projects {{suffer from a}} mess of exceptions thrown across the system with no defined responsibility for catching them. This paper presents a simple component-based strategy addressing the following points: • How many and which <b>exception</b> classes <b>are</b> useful? • When should an <b>exception</b> <b>be</b> thrown? In Java: should it be a checked or an unchecked <b>exception?</b> • Who <b>is</b> responsible for catching exceptions? • How far may <b>exceptions</b> <b>be</b> thrown? Preconditions are considered in detail. The paper {{is based on the}} experience of many real large software projects. I...|$|R

5|$|Although London {{has many}} ties to Middlesex County, it {{is a totally}} {{separate}} entity; the two have no jurisdictional overlap. The <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> the Middlesex County courthouse and former jail, as the judiciary is administered directly by the province.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the city of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited.

5|$|Most solids {{used are}} {{engineering}} materials consisting of crystalline solids {{in which the}} atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive geometric pattern which {{is known as a}} lattice structure.

5|$|The role of Baroque {{sculpture}} {{was usually}} subordinate, as decorative elements of exteriors and interiors, and on tombstones. A famous <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> the Sigismund's Column of Sigismund III Vasa (1644) {{in front of}} Warsaw's Royal Castle.|$|E
5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the House did not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
