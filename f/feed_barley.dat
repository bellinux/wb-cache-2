40|$|A {{series of}} trials were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> silage to laying hens and broiler breeder pullets on performance, stress and behaviour. In the first study, two trials were conducted each with 20 hens and 2 roosters (n= 176) {{randomly assigned to one of}} 8 community cages. The birds in 4 cages were provided with a nutritionally balanced soy/wheat–based laying hen diet ad libitum, whereas the birds in another 4 cages were given free access to barley silage in addition to the regular laying hen diet. In both trials, the control birds consumed more feed (P 0. 05) were found in regards to egg quality, egg production and bird weights at various ages; however yolk colour was darker by silage treatment in each trial. At the end of each trial, the feather score was improved in silage-fed birds compared to the control birds. It was concluded that <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> silage as a supplement to laying hens can improve their welfare without negatively affecting the egg production and egg quality. A second study was conducted to determine the effect of <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> silage on body weight, stereotypic behaviour, stress and fear on broiler breeder pullets during the brooding and rearing periods. The 3 week old broiler breeder pullets (n= 180) were randomly allocated into 12 straw litter floor pens having 15 birds per pen. The birds in 6 pens were provided with a nutritionally balanced corn/oat-soybean/canola meal-based broiler breeder diet at recommended restricted levels, whereas the birds in another 6 pens were given free access to barley silage in addition to a regular broiler breeder diet. Total DM intake was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) for silage-fed birds compared to their control counterparts without affecting mean body weights. Dietary treatment had no significant effect on bird behaviour with the exception of object pecking behaviour which was reduced with silage feeding. Aggressive and gentle feather pecking behaviour was consistently numerically higher in the control birds than the silage-fed birds, although not significantly. Age affected many of the behaviours recorded in this study. Silage feeding had no significant effect on heterophil to lymphocyte ratios and tonic immobility values indicating that birds in both treatments were not very stressed or fearful. It was concluded that <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> silage to broiler breeder pullets has potential to aid in improving their welfare...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Barley grain (Hordeum vulgare L.) is {{characterized}} by a thick fibrous coat, a high level of ß-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. World production of barley is about 30 % of that of corn. In comparison with corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat. Due to its more rapid starch fermentation rate compared with corn, barley also provides a more synchronous release of energy and nitrogen, thereby improving microbial nutrient assimilation. As a result, <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> can reduce the need for feeding protected protein sources. However, this benefit is only realized if rumen acidity is maintained within an optimal range (e. g., > 5. 8 to 6. 0); below this range, microbial maintenance requirements and wastage increase. With a low pH, microbial endotoxines cause pro-inflammatory responses that can weaken immunity and shorten animal longevity. Thus, mismanagement in <b>barley</b> processing and <b>feeding</b> may make a tragedy from this treasure or pearl of cereal grains. Steam-rolling of <b>barley</b> may improve <b>feed</b> efficiency and post-rumen starch digestion. However, it is doubtful if such processing can improve milk production and feed intake. Due to the need to process barley less extensively than other cereals (as long as the pericarp is broken), consistent and global standards for <b>feeding</b> and processing <b>barley</b> could be feasibly established. In high-starch diets, <b>barley</b> <b>feeding</b> reduces the need for capacious small intestinal starch assimilation, subsequently reducing hindgut starch use and fecal nutrient loss. With its nutritional exclusivities underlined, barley use will be a factual art that can either matchlessly profit or harm rumen microbes, cattle production, farm economics and the environment. </p...|$|R

The genotypes were contrasting not only for different levels of stress tolerance acquired after acclimation but also for a different capacity to induce earlier responses to stress conditions; this was especially evident in variation of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters at high light intensity associated to acclimation temperature and in different sugars accumulation in leaves and roots at low temperature.

A model of least-cost feed rations is {{constructed}} to analyze the marginal value of additional protein content in <b>feed</b> <b>barley.</b> The results indicate that increasing the protein content of <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> above 12 % will not substantially increase the value of barley to feeders. This implies that the establishment and maintenance of a protein premium in the <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> market would tend to result in lower average prices for <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> because the feed value/protein relationship is concave and the market would be sustaining costs that the inherent value of the commodity could not support. Key words: <b>feed</b> <b>barley,</b> least-cost rations, protein. Farmers receive significant premiums for the protein content in wheat.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the ochratoxin contamination of the most important potential sources of OTA. The OTA content of cereal samples for human consumption (36 baking wheat, 16 wheat flour and 6 maize coarse meal samples) and feed grain samples (30 feeding wheat, 32 feeding maize and 20 <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> samples) collected in the mid-phase or at the end of the storage period and of 50 commercial coffee samples was determined. The analyses were performed by immunoaffinity column - high-performance liquid chromatography (IAC-HPLC). The limit of detection of the method was 0. 1 ng/g. Of the wheat samples intended for human consumption, 8. 3 % contained OTA at 0. 29 ng/g on the average (OTA ranges: 0. 12 - 0. 5 ng/g; Table 2). The OTA contamination of wheat flour and maize meal samples for human consumption was similar to that of the baking wheat samples. OTA contamination was found in 26. 7 % of the feeding wheat, 15. 6 % of the feeding maize and 35 % of the <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> samples. The average values and the ranges of OTA levels found in the above samples were 12. 2 and 0. 3 - 62. 8 ng/g, 4. 9 and 1. 9 - 8. 3 ng/g, and 72 and 0. 14 - 212 ng/g, respectively (Table 3). Sixty-six percent of the coffee samples were contaminated with OA (average level: 0. 57 ng/g, ranges: 0. 17 - 1. 3 ng/g; Table 4). OTA contamination of baking wheat samples was found to be relatively low, presumably as a result of the favourable weather at harvest and the optimal storage conditions. Calculations made on the basis of the obtained results show that the daily OTA intake of an adult human from edible cereals is only 6. 7 ng, while the amount taken up with coffee is 4. 1 ng daily. The high prevalence and high levels of OTA contamination in feed grains can be explained by the unfavourable storage conditions, and this finding suggests that OA-related health problems may arise in animals, and that foods of animal origin may be contaminated with this mycotoxin...|$|R
