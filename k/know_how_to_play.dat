5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} game divided into as many parts {{as there are}} months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a {{straight}} line. It {{is a bad thing}} for a woman not to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> for love often comes into being during play.|$|E
500|$|Vanilla Ice {{was briefly}} {{a member of}} a band called Pickin' Scabs, which he {{described}} as being [...] "like a grunge band."

His brother Heini is also a musician, they are now both members of The Dreams. Eirikur learned <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the bass when his brother Heini Corfitz Andersen already <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the guitar, he also <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the guitar. Eirikur worked in a nursery earlier.|$|R

60|$|Yes, {{from their}} door by Mill-tail-Shallow, And up Styles-Lane, and by Front-Street houses, Where stood maids, bachelors, and spouses, Who cheered {{the songs that}} we <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're {{not used to}} hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where {{all of a sudden}} you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|The {{track was}} {{recorded}} {{in the middle of}} 1998 at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, {{along with the rest of}} Guerrilla, and was produced by Super Furry Animals. The band allowed [...] "the music to dictate itself" [...] during recording sessions, choosing to add steel drums on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments [...] "lying around" [...] Real World during recording. The steel drum parts were performed by keyboardist Cian Ciaran, despite the fact he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> them.|$|E
500|$|After Speaker's death, Cobb said, [...] "Terribly depressed. I {{never let}} him know how much I admired him when we were playing against each other... It was only after we finally became {{teammates}} and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker of the underlying respect I had for him." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, [...] "He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the hitters." ...|$|E

500|$|Shira is {{frequently}} shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> She {{described it as}} a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1841, Léon Escudier {{wrote of}} a recital given by Chopin that year, [...] "One {{may say that}} Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the {{sweetness}} with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace." [...] Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed {{that there was no}} set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: [...] "Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm." [...] He further stated: [...] "One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> short notes and long notes, and [...] unlimited dexterity." [...] The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{acknowledged}} the expectations and warned, [...] "I won't be an All-Star this year." [...] He was {{appreciative of the}} support, especially from the Asian-American community, but he preferred to concentrate on his play without all the attention when he had not [...] "proven anything to anybody". Smart saw that Lin was skilled at getting to the paint, but needed to learn to pass because, he said, Lin [...] "couldn't shoot the ball at all". The coach also noticed that Lin always arrived early for practice and left late. Lin studied and rehearsed Steve Nash's and other top point guards' pick-and-roll plays. Frank Hughes of Sports Illustrated wrote that Lin spoke with the occasional [...] "seeds of self-doubt", which he said was uncommon to hear in the NBA. Hughes also found it rare when Lin compared himself to the Phoenix Suns' then-backup point guard Goran Dragić. [...] "Neither of us is a freak athlete, but we're both effective and <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the game," [...] Lin said. Lin and Stephen Curry, the 2009–10 runner-up Rookie of the Year, received more interview requests than any other Warrior. Team officials regularly denied requests for Lin to help him keep his focus. He was approached {{to be the subject}} of documentaries. Smart planned to take pressure off Lin since Lin had a tendency to be hard on himself and get frustrated, but the coach admitted that he once succumbed to the home crowd's wishes and put Lin into a game in the wrong situation.|$|E

500|$|Stuart did {{not escape}} {{violence}} in the ECAHA. On January 12, 1907, the Wanderers faced the Ottawa Senators, a game the Wanderers ultimately won 4–2. Charles Spittal of Ottawa was described as [...] "attempting to split Cecil Blachford's skull", Alf Smith hit Stuart [...] "across the temple with his stick, laying him out like a corpse", and Harry Smith cracked his stick across Ernie [...] "Moose" [...] Johnson's face, breaking Johnson's nose. Stuart was commended for his actions during the game; {{it was said that}} he neither flinched nor retaliated, even after bearing most of the hits. At a league meeting on January 18, the Montreal Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season in response to their actions, but this was voted down {{and the president of the}} league, Fred McRobie, resigned. The next time the Senators visited Montreal for a game, the police arrested Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith, leading to $20 fines for Spittal and Alf, and an acquittal for Harry. Even with the persistent violence, Stuart helped the Wanderers to an undefeated season; they then accepted a challenge from the Kenora Thistles for the Stanley Cup. The Thistles won the series, held in January, but lost a rematch between the teams in March, giving the Cup back to the Wanderers. Stuart participated in both challenges, and though did not score a goal in any of the four games, he was said to have played the best game of his career in the first game of the series, even with a broken finger. Regarded as the most important player on the Wanderers, Stuart was said to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> every position on the ice, and passed his knowledge of the game onto his teammates.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bjelland {{moved from}} Portland to Minneapolis, where she formed Babes in Toyland. She met Lori Barbero at a {{barbecue}} {{not long after}} moving to Minneapolis in the mid-1980s, and convinced her to become a drummer– something that Lori became talented at. The pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, and Babes in Toyland was formed. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: [...] "Lori didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> when I met her. Michelle didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, {{you can use your}} imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like you feel it, from your gut, instead of saying, 'Here's my scales.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{more recent}} times, many pipa players, {{especially}} the younger ones, no longer identify themselves with any specific school.

2500|$|Initially, Baldelli had {{to adjust}} to {{professional}} baseball.

Coming out of high school, I'd just come {{up to the plate and}} swing as hard as I could every time and try to smoke the ball.

2500|$|Dolls bass guitarist Arthur [...] "Killer"Kane {{later wrote}} about Thunders' guitar sound, as he {{described}} arriving outside the rehearsal studio where they were meeting to jam {{together for the first}} time: [...] "I heard someone playing a guitar riff that I myself didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> [...] It was raunchy, nasty, rough, raw, and untamed.

2500|$|This volatility/credit {{dichotomy}} is {{the standard}} practice for valuing convertibles. [...] What makes convertibles so interesting is that, except {{in the case of}} exchangeables (see above), one cannot entirely separate the volatility from the credit. [...] Higher volatility (a good thing) tends to accompany weaker credit (bad). In the case of exchangeables, the credit quality of the issuer may be decoupled from the volatility of the underlying shares. [...] The true artists of convertibles and exchangeables are the people who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> this balancing act.|$|E
2500|$|While {{still in}} high school in Ukiah, California, Davey Havok (vocals), Mark Stopholese (guitar) and Vic Chalker (bass) formed a band called AFI in November 1991. While the meaning of the initialism [...] "AFI" [...] {{currently}} stems from the full title [...] "A Fire Inside," [...] band members have stated that the name formerly originated from the titles [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Anthems for Insubordinates." [...] At the time, the band did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> any instruments. Stopholese suggested his friend, Adam Carson, who had a drum kit join the band. Stopholese learned guitar and Chalker learned bass, but Chalker was soon replaced by Geoff Kresge and AFI made its first EP in recording Dork (1993) with the now defunct band Loose Change, which included future AFI guitarist Jade Puget. AFI's beginnings were somewhat inauspicious, as Davey Havok laughed in a 1999 interview, [...] "We were amazed that we even got our shit together enough to put out a split 7-inch with Jade's band at the time." ...|$|E
