40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to examine {{the performance of a}} group of counties in the Mississippi Delta, referred to as project counties. These are counties that have received economic development assistance over several years from the <b>Delta</b> <b>Project.</b> Their performance is examined relative to a selected set of comparison counties and to the State of Mississippi. <b>Delta</b> <b>Project</b> Counties and Comparison Counties The counties most likely impacted by <b>Delta</b> <b>Project</b> include the following seven Mississippi counties — Bolivar, Coahoma, Holmes, Humphreys, Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington. Eleven counties were selected to be used as comparisons to these Project Counties. The eleven counties include — East Carroll Parish in Louisiana; Chicot, Desha and Phillips counties in Arkansas; and Carroll, Issaquena, Panola, Quitman, Sharkey, Tallahatchie, and Yazoo counties in Mississippi. A cursory examination of the two groups of counties suggests that they are appropriate for comparison with one word of caution. The average population of the <b>Delta</b> <b>Project</b> Counties is a little more than double the average population of the Comparison Counties. (See Figure 1.) Population has been declining in both groups of counties. Per capita income has been increasing over the past 27 years but both groups of counties have maintained remarkably 1 Dr. Fisher is Professor and Extension Economist, Department of Agricultura...|$|R
2500|$|After the 1953 disaster, the Delta Works were constructed, a {{comprehensive}} set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with {{the completion of}} the Maeslantkering. New projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the <b>Delta</b> <b>project</b> was {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising [...] of outer sea-dikes and [...] of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional <b>Delta</b> <b>project</b> dike reinforcements. The <b>Delta</b> <b>project</b> is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. This {{dissertation}} {{gives an}} understanding of principles that can be implemented in a <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. This dissertation consists of a literature review and a case study. The literature review gives a background on principles that can be implemented to improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of a <b>projects</b> <b>department.</b> The effective design of projects {{and the importance of}} establishing specifications have been reviewed. Tools such as business process reengineering can be used to rethink and redesign processes in a <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> to improve its current way of working. Materials requirement planning is another tool {{that can be used in}} a <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> to calculate how many types of a specific product are required at any specific time. Just-in-time planning and control is a philosophy that can be implemented in a <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> to meet demands immediately, thus improving their effectiveness. Quality management tools and techniques can be implemented in a <b>projects</b> <b>department.</b> Total quality management, leadership and teamwork will help to convey good practises, generate interest, ideas and awareness in the department. The literature also explains the importance of ergonomics. Ergonomics in workplaces has an affect on the performance, fatigue and physical strain of the staff. Assessing the <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> and applying ergonomics to it will help the staff of the department to be more efficient and effective in their work. The literature further explains the stages involved in the risk management process. Developing an initial risk management plan is an effective and efficient way to identify and prevent risks at an early stage. The case study is about different principles brought together and implemented in a newly formed <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> to improve its way of work. Principles were identified through surveys that were given to various stakeholders. These principles guided the <b>projects</b> <b>department</b> to be more efficient and effective in their way of work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the <b>Delta</b> <b>project,</b> where usability-oriented method extensions were developed together with and introduced in a systems development company. The steps of the method development work are described with particular emphasis on a case study where the proposed method was used by Programatic in a customer project. Results are presented on the project outcome from Programatic's point of view, and on a participatory observation study of the customer project. The conclusions are that the project was successful and that method development can be usefully described as a process of knowledge construction. 1. Introduction Usability is an increasingly important concept in the software industry. The trend towards usability is most visible in software product marketing, but the interest is growing accordingly in consulting companies.
