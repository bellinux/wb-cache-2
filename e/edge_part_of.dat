Well, {{there was}} a good deal of snow up in the ranges, and my feet got away from me one evening when we were {{crawling}} along the edge of a gully. There was a river and big boulders some five hundred feet below, and I slipped down, clawing at the snow, until I grabbed a little bunch of juniper just on the <b>edge.</b> <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> it tore up, but I got a grip of a better handful, and hung on to it, with most of me swinging over the gully. Charley was stripping off the pack-rope on the slope above, and he was mighty quick, but I knew that bush was coming away with me, and didn't think he could be fast enough. I didn't feel exactly happy, but while I've read that folks think of some astonishing things when they're starting out on the long trail, it wasn't that way with me. I could only remember {{there was a}} man I'd never got even with who'd badly cheated me." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{concept is}} {{proposed}} for achieving {{control on the}} power developed by windmill rotors {{in a wide range}} of wind speeds. The leading <b>edge</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the blade is allowed to deflect in high winds. This results in a stalled rotor which delivers regulated power. Early configurations based on this concept of Self-actuated Leading Edge Spoiler (SLES) were tested in simulated winds in the range: 5 - 17. 5 m/s. The results indicate a feasibility of achieving satisfactory control on rotor output using relatively simple arrangements. One configuration was implemented on a 7. 5 m diameter rotor of an innovative wind pump and it has operated in the field for over five years. Several research possibilities are suggested to exploit the potential of this new concept...|$|E
