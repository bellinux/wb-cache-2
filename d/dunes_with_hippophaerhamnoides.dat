40|$|This letter {{presents}} a self-organising cellular automaton model capable of simulating {{the evolution of}} vegetated <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> multiple types of plant response in the environment. It can successfully replicate hairpin, or long-walled, parabolic <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> trailing ridges as well as nebkha <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> distinctive deposition tails. Quantification of simulated landscapes with eco-geomorphic state variables and subsequent cluster analysis and PCA yields a phase diagram {{of different types of}} coastal dunes developing from blow-outs as a function of vegetation vitality. This diagram indicates the potential sensitivity of dormant dune fields to reactivation under declining vegetation vitality, e. g. due to climatic changes. Nebkha simulations with different grid resolutions demonstrate that the interaction between the (abiotic) geomorphic processes and the biological vegetation component (life) introduces a characteristic length scale on the resultant landforms that breaks the typical self-similar scaling of (un-vegetated) bare-sand dunes...|$|R

50|$|Sand threatens {{buildings}} and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> oil stops their migration, but {{this approach is}} quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats and uses a valuable resource. Sand fences might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs. Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the United Nations Environment Programme. Planting <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> vegetation also helps to stabilise them.|$|R

40|$|With 420 trap-nights we sampled shrews in {{different}} habitats of the Souss-Massa National Park. Crocidura viaria (n= 11) {{was found in}} 5 habitats (cultivated land, wetland, beach <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> Chenopodia, sand <b>dunes</b> <b>with</b> patchy vegetation {{and also in the}} Euphorbia association). No shrews were captured in Eucalyptus forest with undergrowth. Southward from Essaouira, C. viaria is obviously the most frequent species in dense or patchy lowland vegetation. Two other species (C. whitakeri and C. tarfayaensis) which occur in sympatry in the Agadir region were not captured. They live probably not in syntopy with C. viaria and their ecological requirements remain to be studied...|$|R
