40|$|Existing {{artificial}} immune optimization algorithms {{reflect a}} number of shortcomings, such as premature convergence and poor local search ability. This paper proposes a danger-theory-based immune network optimization algorithm, named dt-aiNet. The danger theory emphasizes that <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> generated from changes of environments will guide different levels of immune responses, and the areas around <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> are called <b>danger</b> zones. By defining the danger zone to calculate <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> for each antibody, the algorithm adjusts antibodies’ concentrations through its own <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> and then triggers immune responses of self-regulation. So the population diversity can be maintained. Experimental {{results show that the}} algorithm has more advantages in the solution quality and diversity of the population.

Metabolic and immune related activities converge as main triggers of adenosine accumulation in extracellular space. Adenosine by engaging adenosine A 2 A and A 2 B receptors strongly suppresses innate and adaptive immune responses. Although adenosine receptors are being targeted in preclinical and clinical studies, how different <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> are regulated by adenosine is poorly understood. Here {{we showed that}} adenosine receptor stimulation strongly inhibited inflammatory responses while sparing Type-I interferon responses downstream of different <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> in dendritic cells and macrophages. Mechanistically, <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> associated with MyD 88 -dependent inflammatory pathways such as LPS and CpG but not the <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> associated with IRF 3 /Type-I interferon pathways such as pA:U and cGAMP increase the expression of adenosine A 2 A and A 2 B receptors. Expression of anti-inflammatory NR 4 A 1 was increased after adenosine receptor stimulation {{in the presence of}} TLR ligands known to activate MyD 88 pathway but not in the presence of cGAMP and pA:U. Overall these results indicate that there is a differential modulation of <b>danger</b> <b>signaling</b> by adenosine rather than overall suppression.

40|$|Cobalt alloy debris {{has been}} implicated as causative {{in the early}} failure of some designs of current total joint implants. The ability of implant debris to cause {{excessive}} inflammation via <b>danger</b> <b>signaling</b> (NLRP 3 inflammasome) vs. pathogen associated pattern recognition receptors (e. g. Toll-like receptors; TLRs) remains controversial. Recently, specific non-conserved histidines on human TLR 4 have been shown activated by cobalt and nickel ions in solution. However, whether this TLR activation is directly or indirectly an effect of metals or secondary endogenous alarmins (danger-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs) elicited by <b>danger</b> <b>signaling,</b> remains unknown and contentious. Our study indicates that in both a human macrophage cell line (THP- 1) and primary human macrophages, {{as well as an}} in vivo murine model of inflammatory osteolysis, that Cobalt-alloy particle induced NLRP 3 inflammasome <b>danger</b> <b>signaling</b> inflammatory responses were highly dominant relative to TLR 4 activation, as measured respectively by IL- 1 β or TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 10, tissue histology and quantitative bone loss measurement. Despite the lack of metal binding histidines H 456 and H 458 in murine TLR 4, murine calvaria challenge with Cobalt alloy particles induced significant macrophage driven in vivo inflammation and bone loss inflammatory osteolysis, whereas LPS calvaria challenge alone did not. Additionally, no significant increase (p 500 pg/mL). Therefore, not only do the results of this investigation support Cobalt alloy <b>danger</b> <b>signaling</b> induced inflammation, but under normal homeostasis low levels of hematogenous PAMPs (< 2 pg/mL) from Gram-negative bacteria, seem to have negligible contribution to the <b>danger</b> <b>signaling</b> responses elicited by Cobalt alloy metal implant debris.

During myocardial infarction, sterile inflammation occurs. The danger model is a solid theoretic framework that explains this inflammation as danger associated molecular patterns activate the immune system. The innate immune system can sense <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> through different pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) such as toll-like receptors, nod-like receptors and receptors for advanced glycation endproducts. Activation of a PRR results {{in the production of}} cytokines and the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury. Due to tissue damage and necrosis of cardiac cells, <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> such as extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown products, mitochondrial DNA, heat shock proteins and high mobility box 1 are released. Matricellular proteins are non-structural proteins expressed in the ECM and are upregulated upon injury. Some members of the matricellular protein family (like tenascin-C, osteopontin, CCN 1 and the galectins) have been implicated in the inflammatory and reparative responses following myocardial infarction and may function as <b>danger</b> <b>signals.</b> In a clinical setting, <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> can function as prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarkers and for drug targeting.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{initiate}} {{and control}} immune responses, {{participate in the}} maintenance of immunological tolerance and are pivotal players in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. In patients with autoimmune disease and in experimental animal models of autoimmunity, DCs show abnormalities in both numbers and activation state, expressing immunogenic levels of costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Exogenous and endogenous <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> activate DCs to stimulate the immune response. Classic endogenous <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> are released, activated, or secreted by host cells and tissues experiencing stress, damage, and non-physiologic cell death; and are therefore referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Some DAMPs are released from cells, where they are normally sequestered, during necrosis (e. g. heat shock proteins, uric acid, ATP, HMGB 1, mitochondria-derived molecules). Others are actively secreted, like Type I Interferons. Here we discuss important DAMPs {{in the context of}} autoimmunity. For some, there is a clear pathogenic link (e. g. nucleic acids and lupus). For others, there is less evidence. Additionally, we explore emerging <b>danger</b> <b>signals.</b> These include inorganic materials and man-made technologies (e. g. nanomaterials) developed as novel therapeutic approaches.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and inflammasome activation involves sequential hits. The inflammasome, which cleaves pro-interleukin- 1 beta (pro-IL- 1 beta) into secreted IL- 1 beta, is {{induced by}} endogenous and exogenous <b>danger</b> <b>signals.</b> Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a toll-like receptor 4 ligand, {{plays a role}} in NASH and also activates the inflammasome. In this study, we hypothesized that the inflammasome is activated in NASH by multiple hits involving endogenous and exogenous <b>danger</b> <b>signals.</b> METHODS: Using mouse models of methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH and high-fat diet-induced NASH, we found up-regulation of the inflammasome [including NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP 3; cryopyrin), apoptosis-associated speck-like CARD-domain containing protein, pannexin- 1, and pro-caspase- 1] at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level increased caspase- 1 activity, and mature IL- 1 beta protein levels in mice with steatohepatitis in comparison with control livers. There was no inflammasome activation in mice with only steatosis. The MCD diet sensitized mice to LPS-induced increases in NALP 3, pannexin- 1, IL- 1 beta mRNA, and mature IL- 1 beta protein levels in the liver. We demonstrate {{for the first time that}} inflammasome activation occurs in isolated hepatocytes in steatohepatitis. Our novel data show that the saturated fatty acid (FA) palmitic acid (PA) activates the inflammasome and induces sensitization to LPS-induced IL- 1 beta release in hepatocytes. Furthermore, PA triggers the release of <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> from hepatocytes in a caspase-dependent manner. These hepatocyte-derived <b>danger</b> <b>signals,</b> in turn, activate inflammasome, IL- 1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha release in liver mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: Our novel findings indicate that saturated FAs represent an endogenous danger in the form of a first hit, up-regulate the inflammasome in NASH, and induce sensitization to a second hit with LPS for IL-beta release in hepatocytes. Furthermore, hepatocytes exposed to saturated FAs release <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> that trigger inflammasome activation in immune cells. Thus, hepatocytes play a key role in orchestrating tissue responses to <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> in NASH...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: The inflammasome is a well-characterized inducer of {{inflammation}} in alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). Inflammasome activation requires two signals for mature interleukin (IL) - 1 beta production. Here {{we asked}} whether metabolic <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> trigger inflammasome activation in ASH. METHODS: Wild-type mice, ATP receptor 2 x 7 (P 2 rx 7) -KO mice, or mice overexpressing uricase were fed Lieber-DeCarli ethanol or control diet. We also implemented a pharmacological approach in which mice {{were treated with}} probenecid or allopurinol. RESULTS: The sterile <b>danger</b> <b>signals,</b> ATP and uric acid, were increased in the serum and liver of alcohol-fed mice. Depletion of uric acid or ATP, or lack of ATP signaling attenuated ASH and prevented inflammasome activation and its major downstream cytokine, IL- 1 beta. Pharmacological depletion of uric acid with allopurinol provided significant protection from alcohol-induced inflammatory response, steatosis and liver damage, and additional protection was achieved in mice treated with probenecid, which depletes uric acid and blocks ATP-induced P 2 rx 7 signaling. We found that alcohol-damaged hepatocytes released uric acid and ATP in vivo and in vitro and that these sterile <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> activated the inflammasome in LPS-exposed liver mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the second signal in inflammasome activation and IL- 1 beta production in ASH results from the endogenous <b>danger</b> <b>signals,</b> uric acid and ATP. Inhibition of signaling triggered by uric acid and ATP may have therapeutic implications in ASH...|$|R
40|$|Cells {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} mechanisms {{to counteract the}} onslaught of viral infections. To activate these defenses, the viral threat must be recognized. <b>Danger</b> <b>signals,</b> or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, that are induced by pathogens include double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), viral single-stranded RNA, glycolipids, and CpG DNA. Understanding the signal transduction pathways activated and host gene expression induced by these <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> is vital to understanding virus-host interactions.

40|$|The “danger” {{model of}} {{immunity}} posits that {{the immune system}} is triggered by endogenous <b>danger</b> <b>signals,</b> rather than exogenous non-self signals per se. It has been proposed that <b>danger</b> <b>signals</b> may consist of both intracellular “pre-packed” molecules released from damaged cells and stress-induced proteins. Here we focus on glycosylation aberrancies as a unifying concept for <b>danger</b> <b>signaling.</b> According to this proposition glycosylation patterns reliably reflect cellular phenotypic state and appearance of altered carbohydrate structures may constitute a pivotal phenotypic alteration that alarms the immune system to danger and initiates immunity. Viewed from this vantage point, healthy cells avert immune recognition {{by virtue of their}} normal terminal glycosylation patterns. By contrast, abnormal cells display and release glycoproteins and glycolipids with aberrant terminal glycosylation trees, which in turn immunologically flag these cells. Diverse carbohydrate-binding receptors are expressed on immune cells and are used to detect these phenotypic changes. Thus, in addition to the “pre-packed” and stress-induced signals this glycosylation-based signal represents an endogenous signal reliably reflecting the cell phenotypic status, enabling the immune system to monitor the tissue/cell's physical condition and to respond accordingly...|$|R
