One example of the environment impacting ALs is to consider if damp is present in one's home how that might impact independence in breathing (as damp can be related to breathing impairments); another example, using the [...] "green" [...] application, would be how dressings that are soiled with potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>fluids</b> should be disposed of after removal.|$|E

Hydrophilic or [...] "water-loving" [...] waterstops are {{strips of}} rubber, {{modified}} with a hydrophilic agent (such as bentonite) so they swell {{in the presence}} of moisture to effectively seal concrete construction joints. Hydrophilic strip applied waterstops should not be used in contraction or expansion joints per the instructions of most commercial manufacturers. Hydrophilic waterstops can only be effective if they are allowed to swell; therefore, water must be present to activate the hydrophilic agent. Initial leaking is possible until the waterstop expands to seal the joint. The American Concrete Institute recommends against the use of hydrophilic waterstops for <b>hazardous</b> <b>fluids</b> such as fuels, acids, and process chemicals, as the products may not swell as intended in fluids other than water.|$|E

PVC, PE and TPV waterstops are made continuous for the length of the concrete joint by heat welding, using simple thermoplastic welding equipment. PE and TPV waterstops are generally installed in joints of secondary containment structures to prevent the passage of <b>hazardous</b> <b>fluids</b> other than water such as fuel oils, acids, or process chemicals.The German national standards DIN 18541 [...] and DIN 7865 [...] regulate dimensions and material properties of polymeric waterstops.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea behind}} the article is how to define fire behaviour. The work {{is based on an}} {{analytical}} study of fire origin, its development and spread. The study is based on thermodynamics, heat transfer and the study of hydrodynamics and combustion, which represent the bases of fire dynamics. The article shows a practical example of a leak of hazardous chemicals from a tank. Because of the inflammability of the fluid, fire may start. We have tried to model fire propagation around the Krško power plant, and show what extended surrounding area could be affected. The model also considers weather conditions, in particular wind speed and direction. For this purpose we have used the computer code Safer Trace, which is based on zone models. That means that phenomena are described by physical and empirical equations. An imperfection in this computer code is the inability to consider ground topology. However {{in the case of the}} Krško power plant, topology is not so important, as the plan is located in a relatively flat region. Mathematical models are presented.

Simulating <b>hazardous</b> <b>fluid</b> flows {{with the use of}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is an accepted technique to assess consequences, and construct protective barriers in case of a negative event. Some well-documented flow scenarios with significant properties that need to be further investigated are the buoyancy-dominated plumes, and the multiphase flow from a high pressure liquid CO 2 release. The model that will mimic the turbulence in the system is one of the numerous parameters to be considered when conducting a a fluid flow simulation. This project focuses on evaluating Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence models in the buoyant plumes. The models depend on different filtering techniques for the eddy resolution (temporal and spatial), and the goal is to recognize the main factors and challenges affecting such simulations, by comparing numerical to experimental data. Three different test cases are simulated, one thermal plume, one helium plume, and one CO 2 release. In the thermal plume case, the numerical and the experimental data are closely matching, while for the helium plume the models overpredict the experimental data. The numerical data for CO 2 give insights into a high pressure release from a pipeline rupture, which can be encountered in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) infrastructures. Apart from the choice of the turbulence model, imposing random fluctuations in the inlet of the flow, the grid scale of the setup and the writing interval of the time-averaged data are distinguished as key features with large impact on the simulation efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to examine the}} buoyancy-driven gravitational spreading currents, especially as applied to ocean disposal of wastewater and the accidental release of <b>hazardous</b> <b>fluids,</b> such as liquefied natural gas. A series of asymptotic solutions are used to describe the displacement of a gravitationally driven spreading front during an inertial phase of motion and the subsequent viscous phase. Solutions are derived by a force scale analysis and a self-similar technique for flows in stagnant, homogeneous, or linearly density-stratified environments. The self-similar solutions for inertial-buoyancy currents are found using an analogy to the well-known shallow-water wave propagation equations and also to those applicable to a blast wave in gasdynamics. For the viscous-buoyancy currents the analogy is to the viscous long wave approximation to a nonlinear diffusive wave, or thermal wave propagation. Other similarity solutions describing the initial stage of motion of the flow formed by the collapse of a finite volume fluid are developed by analogy to the expansion of a gas cloud into a vacuum. For the case of a continuous discharge there is initially a starting jet flow followed by the buoyancy-driven spreading flow. The jet mixing zone in such flows is described using Prandtl's mixing length theory. Dimensional analysis is used to derive the relevant scaling factors describing these flows...|$|E

This newly developed model can estimate the vaporization rate and net mass evaporating into the air from a multicomponent non- ideal chemical spill. The work has been divided into two parts. In the first step a generic, dynamic source term model was developed that can handle multicomponent non-ideal mixtures. The applicability of this improved pool model for aqueous ammonia spills was then checked to aid in the offsite consequence analysis of aqueous ammonia spills. The behavior of the chemical released depends on its various inherent properties, ambient conditions and the spill scenario. The different heat transfer mechanisms associated with the pool will strongly depend on the temperature of the liquid pool system at different times. The model accounts for all the temperature gradients within the contained pool and hence helps us establish better estimation techniques for source terms of chemical mixtures. This research work will help obtain more accurate and reliable liquid evaporation rates that become the critical input for dispersion modeling studies...|$|E

The phenomenon of magnetocaloric effect (MCE), or adiabatic temperature change, which is obtained by heating or cooling magnetic materials due to a varying magnetic field, can be exploited {{in the area of}} magnetic refrigeration as a reliable, energy-efficient cooling system. In particular, its applications are being explored primarily in cryogenic technologies as a viable process for the liquefaction of hydrogen. The challenge for magnetic refrigeration is that the necessary MCE is most easily achieved with high magnetic fields (5 - 6 Tesla) provided by superconducting magnets. However, a significant magnetocaloric effect can be exhibited at lower magnetic fields (1 - 2 Tesla) by carefully controlling initial temperature conditions as well as by selecting, preparing and synthesizing the optimal fabrication process of Silicon (Si) wafers.

The {{first part}} of this work is on molecular modeling and simulation of 12 industriallyrelevant pure fluids as well as 12 binary mixtures of these components. Their economicalimportance and hazardous nature is a strong incentive for computer simulations. The investigation of these substances is separated into two groups. The Phosgene groupincludes Hydrogen chloride, Phosgene, Benzene, Chlorobenzene, Ortho-Dichlorobenzeneand Toluene. The Ethylene oxide group contains Ethylene oxide, Ethylene glycol andWater. The underlying force fields for these 12 pure substances are developed in this workon the basis of quantum chemical information on molecular geometry and electrostatics. The molecular models are individually optimized to experimental pure fluid data for vaporpressure and saturated liquid density. A comparison to other molecular models fromthe literature is given. The unlike dispersive interaction is optimized for ten of the 12 studied binary mixtures. Previously unpublished experimental VLE data, measured byBASF in the vicinity of ambient temperature, are predominantly used for these fits. VLEdata, including dew point composition, saturated densities and enthalpy of vaporization,are predicted {{for a wide range of}} temperatures and compositions.
