50|$|Bilirubin {{transport}} {{across the}} hepatocyte may be impaired {{at any point}} between the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin into the cell and transport of conjugated bilirubin into biliary canaliculi. In addition, swelling of cells and oedema due to inflammation cause mechanical obstruction of intrahepatic biliary tree. Hence in hepatocellular jaundice, concentration of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin rises in the blood. In hepatocellular disease, there is usually interference in all major steps of bilirubin metabolism—uptake, conjugation and excretion. However, excretion is the rate-limiting step, and usually impaired to the greatest extent. As a result, conjugated <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> predominates.|$|E

Although {{recent studies have}} shown <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> to be a useful predictor of appendiceal perforation, they did not focus on the value of bilirubin as a marker for acute appendicitis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the value of <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> as a marker for acute appendicitis. A retrospective analysis of appendicectomies performed in two hospitals (n= 472). Data collected included laboratory and histological results. Patients were grouped according to histology findings and comparisons were made between the groups. The mean bilirubin levels were higher for patients with simple appendicitis compared to those with a non-inflamed appendix (p< 0. 001). More patients with simple appendicitis had <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> on admission (30 % vs 12 %) and the odds of these patients having appendicitis were over three times higher (odds ratio: 3. 25, p< 0. 001). <b>Hyperbilirubinaemia</b> had a specificity of 88 % and a positive predictive value of 91 % for acute appendicitis. Patients with appendicitis who had a perforated or gangrenous appendix had higher mean bilirubin levels (p= 0. 01) and were more likely to have <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> (p< 0. 001). The specificity of <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> for perforation or gangrene was 70 %.

Subjects: 2167 term and late preterm infants born in 5 neonatal units in the Lazio region of Italy. Methods: All neonates had simultaneous TcB and total serum bilirubin (TSB) measurements, when jaundice appeared and/or before hospital discharge. TcB and TSB values were plotted on a percentile-based hour-specific transcutaneous nomogram previously developed, to identify the safe percentile able to predict subsequent significant <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> defined as serum bilirubin > 17 mg/dL or need for phototherapy. Results: Fifty-five babies (2. 5 %) developed significant <b>hyperbilirubinaemia.</b> The 50 th percentile of our nomogram was able to identify all babies who were at risk of significant <b>hyperbilirubinaemia,</b> but with a high false positive rate.

40|$|<b>Hyperbilirubinaemia</b> is a {{ubiquitous}} transitional morbidity in {{the vast}} majority of newborns and a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life worldwide. While timely and effective phototherapy and exchange transfusion are well proven treatments for severe neonatal <b>hyperbilirubinaemia,</b> inappropriate or ineffective treatment of <b>hyperbilirubinaemia,</b> at secondary and tertiary hospitals, still prevails in many poorly-resourced countries accounting for a disproportionately high burden of bilirubin-induced mortality and long-term morbidity. As part of the efforts to curtail the widely reported risks of frequent but avoidable bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with significant resource constraints, this article presents a practical framework for the management of late-preterm and term infants (>= 35 weeks of gestation) with clinically significant <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> in these countries particularly where local practice guidelines are lacking. Standard and validated protocols were followed in adapting available evidence-based national guidelines on the management of <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> through a collaboration among clinicians and experts on newborn jaundice from different world regions. Tasks and resources required for the comprehensive management of infants with or at risk of severe <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> at all levels of healthcare delivery are proposed, covering primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and follow-up. Additionally, actionable treatment or referral levels for phototherapy and exchange transfusion are proposed within the context of several confounding factors such as widespread exclusive breastfeeding, infections, blood group incompatibilities and G 6 PD deficiency, which place infants at high risk of severe <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in LMICs, as well as the limited facilities for clinical investigations and inconsistent functionality of available phototherapy devices. the need to adjust these levels as appropriate depending on the available facilities in each clinical setting and the risk profile of the infant is emphasised with a view to avoiding over-treatment or under-treatment. These recommendations should serve as a valuable reference material for health workers, guide the development of contextually-relevant national guidelines in each LMIC, as well as facilitate effective advocacy and mobilisation of requisite resources for the optimal care of infants with <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> at all levels.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionEvery {{investigation}} that can contribute towards {{a diagnosis of}} appendicitis is valuable to the emergency general surgeon. Previous {{research has suggested that}} <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> is a more specific marker for both simple and perforated appendicitis than WBC (white blood count) and CRP (C-reactive protein), but this investigation is not commonly used to help diagnose appendicitis. AimsThis study investigated whether there is an association between <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> and appendicitis. We also reviewed the diagnostic value of bilirubin in perforated vs simple appendicitis, and compared it with the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). MethodsThis single centre, prospective observational study included all patients admitted with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain who had liver function tests performed. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test to compare bilirubin, WBC and CRP levels for normal appendices, simple appendicitis, and perforated appendicitis. Results 242 patients were included in this study, of whom 143 were managed operatively for RIF pain. <b>Hyperbilirubinaemia</b> was significantly associated with appendicitis vs RIF pain of other aetiologies (p <  0. 0001). Bilirubin had a higher specificity (0. 96), than WBC (0. 71) and CRP (0. 62), but a lower sensitivity (0. 27 vs 0. 68 and 0. 82 respectively). <b>Hyperbilirubinaemia</b> was associated with perforated appendicitis vs simple appendicitis with statistical significance (p <  0. 0001).

40|$|Gilbert's {{syndrome}} {{was diagnosed}} in 37 patients with unconjugated <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> without overt haemolysis or structural liver abnormality, {{who had a}} marked reduction in hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity (B-GTA) (as {{compared with that of}} 23 normal subjects). No significant correlation existed in these patients between serum bilirubin level and the values of B-GTA, thus suggesting that factors other than a low B-GTA must influence the degree of <b>hyperbilirubinaemia</b> in Gilbert's syndrome. Studies of 51 Cr erythrocyte survival and 59 Fe kinetics in 10 unselected patients demonstrated slight haemolysis in eight, whereas mild ineffective erythropoiesis was suggested in all from a low 24 -hour incorporation of radioactive iron into circulating red cells. This overproduction of bilirubin resulting from mild haemolysis and perhaps dyserythropoiesis might reflect only an extreme degree of the normal situation.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic phototherapy for preterm (10 mg/dl (typical RR 0. 27; 95 % CI 0. 22 to 0. 33; three studies, 1090 participants) or peak unconjugated serum bilirubin levels > 15 mg/dl (typical RR 0. 13; 95 % CI 0. 07 to 0. 23; four studies, 1116 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of all-cause mortality between the two groups (typical RR 1. 08; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 26; four studies, 3044 participants).
