5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes {{much larger than the}} other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located {{at the back of}} the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement.

5|$|P90 Laserex models:The P90 LV (Laser Visible) and P90 IR (InfraRed) models, both {{of which}} were {{introduced}} in late 1995, have an integrated laser sight manufactured by Laserex Technologies in Australia. The P90 LV model projects an 8 mW visible laser intended {{to be used as a}} low-light shooting aid or for dissuasive effect, while the P90 IR model projects a 4.5 mW infrared laser that can only be seen with night vision equipment.

5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping {{in front of the}} muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} description of Dinocephalosaurus, Li recognized the postorbital {{region and the}} elongated cervical centra as being indicative of {{a close relationship with}} Tanystropheus, which led him to assign it to the Tanystropheidae. However, Rieppel and colleagues subsequently noted characteristics that distinguished Dinocephalosaurus from derived protorosaurs such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos; these include the lack of tapering at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nasal and an unreduced contribution of the ilium to the acetabulum. This led Rieppel and colleagues to consider Dinocephalosaurus as an indeterminate protorosaur, with its neck elongation been convergent upon that of Tanystropheus. Their phylogenetic tree, based on a dataset derived from the separate analyses of Jalil (1997), David Dilkes (1998), and Michael Benton & Jackie Allen (1997), is reproduced below, at left.|$|E

5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, {{there is also a}} deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is {{the expansion of the}} <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E

5|$|Multistage rocket: Although {{there is}} still some {{ambiguity}} as to whether the earliest rockets of the 13th century were first developed in Europe (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a fire lance), the Middle East (i.e. 'sahm al-Khitāi' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-Rhammāh in 1280) or China (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong' mortar used by the armies of the Song Dynasty and invading Mongols during the 1270s), during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) the term 'fire arrow' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the Tang Dynasty was then used to describe the true rocket, producing a headache, as Needham says, for historians; the Huolongjing written by military officer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and the Song dynasty Chinese philosopher and politician Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) described several types of rockets, one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched from beneath the water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed booster rockets that, when about to burn out of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missile shaped as a dragon's mouth.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising {{the performance of the}} car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
