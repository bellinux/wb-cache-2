5|$|Ron Swanson {{had been}} {{director}} of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{for six years}} at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch Libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> taxpayer money. Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government. Ron puts almost no effort into his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do {{the vast majority of}} the work.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time and they should return to Washington.|$|E

25|$|Sign {{epistasis}} {{occurs when}} one mutation has {{the opposite effect}} when {{in the presence of}} another mutation. This occurs when a mutation that is deleterious on its own can enhance the effect of a particular beneficial mutation. For example, a large and complex brain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> energy without a range of sense organs, however sense organs can be more useful if the organism's brain is better able to process the information.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the government's assurances that seats will be increased in the institutes so that the general category students don't get affected, another point raised against reservation {{is that most of}} the seats reserved for SC/ST candidates remain empty and hence any more reservation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> resources. A major concern among them is also the fact that implementing reservation in institutes of higher education would be difficult unless the quality of faculty in them is diluted. They back this point by the fact that all IITs and IIMs are facing shortage of faculty and hence increasing the seats will lead to deterioration of education. For example, while IIT Kharagpur requires 667 faculties, it currently has only 470. Similarly, IIT Bombay has just 401 faculties as against the required 529.|$|E
5000|$|Another idea in {{this vein}} is the {{creation}} of [...] "attention bonds," [...] small warranties that some information will not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> the recipient's time, placed into escrow at the time of sending [...] Like the granters of interrupt rights, receivers could cash in their bonds to signal to the sender that <b>a</b> given communication <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> their time or elect not to cash them in to signal that more communication would be welcome.|$|R

25|$|Inequality in {{land and}} income {{ownership}} is {{negatively correlated with}} subsequent economic growth. A strong demand for redistribution will occur in societies where a large section of the population does {{not have access to}} the productive resources of the economy. Rational voters must internalize such issues. High unemployment rates have a significant negative effect when interacting with increases in inequality. Increasing inequality harms growth in countries with high levels of urbanization. High and persistent unemployment also has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment may seriously harm growth because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> resources, because it generates redistributive pressures and distortions, because it depreciates existing human capital and deters its accumulation, because it drives people to poverty, because it results in liquidity constraints that limit labor mobility, and because it erodes individual self-esteem and promotes social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies to control unemployment and reduce its inequality-associated effects can strengthen long-run growth.|$|E

500|$|In 2016 in Saudi Arabia, Grand Mufti Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh {{issued a}} {{religious}} fatwa declaring that chess is banned for Muslims. He stated that [...] "chess <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time {{and an opportunity}} to squander money. It causes enmity and hatred between people". However, this fatwa is not legally binding and chess remains a popular game in Muslim countries.|$|E

500|$|... "Beat It 2008" [...] {{received}} generally unfavorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{claimed that the}} song was a [...] "contender for the year's most pointless musical moment". AllMusic criticized Fergie for [...] "parroting the lyrics of [...] "Beat It" [...] back to a recorded Jackson". Blenders Kelefa Sanneh {{also noted that the}} Black Eyed Peas singer traded lines with Jackson. [...] "Why?", she queried. Todd Gilchrist was thankful that the remix retained Eddie Van Halen's [...] "incendiary guitar solo", but added that the song [...] "holds the dubious honor of making Jackson seem masculine for once, and only in the context of Fergie's tough-by-way-of-Kids Incorporated interpretation of the tune". Tom Ewing of Pitchfork observed that Fergie's [...] "nervous reverence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time".|$|E
500|$|Phil Harrison of Time Out {{said that}} [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] feels [...] "slightly anodyne despite its sweetly vicious climax." [...] Gail Mitchell of Billboard {{magazine}} {{described it as}} [...] "slick, [...] wicked". Mike Joseph of PopMatters was much less impressed, giving the song a negative review: [...] "The dreary 'Kitty Kat' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> four minutes of my time. Pharrell Williams, who produced this song, needs {{to be told that}} his glory days are two years behind him if not more." [...] This was somehow echoed by Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic who wrote: [...] "Pharrell's other contribution to the album is the regrettably plain 'Kitty Kat,' a slower track that gives further credence to the view that he cannot cope when thrust outside his comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{continues}} to despair over the murder case of 11-year-old Adena Watson, which {{he failed to}} solve. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) orders Bayliss and Pembleton {{to move on and}} take new cases, they are assigned to solve the murder of Jake, a police dog. Bayliss thinks it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time, but according to municipal law, the death of a city-owned animal is treated as an official investigation, and Pembleton decides to take the case seriously. The dog's gums are extremely red, and Pembleton believes he may have been poisoned or gassed. They question local dog pound employee Penny (Joy Ehrlich),who admits she accidentally killed Jake with carbon monoxide after mixing him up with another dog, then dumped the body in a panic. John Kuehn (Nick Olcott), Jake's human [...] "partner", scatters Jake's ashes in a lake and Bayliss, reminded of Adena Watson, reacts emotionally.|$|E

500|$|While some {{conflict}} approaches also gained {{popularity in}} the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted {{to a variety of}} empirically oriented middle-range theories with no single overarching, or [...] "grand", theoretical orientation. John Levi Martin refers to this [...] "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" [...] as the Pax Wisconsana, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. Omar Lizardo describes the Pax Wisconsana as: [...] "a Midwestern flavored, Mertonian resolution of the theory/method wars in which [...] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) grand theory' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time; (2) [...] good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin." [...] Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.|$|E
500|$|During the Utopia storyline, the X-Men {{leave their}} San Francisco base and {{establish}} the island [...] "Utopia" [...] for mutants on {{the remains of}} Asteroid M. [...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> time since they could just buy their food from a store. [...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him {{that this was not}} a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E
500|$|Leslie seeks {{advice from}} city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who feels {{the project would}} prove {{practically}} impossible due to the logistics and bureaucratic red tape, but Leslie is undeterred. Leslie later fondly tells the documentary crew that she and Mark made love five years ago, but Mark only vaguely recalls the encounter. Leslie, Tom and uninterested intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) visit Ann and meet Andy, a lazy and demanding musician whom she is forced to wait on and support financially. Afterward, Leslie and Ann visit the pit, which Leslie accidentally falls into as Tom and April make fun of her. Ann quickly provides medical assistance. Afterward, Leslie leaves, and Ann tells the documentary crew, [...] "She's a little doofy, but she's sweet". Some time later, Leslie asks her boss Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) for permission to form an exploratory committee for the pit project. Ron initially refuses, but eventually agrees to consider it so that Leslie will leave his office. Ron explains {{that he does not}} want the Parks Department to build any parks because he believes government <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> money, and that all government should be privatized and run by corporations for profit. Leslie repeatedly pesters Ron about the park project, but he refuses to commit.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1943 {{a policy}} change was mooted to remove female {{officers}} from the technical musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these roles. In opposing this, Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore John McCauley. She told McCauley, [...] "I contend that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> money and training to take women cipher officers, women from Signals (S4) and casualty... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job", and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions, and not simply for administration and welfare. McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to Air Vice Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones backed Lukis' authority, and the latter sent what Joyce Thomson described as a [...] "stinging rebuke" [...] to Stevenson, who was forced to apologise. In any event, women officers continued to be employed in technical positions as the WAAAF expanded {{over the next two}} years, peaking in strength at 18,667 members in October 1944. As of July that year, women comprised thirty-one per cent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one trades, all previously occupied by men. By {{the end of the war}} around 27,000 women had served in the WAAAF.|$|E
500|$|On several occasions, {{people within}} the {{television}} and entertainment industry have suggested that Holby City <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> the television licence fee, with some suggesting that {{it ought to be}} cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being [...] "humdrum" [...] and [...] "formulaic", saying of Holby City and the police procedural Mersey Beat: [...] "One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different." [...] Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were [...] "highly selective" [...] as well as [...] "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like Holby City – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told The Guardian: [...] "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons." [...] Also in 2002, David Cox of the New Statesman criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing Holby City against a contemporary version of Othello. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: [...] "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should know. If that has gone, then the licence fee should go too." [...] At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that Holby City be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: [...] "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold." [...] In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of Holby City, and in January 2010, Janet Street-Porter of The Independent, opined Holby City had [...] "come to the end of [...] natural life" [...] and should be cancelled.|$|E
