5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and descenders.

Darwin found lectures <b>dull</b> <b>and</b> surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.|$|E
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is <b>dull</b> <b>and</b> grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was <b>dull</b> <b>and</b> the game lacked longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment that few people remember it. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated that while it lacked excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable.

5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it <b>dull</b> <b>and</b> switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} of the Escape sections. Edge and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were satisfying to solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them <b>dull</b> <b>and</b> uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were awkward and oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the user interface was improved from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Many reviewers praised the flowchart for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or restart the game from the beginning, but Boosinger and Edge criticized it for removing the tension of making wrong decisions.|$|E

It leaves out the risqué sections as well as chapters that young readers might consider <b>dull,</b> <b>and</b> embellishes {{a great deal on}} Cervantes's original text. The title page actually gives credit to the two editors {{as if they were the}} authors, and omits any mention of Cervantes.|$|E
