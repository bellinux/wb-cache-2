40|$|Single-molecule {{manipulation}} experiments {{of molecular}} motors provide essential {{information about the}} rate and conformational changes of {{the steps of the}} reaction located along the manipulation coordinate. This information is not always sufficient to define a particular kinetic cycle. Recent single-molecule experiments with optical tweezers showed that the DNA unwinding activity of a Phi 29 DNA polymerase mutant presents a complex pause behavior, which includes short and long pauses. Here we show that different kinetic models, considering different connections between the active and the pause states, can explain the experimental pause behavior. Both the two independent pause model and the two connected pause model are able to describe the pause behavior of a mutated Phi 29 DNA polymerase observed in an optical tweezers single-molecule experiment. For the two independent pause model all parameters are fixed by the observed data, while for the more general two connected pause model there is a range of values of the parameters compatible with the observed data (which can be expressed in terms of two of the rates and their force dependencies). This general model includes models with <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> and exit to the long-pause state, and also models with cycling in both directions. Additionally, assuming that detailed balance is verified, which forbids cycling, this reduces the ranges of the values of the parameters (which can then be expressed in terms of one rate and its force dependency). The resulting model interpolates between the independent pause model and the <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> and exit to the long-pause state mode...|$|E

40|$|Economy-wide {{increasing}} {{returns to scale}} embodied in a general purpose technology (GPT) and its applications are often a key source of long-run growth. Yet the successful exploitation of {{increasing returns}} calls for coordination on a particular technological direction, reducing flexibility and choice ex post and potentially creating a growth bottleneck. When the bottleneck is controlled by a single firm, the resulting entry barriers reduce the ability of demanders to choose superior, alternative technologies. We examine how such a growth bottleneck can eventually be overcome under certain key conditions. Demand must be fundamentally diverse so that the original GPT does not serve all demanders. Firms barred from entry into the primary GPT market can then reallocate innovative resources to create new markets to meet the unserved demand. The demand in these new markets must be valuable enough (even if not as valuable as in the primary GPT market) to generate a positive-feedback cycle that results in considerable technical advance in the alternative GPT. This ultimately can lead to <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> by the alternative GPT into the original GPT market if and when it becomes strong enough {{to compete with the}} original GPT. This sequence of (i) increasing returns to scale around a GPT, (ii) reallocation of innovative resources around growth bottlenecks, and (iii) <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> has growth implications. A large contribution to growth follows the exploitation of increasing returns to scale in the original GPT. Much later, another large contribution to growth follows when demand is finally met by an alternative, competitive GPT. Between these two periods falls a period of lesser contributions to growth due to the dominant firm bottleneck. The market-based resolution of the bottleneck is not merely a theoretical possibility. We illustrate the role of this sequence in the two most important technologies for automating white-collar work of the past 50 years. Copyright 2010 The Author 2010.

40|$|Modeling the {{magnitude}} and distribution of sediment-bound pollutants in estuaries is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the site and inadequate sample density. To address these modeling limitations, a decision-support tool framework was conceived that predicts sediment contamination from the sub-estuary to broader estuary extent. For this study, a Random Forest (RF) model was implemented to predict the distribution of a model contaminant, triclosan (5 -chloro- 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenol) (TCS), in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. TCS is an unregulated contaminant used in many personal care products. The RF explanatory variables were associated with TCS transport and fate (proxies) and direct and <b>indirect</b> environmental <b>entry.</b> The continuous RF TCS concentration predictions were discretized into three levels of contamination (low, medium, and high) for three different quantile thresholds. The RF model explained 63 % of the variance with a minimum number of variables. Total organic carbon (TOC) (transport and fate proxy) was a strong predictor of TCS contamination causing a mean squared error increase of 59 % when compared to permutations of randomized values of TOC. Additionally, combined sewer overflow discharge (environmental entry) and sand (transport and fate proxy) were strong predictors. The discretization models identified a TCS area of greatest concern in the northern reach of Narragansett Bay (Providence River sub-estuary), which was validated with independent test samples.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how psychic distance affects the internationalization process, foreign market entry (FME), and entry mode choice of Finnish small and medium-sized family enterprises (family SMEs) operating in France. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports findings from an in-depth case study covering four Finnish manufacturing family SMEs operating in the French market. The data were analyzed using the Uppsala model and distance creating and distance-bridging factors encountered in the FME to France. Findings – The findings reveal that the family SMEs mainly followed a sequential process and favored <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> modes before entering the French market. The French market was psychically distant, but the case firms were able to overcome the distance by using different distance-bridging factors. Based on the findings, it can be argued that psychic distance has an especially important role in the internationalization and the FME of family SMEs, mainly because of their general cautiousness caused by family presence. Research limitations/implications – Although the case study method made it possible to acquire detailed knowledge about the firms' internationalization, the findings can be generalized only to some extent. Practical implications – Managers of family SMEs and family members should be provided with the capacity to overcome distance-creating factors, they might encounter in their FME. The decision to internationalize is a strategic change that will most probably change the historical harmony of the firm. Originality/value – Prior research has mainly focused only on general internationalization pathways of family SMEs. In addition and contrast to the previous studies, this paper investigates the role of perceived psychic distance in family SMEs' FME and entry mode choice in a certain target market...|$|E
40|$|The three {{works of}} Procopius of Caesarea, the History of the Wars, the Buildings and the Secret History, form a corpus {{which can be}} profitably studied as a whole. My thesis is a {{typology}} of the visual in Procopius’ corpus, which is embedded {{in a study of}} narrative technique. It concerns itself with the representation of material reality and the complex relationship between materiality and the text. It utilises the digressive and the descriptive as an <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> point to expose Procopius’ literary finesse and his use of poikilia. 	 In {{the first half of this}} thesis, the main object of my study is the representation of the material world in Procopius. The first chapter is devoted to the first book of the Buildings as it depicts the city of Constantinople. The second chapter moves to the representation of space and the third chapter to that of objects of all sizes and kinds. From these three different angles, I demonstrate how the visual is deeply charged with both ideological and meta-textual intentions. 	 The second half of the thesis goes beyond materiality to examine what I discuss as the imaginaire of Procopius. The fourth chapter examines the way violence is depicted in a material and spectacular manner as well as its meta-textual implications, and the fifth and final chapter addresses the omnipresence of the supernatural in the corpus as well as Procopius’ self-representation as narrator and character. While preoccupied to some extent with ideological and political concerns, this thesis is first and foremost centred on the text itself and how its relationship to the description of material culture throws light on a crucial author on the cusp between the classical and the medieval imaginaire, one of the most significant authors in Byzantine literary culture.

40|$|Acid-sensing ion {{channels}} (ASICs) are non-voltage-gated sodium channels {{activated by}} an extracellular acidification. They are widely expressed in neurons {{of the central}} and peripheral nervous system. ASICs {{have a role in}} learning, the expression of fear, in neuronal death after cerebral ischemia, and in pain sensation. Tissue damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators. There is a subpopulation of sensory neurons which are able to release the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). Neurogenic inflammation refers to the process whereby peripheral release of the neuropeptides CGRP and SP induces vasodilation and extravasation of plasma proteins, respectively. Our laboratory has previously shown that calcium-permeable homomeric ASIC 1 a channels are present in a majority of CGRP- or SP-expressing small diameter sensory neurons. In the first part of my thesis, we tested the hypothesis that a local acidification can produce an ASIC-mediated calcium-dependant neuropeptide secretion. We have first verified the co-expression of ASICs and CGRP/SP using immunochemistry and in-situ hybridization on dissociated rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We found that most CGRP/SP-positive neurons also expressed ASIC 1 a and ASIC 3 subunits. Calcium imaging experiments with Fura- 2 dye showed that an extracellular acidification can induce an increase of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, which is essential for secretion. This increase of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration is, at least in some cells, ASIC-dependent, as it can be prevented by amiloride, an ASIC antagonist, and by Psalmotoxin (PcTx 1), a specific ASIC 1 a antagonist. We identified a sub-population of neurons whose acid-induced Ca 2 + entry was completely abolished by amiloride, an amiloride-resistant population which does not express ASICs, but rather another acid-sensing channel, possibly transient receptor potential vanilloïde 1 (TRPV 1), and a population expressing both H+-gated channel types. Voltage-gated calcium channels (Cavs) may also mediate Ca 2 + entry. Co-application of the Cavs inhibitors (ω-conotoxin MVIIC, Mibefradil and Nifedipine) reduced the Ca 2 + increase in neurons expressing ASICs during an acidification to pH 6. This indicates that ASICs can depolarise the neuron and activate Cavs. Homomeric ASIC 1 a are Ca 2 +-permeable and allow a direct entry of Ca 2 + into the cell; other ASICs mediate an <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> of Ca 2 + by inducing a membrane depolarisation that activates Cavs. We showed with a secretion assay that CGRP secretion can be induced by extracellular acidification in cultured rat DRG neurons. Amiloride and PcTx 1 were not able to inhibit the secretion at acidic pH, but BCTC, a TRPV 1 inhibitor was able to decrease the secretion induced by an extracellular acidification in our in vitro secretion assay. In conclusion, these results show that in DRG neurons a mild extracellular acidification can induce a calcium-dependent neuropeptide secretion. Even if our data show that ASICs can mediate an increase of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, this appears not to be sufficient to trigger neuropeptide secretion. TRPV 1, a calcium channel whose activation induces a sustained current - in contrary of ASICs - played in our experimental conditions a predominant role in neurosecretion. In the second part of my thesis, we focused on the role of ASICs in neuropathic pain. We used the spared nerve injury (SNI) model which consists in a nerve injury that induces symptoms of neuropathic pain such as mechanical allodynia. We have previously shown that the SNI model modifies ASIC currents in dissociated rat DRG neurons. We hypothesized that ASICs could {{play a role in the}} development of mechanical allodynia. The SNI model was performed on ASIC 1 a, - 2, and - 3 knock-out mice and wild type littermates. We measured mechanical allodynia on these mice with calibrated von Frey filaments. There were no differences between the wild-type and the ASIC 1, or ASIC 2 knockout mice. ASIC 3 null mice were less sensitive than wild type mice at 21 day after SNI, indicating a role for ASIC 3. Finally, to investigate other possible roles of ASICs in the perception of the environment, we measured the baseline heat responses. We used two different models; the tail flick model and the hot plate model. ASIC 1 a null mice showed increased thermal allodynia behaviour in the hot plate test at three different temperatures (49, 52, 55 °C) compared to their wild type littermates. On the contrary, ASIC 2 null mice showed reduced thermal allodynia behaviour in the hot plate test compared to their wild type littermates at the three same temperatures. We conclude that ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 in mice can play a role in temperature sensing. It is currently not understood how ASICs are involved in temperature sensing and what the reason for the opposed effects in the two knockout models is...|$|E

30|$|Taxi {{services}} were unregulated {{when they first}} began over a century ago; regulation {{was brought in to}} protect road users from the safety impacts of poor driving and the sometimes violent conduct of drivers vying for business [38]. But the regulation, which initially took the form of limiting the number of drivers, developed {{in a variety of ways}} over time and location. According to Bekken [4], writing before the advent of Uber and its ilk, there are three categories: direct barriers to entry (principally quantitative and qualitative regulations on the operators); <b>indirect</b> barriers to <b>entry</b> (of which driver requirements and vehicle requirements are obvious examples); and fare regulations. This is close to the four-fold structure adopted by International Transport Forum Corporate Partnership Board [27] in its deliberations: public safety rules (including insurance); market entry conditions; service requirements; and fares. In this context, Darbéra [11] offers a useful clarification based on the distinction between the French words régulation and réglementation: regulation is the business of ensuring that a given market “works” in some agreed sense by imposing a set of economic controls. Deregulation, the removal of some or all of those controls, will not tend to mean the disappearance of all rules and laws (réglementation), and will probably instead imply a range of new ones to promote competition.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this Thesis {{analyzes}} the impact of financial constraints (FC) on industrial structure. Chapter 1 presents a model that disentangles several effects of FC on entry, turnover, productivity and firms size distribution. The framework is applied in Chapter 2 which develops an industry equilibrium model of vertical integration under contractual imperfections with specific input suppliers and external investors. I assume that vertical integration economizes on the needs for contracts with specific input suppliers at the cost of higher financial requirements. I show that the two forms of contractual imperfections have different effects on the degree of vertical integration, and that contractual frictions with external investors affect vertical integration through two opposing channels: a direct negative, investment, effect and an <b>indirect</b> positive, <b>entry,</b> effect. Using cross-country- industry data, I present novel evidence on the institutional determinants of international differences in vertical integration which is consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. In particular, I show' that countries with more developed financial systems are relatively more vertically integrated in industries that are dominated by large firms. The second part (Chapter 3) asks whether vertical integration reduces or increases transaction costs with external investors. I build a model in which a seller produces a good that can be used by a buyer, or sold on a spot market. The buyer and the seller have no cash, need to finance investments for production, and can not foresee in advance whether the input is most efficiently traded on the spot market or among each other. I assume that ownership of physical assets gives control over contracting rights to those assets, that financial streams get transferred with ownership and that returns can not be perfectly verified. The net balance of {{the costs and benefits of}} integration in terms of pledgeable income depends on the relative intensities of a positive "profits-pooling" effect against a negative "de-monitoring" effect. I find that larger projects, more specific assets, and low' investors protection are determinants of vertical integration. I discuss joint liability contracts between non integrated firms and how contractual externalities among investors favor integration...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{medicines}} (VMs) from {{agricultural industry}} {{can enter the}} environment {{in a number of}} ways. This includes direct exposure through aquaculture, accidental spillage and disposal, and <b>indirect</b> <b>entry</b> by leaching from manure or runoff after treatment. Many compounds used in animal treatments have ecotoxic properties that may have chronic or sometimes lethal effects when they come into contact with non-target organisms. VMs enter the environment in mixtures, potentially having additive effects. Traditional ecotoxicology tests are used to determine the lethal and sometimes reproductive effects on freshwater and terrestrial organisms. However, organisms used in ecotoxicology tests can be unrepresentative of the populations that are likely to be exposed to the compound in the environment. Most often the tests are on single compound toxicity but mixture effects may be significant and should be included in ecotoxicology testing. This work investigates the use, measured environmental concentrations (MECs) and potential impact of sea lice treatments on salmon farms in Scotland. Alternative methods for ecotoxicology testing including mixture toxicity, and the use of in silico techniques to predict the chronic impact of VMs on different species of aquatic organisms were also investigated. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) provided information on the use of five sea lice treatments from 2008 - 2011 on Scottish salmon farms. This information was combined with the recently available data on sediment MECs for the years 2009 - 2012 provided by SEPA using ArcGIS 10. 1. In depth analysis of this data showed that from a total of 55 sites, 30 sites had a MEC higher than the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) as set out by SEPA for emamectin benzoate and 7 sites had a higher MEC than MAC for teflubenzuron. A number of sites that were up to 16 km away from the nearest salmon farm reported as using either emamectin benzoate or teflubenzuron measured positive for the two treatments. There was no relationship between current direction and the distribution of the sea lice treatments, nor was there any evidence for alternative sources of the compounds e. g. land treatments. The sites that had MECs higher than the MAC could pose a risk to non-target organisms and disrupt the species dynamics of the area. There was evidence that some marine protected sites might be at risk of exposure to these compounds. To complement this work, effects on acute mixture toxicity of the 5 sea lice treatments, plus one major metabolite 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 PBA), were measured using an assay using the bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri. When exposed to the 5 sea lice treatments and 3 PBA A. fischeri showed a response to 3 PBA, emamectin benzoate and azamethiphos as well as combinations of the three. In order to establish any additive effect of the sea lice treatments, the efficacy of two mixture prediction equations, concentration addition (CA) and independent action ii(IA) were tested using the results from single compound dose response curves. In this instance IA was the more effective prediction method with a linear regression confidence interval of 82. 6 % compared with 22. 6 % of CA. In silico molecular docking was carried out to predict the chronic effects of 15 VMs (including the five used as sea lice control). Molecular docking has been proposed as an alternative screening method for the chronic effects of large animal treatments on non-target organisms. Oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) of 7 non-target bony fish and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis were modelled using SwissModel. These models were then ‘docked’ to oestradiol, the synthetic oestrogen ethinylestradiol, two known xenoestrogens dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and bisphenol A (BPA), the antioestrogen breast cancer treatment tamoxifen and 15 VMs using Auto Dock 4. Based on the results of this work, four VMs were identified as being possible xenoestrogens or anti-oestrogens; these were cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenbendazole and teflubenzuron. Further investigation, using in vitro assays, into these four VMs has been suggested as future work. A modified recombinant yeast oestrogen screen (YES) was attempted using the cDNA of the ERα of the zebrafish Danio rerio and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Due to time and difficulties in cloning protocols this work was unable to be completed. Use of such in vitro assays would allow for further investigation of the highlighted VMs into their oestrogenic potential. In conclusion, VMs used as sea lice treatments, such as teflubenzuron and emamectin benzoate may be more persistent and have a wider range in the environment than previously thought. Mixtures of sea lice treatments have been found to persist together in the environment, and effects of these mixtures on the bacteria A. fischeri can be predicted using the IA equation. Finally, molecular docking may be a suitable tool to predict chronic endocrine disrupting effects and identify varying degrees of impact on the ERα of nine species of aquatic organisms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) methodology, {{originally}} developed by Talairach and Bancaud, is progressively gaining popularity for the presurgical invasive evaluation of drug-resistant epilepsies. Objective: To describe recent SEEG methodological implementations {{carried out in}} our center, to evaluate safety, and to analyze in vivo application accuracy in a consecutive series of 500 procedures {{with a total of}} 6496 implanted electrodes. Methods: Four hundred nineteen procedures were performed with the traditional 2 -step surgical workflow, which was modified for the subsequent 81 procedures. The new workflow entailed acquisition of brain 3 -dimensional angiography and magnetic resonance imaging in frameless and markerless conditions, advanced multimodal planning, and robot-assisted implantation. Quantitative analysis for in vivo entry point and target point localization error was performed on a sub-data set of 118 procedures (1567 electrodes). Results: The methodology allowed successful implantation in all cases. Major complication rate was 12 of 500 (2. 4 %), including 1 death for <b>indirect</b> morbidity. Median <b>entry</b> point localization error was 1. 43 mm (interquartile range, 0. 91 - 2. 21 mm) with the traditional workflow and 0. 78 mm (interquartile range, 0. 49 - 1. 08 mm) with the new one (P < 2. 2 × 10). Median target point localization errors were 2. 69 mm (interquartile range, 1. 89 - 3. 67 mm) and 1. 77 mm (interquartile range, 1. 25 - 2. 51 mm; P < 2. 2 × 10), respectively. Conclusion: SEEG is a safe and accurate procedure for the invasive assessment of the epileptogenic zone. Traditional Talairach methodology, implemented by multimodal planning and robot-assisted surgery, allows direct electrical recording from superficial and deep-seated brain structures, providing essential information in the most complex cases of drug-resistant epilepsy.

40|$|When interpreted, {{sometimes}} treaties have to {{go through}} a trial by fire and are found either to be ‘living instruments’ evolving alongside the relevant changes both in law and in facts or to have a ‘fixed’ meaning. The aim of the present article is to examine how temporal considerations find their way into the interpretative process and what are the effects on the treaties being interpreted. Do these changes in law and fact actually change the treaty itself, or are they merely a latent quality already existing in the treaty itself? Does time change the treaty, or does it merely ‘unfold’ it as Max Frisch would put it? All of these ideas, and the philosophical theories on identity and persistence connected to them, which explain the terms employed in the sous-titre of this article ‘Do Treaties Endure, Perdure or Exdure?’, will be addressed in Section 2. Based on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) temporal considerations are almost ubiquitous in the structure of Articles 31 - 32 of the VCLT. The present article will focus mainly on the ‘points of entry’ of temporal considerations, and in particular those which are connected to the notion of inter-temporality. Two are the main points of entry of (inter) temporal considerations in the interpretative process: 1) Direct point of entry: Contemporaneity or Dynamic Interpretation and 2) Indirect point of entry: Intertemporal Law Considerations within Article 31 (3) (c) In order to highlight the ties and overlaps between these two points of entry the present Article in Section 2 will clarify certain concepts central to the following analysis. Section 3 will provide an overview of the preparatory work of the VCLT on intertemporal law, both as a separate issue (direct point of entry) and as an element of Article 31 (3) (c) (<b>indirect</b> point of <b>entry).</b> In Section 4 the analysis will move on to an examination of the elements that weigh upon the judicial interpretative process and tip the scales either in favour of a dynamic/evolutive interpretation or in favour of the principle of contemporaneity.

Regarding Chlorophenols, special attention was drawn to the degradation of 4 -chlorophenol by means of wet oxidation and wet peroxide oxidation. This aromatic compound was taken into investigation due to its harmful properties against the environment and due to its wide presence in the environment. Once it was clear that it could be degraded by these technologies, a research focused on the influence of the operating conditions in the result of the oxidation was carried out. The influence on the wet peroxide oxidation and wet oxidation reactions of the following parameters, initial concentration of the pollutant, temperature and amount of oxidizing agent (oxygen or hydrogen peroxide depending on the process) has been taken under study. The identification and quantification of the intermediate compounds involved in the wet oxidation of 4 -chlorophenol, together with a suggested mechanistic pathway, allowed the obtaining of a kinetic model, which appeared to be a useful tool for the prediction of these compounds throughout the reactions. The evolution of the free chlorine released to the solution from the degraded chlorophenol was also a useful tool when determining the kinetic pathway of the reaction. Another objective of the work comprised the investigation of the variations of the biodegradability of the samples during the process. The knowledge of evolution of this parameter during the wet oxidation was thought to be of major importance, since high biodegradability enhancements allow the combination of a wet oxidation unit with a biological post-treatment, which is an effective and inexpensive technology to couple the oxidation. The establishment of a comparison between wet oxidation and the wet peroxide oxidation for the removal of 4 -chlorophenol was investigated as well. Concerning wastewaters from pulp and paper mills, debarking and termo-mechanical pulp process wastewater have been treated by wet oxidation. Both waters were concentrated before oxidation in order to favor the economy of the process. Debarking wastewater was concentrated by evaporation and pulp process water by nanofiltration. The influence of the operating conditions, such as temperature and partial pressure of oxygen, on the results achieved {{at the end of the}} wet oxidation were studied and evaluated in order to find the optimum working conditions for each type of wastewater. Special attention was drawn to the evolution of Lipophilic Wood Extractive Compounds throughout the reactions. In addition, kinetic models suggested in the literature were tested to find a suitable one, which allowed the prediction of for instance, the organic load, over the duration of the reactions. Due to the fact that wet oxidation is more economically viable when the initial waste stream is highly concentrated, a final chapter dedicated to a emerging technique, i. e., membrane technology has been included in this thesis. An investigation regarding the parameters affecting its performance, as well as the general aspects of the process has been conducted...|$|R
