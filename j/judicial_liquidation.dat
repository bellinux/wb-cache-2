5000|$|Owner {{of three}} villas in Cannes, Rafik Khalifa {{wanted to create}} a ville {{nouvelle}} named [...] "Algeria," [...] triggering the attention of French media. He became close to the French show-business, getting to know Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve. However, in 2003, a <b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation</b> of his endebted firm was started. Khalifa then used shady methods to save his assets. An investigation revealed the disappearance of 50 million euros in the Khalifa Bank of Algiers. Khalifa was then suspected of having spent the money of personalities close to the Algerian President Bouteflika. 17 judicial investigations were opened against him, who took refuge in London in 2003. The Khalifa Bank was closed on orders of Bouteflika.Khalifa like Bouteflika belong to the same unchanged political regime since 1962.|$|E
50|$|Reims {{returned}} to top-flight for the 1966-67 season after two {{seasons in the}} second division. However, the stint proved short with Reims finishing 19th. In 1970, the club {{returned to}} top-flight and many in the league for nearly a decade. Reims' best performance in the league during its nine-year stint was finishing 5th in the 1975-76 season. Reims were relegated in 1979 and didn't return to the first division of French football for 33 years. In the ensuing season in Division 2, Reims was limited financially {{and was forced to}} field a much younger team during the campaign. Despite the return of former popular player Carlos Bianchi as manager during the mid-1980s, the club failed to return to Division 1. Reims did surprise many by reaching the semi-finals of the Coupe de France in back-to-back seasons in 1987 and 1988. As the years wore on, the club's financial situation began to take {{a turn for the worse}} and, in 1991, Reims was administratively relegated to Division 3 after its failure to find a buyer to help alleviate the club's debt, which had exceeded over ₣50 million. In October 1991, the club underwent liquidation and changed its name to Stade de Reims Champagne FC. The club spent the 1991-92 season in Division 3 and were, surprisingly, declared ineligible to compete in the league ahead of its final league match in May 1992 after a <b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation</b> resulted in the stoppage of the club's activities. In the ensuing months, all aspects of the club (its records, trophies, etc.) were auctioned off.|$|E
30|$|The {{redressement}} judiciaire (judicial reorganization) and the liquidation judiciaire (<b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation)</b> are {{the main}} insolvency procedures for corporations in France. As for personal bankruptcy, which may apply to both consumer and entrepreneurs, {{there are two different}} procedures: the plan de redressement (reorganization plan) and the procedure de rétablissement personnel (procedure of personal recovery). The debtor, creditors, the public prosecutor and the court itself may initiate the proceedings.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{giving an}} {{explanation}} of the changes in the number of bankruptcies during {{the second part of the}} 19 th century and the beginning of the 20 th. We firstly study the evolution of the French insolvency law and then we introduce some regional aspects. We indeed observe that the court of the District of the Seine is more tolerant than the others; however this kind of use of the law will spread in the other courts until the reform in 1889 that creates the <b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation.</b> The special analysis permits us to show that the changes in the law do not explain the total variations of the total amount of bankruptcies. The local practices and, thus, the way the judicial agents act are also essential in the explanation. Bankruptcy, Code de commerce, 19 th century...|$|E
40|$|Liquidation of {{the limited}} {{liability}} company from {{the decision of the}} court The theme which I have chosen for my thesis is the process surrounding a decision of the court to dissolve a private limited company by liquidation. I have chosen to focus only on private limited companies as I believe it is the most used entity for the purpose of incorporation in the Czech Republic. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse an area which is missing the attention of the public despite the fact that every year hundreds of companies by the Municipal Court in Prague are being dissolved in this way. The reason for my research is based on the current situation in the field of "judicial liquidations" where changes in the insolvency law and the undeveloped conception of the commercial register are contributing to an increasing number of so called "death companies". The thesis is composed of three main parts, each of them dealing with different aspects of the liquidation process. The first part is the introduction and defines the main issues in this field. I have provided a description of the phenomenon regarding the <b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation</b> system, setting it {{within the context of the}} continuing economic and financial crisis. I have given details of the causes which lead up to the liquidation of a company; these will [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Italian Parliament has {{recently}} approved the Enabling Law no. 155 / 2017, which {{draws on the}} results of the work of the so-called Rordorf Commission, previously established by the Minister of Justice with the task of preparing a general reform proposal on corporate rescue and insolvency (Reform Law). Among the interventions envisaged, the Reform Law provides for the elimination of the term “bankruptcy” from the Italian insolvency panorama and the replacement of the bankruptcy proceeding with a new procedure, called “judicial liquidation”. The explanatory memorandum says that the decision to abandon the term “bankruptcy” aims to avoid the social stigma historically related to a person being declared “bankrupt” even though this is not justified by the mere fact of an entrepreneur failing to achieve a successful outcome. There is no doubt that an entrepreneurial crisis cannot be considered incontrovertible proof of inherently antisocial and illegal conduct. Nevertheless, experience shows that entrepreneurs who are declared bankrupt are strongly discredited by dint merely of the bankruptcy, even when their honesty is indisputable. The following pages will thus verify the elements of discontinuity between the “old” bankruptcy and the “new” <b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation,</b> in order to understand whether the transition from the former to the latter actually represents a cultural revolution or should instead be regarded as merely a cosmetic reworking of the regulations...|$|E
40|$|Policies and {{procedures}} to resolve bank failures have evolved significantly in Argentina since {{the introduction of}} currency convertibility in 1991, and particularly {{in reaction to the}} 1995 "tequila"crisis, which exposed the inadequacy of the bank exit framework in place then. The author reviews the institutional changes introduced in Argentina in 1995 to handle bank failures more effectively, particularly the creation of the deposit guarantee scheme and the procedural framework for resolving bank failures, embedded in Article 35 of the Financial Institutions Law. This framework enables the Central Bank to carve out the assets and"privileged"liabilities of the failing bank and transfer them to sound banks, thereby sending only a"residual"balance sheet to <b>judicial</b> <b>liquidation.</b> Subsequent refinements in the application of Article 35 procedures eventually led to current Argentine practice. The author examines this practice in detail by considering the handling of the recent failure of Banco Almafuerte. The author assesses a number of issues that arise from the Argentine model of bank failure resolution, taking into account both country-specific circumstances and more general concepts and concerns. He emphasizes the potential tradeoffs between reducing contagion risk, limiting moral hazard, and avoiding unnecessary destruction of asset value; the implications of priority-of-claims rules, and least-cost criteria; {{the pros and cons of}} alternative organizational and institutional arrangements; and the need for legal security. Finally, he outlines two prototypical approaches to striking a balance between rules and discretion, an issue underlying much of the ongoing policy discussion on alternative bank exit frameworks.
