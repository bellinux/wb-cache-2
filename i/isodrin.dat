5000|$|The {{compound}} {{was first}} synthesized by Horst Prinzbach {{and his associates}} in 1987, by a 14-step sequence starting from <b>isodrin.</b> In the process they also synthesized 2.2.1.1pagodane [...] and several derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|When used in polymers, {{whether as}} a curing agent or as a flame retardant, it bonds covalently to the polymer matrix, which reduces its {{leaching}} to the environment. It may, however, be released when such materials {{are subjected to}} hydrolysis, and can be formed by oxidation of chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides (e.g. endosulfan, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and <b>isodrin).</b> Its half-life in soil is 140-280 days.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987 an {{alternative}} synthesis route {{was found by}} the Prinzbach group, through the isomer pagodane. [...] Pagodane, obtained from <b>isodrin</b> as starting material i.a. through 6+6photocycloaddition, {{was thought to be}} a suitable candidate for isomerization to dodecahedrane similar to Schleyer´s approach to adamantane. Joint efforts of the Prinzbach team and the Schleyer group succeeded in 8% yield for the conversion at best. In the following decade the pagodane route was optimized by the Prinzbach group over and over again and finally allowed to access not only dodecahedrane in multi-gram quantities but - more importantly - to selectively incorporate substitution and unsaturation. Highlights of the study of different pagodane and dodecahedrane derivatives were the discovery of σ-bishomoaromaticity [...] and the formation of C20 fullerene from highly brominated dodecahedrane species. A final summary of the Prinzbach group´s contributions - including the over-and-over optimized pagodane route to dodecahedrane - can be found in Prinzbach´s 2006 paper on C20 clusters. In the optimized dodecahedrane synthesis the low-yielding isomerization of parent pagodane to dodecahedrane is replaced by a longer but higher yielding sequence - which nevertheless still relies heavily on pagodane derivatives, cf. the following scheme (the scheme diverges from the pagodane synthesis after compound 16).|$|E
40|$|Cyclodiene pesticides: aldrin, <b>isodrin,</b> {{dieldrin}} and endrin were dechlorinated by methanogenic granular sludge in spiked batch tests.

Two monodechlorinated analogues {{were formed}} during the conversions of aldrin and <b>isodrin.</b> Dieldrin {{was transformed into}} two monodechlorinated products as well as into aldrin and two monodechlorinated derivatives of aldrin. In respect of endrin three monodechlorinated and three didechlorinated products were found. The dechlorination of endrin was the most rapid, and was almost complete within 28 days. The dechlorinations of aldrin, <b>isodrin</b> and dieldrin were much slower: {{over a period of}} 3 months only 59 %, 70 % and 88 % was transformed, respectively. The amounts of released chloride corresponded 0. 54 +/- 0. 23, 1. 05 +/- 0. 25, 1. 10 +/- 0. 12 of theoretical value for suggested reactions, for aldrin, <b>isodrin</b> and dieldrin respectively. For endrin it was much higher. These transformations did not occur in control samples containing autoclaved granules or in control blank samples without sludge. However, in aldrin spiked blanks, a conversion into a six-chlorinated analogue was found. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aquatic {{birds are}} often used as a health indi-cator of the marine ecosystem. African {{penguins}} living in the zoo make good research material as they form {{a link between the}} marine and the terrestrial ecosystem in terms of xenobiotic circulation. Tests were performed on whole herring—the food of the penguins—as well as on bird muscle, liver, brain, eggs, feathers and guano in order to determine total mercury, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, <b>isodrin,</b> endosulfan isomers, endosulfan sulfate, me-thoxychlor, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites. In herring and penguin, the tests did not show the presence of β-endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, aldrin and <b>isodrin.</b> It was shown that penguins absorb about 36. 8 μg of organochlorine pesticides and 4. 6 μg of mercury with their food on a daily basis. Xenobiotics accumulate mostly in the liver, from where they are transported to the muscles and the brain, where the highest bioaccumulation factor is reached by endrin and pp’-DDT. Conceivably, the older the penguin, the higher is the concentration level of pesticides in its liver and brain. Molting was found to be the most effective way of eliminating mercury, dieldrin and methoxychlor from the system. Insecticides, such as DDT and its metabolites, were removed most effectively by females through laying of eggs. The standard four eggs laid within a year may have contained up to 20 % of the total amount of pesticideswhich had been absorbedwith food, but no more than 5 % of mercury...|$|E

In this study, organochlorine and organophosphorous pesticide residues were measured in more than 35 sediment samples collected on nine locations along the Ouémé River from upstream to downstream. Except for one location, Tanéka-Koko, all areas were contaminated by more than 20 pesticides. Organochlorine pesticides identified in sediment samples included pp′-DDE, op′-DDD, pp′- DDD, op′-DDT, pp′-DDT, α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, endosulfan sulphate, α-HCH, β-HCH, lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, telodrin, <b>isodrin,</b> cis- and trans-heptachlorepoxide, hexachlorbutadiene, hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene. The organophosphorous pesticide chlorpyrifos, used in a new formulation to protect cotton, was also identified.

Significant declines on the levels of DDTs were observed at most of the areas studied. Conversely, no trends or weak downtrends for PCBs were observed in the areas more polluted by local sources, and in most areas less polluted, where PCBs inputs may be primarily from the atmosphere. Upward trends for PCBs were found in some areas from the Albor an Sea, probably related to the inputs of PCBs through the Strait of Gibraltar.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the investigation of a structure-reactivity relationship {{in a series of}} pentacyclic <b>Isodrin</b> derivatives. These compounds undergo a two-hydrogen atom dyotropic rearrangement at vastly differing rates when apparently small structural changes are made. Two pairs of these isomers (with the formulas C(_ 16) H(_ 8) Cl(_ 10) and C(_ 16) H(_ 9) Cl(_ 9)) have been investigated using both X-ray and neutron single crystal diffraction studies, at ambient and low temperatures. The experimental details of these studies are given for five experiments and the results of the least-squares refinements made using the data from these experiments are reported herein. In addition to conventional crystallographic studies, an experimental charge density study of one of these compounds, C(_ 16) H(_ 9) Cl(_ 9), has been made at 123 K. The electron density was modelled using a multipole model which allows explicitly for the aspherical nature of the electron density. The results of this study, including a topological analysis of the charge density are reported in this thesis. The structures of six organometallic, four molybdenum bis(imido) and two half-sandwich niobium imido complexes, are also reported herein. Their structures were determined from single crystal diffraction data.

40|$|The target {{compounds}} of {{the cross}} matrix programme were Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Polybrominated Diphenylethers (PBDEs), Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), all of them Semivolatile Organic Compound (SOC) classes which, depending on their lipophilicity and persistence, tend to accumulate in sediments and biota. In the aqueous phase SOCs distribute between dissolved phase and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), depending on their Octanol/Water partition coefficient (Ko/w) and the amount and type of SPM available. The transport within the water column {{is often associated with}} the hydraulic remobilization of sediments and the subsequent transport and re-sedimentation of SPM. The scope {{of the cross}}-matrix sampling was to obtain spatially overlapping data involving sediment, SPM, water and biota from corresponding sites that would allow an insight into the interactions between the relevant compartments. Results from 23 sites are reported, covering the River Danube over a distance of 2600 km from Germany to the Black Sea. The main objective of JDS 2 was to produce comparable and reliable information on water quality of the whole Danube and many of its main tributaries. Regarding the chemical status, an important objective was to obtain a dataset for priority pollutants according to the daughter directive of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Among the SOCs reported in this study, the following substances are included in the List of Priority Substances of the WFD, with Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) established (COMMON POSITION, ANNEX I, 2007) : Flame retardants such as PBDEs; OCPs such as Endosulfan, Hexachlorobenzene, Hexachlorocyclohexane, DDT and its metabolites, Cyclodiene pesticides (Aldrin, Dieldrin, Endrin, <b>Isodrin),</b> and the PAHs such as Naphthalene, Anthracene, Fluoranthene, Benzo(a) pyrene, Benzo(b) fluoranthene, Benzo(ghi) perylene, Benzo(k) fluoranthene, Indeno(123 -cd) pyrene.

Long-range advection pathways were determined based on analysed back-trajectory calculations. The mean concentrations of DDT and its metabolites, HCB, HCH, and PCB at the coast were in the 100 - 1000 pg m- 3 range. Higher concentrations prevailed during night-time. The levels were in general lower at the island site, but not for DDT. Local sources are likely. PCBs were even 2 orders og magnitude lower, suggesting that PCBs {{are not subject to}} regional transport but elevated concentrations in air are limited to the source areas. Organochlorine pesticide levels on the other hand were seemingly determined by regional transport over mainland China rather than by emissions in the coastal area. The currently used pesticides mirex and chlordane were found at elevated levels, i. e. 79 (6. 6 - 255) and 36 (< 6 - 71) pg m- 3, respectively, at the coast but not over the island. The POPs pesticides aldrin, dieldrin and eldrin, never registered in China, were mostly found at < 10 pg m- 3 except for eldrin at the coastal site (up to 400 pg m- 3) and aldrin at the island site (up to 50 pg m- 3) ...|$|E
