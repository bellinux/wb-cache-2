5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent <b>HIV</b> <b>risk.</b> Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E

25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in <b>HIV</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors. In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, a pilot study of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in heroin use, drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone maintenance treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Donors are {{screened}} for health risks {{that could make}} the donation unsafe for the recipient. [...] Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) for <b>HIV</b> <b>risk.</b> In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year.

Of particular importance is whether AIDS-related stigma is associated with <b>HIV</b> transmission <b>risks</b> among people who have never been tested for HIV. Purpose We examined: (1) AIDS-related stigma {{as a barrier}} to testing, controlling for other potential barriers, and (2) whether stigma is associated with <b>HIV</b> <b>risks</b> among HIVuntested individuals. Methods We surveyed 2, 572 individuals attending informal drinking establishments in Cape Town, South Africa to assess HIV testing status, AIDS-related stigma endorsement, and <b>HIV</b> transmission sexual <b>risk</b> behavior. Results Endorsement of AIDS-related stigma was negatively associated with HIV lifetime testing. In addition, stigma endorsement was associated with higher <b>HIV</b> transmission <b>risks.</b> Conclusion AIDS-related stigma must be addressed in HIV prevention campaigns across South Africa.

40|$|Migration and HIV {{research}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{has focused on}} <b>HIV</b> <b>risks</b> to male migrants, yet women's levels of participation in internal migration have met or exceeded those {{of men in the}} region. Moreover, studies that have examined <b>HIV</b> <b>risks</b> to female migrants found higher <b>risk</b> behavior and <b>HIV</b> prevalence among migrant compared to non-migrant women. However, {{little is known about the}} pathways through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. This study aimed to characterize the contexts and processes that may facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission among migrant women in the Kisumu area of Nyanza Province, Kenya. We used qualitative methods, including 6 months of participant observation in women's common migration destinations and in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 male and 40 female migrants selected from these destinations. Gendered aspects of the migration process may be linked to the high <b>risks</b> of <b>HIV</b> observed in female migrants - in the circumstances that trigger migration, livelihood strategies available to female migrants, and social features of migration destinations. Migrations were often precipitated by household shocks due to changes in marital status (as when widowhood resulted in disinheritance) and gender-based violence. Many migrants engaged in transactional sex, of varying regularity, from clandestine to overt, to supplement earnings from informal sector trading. Migrant women are at high <b>risk</b> of <b>HIV</b> transmission and acquisition: the circumstances that drove migration may have also increased <b>HIV</b> infection <b>risk</b> at origin; and social contexts in destinations facilitate having multiple sexual partners and engaging in transactional sex. We propose a model for understanding the pathways through which migration contributes to <b>HIV</b> <b>risks</b> in women in high HIV prevalence areas in Africa, highlighting potential opportunities for primary and secondary HIV prevention at origins and destinations, and at key 'moments of vulnerability' in the migration process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|People who inject drugs (PWID) in India {{are at high}} <b>risk</b> for <b>HIV,</b> {{with women}} being at {{elevated}} risk. Using a socio-ecological framework, this study assessed whether factors associated with <b>HIV</b> transmission <b>risk</b> behaviors differed across men and women PWID. Data for this cross-sectional study were collected from 6449 PWID in 7 cities in Northeast India. Men (n = 5653) and women (n = 796) PWID were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). We assessed sex differences in two recent <b>HIV</b> transmission <b>risk</b> behaviors: multiple sex partners and needle/syringe sharing. We used multi-level logistic regression models, which incorporated sampling weights and random intercepts for city, to assess factors associated with these <b>HIV</b> <b>risks,</b> separately among men and women. The prevalence of HIV was significantly higher among women than men (53 % vs 18. 4 %, p< 0. 01). Nearly 13 % of men and 8 % of women (p =. 30) had multiple partners. Employment in men and relationship status and stigma in women {{were significantly associated with}} multiple partners. Approximately 25 % of men and 19 % of women engaged in needle sharing (p =. 16). Younger age in women and depression symptoms in men were significantly associated with increased risk for sharing needles. We found that sexual and drug related risk behaviors were common among PWID in Northeast India, and there were {{differences between men and women}} in the socio-ecologic correlates of these behaviors.

40|$|Whereas {{research}} {{has suggested that}} drug-involved men are at disproportionately high risk of engaging in transmission <b>risk</b> behaviors for <b>HIV</b> and of perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV) against women, only a few cross-sectional studies have examined the relationship between IPV and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission risks among heterosexual, drug-involved men. This study builds on previous cross-sectional research by using a longitudinal design to examine the temporal relationships between perpetration of IPV and different HIV/STI transmission risks among a random sample of 356 men on methadone assessed at baseline (wave 1), 6  months (wave 2), and 12  months (wave 3). The findings indicate that (1) perpetration of IPV in the past 6  months at wave 1 was associated with having more than one intimate partner, buying sex, and sexual coercion at subsequent waves and that (2) noncondom use, injecting drugs, and sexual coercion at wave 1 were associated with subsequent IPV. The temporal relationships between perpetration of IPV and <b>HIV</b> <b>risks</b> found in this study underscore the need for HIV prevention interventions targeting men on methadone to consider IPV and <b>HIV</b> <b>risks</b> as cooccurring problems...|$|R
