5|$|<b>Epizootics</b> are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant <b>epizootics</b> of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century <b>epizootics</b> in {{livestock}} caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. Bluetongue disease, a disease caused by an orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007. Until then the disease had been mainly confined to the Americas, Africa, southern Asia and northern Australia, but it is now an emerging disease around the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused <b>epizootics</b> in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
40|$|<b>Epizootic</b> subtype IAB and IC Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} viruses (VEEV) readily infect the <b>epizootic</b> mosquito vector Aedes taeniorhynchus. The inability of enzootic subtype IE viruses to infect this mosquito species provides a model {{system for the}} identification of natural viral determinants of vector infectivity. To map mosquito infection determinants, reciprocal chimeric viruses generated from <b>epizootic</b> subtype IAB and enzootic IE VEEV were tested for mosquito infectivity. Chimeras containing the IAB <b>epizootic</b> structural gene region and, more specifically, the IAB PE 2 envelope glycoprotein E 2 precursor gene demonstrated an efficient infection phenotype. Introduction of the PE 2 gene from an enzootic subtype ID virus into an <b>epizootic</b> IAB or IC genetic backbone resulted in lower infection rates {{than those of the}} <b>epizootic</b> parent. The finding that the E 2 envelope glycoprotein, the site of epitopes that define the enzootic and <b>epizootic</b> subtypes, also encodes mosquito infection determinants suggests that selection for efficient infection of <b>epizootic</b> mosquito vectors may mediate VEE emergence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} virus (VEEV) continues to circulate enzootically in Mexico {{with the potential}} to re-emerge and cause disease in equines and humans in North America. We infected two geographically distinct mosquito populations of eastern Psorophora columbiae form columbiae (Chiapas, Mexico and Texas, United States) and one mosquito population of western Psorophora columbiae form toltecum (California, United States) with <b>epizootic</b> and enzootic IE VEEV and <b>epizootic</b> IAB VEEV. We detected no differences between <b>epizootic</b> and enzootic IE viruses in their ability to infect any of the mosquito populations analyzed, which suggested that neither species selects for <b>epizootic</b> IE viruses. Psorophora columbiae f. columbiae (Texas) were significantly less susceptible to infection by <b>epizootic</b> IE than Ps. columbiae f. columbiae (Mexico). Psorophora columbiae f. toltecum populations were more susceptible than Ps. columbiae f. columbiae populations to <b>epizootic</b> IE and IAB viruses...|$|R

5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe <b>epizootics</b> in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (<b>epizootics).</b> Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E

40|$|Venezuelan equine {{encephalomyelitis}} (VEE) epizoodemics were reported at 6 – 10 -year intervals in northern South America {{beginning in the}} 1920 s. In 1937, <b>epizootic</b> VEE virus was isolated from infected horse brain and shown as distinct from the North American {{equine encephalomyelitis}} viruses. Subsequently, <b>epizootic</b> and sylvatic strains were isolated in distinct ecosystems; isolates were characterized serologically as <b>epizootic</b> subtype I, variants A/B and C; or sylvatic (enzootic) subtype I, variant...|$|R
5000|$|Sylvatic plague is {{normally}} enzootic, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas. At unpredictable times it becomes <b>epizootic</b> in unexpected places. It is during these <b>epizootic</b> outbreaks that transmission to humans is most common.|$|R
40|$|Epidemics of Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} (VEE) result from high-titer equine viremia of IAB and IC subtype viruses that mediate increased mosquito transmission and spillover to humans. Previous genetic {{studies suggest that}} mutations in the E 2 envelope glycoprotein allow relatively viremia-incompetent, enzootic subtype ID strains to adapt for equine replication, leading to VEE emergence. To test this hypothesis directly, chimeric VEEV strains containing the genetic backbone of enzootic subtype ID strains and the partial envelope glycoprotein genes of <b>epizootic</b> subtype IC and IAB strains, as well as reciprocal chimeras, were used for experimental infections of horses. Insertion of envelope genes from two different, closely related enzootic subtype ID strains into the <b>epizootic</b> backbones resulted in attenuation, demonstrating that the <b>epizootic</b> envelope genes are necessary for the equine-virulent and viremia-competent phenotypes. The partial <b>epizootic</b> envelope genes introduced into an enzootic ID backbone were sufficient to generate the virulent, viremia-competent equine phenotype. These results indicate that {{a small number of}} envelope gene mutations can generate an equine amplification-competent, <b>epizootic</b> VEEV from an enzootic progenitor and underscore the limitations of small animal models for evaluating and predicting the <b>epizootic</b> phenotype...|$|R
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{believed}} to have originated in Asia, later spreading through the transport of cattle. Other cattle <b>epizootics</b> are noted in ancient times: a cattle plague is thought {{to be one of the}} ten plagues of Egypt described in the Hebrew Bible. By around 3,000 BC, a cattle plague had reached Egypt, and rinderpest later spread throughout the remainder of Africa, following European colonization.|$|E
25|$|Swine plague spreads {{very quickly}} in wild boar, with <b>epizootics</b> being {{recorded}} in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and other regions. Foot-and-mouth disease {{can also take}} on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts Pasteurellosis, hemorrhagic septicemia, tularemia and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.|$|E
25|$|Disease {{has also}} been a factor in the {{survival}} of the western lowland gorilla. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in western lowland gorillas. From 2003–2004, two <b>epizootics</b> infected the western lowland gorilla, which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by Magdalena Bermejo and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with bushmeat. The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the western lowland gorilla a critically endangered species. Malaria is also an issue that has been arising for the western lowland gorillas. Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have Plasmodium DNA. Laverania, which is a sub-genus of the Plasmodium genus of parasitic protozoa, was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting Plasmodium species is known to be the origin of malaria in western lowland gorillas.|$|E
40|$|Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} virus (VEEV) is a reemerging pathogen and a continuing threat to humans and equines in the Americas. Identification {{of the genetic}} determinants that enable <b>epizootic</b> VEEV strains to arise and exploit equines as amplification hosts to cause widespread human disease is pivotal to understanding VEE emergence. The sensitivity to murine alpha/beta interferon-mediated antiviral activity was previously correlated to the <b>epizootic</b> phenotype of several VEEV strains. Infectious cDNA clones were generated from an <b>epizootic</b> subtype IC VEEV strain (SH 3) isolated during the 1992 Venezuelan outbreak and a closely related enzootic, sympatric subtype ID strain (ZPC 738). These VEEV strains had low-cell-culture-passage histories and differed by only 12 amino acids in the nonstructural and structural proteins. Rescued viruses showed similar growth kinetics to their parent viruses in several cell lines, and murine infections resulted in comparable viremia and disease. Unlike what was found in other studies of <b>epizootic</b> and enzootic VEEV strains, the sensitivities to murine alpha/beta interferon did not differ appreciably between these <b>epizootic</b> versus enzootic strains, calling into question the reliability of interferon sensitivity as a marker of <b>epizootic</b> potential...|$|R

500|$|West Nile virus, a flavivirus, [...] {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1937 {{when it was}} found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe [...] fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in Cape Province, South Africa and 10,000 people became ill. An increasing frequency of epidemics and <b>epizootics</b> (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York City. Since then the virus has spread throughout the US. In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in mid July to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases. In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred; [...] in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses. The mosquito (Culex modestus) that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north Kent. This mosquito species was not previously thought to be present in the UK, but it is widespread in southern Europe where it carries West Nile virus.|$|E
2500|$|Dolphins {{have few}} natural enemies. Some species or {{specific}} populations have none, making them apex predators. For {{most of the}} smaller species of dolphins, {{only a few of}} the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, dusky shark, tiger shark and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves. Some of the larger dolphin species, especially orcas (killer whales), may also prey on smaller dolphins, but this seems rare. Dolphins also suffer from a wide variety of diseases and parasites. [...] The Cetacean morbillivirus in particular has been known to cause regional <b>epizootics</b> often leaving hundreds of animals of various species dead. Symptoms of infection are often a severe combination of pneumonia, encephalitis and damage to the immune system, which greatly impair the cetacean's ability to swim and stay afloat unassisted. A study at the U.S. National Marine Mammal Foundation revealed that dolphins, like humans, develop a natural form of type 2 diabetes which may lead to a better understanding of the disease and new treatments for both humans and dolphins.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that sea lice flourishing on salmon farms can spread to nearby wild juvenile salmon and devastate these populations. Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including Caligus clemensi and Caligus rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice. When exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, mathematical models have suggested that many young wild salmon may be infected [...] Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. It {{has been suggested that}} sea trout populations in recent years have seriously declined due to infestation by sea lice, and Krkosek et al. have claimed that on the Pacific coast of Canada the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is over 80%. A few studies indicated there has been no long term damage to fish stocks in some locations, and that a population decline in wild salmon that occurred in 2002 was caused by [...] "something other than sea lice". However, the repeated <b>epizootics</b> of lice on wild fish have only occurred in areas with salmon farms in Ireland, Scotland, Norway, British Columbia, and Chile. Field sampling of copepodids, and hydrographic and population models, show how L. salmonis from farms can cause mass infestations of seaward migrating salmonids, and that this effect can occur up to [...] from the farms.|$|E
