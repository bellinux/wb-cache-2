5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Finance is sourced from public, {{private and}} {{public-private}} sectors {{and can be}} channelled through various intermediaries, notably BFIs, MFIs, development cooperation agencies, the UNFCCC (various funds including those managed by the Global Environment Facility), non-governmental organisations and the private sector. The financials flows can flow from <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> countries (North-South), from <b>developing</b> <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> countries (South-South), from <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> countries (North-North) and domestic climate finance flows in developed and developing countries.|$|R
50|$|Several {{assessments}} {{have been}} <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> measure {{the amount of}} safety behaviors used by people with specific psychological conditions. Two examples of assessments <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> measure safety behaviors performed by people with social anxiety are the Social Behavior Questionnaire and the Subtle Avoidance Frequency Examination.

5|$|The Catlins has a cool {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat {{cooler than}} {{other parts of}} the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|The South Pacific Ocean basin runs between 160°E and 120°W, with {{tropical}} cyclones {{developing in}} it officially {{monitored by the}} Fiji Meteorological Service and New Zealand's MetService. Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries {{to the west of}} the dateline, though during El Niños cyclones have been known to <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E

5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression initially moved northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge over Mexico. Convection continued to <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> {{the west of}} the center, and late on August 23, a ship report confirmed the depression intensified Tropical Storm Julio. Initially, the persistent shear left the center partially exposed from the thunderstorm activity, though upper level conditions gradually became more favorable for strengthening. On August 24, Tropical Storm Julio attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) as intense convection developed near the center. Shortly thereafter, the center became difficult to locate, and late on August 24 the storm moved ashore along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Walters Cultural Arts Center was {{designed}} to be a bookend, along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the city’s first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other developments that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Pacific basin in the Southern Hemisphere between 160°E– 120°W, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis {{indicate that a}} system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) names systems that are located between the Equator and 25°S, while the New Zealand MetService names systems (in conjunction with the FMS) that <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the south of 25°S. If {{a tropical}} cyclone causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to {{the way of life}} of a community, then the name assigned to that cyclone is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting. The name of a tropical cyclone is determined by using Lists A— D in order, without regard to year before restarting with List A. List E contains names that will replace names on A-D when needed.|$|E

25|$|The British National Formulary {{recommends}} a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. While withdrawal symptoms can occur, {{there is no}} evidence that tolerance develops to the drug's antipsychotic effects. A patient can be maintained for years on a therapeutically effective dose without any decrease in effectiveness being reported. Tolerance appears to <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the sedating effects of chlorpromazine when it is first administered. Tolerance also appears to <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> the extrapyramidal, parkinsonian and other neuroleptic effects, although this is debatable.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is {{a process}} {{characterized}} by neuroadaptations that result in reduced drug effects. While receptor upregulation may often {{play an important role}} other mechanisms are also known. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. However, tolerance does not <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> constipation or miosis (the constriction of the pupil of the eye to {{less than or equal to}} two millimeters). This idea has been challenged, however, with some authors arguing that tolerance does <b>develop</b> <b>to</b> miosis.|$|E
