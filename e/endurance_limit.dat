40|$|Self-healing polymers, {{based on}} {{microencapsulated}} dicyclopentadiene and Grubbs' catalyst {{embedded in the}} polymer matrix, are capable of responding to propagating fatigue cracks by autonomic processes that lead to higher <b>endurance</b> <b>limits</b> and life extension, or even the complete arrest of the crack growth. The amount of fatigue-life extension depends on the relative magnitude of the mechanical kinetics of crack propagation and the chemical kinetics of healing. As the healing kinetics are accelerated, greater fatigue life extension is achieved. The use of wax-protected, recrystallized Grubbs' catalyst leads to a fourfold increase {{in the rate of}} polymerization of bulk dicyclopentadiene and extends the fatigue life of a polymer specimen over 30 times longer than a comparable non-healing specimen. The fatigue life of polymers under extremely fast fatigue crack growth can be extended through the incorporation of periodic rest periods, effectively training the self-healing polymeric material to achieve higher <b>endurance</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{environmental}} effect on fatigue properties of die-cast magnesium alloys, several fatigue tests were performed for AM 50 HP and AZ 91 HP in ambient air, vacuum, engine oil, deionized water and 3. 5 % NaCl solution. It is found that the S-N curves are steeper in corrosive environment and AM 50 HP shows a higher sensitivity to the action of 3. 5 % NaCl solution than AZ 91 HP. Both alloys do not have <b>endurance</b> <b>limits</b> in 3. 5 % NaCl solution, whereas <b>endurance</b> <b>limits</b> could be detected in ambient air, which are about 90 MPa and 100 MPa for AZ 91 HP and AM 50 HP respectively. It is also found that FCP rate is substantially increased in corrosion media: the presence of oxygen causes the production of oxide film on the fresh surfaces made during the cyclic loading and the oxide film would restrict the deformation of the matrix beneath the hard film and promote hydrogen embrittlement in the wet condition...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>endurance</b> <b>limit</b> was {{introduced}} in 1870 by August Wöhler.

50|$|The ASTM defines fatigue strength, SNf, as {{the value}} of stress at which failure occurs after Nf cycles, and fatigue limit, Sf, as the {{limiting}} value of stress at which failure occurs as Nf becomes very large. ASTM does not define <b>endurance</b> <b>limit,</b> the stress value below which the material will withstand many load cycles, but implies that it is similar to fatigue limit.|$|E
50|$|The American Society for Testing and Materials defines fatigue life, Nf, as {{the number}} of stress cycles of a {{specified}} character that a specimen sustains before failure of a specified nature occurs. For some materials, notably steel and titanium, there is a theoretical value for stress amplitude below which the material will not fail for any number of cycles, called a fatigue limit, <b>endurance</b> <b>limit,</b> or fatigue strength.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of three different}} techniques, designed to improve the bending fatigue life in comparison to conventionally processed gas-carburized 8620 steel, were evaluated with modified Brugger bending fatigue specimens and actual ring and pinion gears. The bending fatigue samples were machined from forged gear blanks from the same lot of material used for the pinion gear tests, and all processing of laboratory samples and gears was done together. Fatigue data were obtained on standard as-carburized parts and after three special processing histories: shot-peening to increase surface residual stresses; double heat treating to refined austenite grain size; and vacuum carburizing to minimize intergranular oxidation. Standard room-temperature S-N curves and <b>endurance</b> <b>limits</b> were obtained with the laboratory samples. The pinions were run {{as part of a}} complete gear set on a laboratory dynamometer and data were obtained at two imposed torque levels. The number of cycles to failure was used to evaluate the effects of processing history. Based on laboratory <b>endurance</b> <b>limits,</b> shown in parentheses, the processing histories ranked as follows: shot-peened (1410 MPa), vacuum carburized (1210 MPa), reheated to refine grain size (1140 MPa), and as-gas-carburized (1000 MPa). In the gear set tests, shot peening also proved to be {{the most effective way to}} improve fatigue life at both imposed torque levels.

Those specimens with higher defect densities had shorter fatigue lives, lower fatigue <b>endurance</b> <b>limits,</b> and greater reductions in the elastic unloading modulus (that is, stiffness) because of fatigue cycling.

50|$|Fatigue limit, <b>endurance</b> <b>limit,</b> {{and fatigue}} {{strength}} are all expressions {{used to describe}} a property of materials: the amplitude (or range) of cyclic stress {{that can be applied}} to the material without causing fatigue failure.

Other structural metals such as aluminium and copper do not have a distinct limit and will eventually fail even from small stress amplitudes. In these cases, a number of cycles (usually 107) is chosen to represent the fatigue life of the material.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantages}} of an SSN over a conventionally powered SSK are much longer <b>endurance</b> (<b>limited</b> {{more by the}} crew than the boat, a nuclear submarine can stay submerged for months and does not need refueling in their 25-year lifespans), and higher speed.

Some of the newest conventional submarines approach these advantages: Stirling engine powered vessels can cruise underwater for up to two weeks and, like diesel/electric vessels (and in theory LOX powered vessels), are significantly quieter than nuclear submarines, since they do not need to run the powerful (and noisy) pumps associated with the cooling circuits of pressurized water reactors.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{its high}} initial strength-to-weight ratio, a design {{limitation}} of CFRP is {{its lack of}} a definable fatigue <b>endurance</b> <b>limit.</b> This means, theoretically, that stress cycle failure cannot be ruled out. While steel and many other structural metals and alloys do have estimable fatigue endurance limits, the complex failure modes of composites mean that the fatigue failure properties of CFRP are difficult to predict and design for. As a result, when using CFRP for critical cyclic-loading applications, engineers may need to design in considerable strength safety margins to provide suitable component reliability over its service life.|$|E
