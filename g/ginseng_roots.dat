40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} compare the potency and duration effect of Java ginseng and Korean <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extract administration on sexual behavior of male mice. It was done experimentally on male mice (strain BALB, aged 8 â€“ 10 weeks, weighed 25 â€“ 35 g). Thirty eight mice were grouped to 4 (four) groups: First group was treated with solvent (as positive control), 2 nd group was treated ethynilestradiol (EE 2) (as negative control), 3 rd group was treated with Java <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extract, and 4 th group was treated with Korean <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extract. All groups were administered with EE 2 0. 56 mg/ 20 g bw/day for 9 days as pretreatment to decrease the testosteron level. After pretreatment, each group divided to 3 subgroups (each would receive treatment for 9, 18, and 27 days). Ethynilestradiol 0. 56 mg/ 20 g bw/day was administered along treatment to keep testosterone level low, except to positive control group. Java ginseng and Korean <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extract (equal with 1. 4 mg <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> powder/ 20 g bw/day) and EE 2 were administered orally.

40|$|Antioxidant {{activity}} of some extracts of javanese <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> was investigated. Javanese <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extracts were prepared by solvent extraction using methanol, ethanol (96 %), ethanol (70 %), acetone, and hexane. Total antioxidant {{activity of}} the extracts was measured by ferric thiocyanate method, whereas radical scavenging capacity and reducing power were measured by the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl and the reducing potential methods, respectively. The result showed that the highest total antioxidant activity was observed in acetone and methanol extracts. It was supposed that the ability of these extracts for partitioning at the interface of the emulsion in the tested oxidation system was the highest among other extracts, therefore it had the best activity to inhibit oxidation. The highest radical scavenging capacity measured by EC 50 was observed in acetone extract. The type of phenolic compounds of this extract was suggested {{to be responsible for}} the highest radical scavenging capacity. Different phenomena occurred for reducing power. Methanol extract had the highest reducing power and the least is hexane and acetone extract. It was suggested that each extracts comprised different types of phenolic based on different polarity of solvents used for extraction. The antioxidant compounds of javanese <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extracts were primary antioxidant based on these ability to scavenge free radical. It could be concluded that acetone was the best solvent for antioxidant extraction of javanese <b>ginseng</b> <b>root.</b> However, all tested antioxidant mechanisms in this research showed that vitamin E (1000 ppm) had better activity than javanese <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> extracts (1000 ppm) for all types of solvent.

40|$|Abstract. Root {{growth and}} saponin {{production}} in the root culture of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer were investigated under various pH values, concentrations of sucrose, nitrogen and phosphate and elicitors. The pH of a medium {{did not have a}} significant effect on root growth, but apparently affected the saponin content. The maximum saponin content of 0. 26 % was obtained at pH 6. 0. The optimal concentrations of sucrose, nitrogen and phosphate on root growth and saponin production were 30 g/l, 382. 7 mg/l and 40. 40 mg/l, respectively. Saponin biosynthesis was stimulated by the addition of panaxatriol saponin (PTS) and total saponin (TS). However, fresh weight in PTS was so low that the theoretical total saponin in TS treatment was higher than that in PTS treatment. Thus, it appears that TS is a better elicitor than PTS in the <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> culture. The saponin content in TS treated <b>ginseng</b> <b>root</b> was 0. 38 % and approximately 1. 5 -fold higher than the control.

50|$|Wild ginseng {{had been}} {{collected}} in the forests of North America for hundreds of years, for sale to China. Reinhold Dietsch, a neighbor of the Fromms, was experimenting with cultivating it, and he shared with the brothers how to plant the roots in beds and how to build lath arbors over the plants to simulate {{the shade of the}} forest. In 1904 the brothers planted some wild roots they had found in their mother's garden. When their father refused to give them lath to use for their crazy scheme, they bought it themselves. When they asked for more land to plant on, he offered them only a rock pile. They moved the rocks and planted. To grow more ginseng, the brothers needed to plant seeds, rather than the few roots they found in the forest. This required a tricky process of germinating seeds in layers of sand buried in boxes for a year, which they learned from Eastern ginseng growers. <b>Ginseng</b> <b>roots</b> take about five years to mature, and the first crop grown from seeds was finally harvested in 1912.
