In other words, the person intervening is deemed to “stand in the shoes” of the person on whose behalf he is intervening. If that individual “had the right to defend himself, then the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> is also protected by that right. To claim self-defense, a person has to be in a place they have a legal right to be, not be involved in any illegal activity, must not have started the confrontation, and must be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{consequences}} of child neglect {{are still too}} often played down. It is important to intervene at an early stage, approaching families at home through means adapted to community-level action. Interventions by health and social professionals face several hurdles: (1) the difficulty for front-line health and social professionals to make a diagnosis; (2) the difficulty of entering into a dialog with possible beneficiaries of the interventions owing to distrust; and (3) the difficulty of assessing {{the outcome of the}} interventions. In order to answer the need for the medium-term assessment of our intervention programs in the field of neglect and attachment disorders, our multidisciplinary team (psychologists, a general practitioner, an anthropologist and an educationalist) designed a tool aimed at supporting the observation of challenging indicators by parents and <b>intervening</b> <b>parties</b> in a given educational situation. Method The MASPIN tool (Method for Analysis of Situations and Project on Individual cases of Neglect) was designed {{on the basis of a}} review of existing literature on assessment tools for actions in the field concerning parental disorders, focusing on children up to three years old. Field professionals were involved in the design process in order to make sure that the tool matched their daily practice. Results The tool allows a six-fold assessment of: interactions between parents and child, parental skills, acknowledgement by parents of their difficulties or responsibilities, environmental factors, how the family experienced the intervention, and the <b>intervening</b> <b>party’s</b> experience. Discussion and conclusion The MASPIN tool could foster the development of a common knowledge and culture regarding intervention on neglect. Our limited use unveiled unexpected potential. It makes for interesting prospects in structuring the dialog between front-line professionals (medics, nurses and social workers) and experts. Moreover, it helps to ease the dialog between <b>intervening</b> <b>parties</b> and parents, clearly identifying existing parental skills and specific issues that might call for educational assistance...|$|R
40|$|What makes helping {{relationships}} - {{or social}} interventions in general - so sensitive to abuse? These problems {{are directly related}} {{to the nature of the}} helping relationship. The core of this relationship is the inequality, the asymmetry, between the helper and the person being helped, and the dependence of the latter. Asymmetry is the driving force behind every social intervention and at the same time its weakest point. Handling asymmetry in an appropriate manner constitutes a major part of the work of the <b>intervening</b> <b>party.</b> This asymmetry makes heavy demands on the professional attitude of the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> i. e. the helper. Is s/he capable of dealing with dependence in an acceptable way? Is s/he well-versed in her/his profession? This article contains a comprehensive sketch of many of the possible dangers and pitfalls which beset asymmetric intervention relations. At the end it will be argued that, for a better understanding, the proximity of helping and power has to be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|To examine {{when and}} why animals break up fights between {{others in their}} group, I {{modelled}} whether 'winner' and 'loser' effects might be one element driving the evolution of intervention behaviour. I considered one particular type of intervention: when the intervener simply breaks up fights between two others, but does not favour either party in so doing. When victories at time T + 1 are more likely given a victory at time T (i. e. winner effects), intervention is often favoured. Intervention is favoured in these circumstances because the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> in essence stops others from 'getting on a roll' and climbing up any hierarchy that exists. However, when loser effects alone are at work (defeats at time T + 1 are more likely given a defeat at time T), breaking up fights between others is never selected. If both winner and loser effects are operating simultaneously, then the likelihood of intervention behaviour evolving {{is a function of}} the relative strength of these two effects. The greater the winner effect relative to the loser effect, the more likely intervention behaviour is to evolve...|$|E
40|$|In this work, I analyze two {{different}} statebuilding attempts in rural Afghanistan that {{work at the}} village level. Their approaches to the Afghan village institution differ profoundly. These enterprises represent the split in the current statebuilding debate. In the current intervention, divergent assumptions and strategic interests are merged under a common ideological rhetoric. In practice however, they have disparaging results. This research concentrates on how the assumptions of the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> affect its project design and process, and form the interaction with Afghan counterparts. These assumptions, I argue, are a determining factor {{in the success of}} these enterprises. The most determining assumptions relate to the causes of state fragility and the statebuilding process: the questions about how to achieve such ambiguous goals as good governance, statebuilding, and development. Moreover, assumptions about the Afghan cultural and socio-political landscape are decisive. I show how these shape the project design and execution, the interaction with the local powerholders and all together, the success of the intervention. I maintain that the assumptions of the external actors that determine the outcome of the interactive institution building process. I herewith expand the statebuilding research from its focus on weak governance in Afghanistan to the approaches of the external actors...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] “Health {{and safety}} {{managers}} face complex challenges in today’s production environments. They {{are confronted with}} increasingly flexible, autonomous and polyvalent contexts. Asymmetry {{of information on the}} workplace is widespread because various <b>intervening</b> <b>parties</b> rely on information lacking conformity. Social partners generate and use information which supports or benefits their pursuit of differing goals. Ascertaining and controlling this information can prove both difficult and costly. When addressing health and safety issues, one intervening partner alters or changes behavior in response to changes introduced by the other side. Strategic behaviors result, based on post-contract opportunism (moral hazard) and alliances with partners who can reasonably be expected to deliver predictable and effective contributions toward individual goals (adverse selection). These behaviors arise out of diagnostic problems, difficulty in determining acceptable risk, asymmetries in the information used in risk taking decisions on the part of social partners and the operation of health and safety systems.... Inevitably, effective and efficient management of health and safety must spring from an understanding of the dynamics governing the <b>intervening</b> <b>parties.</b> This paper makes use of non-cooperative game theory to identify conditions fostering cooperation between managers and workers as social partners in the workplace. ...|$|R

The {{official}} published version can be accessed from the link below - Copyright @ 2012 Martinus NijhoffThis article takes issue with recent references to the British nineteenth century campaign for {{the abolition of the}} trans-Atlantic slave trade to Brazil that serve to bolster interventionist or imperialist agendas. In particular, such accounts reproduce two and a half myths about the campaign: that it can {{serve as a model for}} the present age; that the success of the campaign can be explained through the actions of the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> alone (with a corresponding neglect of those of the ‘target’ state); and the half-myth that the campaign’s success was due to military action (at the expense of institutional (legal) and normative factors and the capacity of the target state). I argue instead that this case – and interventions more generally – would benefit from an analysis that considers the role of force in relation to a series of residual institutional and cultural constraints within the liberal state and to political conditions in the target state. In light of the complexities and contingencies that these factors present the underlying lesson is that military force should be used sparingly, if at all...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} interest is emerging in ecological compensation or biodiversity offsets {{as an instrument}} for slowing down the rate of biodiversity losses, with programs ongoing in more than 40 countries. Adhering to the polluter-pays principle, the instrument requires the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> to compensate for environmental degradation that has occured {{as a result of}} development. However, its use is contested as the instrument may facilitate a ‘license to trash’ if more development permits are allowed under the assumption that the degradation can simply be compensated. This paper increases the understanding of whether existing programs for ecological compensation effectively addresses the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. A literature review is conducted with five case studies of ecological compensation programs representing middle- and high- income countries. We begin by describing the different approaches of designing compensation programs in Australia, England, Germany, South Africa and the U. S. Key issues in the program design are reviewed: policy goals, adherence to the mitigation hierarchy, weighting of losses and gains, and monitoring activities. We then evaluate the programs’ outcomes, in terms of the ecological and social benefits provided. From these case studies, we find three design aspects that may contribute towards improving the compensation programs’ outcomes: (1) integration of compensation programs with conservation landscape planning, (2) adequate commensurability of ecosystem functions and (3) an open access centralised reporting system. We also identify four safeguards to contribute towards protecting the ecological and social benefits: (1) allocate co-responsibilities of equivalence weighting and monitoring to an independent, external organisation, (2) consider local livelihoods at both the impact and proposed compensation site, (3) ensure access to recreation and (4) stakeholder participation from the general society and consultation of the directly affected community. We highlight that the use of this controversial instrument requires considerable regulation and capacity, with democratically decided performance criteria.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of contemporaneous American participation in war on military labor and conflict duration. Chapter one uses variation in occupation-specific retention bonuses and mortality risks observed in the U. S. Army during {{the war on terror}} to estimate the rate at which volunteers for active military service are willing to trade wealth and risk of death when making reenlistment decisions. Our estimate of the Value of Statistical Life among first-term soldiers is between $ 0. 1 M and $ 0. 5 M. Bonus policy is an effective tool for meeting near-term military manpower shortages. Increasing the bonus offer by $ 1, 000 leads to an increase in the probability of reenlistment of 1. 5 percentage points. Chapter two documents a substantial increase in the post-service one-year mortality rate of recent veterans using estimates constructed by matching Army administrative data to the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. The total mortality of service in the Army between 2001 and 2010 is likely understated by approximately 10 % or over 350 deaths. Approximately 91 % of the change in post-service mortality is due to the effect of exposure to high rates of mortality while in-service. The relationship between in-service and post-service mortality has likely always existed, but the higher rates of in-service mortality during the war mean that post-service mortality rates are higher. The third chapter provides empirical evidence linking third-party interventions to increases in the duration of intra-state wars. It also reviews several theoretical constructs underlying this correlation, and it adapts the model of the Swing Voter's Curse to provide a novel explanation. Namely, when third-parties intervene in civil wars, local nationals are more likely to abstain from making a commitment to either the government or rebel side as the <b>intervening</b> <b>party</b> serves to cloud perceptions of the latent balance of power between the primary intra-state contenders.

40|$|Scholars {{and policymakers}} have devoted much {{attention}} to issues of third party intervention in conflict. The present paper considers a conflict that draws two countervailing outside interveners. As in the realist perspective, the outside parties are drawn to intervene through some economic or geostrategic interest that would be promoted through the victory of an ally. Using a simple game theoretic model, I find conditions under which outside interveners fall prey to a Prisoner’s Dilemma outcome and become worse off through their own intervention. This result brings into question the desirability of escalatory conflict intervention. The paper also studies conditions required for the United Nations, or some such supra-national institution, to prevent a Prisoner’s Dilemma outcome and successfully deter escalatory bilateral intervention. The findings show that the United Nations can alter the game equilibrium, and deter escalatory intervention, by imposing sufficient costs on the <b>intervening</b> <b>parties.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{idea that}} some {{geographic}} regions, known as shatterbelts, are more conflict-prone than others has appeared and resurfaced in geopolitical writings throughout the twentieth century. Yet {{much of that}} work has been tautological or impressionistic. We attempt {{to sort out the}} conceptual components of shatterbelts from their hypothesized consequences, and to test propositions about the effects of shatterbelts. The results indicate that shatterbelts are more likely than other regions to be the setting for interstate wars, but this is largely because they also generate more militarized disputes that can go to war, rather than because of any greater likelihood that those lesser conflicts will escalate. Internal conflicts were also more common in shatterbelts, although the effect was more modest than with interstate conflict. The portion of conflicts, especially interstate wars, that involve outside intervention is greater in shatterbelts. Yet, given that intervention occurs, conflicts in shatterbelts (with the exception of interstate wars) are not more likely to expand further or to include major powers as the <b>intervening</b> <b>parties.</b> Shatterbelt conflicts, both internal and external, were also generally considerably longer and bloodier than conflicts in other regions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} use of the military instrument for initiating a state-building process in fragile states as a foundation for stability and basic security. This is done by analysing the position of the armed <b>intervening</b> <b>parties</b> in Afghanistan in the 2001 - 2011 period as an empirical and qualitative single-case study. Owing to their weak governmental institutions, instability and lack of basic security, fragile state can represent serious security risks. Events taking place far from national borders of developed states governed by the rule of law can therefore affect the national security situations of those states. Whatever the motive for an armed intervention, before it commences the question must be asked as to whether the intervention force is fit-for-purpose regarding the tasks to be carried out and whether there is a large enough support base, not only for the invasion, but also for the long-term process required for the political consolidation of military results. The intervening force must be capable of kneading this harmonisation into a workable and integrated strategy, giving as much confidence as possible to the legitimate and broadly supported leadership and ownership of the fragile state that was subject of the interventio...|$|R
