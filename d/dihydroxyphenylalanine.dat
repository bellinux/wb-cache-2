40|$|AbstractAqueous {{ozonation}} of the 22 {{most common}} amino acids and some small peptides were studied by electrospray mass (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry. After 5 min of ozonation only His, Met, Trp, and Tyr form oxidation products clearly detectable by ESI-MS. For His, the main oxidation product is {{formed by the}} addition of three oxygen atoms, His + 3 O; for Met and Tyr {{by the addition of}} one oxygen atom, Met + O and Tyr + O, and for Trp by the addition of two oxygen atoms, Trp + 2 O. Ozone oxidation occurs rapidly, products are already detected after 30 s of ozonation, and the reactivity order is Met > Trp > Tyr > His. The structures of the oxygen addition products were investigated by electrospray product ion mass spectra, and by comparing these spectra to those of protonated intact amino acids, and when available, to those of model compounds. His + 3 O was assigned as 2 -amino- 4 -oxo- 4 -(3 -formylureido) butanoic acid (1) formed by oxidation of the His imidazole ring, Met + O as methionine sulfoxide (2), Trp + 2 O as N-formylkynurenine (4), and Tyr + O as a mixture of <b>dihydroxyphenylalanines</b> (7 and 8). Ozonation of peptides show that the same number of oxygen atoms are added as expected from the ozonation of the free amino acids. The product ion mass spectra of both the protonated intact peptides, MH+, and the main ozonation products (M + nO) H+ (n = 1 – 3) revealed b and y type ions as the main fragments, which allow one to assign the type and location of modified amino acid in the model peptides...|$|R

Glucose is converted via glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate pathway to phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, respectively, which are converted via the shikimate pathway to tyrosine and <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine.</b> Although the multistep conversion of <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> to propylproline remains unknown, experiments involving accumulation of 1,2,3,6-tetradehydro-propylproline in mutants lacking a reductase requiring lincomycin cosynthetic factor suggests a biosynthetic scheme that Kuo and coworkers have modified from Brahme et al. to accommodate the remaining steps leading to propylproline.|$|E
5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase.

This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.|$|E
5000|$|After {{reading an}} article by the Dutchman Christiaan Eijkman that {{indicated}} that persons who ate brown rice were less vulnerable to beri-beri than those who ate only the fully milled product, Funk tried to isolate the substance responsible, and he succeeded. Because that substance contained an amine group, he called it [...] "vitamine". It was later {{to be known as}} vitamin B3 (niacin), though he thought that it would be thiamine (vitamin B1) and described it as [...] "anti-beri-beri-factor". In 1911 he published his first paper in English, on <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine.</b> Funk was sure that more than one substance like Vitamin B1 existed, and in his 1912 article for the Journal of State Medicine, he proposed the existence of at least four vitamins: one preventing beriberi (“antiberiberi”); one preventing scurvy (“antiscorbutic”); one preventing pellagra (“antipellagric”); and one preventing rickets (“antirachitic”). From there, Funk published a book, The Vitamines, in 1912, and later that year received a Beit Fellowship to continue his research.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 the Austrian {{biochemist}} Oleh Hornykiewicz, {{while at}} the University of Vienna, examined results of autopsies of patients who had died with Parkinson's disease. He suggested that the disease was associated with, or caused by, {{a reduction in the}} levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia of the brain. Since dopamine itself did not enter the brain, he tried treating twenty patients with a racemic mixture of <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> (DOPA), which could enter the brain and be converted there to dopamine by the action of DOPA decarboxylase. His results were positive, as were those of another trial in Montreal run by André Barbeau. Unfortunately, other investigators were unable to replicate these early results, and the use of DOPA remained in question until 1967, when George Cotzias at the Brookhaven National Laboratories in Upton, New York, used megadoses of DOPA, up to 16 grams per day. Not long after these results became known, Curt Porter at Merck showed that L-DOPA was the active stereoisomer, thus reducing the effective dose to half.|$|E

When the hypertensive effect of tyramine was blocked by bretylium, both noradrenaline and <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine,</b> when slowly infused, were found to restore it. The well-known block by cocaine of the hypertensive response to tyramine could also be reversed by intravenous infusion of noradrenaline and <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine.</b> It is concluded that the infusion of noradrenaline and <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> makes available noradrenaline in the postganglionic adrenergic nerves which is necessary for the action of tyramine...|$|E

40|$|The in vivo {{effects of}} remoxipride, in {{relation}} to some of its identified metabolites, were investigated in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The methods used included: (1) estimation of the in vivo rate of brain monoamine synthesis by measuring the accumulation of <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> and 5 -hydroxytrypto-phan after decarboxylase inhibition; (2) observations of spon-taneous locomotor activity in a photocell-equipped open-field arena (' 0. 5 m 2); (3) treadmill locomotion (' 4 m min 21); (4) inclined grid (60 °) catalepsy test; (5) d-amphetamine-induced (1. 0 mg kg 21) hyperlocomotion;(6) quinpirole-induced (0. 4 mg kg 21) hypothermia. By use {{of one or more}} of these tests, the findings with remoxipride were as follows: First, remoxipride had a late onset of action (up to 3 h). Second, potency and efficacy depended on exposure to hepatic metabolism. Thus, intraperitoneal administration was more effective than the sub-cutaneous route, whereas virtually all biological effects were lost on intracerebroventricular administration.

40|$|Adult Syrian hamsters {{were given}} a {{subcutaneous}} injection of reserpine 3 days before an intraperitoneal injection of 3 H- 3, 4 <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> or 3 H- 5, hydroxytryptophan and the carotid bodies were subsequently prepared for electron microscopic radioautography. Other Syrian hamsters {{were given a}} subcutaneous injection of reserpine and the carotid bodies were subjected to a sensitive cytochemical test {{for the detection of}} unsubstituted amines. These studies were made to determine whether the labeled amine precursors were incorporated into the cells and to see whether the parenchymal cells were affected by reserpine treatment. Material from hamsters treated first with reserpine and subsequently injected with 3 H- 3, 4 <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> or 3 H- 5, hydroxytryptophan exhibited reduced grains of silver over the cells which were associated mainly with the dense cores of the cytoplasmic granules. These studies offer evidence that the granules of the carotid body incorporate catecholamine and indolamine precursors. Material from hamsters incubated for the presence of unsubstituted amines gave a positive reaction (opaque cytoplasmic granules) for catecholamines but not for indolamines. The latter substances may not be present in quantities sufficient to register a positive reaction in the cytochemical test.

40|$|Prolonged head-down {{bed rest}} (HDBR) {{provides}} {{a model for}} examining responses to chronic weightlessness in humans. Eight healthy volunteers underwent HDBR for 2 wk. Antecubital venous blood was sampled for plasma levels of catechols [norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine, dopamine, <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine,</b> dihydroxyphenylglycol, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid] after supine rest on a control (C) day and after 4 h and 7 and 14 days of HDBR. Urine was collected after 2 h of supine rest during day C, 2 h before HDBR, and during the intervals 1 - 4, 4 - 24, 144 - 168 (day 7), and 312 - 336 h (day 14) of HDBR. All subjects had decreased plasma and blood volumes (mean 16 %), atriopeptin levels (31 %), and peripheral venous pressure (26 %) after HDBR. NE excretion on day 14 of HDBR was decreased by 35 % from that on day C, without further trends as HDBR continued, whereas plasma levels were only variably and nonsignificantly decreased. Excretion rates of dihydroxyphenylglycol and <b>dihydroxyphenylalanine</b> decreased slightly during HDBR; excretion rates of epinephrine, dopamine, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and plasma levels of catechols were unchanged. The results suggest that HDBR produces sustained inhibition of sympathoneural release, turnover, and synthesis of NE without affecting adrenomedullary secretion or renal dopamine production. Concurrent hypovolemia probably interferes with detection of sympathoinhibition by plasma levels of NE and other catechols in this setting. Sympathoinhibition, despite decreased blood volume, may help to explain orthostatic intolerance in astronauts returning from spaceflights...|$|E

After phenylalanine lower blood levels of this were found in Parkinsonian patients than in controls, but tyrosine levels were the same. After tyrosine lower levels of this were also found in patients compared with controls.

The production of DOPA, i. e. tyrosinase activity, {{and the rate of}} colour development in homogenates of Norway lobster were found to be directly related to the phenolase activity as measured using catechol oxidase activity. It is proposed that tyrosine is the initial substrate for blackspot development in Norway lobster and that the process is an enzymatically controlled oxidation.

L-DOPA was successfully expressed and purified in a phenylalanine auxotroph, GBP 152 -PheL-DOPA, but not successfully expressed in a tyrosine auxotroph. Cyclic voltammetry was used and the data obtained indicated that an increase in glucose concentration corresponded to a decrease in oxidation, meaning that L-DOPA is less readily oxidized to the quinone structure in the presence of glucose.

No reaction product was found in early premelanosomes. In premelanosomes, the reaction product of DOPA appears first in vesicles approximately 400 A in diameter which are surrounded by a matrix with a characteristic periodicity.

The enhanced sensitivity of DA�/ � mice to agonists was independent of changes in steady-state levels of dopamine receptors and the presynaptic dopamine transporter as measured by ligand binding. The acute behavioral response of DA�/ � mice to a dopamine D 1 receptor agonist was correlated with c-fos induction in the striatum, a brain nucleus that receives dense dopaminergic input.

40|$|Several indoles {{served as}} {{substrates}} for the phenoloxidase of Cryptococcus neoformans {{and resulted in}} the production of a melanin-like pigment. In general, a higher percentage of C. neoformans var. neoformans (A and D serotypes) isolates could produce pigment from indoles than could those of var. gattii (B and C serotypes). Only compounds with a hydroxyl or an amino group on the phenyl ring produced pigment; methoxy, nitro, methyl, and fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring were inactive, as was a hydroxyl group at the 2 position on the indole ring. The phenoloxidase of C. neoformans thus appears to differ from that found in Mycobacterium leprae, which cannot use a hydroxyindole, desoxyfructo- 5 -hydroxytryptamine, as a substrate.
