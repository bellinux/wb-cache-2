5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady <b>growth</b> <b>path</b> using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
25|$|As Prof. Okishio himself acknowledged, his {{argument}} {{is based on}} a comparative static analysis. His starting point is an equilibrium <b>growth</b> <b>path</b> of an economy with a given technique. In a given branch of industry, a technical improvement is introduced (in a way similar to what Marx described) and then the new equilibrium <b>growth</b> <b>path</b> is established under the assumption that the new technique is generally adopted by the capitalists of that branch. The result is that even under Marx's assumptions about technical progress, the new equilibrium <b>growth</b> <b>path</b> goes along with a higher rate of profit. However, if one drops the assumption that a capitalist economy moves from one equilibrium to another, this result no longer holds. There is no real evidence that capitalist development spontaneously tends to equilibrium, since there are continuously market fluctuations, mismatches of supply and demand, and periodic economic crises. In addition perfect competition does not exist, and corporations may actively try to block competitors in their markets (e.g. European Union Microsoft competition case).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an approach to}} new firm growth that views this as an unfolding developmental process. This approach {{is based on a}} Penrosean (1995) model of the firm. We find that new firm growth is non-linear and prone to interruptions and setbacks to an extent overlooked in the literature. From the model of development used, five propositions are drawn concerning measurable features of new firms' growth paths; these relate to patterns of survival, continuousness of growth, turning points, reversals and cumulative growth. These propositions are examined in the light of data on the <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> of new firms in three countries, with aggregate comparisons of firms' <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> effected by graphical representations and sequence analysis.

It is then applied to monitor the puberty growth among a group of Finnish teenagers, and yields interesting insights. A Monte-Carlo study is conducted to investigate the performance of our proposed algorithm, with comparison to existing methods. In the second part of the dissertation, the proposed screening method is further extended to incorporate subject level covariates, such as parental information. When it is applied to the same group of Finnish teens, it shows enhanced screening performance in identifying possible abnormal <b>growth</b> <b>paths.</b> Simulation studies are also conducted to validate the proposed covariate adjusted method...|$|R

40|$|Research {{highlighting}} the differential resilience of economies to shocks {{opens up the}} possibility that long-run <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> are associated with how regions cope with and recover from such shocks. To date, however, there has been limited exploration into whether long-run evolutionary <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> or trajectories influence regional economic resilience, and what types of trajectory might be more associated with resilience. This paper explores the connections between regional economic resilience and regional and national growth trajectories by utilizing a novel set of methods to group regions according to the similarity of their <b>growth</b> <b>paths,</b> identifying {{the relative importance of}} national growth for regional growth, and categorizing regions according to their resilience to the 2007 - 2008 economic crisis. The results suggest that regions have empirically identifiable long-run and path-dependent development trajectories that are significantly associated with industrial employment shares and observed resilience outcomes. Critically, however, these regional <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> are significantly shaped by national trajectories. Furthermore, regions with greater employment shares in sectors that are less susceptible to demand fluctuations are likely to experience more stable growth rates and be more resilient to economic downturns. This has implications for understanding the importance of evolutionary trends and specifically the role of national contexts and industrial legacies in shaping regional resilience...|$|R

A multiple case study methodology {{was used to examine}} the <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> of eight SMEs over a period of fourteen years. Four firms represented manufacturing and four, the professional and business services industry. The firms were paired according to similar sectors and contrasting <b>growth</b> <b>paths.</b> Longitudinal employment data illustrated the firms’ <b>growth</b> <b>paths,</b> and the primary method of data collection was semi-structured interviews of the firms’ owner-managers. The research incorporated extensive literature, including traditional research approaches and life cycle models and emergent literature on organisational learning and <b>growth</b> <b>paths.</b> The <b>growth</b> and non-growth firms were found to be distinct from each other, regardless of industry. The growth firms’ owner-managers had strong growth ambitions and actively sought the recognition and challenges that arise from the operation of multiple growth businesses. The non-growth owner-managers had passive growth ambitions and focused on maintaining their accustomed lifestyle. These differences were also illustrated in the firms’ approaches to networking, internationalisation and technological advancement. The growth firm owner-managers were all portfolio entrepreneurs and had strong professional networks, which they considered were strategically vital. In contrast, the non-growth owner-managers were novice entrepreneurs and were nonchalant towards networking. Innovation and flexibility were identified as important characteristics in the long-term performance of the firms. Findings also indicated that owner-managers’ perceptions of their external business environment determined the influence it had on the business. Individual and collective learning processes underpin these findings in determining long-term growth performance of the firms.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{a growing body of}} work in {{economic}} geography and innovation studies has enhanced our understanding of forms and determinants of regional industrial path development. The importance of policy, however, has received limited attention and accordingly, the role of policy for the emergence and development of new regional industrial <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> remains largely unexplored. This paper takes an institutional perspective and suggests that the regional innovation system approach can contribute to conceptualising and analysing the role of policy for new regional industrial path development. We argue that in order to turn regional preconditions into new <b>growth</b> <b>paths,</b> regional innovation systems require strong policy capacities, consisting of formal and governance capacities. In the empirical part, we analyse the emergence and further development of two new <b>growth</b> <b>paths</b> in the region of Scania in southern Sweden, namely biogas and new media. Based on personal interviews with policy makers, representatives from knowledge and supporting organisations and firms as well as a document analysis, we investigate how policy interventions have influenced the rise and evolution of these two industries.

2500|$|From {{the point}} of view of today's {{mainstream}} schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates money supply and/or aggregate demand on a stable <b>growth</b> <b>path.</b> When threatened by the forecast of a depression central banks should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing. At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in Say's law and the self-equilibrating powers of the market and failed to explain the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone liquidationism was a position mainly held by the Austrian School. The liquidationist position was that a depression is good medicine. The idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies, then so be it. An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences. Regarding the policies of President Hoover, economists like Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong point out that President Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him. Despite liquidationist expectations, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933. Milton Friedman called the leave-it-alone liquidationism [...] "dangerous nonsense". He wrote: ...|$|E
