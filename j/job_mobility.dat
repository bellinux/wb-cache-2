40|$|Both authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. This paper {{addresses}} two questions: Do changing labour market conditions affect <b>job</b> and occupational <b>mobility</b> over the life-course? Are there {{gender differences in}} the effects of labour market fluctuations? Demand-side theories of employers ‟ recruitment practices and supply-side micro-economic theory of individuals ‟ search for jobs are used to generate a set of hypotheses about how <b>job</b> and occupational <b>mobility</b> might be affected as labour market conditions fluctuate. We draw on longitudinal job and occupational history data from two British birth cohort studies originating in 1958 and 1970. Focusing on the early careers of individuals, fixed-effects models of <b>job</b> and occupational <b>mobility</b> are estimated. Labour market conditions are measured by the actual level of unemployment and the direction in which unemployment rates are moving. The probabilities of <b>job</b> and occupational <b>mobility</b> are significantly lower in economically depressed conditions than in more buoyant times, especially for individuals in lower level jobs. Also, the gender gap in occupational mobility chances, in upward mobility chances in particular, is widening as labour market condition...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a two sector general {{equilibrium}} model with fully integrated labour and goods markets is presented. The two labour markets are segmented and represent two different "labour market regimes". The primary sector is an unionized high wage sector with "good" and rationed jobs, in the secondary sector the wage rate is given by a competitive labour market with "bad" <b>jobs.</b> <b>Mobility</b> between the two sectors takes place as in the Harris-Todaro model of migration depending on expected wage income in a sector. Goods demand depends on real household (workers) income and on relative prices given by unit costs. A simulation experiment shows that an ex ante aggregate neutral demand shift from the secondary to the primary sector might {{have a positive impact}} on aggregate unemployment, while a demand shift from the primary to the secondary sector could have a negative impact.

50|$|Oakland’s {{analysis}} {{stated that}} historically {{high levels of}} unemployment and limited <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> in New Orleans were {{the root cause of}} this issue. According to Oakland’s study, there was a very high unemployment rate in the New Orleans area before Hurricane Katrina affected it and this was largely because of the limited <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> caused by high concentrations of the city’s poorest people living in a few areas. Oakland was quoted in the New York Times regarding his analysis, “Where there are high concentrations of poverty, people can’t see a way out. Maybe the diaspora is a blessing.” Oakland's analysis showed that the living conditions in New Orleans were not attractive for the poor to begin with and Hurricane Katrina provided an exit from those conditions, resulting in the lack of interest to return to the area.|$|E
5000|$|A 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) that sampled {{married men}} in the United States aged 20-55 found <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> rates were 30-31% lower among those with employment-provided health {{insurance}} coverage, compared with those without it. An NMES literature review {{in the same year}} found that studies typically reported a 20-40% reduction in mobility rates due to employment-related health insurance. A 1984 Panel Study of Income Dynamics examining mobility rates among full-time workers aged 25-55 found no statistically significant results. A Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (1985, 1986, 1987) found that state and federal policy to mandate continuation of coverage increased the <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> of prime-age male workers.

40|$|The {{central focus}} of this article is the {{influence}} of over- and undereducation on <b>job</b> satisfaction, <b>mobility,</b> training participation and wages when four alternative mismatch measures are used. The sign, magnitude and significance of the effects largely diverge between these measures. When attained education is controlled for, overeducated workers are less satisfied, more mobile, participate less in training and earn less than adequately educated workers. With respect to undereducation, we have no clear results. When years of required education are controlled for, no robust results are found for <b>job</b> satisfaction and <b>mobility.</b> Overeducated workers earn more than adequately educated colleagues, but have similar training opportunities. None of the measures clearly outperforms the alternatives for the explanation of all variables of interest. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{part due}} to the {{regional}} disparity of the three campuses each campus has, over time, developed its own distinct culture and traditions. Contributing to this is also the fact that union contracts apply to the individual campuses rather than to the college as a whole, meaning that each campus has its own separate teaching, professional and support staff unions, with little chance for <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> between the campuses. Meetings of college-wide bodies are often held in rented space in the city of Drummondville, which is more or less equidistant from each of the three campuses and the Sherbrooke administrative offices.

50|$|The central {{provisions}} of the 1980s reform related to funding, the technology market and cooperative ventures, and the rights and potential <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> of individual researchers. The intent of the reformers was to change the basic conditions of the economic system, so that the self-interest that had pushed managers of factories and research institutes toward compartmentalization, duplication, and hoarding of resources would henceforth push them toward cooperation, division of labor, and orientation toward {{the needs of the}} market. Because these reforms represented a radical departure from the procedures developed since the 1950s, the leadership anticipated that their implementation would be slow, and it planned to phase them in over a number of years.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores both {{observable}} and unobservable {{variables that}} would affect employed workers decisions on job change. We find that age, job satisfaction, satisfaction with working environment or job security, and firm size are among the major factors determining workers intentions of job-to-job mobility. Younger workers and workers in smaller firms {{are more likely to}} look for other jobs. We also find that men are more likely to consider a change in job than women, but when actually looking for another job is concerned, men and women do not differ.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} and evaluates {{determinants of}} employees’ <b>job</b> and residential <b>mobility.</b> It examines mobility of fulltime employees in selected sectors in 2003 / 2004, using register {{data provided by}} Statistics Netherlands. We estimate a multinomial model of job and residential change. The results illustrate that individuals decide upon changing jobs and/or relocating by {{taking into account the}} strength of their family- and job-related ties. We also find that the prevalence of internal versus external career opportunities impedes job changes. While a high salary facilitates relocation, our findings regarding the effect of salary on interfirm mobility were inconclusive. A long commuting distance encourages (simultaneous) <b>job</b> and housing <b>mobility,</b> while being situated in the municipality of a large city encourages employees to either change jobs, or to relocate. ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{secondary}} sector, job management {{is entitled to}} complete control {{because there is a}} larger turnout. Many in this job type either leave or are replaced quickly. These jobs give low emphasis on job morale and their workers lack motivation. The secondary jobs are mostly low-skilled, require relatively little training, and can be learned relatively quickly on the job. There are few barriers to <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> within the secondary sector. Because the jobs are unattractive, there is little incentive to stay, and there are high levels of labor turnover, with workers moving on to other jobs or employers. Wages are low, and the terms and conditions of the job are poor.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1980s, however, <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> and {{attempts}} to place scientists where their talents could have the greatest effect were the aspect of reform in which least was achieved. Transfer of scientists from one unit to another remained a major step, and a relatively infrequent one. According to the State Science and Technology Commission, 2 percent of scientists and engineers changed work units in 1983, and only 4 percent in 1985. Personnel still required the permission of their work unit heads to transfer, and that permission often was withheld. Many directors of institutes were accused of having a [...] "feudal mentality," [...] that is, regarding personnel {{as part of their}} unit's property.|$|E

Some observers believed that because of its potential challenge to the authority of the party, which controlled personnel matters in all work units, <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> for scientists, even though it would have promoted scientific productivity and the growth of the economy, may have been too extreme a reform to be feasible.|$|E

5000|$|The {{degree of}} {{segregation}} varies from province to province. A series of field studies by China Center for Economic Research {{demonstrate that the}} labor market in Sichuan province is relatively integrated, while in Guangdong province and Shanghai the labor market is quite segregated with [...] "rural migratory-worker urban-resident-worker dualism". [...] In addition to inadequate social protection, the primary reason of the occupational segregation is the migrant workers’ lack of skills and education, which keeps them in manual labor. Migrant workers have less human capital since they have less schooling, shorter job tenure and less training compared with the local residents. Moreover, {{because of the high}} rate of <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> among rural migrant workers, employers have little incentive to train them and thereby prevent them from increasing their social capital.|$|E
50|$|Colonias can {{be found}} in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and California. To this day {{residents}} are mostly Hispanic and about 65% of the colonia population were born in the United States. Overall, colonias consist of low-income communities with families that cannot afford goods in a formal economy. In a random survey by the Texas Department of State Health Services, it was found that half of the families make less than $834 a month. Unemployment is common in colonias as most people lack proper education. About 70% of colonia residents have not graduated from high school, which hampers their <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> and suppresses wages. And since most people living in colonias are Hispanic, they lack English language skills, preventing them from seeking assistance. The unemployment rate for families in colonias is 18%. Neighboring cities, in comparison, have an 11% unemployment rate.|$|E
50|$|Concentrating {{the family}} {{resources}} to achieve home ownership {{was a common}} strategy in the ethnic European neighborhoods. It meant sacrificing current consumption, and pulling children out of school {{as soon as they}} could earn a wage. By 1900, working-class ethnic immigrants owned homes at higher rates than native-born people. After borrowing from friends and building associations, immigrants kept boarders, grew market gardens, and opened home-based commercial laundries, eroding home-work distinctions, while sending out women and children to work to repay loans. They sought not middle-class upward mobility but the security of home ownership. Many social workers wanted them to pursue upward <b>job</b> <b>mobility</b> (which required more education), but realtors asserted that houses were better than a bank for a poor man. With hindsight, and considering uninsured banks' precariousness, this appears to have been true. Chicago's workers made immense sacrifices for home ownership, contributing to Chicago's sprawling suburban geography and to modern myths about the American dream. The Jewish community, by contrast, rented apartments and maximized education and upward mobility for the next generation.|$|E
