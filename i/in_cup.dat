5|$|Chelsea have long-standing rivalries with North London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.

More recently a rivalry with Liverpool has grown following repeated clashes <b>in</b> <b>cup</b> competitions. Chelsea's fellow West London sides Brentford, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers are generally not considered major rivals, as matches have only taken place intermittently due to the clubs often being in separate divisions. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries to be with (in order): Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. In the same survey, fans of six clubs (Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, Tottenham and West Ham United) named Chelsea {{as one of their}} three main rivals.
