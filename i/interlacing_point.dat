40|$|Abstract. As manual tilt {{correction}} {{has always}} been the bottleneck of automatic weave image analysis and processing, this paper proposed a means by which automatic weave image tilt correction can be achieved. First, mathematical morphology is carried out in weave image preprocessing for de-noise and enhancement. OTSU and raster scanning are followed to detect target rectangles in the image so as to determine the outlines of interlacing points on which the <b>Interlacing</b> <b>Point</b> Fullness (ISF) is established. Then the relationship between ISF and the correcting angle of weave image is discussed and the correcting coefficient built on ISF is used to counteract the disturbance of weave surface distortions in order to identify the correcting angle in a comprehensive way...|$|E

The flatness of STF, which comes from near absence of crimp, significally reduces accumulation of matrix at the <b>interlacing</b> <b>points</b> and thereby the dead weight of the final composite material. This not only reduces {{the weight of the}} final composite material product but also eliminates the print-through defects associated with post curing of the undesired matrix accumulation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposed}} a new method based on secondary encoding technology {{to recognize the}} pattern of woven fabric. The method disposed the information of both {{the top and bottom}} fabric images. The result of analyzing the regularity of the intensity variation of the horizontal and vertical direction of image can be used to determine the interlacing position of yarn sections. The secondary encoding technology coded the color information of both sides of fabric image, then the types of cross points can be determined. After getting the color information of fabric on the warp and weft direction, the color pattern could be obtained, and {{it can be used to}} correct the errors of classification of cross-point classification. Finally a fabric model can be built which contains types of <b>interlacing</b> <b>points</b> and color pattern...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{model of a}} yarn pullout test for plain woven fabrics is introduced. The main focus {{of the study is}} on the realization of a 3 D fabric geometrical model, the incorporation of anisotropic material properties and the validation of yarn and fabric finite element meso-models using experimental results. The material properties of yarn and fabric were assumed to be linear orthotropic. The required engineering constants were obtained from experimentally-measured tensile, compression and shear diagrams. The accuracy of the applied engineering constants was investigated by finite element (FE) modeling of yarn pure bending. The yarn pullout test was modeled with the Abaqus FE package. The fabric sample was modeled with solid elements for the weft and warp yarns in the <b>interlacing</b> <b>points,</b> which are directly involved in the yarn pullout, plus shell elements for the parts of the fabric that undergo only shear deformation. The effects of the geometrical model and material anisotropy were investigated and the predicted force-displacement profiles of the yarn pullout test were compared with experimental measurements. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between the melting temperatures of poly(propylene) (PP) fibre and random poly(propylene-co-ethylene) (PPE) was exploited {{in order to establish}} processing conditions for an all PP composite. Under these conditions the matrix must be a liquid in order to ensure good wetting and impregnatin at the fibres, though the temperature must not be too high to avoid metling the fibres. The high chemical compatibility of the two components allowed creation of strong physico-chemical interactions, which favour strong interfacial adhesion. The static and dynamic mechanical properties and morphology of poly(propylene) woven fabric reinforced random PPE composites have been investigated with reference to the woven geometry that influenced the properties of the woven composites. Among the various cloth architectures that were used in the PP-PPE composites, the satin weave imparted overall excellent mechanical properties due to the weave parameters, such as high float length and fibre count, low <b>interlace</b> <b>point</b> and crimp angle,etc. Morphology of the composite has been investigated by macro photography and scanning electron microscopy. Images from scanning electron microscopy provided confirmation of the above results by displaying the consolidation and good fibre matrix wetting of the composites...|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral, {{begun in}} 1131, {{in a style}} of Norman {{architecture}} which would be more accurately called Sicilian Romanesque. The exterior is well preserved, and is largely decorated with <b>interlacing</b> <b>pointed</b> arches; the windows also are pointed. On {{each side of the}} façade is a massive tower of four stories. The round-headed Norman portal is worthy of note. A semi-circular apse is set into the east end wall. Its strengthening counterforts that work like buttresses, are shaped as paired columns to lighten their aspect. The groined vaulting of the roof is visible in the choir and the right transept, {{while the rest of the}} church has a wooden roof. Fine cloisters, coeval with the cathedral, adjoin it. The interior of the cathedral was restored in 1559, though the pointed arches of the nave, borne by ancient granite columns, are still visible; and the only mosaics preserved are those of the apse and the last bay of the choir; they are remarkably fine specimens of the Byzantine art of the period (1148) and, though restored in 1859-62, have suffered much less than those at Palermo and Monreale from the process. The figure of the Pantocrator gracing the apse is especially noteworthy.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of fibre, yarn, and fabric properties on the bagging behaviour of woven fabrics is studied by developing rheological models and comparing {{them with the}} results of statistical analysis on experimental measurements. Three rheological models are developed to describe the bagging-deformation features at different stages of bagging processes, from which three types of deformation energy are identified: elastic and viscoelastic energies of the fibres, and the frictional-deformation energy resulting from the frictional slippage between fibres and yarns. To evaluate the theoretical analysis, 24 fabrics were tested to determine their bagging behaviour, the mechanical properties of constituent fibres and yarns, and fabric structural features. Statistical regression analysis is applied to derive the parameters describing bagging fatigue and their relationships with the fibre and yarn mechanical properties and fabric structural features. A comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical analysis indicates that a decrease in the work of loading with repeated bagging deformation resulted from two basic causes: the stress relaxation of the fibres due to the fibres' viscoelastic behaviour and the friction between fibres and between yarns due to frictional restraints inherent in the fabric structures. The three parameters (Q o, U σ) describing the fabric-fatigue process are shown to be dependent on fibre and yarn mechanical properties and fabric structural parameters, such as fabric thickness, weight, cover factor, and <b>interlacing</b> <b>points.</b> Using the regression equations for the three parameters (Q o, U σ), we show that the bagging-fatigue behaviour and fabric-residual-bagging height are predictable from the fundamental fibre and yarn mechanical properties and fabric structural parameters, indicating that a subjective perception of fabric-bagging is also predictable from the parameters.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} extremal point systems on the real line consisting of two <b>interlaced</b> sets of <b>points</b> solving a modified minimum energy problem. We show that these extremal points for the intervals [− 1, 1], [0,∞) and (−∞,∞), which are analogues of Menke points for a closed curve, {{are related to the}} zeros and extrema of classical orthogonal polynomials. Use of external fields in the form of suitable weight functions instead of constraints motivates the study of “weighted Menke points” on [0,∞) and (−∞,∞). We also discuss the asymptotic behavior of the Lebesgue constant for the Menke points on [− 1, 1]...|$|R

60|$|Just {{about the}} hour Lord Howe was killed, Montcalm fell {{back with his}} force from his {{position}} by the falls, and resolved to make a stand {{at the base of}} the peninsula on which Ticonderoga stands. The outline of the works had already been traced, and the soldiers of the battalion of Berry had made some progress in constructing them. At daybreak, just as Abercromby was drawing his troops back to the landing place, Montcalm's whole army set to work. Thousands of trees were hewn down, and the trunks piled one upon another, so as to form a massive breastwork. The line followed the top of the ridge, with many zigzags, so that the whole front could be swept by a fire of musketry and grape. The log wall was eight or nine feet high, and the upper tier was formed of single logs, in which notches were cut to serve as loopholes. The whole space in front was cleared of trees, for the distance of a musket shot, the trees being felled so that their tops turned outwards, forming an almost impenetrable obstacle, while, immediately in front of the log wall, the ground was covered with heavy boughs, overlapping and <b>interlaced,</b> their <b>points</b> being sharpened. This position was, in fact, absolutely impregnable against an attack, in front, by infantry.|$|R
40|$|A basic {{property}} of both polynomial and more general Tchebyche#an splines {{is that the}} associated B-spline collocation matrix has certain total positivity properties, and it is nonsingular {{if and only if}} well-known interlacing conditions hold. Using a technique from a recent paper of Mørken, we extend these results to L-splines. 1. Introduction One of the most important properties of classical polynomial B-splines is the fact that matrices formed from ordered subsets of them by evaluation at a set of (possibly repeated) points always have nonnegative determinants which are positive if and only if the knots and interpolation <b>points</b> <b>interlace</b> appropriately. This property leads to a number of important facts about splines, including the existence of interpolants and a variation diminishing formula. The analogous total positivity property has been established for Tchebyche#an splines, and a class of generalized B-splines [1], but not for L-splines. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to estab [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} genesis is a {{very complex}} process that involves a sequence of pathogenetic cellular events. Mutation of various genes and numerous other cellular mechanisms {{play an important role in}} the course of malignant melanocyte alteration and their malignant transformation from naevi into melanoma. Apoptosis is an active, genetically controlled process of programmed cell death, which leads to cell destruction and cell death without involvement of surrounding cells or inflammatory response. In this process, disrupted mechanisms of cell regulation and apoptosis take place in malignant melanoma cells, thus leading to their uncontrolled proliferation and melanocyte growth. Apoptosis is a process that involves two major pathways, the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which <b>interlace</b> at certain <b>points</b> and ultimately result in apoptosis. It can be said that molecular events regulating cell survival, nomal growth arrest, apoptosis and cell differentiation, contribute to the overall pathogenesis of malignant cell growth. It is presumed that in the future, understanding of molecular aberrations and cellular processes, such as cell signaling, cell cycle regulation and cell apoptosis, will be essential for better patient monitoring and rational design of effective treatment...|$|R
50|$|The Evangelist John {{is shown}} in a fully frontal pose. He holds a book or tablet of some kind, with his hand over it and his heart. This could be a {{reference}} to his position as the scribe {{of one of the}} Gospels. He has blond hair and blue eyes, and his robes are in shades of rich blue and red. The robes flow around him, forming interlaced, almost geometric shapes, echoing those around the border. There is a border surrounding the portrait. In this case, John’s halo, a marker of his holy status, breaks the frame created by the border. The border is relatively sparse above and below the Evangelist, however on {{the left and the right}} elaborate designs have been created within the border. Interlaced line work fills squares in all four corners, two panels on the left and the right feature interlocking animal shapes, elongated and <b>interlaced</b> to the <b>point</b> of being nearly unrecognizable. Both of these patterns call to mind the style of metalwork also popular in this period. The colors are faded, but the richness of this image is evident by the use of gold and the immense attention to detail, making this one of the leading examples of illuminated manuscript art from this period.|$|R
