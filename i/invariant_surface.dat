The Fitzhugh Nagumo partial differential equation is a reaction diffusion equation that arises both in population genetics and in modeling the transmission of action potentials in the nervous system. In this paper {{we are interested in}} finding solutions to this equation.

40|$|The {{surface coat}} of Trypanosoma brucei, formed by about 10 (7) {{molecules}} of the membrane-form {{variant surface glycoprotein}} (mfVSG) per cell, is generally considered to constitute a barrier against the access of antibodies directed to <b>invariant</b> <b>surface</b> proteins. The recent characterization of two <b>invariant</b> <b>surface</b> glycoproteins (ISGs) with apparent molecular masses of 65 and 75 kDa (ISG 65 and ISG 75; 70, 000 and 50, 000 molecules per cell, respectively), which are both predicted to be composed of large extracellular domains, single transmembrane alpha-helices, and small intracellular domains, enabled a critical test of this hypothesis. Although ISG 65 is distributed over the entire surface of the parasites, it is not accessible to antibodies or to the proteinase trypsin in live cells provided the mfVSG is also proteinase resistant. ISG 75 is similarly distributed; its accessibility to antibodies depends on the expressed mfVSG, and it is sensitive to trypsin in a variant clone in which the mfVSG is proteinase resistant. Vaccination experiments using recombinant proteins to a mixture of the native ISGs were unsuccessful. ISG 65 but not ISG 75 elicited an antibody response in chronically infected mice. The results strengthen {{the view of the}} protective properties of the variant surface glycoprotein coat by steric hindrance and suggest that additional factors such as low abundance or low immunogenicity of <b>invariant</b> <b>surface</b> proteins may prevent a control of the disease by the humoral immune response...|$|E

40|$|Shear {{bands are}} narrow zones of intense shear {{observed}} during plastic deformations of metals at high strain rates. Because they often precede rupture, their study attracted attention {{as a mechanism}} of material failure. Here, we aim to reveal the onset of localization into shear bands using a simple model developed from viscoplasticity. We exploit the properties of scale invariance of the model to construct a family of self-similar focusing solutions that capture the nonlinear mechanism of shear band formation. The key step is to de-singularize a reduced system of singular ordinary differential equations and reduce the problem into {{the construction of a}} heteroclinic orbit for an autonomous system of three first-order equations. The associated dynamical system has fast and slow time scales, forming a singularly perturbed problem. The geometric singular perturbation theory is applied to this problem to achieve an <b>invariant</b> <b>surface.</b> The flow on the <b>invariant</b> <b>surface</b> is analyzed via the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem to construct a heteroclinic orbit.
