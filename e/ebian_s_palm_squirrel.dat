50|$|The Indian <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> or three-striped <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Funambulus palmarum) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Sciuridae found {{naturally}} in India (south of the Vindhyas) and Sri Lanka. In the late 19th century, the <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> was introduced to Madagascar, Réunion, Mayotte, Comoro Islands, Mauritius, Seychelles and Australia, where it has since become a minor pest. The closely related five-striped <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel,</b> F. pennantii, is found in northern India, and its range partly overlaps with this species.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The five-striped Indian <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel,</b> Funambulus pennanti, is a {{seasonal}} breeder from January to August. Mature females are sexually quiescent from September to December; recrudescence of the gonad starts in late December. The <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> is a reflex ovulator. A mature female may produce two litters of approximately three young each in one breeding season. The period of suckling is 6 weeks. Mature females experience {{a short period}} of post-lactational anoestrus during the breeding season prior to the onset of second oestrus. The role of exteroceptive factors in regulating the reproductive cycle of the <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Epixerus ebii, {{also known}} as Ebian's <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel,</b> Temminck's giant squirrel, or the western <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel,</b> is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is the only species in the genus Epixerus, {{although}} eastern populations (subspecies Epixerus ebii wilsoni) were previously regarded as a separate species, E. wilsoni. It is found in West and Central Africa. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R

5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Funambulus pennantii) {{also called}} the five-striped <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae. Some authorities recognise two subspecies, F. p. pennantii and F. p. argentescens. It is a semi-arboreal species found in tropical and subtropical dry deciduous forest and many other rural and urban habitats. It is a common species {{with a wide range}} and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R

50|$|When nesting, {{they may}} mob <b>palm</b> <b>squirrels</b> but being small birds {{they are usually}} on the defensive. Their predators include bats (esp.

40|$|Attribution License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Daily injections of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA, dopamine precursor) given 4 h after 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP, serotonin precursor) induced inhibitory responses in recrudescing gonad (in {{the first week}} of December) of Indian <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel,</b> a seasonally breeding subtropical animal. Other temporal relations (L-DOPAgiven at 0, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h after 5 -HTP administration) did not show any effect on the recrudescing gonad. This inhibitory effect of 4 h was evident under short day length (6 : 18) group but was masked by the increasing day length of nature (NDL, late December onwards) and increased photoperiod of long day group (16 : 8). It is apparent that seasonal testicular recrudescence of Indian <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> during short day length by 4 h relation of 5 -HTP and L-DOPA is not a pharmacological effect but actually is an alteration of seasonality in this annually breeding mammal. It seems that endogenous mechanism controlling seasonal testicular recrudescence of Indian <b>palm</b> <b>squirrel</b> is reset by timed daily injections of these neurotransmitter drugs. It is suggested that in spite of different environmental factors (photoperiod, humidity, etc.) used by different species to time their annual reproduction, basic mechanism of seasonality appears to be the same, that is, the temporal synergism of neurotransmitter activity. 1...|$|R
