5|$|He is {{predominantly}} a left <b>footed</b> player. During a match he will often drift {{to the left}} wing, with his teammate, {{in the case of}} Bayern Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another factor in his playing style is his relationship with the right-fullback. At Bayern, this partnership with Philipp Lahm has had benefits for the team's efficiency and chemistry. Robben's defensive work improved when he went to Bayern where he often tracks back and covers for his partner when he pushes forward and becomes a temporary right back.|$|E
5|$|Next, Iniesta sent a {{pass through}} the inside-left channel to Larsson whose one touch, right foot lay-off quickly {{released}} Eto to equalise for Barcelona. Four minutes later Belletti passed through the inside-right channel to Larsson. After controlling the ball, Larsson made a left <b>footed</b> return pass to Belletti. Belletti ran onto control the ball with his left foot. He then used his right to shoot through Almunia's legs to score at the near post. This was Larsson's second assist for Barcelona since he joined the game.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was <b>footed</b> by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Electricity Supply Board (ESB) {{personnel}} were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and supply shortages to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to the Government for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. Uncertainty over whether some of the cost could be <b>footed</b> by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement over how much aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground power cables, especially in Galway.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten <b>footed</b> some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right <b>footed,</b> as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E

Giovinco fell out of form again and struggled to gain playing time, {{but he managed to}} break his goal drought on 14 April 2014, with a goal against Udinese, taking the ball past a defender and scoring with a left <b>footed</b> curling shot from outside the box. Overall, Giovinco managed 2 goals in 17 Serie A appearances that season, and one goal in the Coppa Italia, as Juventus won their third consecutive Serie A title. During the 2014–15 season under Massimiliano Allegri, Giovinco scored two goals in a 6–1 win over Hellas Verona in the Coppa Italia, on 15 January 2015, helping Juventus to the quarter-finals of the competition; both of his goals came in the first half, with the first coming from a free kick, and the second in injury time.|$|E
5|$|Stockport {{spent one}} season {{at this level}} before the club was demoted. Stockport played in the first League Cup {{competition}} in 1960–61, beating Carlisle United in the first round, but the club was eliminated {{in the second round}} after a 3–0 defeat against Manchester City. In the 1964–65 FA Cup run Stockport were drawn against reigning Football League champions Liverpool FC at Anfield. Stockport <b>footed</b> the 4th Division table. Stockport pulled off a shock 1–1 draw at Anfield after deservedly taking the lead with enough chances to have won. Unfortunately the replay was a 0–2 home defeat after another excellent performance against top class opposition. Despite Stockport's ability to match the 1964–65 European Cup semi-finalist they finished bottom of the 4th division and survived re-election in the 1964–65 season. After finishing bottom of the league with 27 points, the club was re-elected by gaining 45 votes. During the 1964–65 season, then Stockport Chairman Vic Bernard re-introduced the royal blue strip, colours they still play in. Two seasons later Stockport returned to Third Division by winning the Fourth Division in 1966–67 after gaining 64 points.|$|E
5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right <b>footed.</b> He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance.

5|$|The Eastern small <b>footed</b> bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
