It shows high {{affinity for the}} Î±1-adrenergic receptor and 5-HT1A receptor, among other sites. The drug was initially anticipated to produce ortho-methoxyphenylpiperazine (oMPP), a serotonin receptor agonist with high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor, as a significant active metabolite, but subsequent research found this {{not to be the}} case.|$|E
