5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated AÎ´ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (<b>hyperalgesia).</b> The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E
25|$|In some conditions, {{excitation}} of pain fibers becomes greater as {{the pain}} stimulus continues, {{leading to a}} condition called <b>hyperalgesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|A fever {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by sickness behavior, {{which consists of}} lethargy, depression, anorexia, sleepiness, <b>hyperalgesia,</b> and the inability to concentrate.|$|E
25|$|Long-term opioid use {{can cause}} opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia,</b> {{which is a}} {{condition}} in which the patient has increased sensitivity to pain.|$|E

25|$|Glial cells, {{including}} SGCs, {{have long}} been recognized for their roles in response to neuronal damage and injury. SCGs have specifically been implicated in a new role involving the creation and persistence of chronic pain, which may involve <b>hyperalgesia</b> {{and other forms of}} spontaneous pain.|$|E
25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other investigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory <b>hyperalgesia</b> led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the primary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of the primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory <b>hyperalgesia.</b> He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic <b>hyperalgesia.</b> In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E
25|$|After {{nerve damage}} or {{repeated}} stimulation, WDR (wide dynamic range) neurons experience a general increase in excitability. This hyper-excitability {{can be caused}} by an increased neuronal response to a noxious stimulus (<b>hyperalgesia),</b> a larger neuronal receptive field, or spread of the hyper-excitability to other segments. This condition is maintained by C fibers.|$|E
25|$|All observations, both {{movement}} and physiological, tend to decrease when pain is persistent, thus rendering the scale unreliable in acute or prolonged cases. In addition, <b>hyperalgesia</b> and allodynia, occur {{more quickly and}} more extensively in babies than in adults. Day to day changes in the response to a specific injury may therefore become unpredictable and variable.|$|E
25|$|Nociceptor neuron {{sensitivity}} is modulated {{by a large}} {{variety of}} mediators in the extracellular space. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This {{is commonly known as}} <b>hyperalgesia.</b> Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally <b>hyperalgesia</b> ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.|$|E
25|$|Cyclooxygenases {{have two}} main isoforms that are called COX-1 and COX-2 (as {{well as a}} COX-3). COX-1 is {{responsible}} for the synthesis of prostaglandin and thromboxane in many types of cells, including the gastro-intestinal tract and blood platelets. COX-2 {{plays a major role in}} prostaglandin biosynthesis in inflammatory cells and in the central nervous system. Prostaglandin synthesis in these sites is a key factor in the development of inflammation and <b>hyperalgesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Side effects such as <b>hyperalgesia</b> and allodynia, {{sometimes}} {{accompanied by}} a worsening of neuropathic pain, may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely {{be a result of}} actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the nociceptin receptor, sigma receptor and Toll-like receptor 4, and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as J-113,397, BD-1047 or (+)-naloxone respectively. No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs. However, since individual sensitivity to the development of this side effect is highly dose dependent and may vary depending which opioid analgesic is used, many patients can avoid this side effect simply through dose reduction of the opioid drug (usually accompanied by the addition of a supplemental non-opioid analgesic), rotating between different opioid drugs, or by switching to a milder opioid with a mixed mode of action that also counteracts neuropathic pain, particularly tramadol or tapentadol.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{antihistamine}} effects {{it can be}} {{used for}} the treatment of severe cases of itching, <b>hyperalgesia</b> and motion sickness-induced nausea; it has also been used in some cases to relieve the effects of opioid withdrawal. Even though it is an effective sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic, it shares virtually none of the abuse, dependence, addiction, and toxicity potential of other drugs used for the same range of therapeutic reasons. Hydroxyzine has also been used to potentiate the analgesia of opioids and to alleviate some of their side effects, such as itching, nausea, and vomiting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presence}} of continuing pain, allodynia, or <b>hyperalgesia</b> after a nerve injury, not necessarily {{limited to the}} distribution of the injured nerve ...|$|E
2500|$|Opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> [...] where {{individuals}} using opioids {{to relieve}} pain paradoxically experience more pain {{as a result}} of that medication [...] has been observed in some people. This phenomenon, although uncommon, is seen in some people receiving palliative care, most often when dose is increased rapidly. If encountered, rotation between several different opioid pain medications may decrease the development of increased pain. Opioid induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> more commonly occurs with chronic use or brief high doses but some research suggests that it may also occur with very low doses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adaptive}} value of nociception is obvious; an organism detecting a noxious stimulus immediately withdraws the limb, appendage or entire {{body from the}} noxious stimulus and thereby avoids further (potential) injury. [...] However, a characteristic of pain (in mammals at least) is that pain can result in <b>hyperalgesia</b> (a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (a heightened sensitivity to non-noxious stimuli). [...] When this heightened sensitisation occurs, the {{adaptive value}} is less clear. [...] First, the pain arising from the heightened sensitisation can be disproportionate to the actual tissue damage caused. [...] Second, the heightened sensitisation may also become chronic, persisting well beyond the tissues healing. [...] This can mean that rather than the actual tissue damage causing pain, it is the pain due to the heightened sensitisation that becomes the concern. [...] This means the sensitisation process is sometimes termed maladaptive. [...] It is often suggested <b>hyperalgesia</b> and allodynia assist organisms to protect themselves during healing, but experimental evidence to support this has been lacking.|$|E
2500|$|HXA3 and HXB3 appear {{responsible}} for <b>hyperalgesia</b> and tactile allodynia (pain {{caused by a}} normally non-painful stimulus) response of mice to skin inflammation. In this model, the hepoxilins are released in spinal cord and directly activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors to augment the perception of pain. [...] TRPV1 (the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TrpV1), also termed the capsaicin receptor or vanilloid receptor) and TRPA1 (Transient receptor potential cation channel, member A1) are plasma membrane ion channels on cells; these channels {{are known to be}} involved in the perception of pain caused by exogenous and endogenous physical and chemical stimuli in a wide range of animal species including humans.|$|E
2500|$|C fibers cause central {{sensitization}} of the {{dorsal horn}} in {{the spinal cord}} in response to their hyperactivity. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon involves the release of glutamate by these pathologically sensitized C fibers. The glutamate interacts with the postsynaptic NMDA receptors, which aids the sensitization of the dorsal horn. Presynaptic neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels are {{largely responsible for the}} release of this glutamate as well as the neuropeptide, substance P. The expression of presynaptic neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels increases after a nerve lesion or repeated stimulation. NMDA receptor activation (by glutamate) enhances postsynaptic Nitric Oxide Synthase. Nitric Oxide is thought to migrate back to the presynaptic membrane to enhance the expression of the voltage-gated N-calcium channels resulting in a pain wind-up phenomenon. [...] This abnormal central sensitization cycle results in increased pain (<b>hyperalgesia)</b> and pain responses from previously non-noxious stimuli evoke a pain response (allodynia).|$|E
2500|$|Astrocytes detect {{neuronal}} {{activity and}} can release chemical transmitters, {{which in turn}} control synaptic activity. In the past, <b>hyperalgesia</b> {{was thought to be}} modulated by the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as glutamate, from the presynaptic afferent nerve terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of AMPA (Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction. [...] A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, and vasopressin are all synthesized and released in response to noxious stimuli. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.|$|E
2500|$|Complex {{regional}} pain {{syndrome is}} a multifactorial disorder with clinical features of neurogenic inflammation (swelling {{in the central}} nervous system), nociceptive sensitisation (which causes extreme sensitivity or allodynia), vasomotor dysfunction (blood flow problems which cause swelling and discolouration) and maladaptive neuroplasticity (where the brain changes and adapts with constant pain signals); CRPS {{is the result of}} an [...] "aberrant [...] response to tissue injury". The [...] "underlying neuronal matrix" [...] of CRPS is seen to involve cognitive and motor as well as nociceptive processing; pinprick stimulation of a CRPS affected limb was painful (mechanical <b>hyperalgesia)</b> and showed a [...] "significantly increased activation" [...] of not just the S1 cortex (contralateral), S2 (bilateral) areas, and insula (bilateral) but also the associative-somatosensory cortices (contralateral), frontal cortices, and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast to previous thoughts reflected in the name RSD, it appears that there is reduced Sympathetic Nervous System outflow, at least in the affected region (although there may be sympatho-afferent coupling). Wind-up (the increased sensation of pain with time) and central nervous system (CNS) sensitization are key neurologic processes that appear {{to be involved in the}} induction and maintenance of CRPS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperalgesia</b> is extreme {{sensitivity}} to pain. <b>Hyperalgesia</b> to mechanical stimuli extends {{to a large}} area around the initial location of the stimulus, while <b>hyperalgesia</b> to thermal stimuli remains in the same location as the initial stimulus. <b>Hyperalgesia</b> which remains in the initial area is known as primary <b>hyperalgesia,</b> and <b>hyperalgesia</b> which extends to a large area is secondary <b>hyperalgesia.</b> Primary <b>hyperalgesia</b> probably relies on a central mechanism. It is argued that MIAs, or C-MiHi primary afferents, are crucial to the initiation of primary <b>hyperalgesia</b> {{because they have a}} significant response to capsaicin, which is a chemical commonly used to induce <b>hyperalgesia.</b> Secondary <b>hyperalgesia</b> is believed to be caused by a magnified spinal response to nociceptor stimulation. It is argued that heat sensitive AÎ´ nociceptors are responsible for secondary <b>hyperalgesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperalgesia</b> and allodynia are {{examples}} of neuropathic pain. It is thought that the activation of specialized neuronal nociceptors are responsible for <b>hyperalgesia.</b> Studies suggest that <b>hyperalgesia</b> and allodynia are set off and sustained by certain groups of mechanosensitive sensory neurons. There is a general consensus among the scientific community that neuropeptides and NMDA receptors are crucial to the initiation of sensitization states such as <b>hyperalgesia</b> and allodynia.|$|E
50|$|Noxious {{input to}} {{the spinal cord}} is known to produce central sensitization, which {{consists}} of allodynia, exaggeration of pain, and punctuate <b>hyperalgesia,</b> extreme sensitivity to pain. Two types of mechanical <b>hyperalgesia</b> can occur: 1) touch that is normally painless in the uninjured surroundings of a cut or tear can trigger painful sensations (touch-evoked <b>hyperalgesia),</b> and 2) a slightly painful pin prick stimulation is perceived as more painful around a focused area of inflammation (punctuate <b>hyperalgesia).</b> Touch-evoked <b>hyperalgesia</b> requires continuous firing of primary afferent nociceptors, and punctuate <b>hyperalgesia</b> does not require continuous firing which means it can persist for hours after a trauma and can be stronger than normally experienced. In addition, {{it was found that}} patients with neuropathic pain, histamine ionophoresis resulted in a sensation of burning pain rather than itch, which would be induced in normal healthy patients. This shows that there is spinal hypersensitivity to C-fiber input in chronic pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperalgesia</b> can be {{experienced}} in focal, discrete areas, or {{as a more}} diffuse, body-wide form. Conditioning studies have established {{that it is possible}} to experience a learned <b>hyperalgesia</b> of the latter, diffuse form.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral <b>hyperalgesia</b> in {{inflammatory}} pain {{states is}} closely correlated with phosphorylation of spinal NMDA receptors. To {{find out more}} about the role of NMDA receptors in RVM pain facilitation, intrathecal MK-801 was administered before a RVM SP injection. Pretreatment with MK-801 significantly reduced SP induced <b>hyperalgesia.</b> Intrathecal MK-801 also blocked <b>hyperalgesia</b> resulting from continuous SP infusions. SP also increased the phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors.|$|E
50|$|Verbal {{suggestion}} {{can cause}} <b>hyperalgesia</b> (increased sensitivity to pain) and allodynia (perception of a tactile stimulus as painful) {{as a result}} of the nocebo effect. Nocebo <b>hyperalgesia</b> is believed to involve the activation of cholecystokinin receptors.|$|E
50|$|The International Association of the Study of Painâs (IASP) {{definition}} of hyperpathia is that: A painful syndrome {{characterized by an}} abnormally painful reaction to a stimulus, especially a repetitive stimulus, {{as well as an}} increased threshold. The definition also complies with a note which is: It may occur with allodynia, hyperesthesia, <b>hyperalgesia,</b> or dysesthesia. Faulty identification and localization of the stimulus, delay, radiating sensation, and after-sensation may be present, and the pain is often explosive in character. The changes in this note are the specification of allodynia and the inclusion of <b>hyperalgesia</b> explicitly. Previously <b>hyperalgesia</b> was implied, since hyperesthesia was mentioned in the previous note and <b>hyperalgesia</b> is a special case of hyperesthesia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperalgesia</b> {{is similar}} to other sorts of pain {{associated}} with nerve irritation or damage such as allodynia and neuropathic pain, and consequently may respond to standard treatment for these conditions, using various drugs such as SSRI or tricyclic antidepressants, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, gabapentin or pregabalin, NMDA antagonists, or atypical opioids such as tramadol. Where <b>hyperalgesia</b> has been produced by chronic high doses of opioids, reducing the dose may result in improved pain management. However, as with other forms of nerve dysfunction associated pain, treatment of <b>hyperalgesia</b> can be clinically challenging, and finding a suitable drug or drug combination that is effective for a particular patient may require trial and error. The use of a {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} device has been shown to alleviate <b>hyperalgesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{tolerance}} and opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> both {{result in a}} similar need for dose escalation, they are nevertheless caused by two distinct mechanisms. The similar net effect makes the two phenomena difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Under chronic opioid treatment, a particular individual's requirement for dose escalation {{may be due to}} tolerance (desensitization of antinociceptive mechanisms), opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> (sensitization of pronociceptive mechanisms), or a combination of both. Identifying the development of <b>hyperalgesia</b> is of great clinical importance since patients receiving opioids to relieve pain may paradoxically experience more pain as a result of treatment. Whereas increasing the dose of opioid can be an effective way to overcome tolerance, doing so to compensate for opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> may worsen the patient's condition by increasing sensitivity to pain while escalating physical dependence.|$|E
50|$|One unusual {{cause of}} focal <b>hyperalgesia</b> is platypus venom.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary <b>hyperalgesia</b> {{describes}} pain sensitivity {{that occurs}} in surrounding undamaged tissues.|$|E
50|$|Opioid-induced <b>hyperalgesia</b> {{may develop}} {{as a result}} of {{long-term}} opioid use in the treatment of chronic pain. Various studies of humans and animals have demonstrated that primary or secondary <b>hyperalgesia</b> can develop in response to both chronic and acute exposure to opioids. This side effect can be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of opioid treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Primary <b>hyperalgesia</b> {{describes}} pain sensitivity {{that occurs}} {{directly in the}} damaged tissues.|$|E
50|$|The RVM {{contains}} {{high levels}} of both the neurokinin 1 receptor and its endogenous ligand, Substance P (SP). Microinjections of SP into the RVM resulted in transient antinociception to noxious heat stimuli but not mechanical stimuli. Pretreatment with a neurokinin 1 (NK1) antagonist prevented the antinociception induced by SP injection, but the NK1 antagonist had no effects on pain threshold by itself. To test the effects of an NK1 antagonist during injury states, an NK1 antagonist was microinjected into the RVM after application of Freund's Complete Adjuvant (CFA), a chemical used for inflammation models. Administration of the NK1 antagonist reversed the heat <b>hyperalgesia</b> caused by CFA. In contrast, the administration of an NK1 antagonist further increased the tactile <b>hyperalgesia</b> induced by CFA. However, the NK1 antagonist did prevent some tactile <b>hyperalgesia</b> induced by a different compound, capsaicin. In yet another induced injury model using mustard oil (a TRPA1 agonist), NK1 antagonists did not affect thermal or tactile <b>hyperalgesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{lidocaine}} microinjections {{into the}} RVM temporarily reversed allodynia and <b>hyperalgesia</b> caused by nerve injury.|$|E
