5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this <b>heat-stable</b> factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E
25|$|Most {{soy protein}} is a {{relatively}} <b>heat-stable</b> storage protein. This heat stability enables soy food products requiring high temperature cooking, such as tofu, soy milk and textured vegetable protein (soy flour) to be made.|$|E
25|$|When {{eaten in}} large {{quantities}} or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN). MPN is <b>heat-stable</b> and not destroyed by cooking. Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with pyridoxine (vitamin B6).|$|E
25|$|The class II bacteriocins {{are small}} (<10 kDa) <b>heat-stable</b> proteins. This class is {{subdivided}} into five subclasses. The class IIa bacteriocins (pediocin-like bacteriocins) {{are the largest}} subgroup and contain an N-terminal consensus sequence -Tyr-Gly-Asn-Gly-Val-Xaa-Cys across this group. The C-terminal is responsible for species-specific activity, causing cell-leakage by permeabilizing the target cell wall.|$|E
25|$|Almost all PCR {{applications}} {{employ a}} <b>heat-stable</b> DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally {{isolated from the}} thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. This DNA polymerase enzymatically assembles a new DNA strand from free nucleotides, {{the building blocks of}} DNA, by using single-stranded DNA as a template and DNA oligonucleotides (the primers mentioned above) to initiate DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{thiamine}} antagonists are <b>heat-stable</b> and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and tannic acid. These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{setting for a}} hot air oven is {{at least two hours}} at 160°C. A rapid method heats air to 190°C for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects. Dry heat has the advantage that it can be used on powders and other <b>heat-stable</b> items that are adversely affected by steam (e.g. it does not cause rusting of steel objects).|$|E
25|$|The first organic {{cofactor}} to {{be discovered}} was NAD+, which was identified by Arthur Harden and William Youndin 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this <b>heat-stable</b> factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. Other cofactors were identified throughout the early 20th century, with ATP being isolated in 1929 by Karl Lohmann, and coenzyme A being discovered in 1945 by Fritz Albert Lipmann.|$|E
25|$|Patulin is a {{white powder}} soluble in low-pH water and organic solvents. It is a polyketide lactone that is <b>heat-stable,</b> {{so it is not}} {{destroyed}} by pasteurization or thermal denaturation. However, stability following fermentation is lessened. Isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (IDH) is an important enzyme in the multi-step biosynthesis of patulin, and its gene is present in other fungi that may potentially produce the toxin. It is reactive with sulfur dioxide, so antioxidant and antimicrobial agents may be useful to destroy it. Levels of nitrogen, manganese, and pH as well as abundance of necessary enzymes regulate the biosynthetic pathway of patulin.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B was {{originally}} {{considered to have}} two components, a heat-labile vitamin B1 and a <b>heat-stable</b> vitamin B2. In the 1920s, vitamin B2 {{was thought to be}} the factor necessary for preventing pellagra. In 1923, Paul Gyorgy in Heidelberg was investigating egg-white injury in rats; the curative factor for this condition was called vitamin H (which is now called biotin or vitamin B7). Since both pellagra and vitamin H deficiency were associated with dermatitis, Gyorgy decided to test the effect of vitamin B2 on vitamin H deficiency in rats. He enlisted the service of Wagner-Jauregg in Kuhn’s laboratory. In 1933, Kuhn, Gyorgy, and Wagner found that thiamin-free extracts of yeast, liver, or rice bran prevented the growth failure of rats fed a thiamin-supplemented diet.|$|E
25|$|Cochineal {{is one of}} the few {{water-soluble}} colourants {{to resist}} degradation with time. It {{is one of the}} most light- and <b>heat-stable</b> and oxidation-resistant of all the natural organic colourants and is even more stable than many synthetic food colours. The water-soluble form is used in alcoholic drinks with calcium carmine; the insoluble form is used in a wide variety of products. Together with ammonium carmine, they can be found in meat, sausages, processed poultry products (meat products cannot be coloured in the United States unless they are labeled as such), surimi, marinades, alcoholic drinks, bakery products and toppings, cookies, desserts, icings, pie fillings, jams, preserves, gelatin desserts, juice beverages, varieties of cheddar cheese and other dairy products, sauces, and sweets.|$|E
25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} <b>heat-stable</b> noncaloric sweetener, {{allowing}} it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E

Among these, the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is Thermus aquaticus. The fact that such bacteria exist also stretches our imagination about life on other celestial bodies, both within and beyond the solar system.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} study (2007), using the <b>heat-stable</b> [...] from Thermotoga maritima they screened 5 mutants (Y13C, W14C, Y189C, S131C and M239C) with 4 dyes ( [...] , , Cy5 and Cy3) identifying Y13C-Cy5 conjugate, which gave a maximal increase of 50% and affinity at 15mM.|$|E
2500|$|... α-Keto acid primers {{are used}} to produce {{branched-chain}} fatty acids that, in general, are between 12 and 17 carbons in length. The proportions of these branched-chain fatty acids tend to be uniform and consistent among a particular bacterial species but may be altered due to changes in malonyl-CoA concentration, temperature, or <b>heat-stable</b> factors (HSF) present. All of these factors may affect chain length, and HSFs have been demonstrated to alter the specificity of BCKA decarboxylase for a particular α-keto acid substrate, thus shifting the ratio of branched-chain fatty acids produced. An increase in malonyl-CoA concentration {{has been shown to}} result in a larger proportion of C17 fatty acids produced, up until the optimal concentration (≈20μM) of malonyl-CoA is reached. [...] Decreased temperatures also tend to shift the fatty-acid distribution slightly toward C17 fatty-acids in Bacillus species.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s [...] and early 1950s, Leslie Collier, an English {{microbiologist}} {{working at the}} Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, developed a method for producing a <b>heat-stable</b> freeze-dried vaccine in powdered form. Collier added 0.5% phenol to the vaccine {{to reduce the number}} of bacterial contaminants but the key stage was to add 5% peptone to the liquid vaccine before it was dispensed into ampoules. This protected the virus during the freeze drying process. After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1–2 [...] days at ambient temperatures. However, the dried vaccine was 100% effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at [...] allowing it to be transported to, and stored in, remote tropical areas. Collier's method was increasingly used and, with minor modifications, became the standard for vaccine production adopted by the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit when it initiated its global Smallpox Eradication Campaign in 1967, at which time 23 of 59 manufacturers were using the Lister strain.|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, George Nuttall {{found that}} sheep blood serum had mild killing {{activity}} against the bacterium that causes anthrax. The killing activity disappeared when he heated the blood. [...] In 1891, Hans Ernst August Buchner, noting the same property {{of blood in}} his experiments, named the killing property [...] "alexin," [...] which means [...] "to ward off" [...] in Greek. [...] By 1884, several laboratories had demonstrated that serum from guinea pigs that had recovered from cholera killed the cholera bacterium in vitro. [...] Heating the serum destroyed its killing activity. [...] Nevertheless, the heat-inactivated serum, when injected into guinea pigs exposed to the cholera bacteria, maintained its ability to protect the animals from illness. [...] Jules Bordet, a young Belgian scientist in Paris at the Pasteur Institute, concluded that this principle has two components, one that maintained a [...] "sensitizing" [...] effect after being heated and one (alexin) whose toxic effect was lost after being heated. The <b>heat-stable</b> component was responsible for immunity against specific microorganisms, whereas the heat-sensitive component {{was responsible for the}} non-specific antimicrobial activity conferred by all normal sera. In 1899, Paul Ehrlich renamed the heat-sensitive component [...] "complement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{strains of}} E. coli, such as , , O121, O26, , O111, O145, and , produce {{potentially}} lethal toxins. Food poisoning caused by E. coli {{can result from}} eating unwashed vegetables or poorly butchered and undercooked meat. O157:H7 is also notorious for causing serious and even life-threatening complications such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. This particular strain {{is linked to the}} 2006 United States E. coli outbreak due to fresh spinach. The [...] strain is equally virulent. Antibiotic and supportive treatment protocols for it are not as well-developed (it has the ability to be very enterohemorrhagic like O157:H7, causing bloody diarrhea, but also is more enteroaggregative, meaning it adheres well and clumps to intestinal membranes). It is the strain behind the deadly June 2011 E. coli outbreak in Europe. Severity of the illness varies considerably; it can be fatal, particularly to young children, the elderly or the immunocompromised, but is more often mild. Earlier, poor hygienic methods of preparing meat in Scotland killed seven people in 1996 due to E. coli poisoning, and left hundreds more infected. E. coli can harbour both <b>heat-stable</b> and heat-labile enterotoxins. The latter, termed LT, contain one A subunit and five B subunits arranged into one holotoxin, and are highly similar in structure and function to cholera toxins. The B subunits assist in adherence and entry of the toxin into host intestinal cells, while the A subunit is cleaved and prevents cells from absorbing water, causing diarrhea. LT is secreted by the Type 2 secretion pathway.|$|E
