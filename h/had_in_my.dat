In a letter home describing the battle, Baker said it was the [...] "biggest thrill I ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life", and compared it to the feeling after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E

Brown was yellow carded by the referee, but afterwards said [...] "It was the best booking I've <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] In a physical encounter against Ross County in 2013, he was booked for goading and laughing at Mihael Kovačević after the Ross County defender rushed up to him and shouted in his face.

500|$|A {{week after}} the long range shoot at Vieques, Iowas new {{executive}} officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, {{over the objections of}} his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the starboard side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the breechlock was closed. Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers {{at the base of the}} main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was [...] "the most frightening experience I have ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, no lights for a time. Men were screaming. There was panic." ...|$|E

He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon was a {{long time}} fan of boxing, {{attending}} fights with his grandfather, but his interest increased particularly after seeing the 1990 heavyweight championship fight between Evander Holyfield and James [...] "Buster" [...] Douglas which he described as [...] "the most electrifying feeling I'd <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] He began training and won six out of nine amateur fights; he was also a reserve contestant on the Fox series Celebrity Boxing. Simon was for eight years the manager of heavyweight boxer Lamon Brewster, the now-retired former World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion. He met Brewster in 1997 and began managing him, helping him rise {{to the top of the}} WBO rankings. He considers guiding Brewster to his April2004 victory over Wladimir Klitschko to win the vacant WBO Heavyweight Championship, with Klitschko the heavy favorite, to be amongst the greatest moments of his life; it [...] "eclipsed everything he had achieved in a glittering 26-year showbiz career." [...] Before the Klitschko fight, Simon calculated he had spent several hundred thousand dollars funding Brewster, paying him a large salary on top of match fees as well as letting him stay rent-free at one of his houses, and taking only a 10% cut of the match fees; however, he never intended boxing to be a substantial [...] "source of revenue". Simon retired from boxing management soon after Brewster became WBO Heavyweight Champion.|$|E

In 2003, he appeared as Bernard in {{a run of}} David Mamet's play Sexual Perversity in Chicago, along with Matthew Perry and Minnie Driver, in London's West End. Azaria made his first appearance as Sir Lancelot, the French Taunter, and four other characters in Spamalot, the musical version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which opened in Chicago in December 2004, {{before moving to the}} Shubert Theatre on Broadway. The show met with critical acclaim, receiving fourteen Tony Award nominations in 2005, with Azaria being nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Reuniting with The Birdcage director Mike Nichols, and being a huge Monty Python fan, he saw it as an opportunity he could not pass up, describing it as [...] "so much fun that I haven't realized how tiring it is", and [...] "the most fun that I've ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life". He took a break from the show in June 2005, with Alan Tudyk filling in for him, to work on Huff, but returned in December 2005. In late 2007 he starred in Aaron Sorkin's The Farnsworth Invention, playing RCA head David Sarnoff. In 2016, he starred in the world premiere of Dry Powder opposite Claire Danes, John Krasinski, and Sanjit De Silva, directed by Thomas Kail, at the off-Broadway Public Theater in New York City.|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} in five Glee episodes {{over the course}} of the first season, O'Malley was upgraded to a series regular along with Heather Morris and Naya Rivera in the show's second season. Murphy confirmed this fact on July 13, 2010, in the wake of O'Malley's nomination for an Emmy Award for his work in the role of Burt. He appeared in eight season two episodes, and is guaranteed at least six episodes during the third season. In early 2011, O'Malley was cast in the lead role in a comedy pilot entitled Family Album, which prompted media speculation that his role as Burt might need to be reduced. In actuality, the actor ensured that he would be able to meet his six-episode commitment to Glee should the pilot be picked up for a full series run, and commented: [...] " [...] is one of the best parts I've ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I don’t want to leave it behind until it's run its course or the story has run its course." [...] On August 11, 2011, Fox announced that Family Album would not be made into a series. Although there was no announcement about a change in O'Malley's status on Glee, the press release for the first episode of the show's third season omitted O'Malley's name from the regular cast, and the one for the second episode has him listed as part of the guest cast.|$|E
500|$|Businessweek {{attributed}} the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success {{is in part}} due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career.

He also stated, [...] "A No. 1 album is something I never <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wildest dreams ever thought would be a reality." [...] The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album's release, and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Trending 140 chart during that week. In contrast, Yankovic's video for [...] "Perform This Way", the lead single off Alpocalypse, only received 16.8 million views in the three years since its release, while an individual video from Mandatory Fun, like [...] "Tacky", received 12.8 million views within the first week.

500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision...
