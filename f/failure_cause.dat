Therefore, it is supposed that if a <b>failure</b> <b>caused</b> by random environmental factors occurs before M, the equipment will return to operation after repair and the original PM will be carried out as usual. Only the occurrence of <b>failure</b> <b>caused</b> by deterioration during the period [0, M] can cause the cancellation of PM and the immediate implementation of CM.|$|R

50|$|It is {{necessary}} {{to look at the}} cause of a failure mode and the likelihood of occurrence. This can be done by analysis, calculations / FEM, looking at similar items or processes and the failure modes that have been documented for them in the past. A <b>failure</b> <b>cause</b> is looked upon as a design weakness. All the potential causes for a failure mode should be identified and documented. This should be in technical terms. Examples of causes are: Human errors in handling, Manufacturing induced faults, Fatigue, Creep, Abrasive wear, erroneous algorithms, excessive voltage or improper operating conditions or use (depending on the used ground rules).A failure mode is given a Probability Ranking.|$|E

50|$|The VMSC will {{request the}} {{information}} needed {{for it to}} deliver the Short Message to its recipient by sending a Send_Info_for_MT_SMS message to the VLR. The VLR will then instigate a page request, or subscriber search, for the destination subscribers Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number (MSISDN), and return the result to the VMSC. Since a typical deployment sees the VLR being co-located with the MSC, this message flow is usually internal to the platform. Should the page or search for the subscriber fail, the VLR will indicate the <b>failure</b> <b>cause</b> to the VMSC, which will abort the Short Message delivery procedure and return the failure to the SMSC (see the Failed Short Message delivery section below). If the page of the handset was successful, the VMSC will then send to the SMSC indicating successful delivery. The GMSC component of the SMSC passes {{the result of the}} delivery attempt to the Service Centre. In the case of successful delivery, the delivered text message will be removed from the Store and Forward Engine (SFE) and, if requested, a delivery report sent to the text originator. If the delivery failed, the SMSC invokes a retry procedure to periodically make further attempts at delivery; additionally, it may register with the HLR to receive a notification when the B-Party becomes available for Short Message delivery in the future (see the Failed Short Message delivery section below).|$|E
