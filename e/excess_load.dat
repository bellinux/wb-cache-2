2500|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Izvestia, the increased vibration of turbine2 was going on for some 10years and was well-known to the plant personnel. [...] According to {{the former director of}} Irkutskenergo, Viktor Bobrovski, the accident could have been caused by an incorrect start-up process of the turbine which resulted in a hydraulic pressure surge, or <b>excess</b> <b>load</b> of the turbine caused by peak consumption of electricity. According to Bobrovski, it is common practice in the region to compensate for a peak load by overloading hydroelectric power plants, and the energy system of the region is near collapse, as the main goal of its owners is to take out as much profit as possible, typically by cutting down on maintenance, investment, safety, and educational costs. [...] Since the load for other turbines ceased {{after the collapse of the}} turbine2, they probably started to spin without load at increasing speed until they failed. He said that the former director of Sayano–Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station, Valentin Bryzgalov, had alerted that it is dangerous to operate the plant at its maximum loads when the turbines are starting to vibrate in the axial direction. He said that the accident probably would not have had such catastrophic results if the safety systems had worked and the safety rules had been followed.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, {{the side}} of the {{building}} that failed was designed to be a two story structure, while the other side was designed to be three stories. Late in the construction process, it was decided that both sides of the building should be equal heights, and a third story was added to the shorter side. However, the live load due to occupancy is typically much greater than the design load for a roof. As a result, the structure supporting the new third story was subjected to much greater loading than was originally anticipated.

Gait was classified as symmetric (TGS) or asymmetric and external knee adduction (KAM) and flexion moments (KFM) were calculated. Participants were compared to healthy older adults (n= 109) on KAM and KFM. The proportion of individuals with increased loading was compared between the TGS and TGA groups. Results: Six and four participants exhibited increased loading of the non-paretic and paretic leg respectively. TGA and TGS groups did not differ in the proportion of individuals with increased loading. Conclusion: People post-stroke exhibited increased loading of the paretic and/or non-paretic leg but it was unrelated to TGA. Future work should investigate secondary MSK issues post-stroke in a longitudinal study...|$|R

40|$|<b>Excess</b> {{nutrient}} <b>loads</b> {{carried by}} {{streams and rivers}} are a great concern for environmental resource managers. In agricultural regions, <b>excess</b> <b>loads</b> are transported downstream to receiving water bodies, potentially causing algal blooms, {{which could lead to}} numerous ecological problems. To better understand nutrient load transport, and to develop appropriate water management plans, {{it is important to have}} accurate estimates of annual nutrient loads. This study used a Monte Carlo sub-sampling method and error-corrected statistical models to estimate annual nitrate-N loads from two watersheds in central Illinois. The performance of three load estimation methods (the seven-parameter log-linear model, the ratio estimator, and the flow-weighted averaging estimator) applied at one-, two-, four-, six-, and eight-week sampling frequencies were compared. Five error correction techniques; the existing composite method, and four new error correction techniques developed in this study; were applied to each combination of sampling frequency and load estimation method. On average, the most accurate error reduction technique, (proportional rectangular) resulted in 15 % and 30 % more accurate load estimates when compared to the most accurate uncorrected load estimation method (ratio estimator) for the two watersheds. Using error correction methods, it is possible to design more cost-effective monitoring plans by achieving the same load estimation accuracy with fewer observations. Finally, the optimum combinations of monitoring threshold and sampling frequency that minimizes the number of samples required to achieve specified levels of accuracy in load estimation were determined. For one- to three-weeks sampling frequencies, combined threshold/fixed-interval monitoring approaches produced the best outcomes, while fixed-interval-only approaches produced the most accurate results for four- to eight-weeks sampling frequencies...|$|R

30|$|We {{present a}} {{workflow}} linking coupled fluid-flow and geomechanical simulation with seismic modelling to predict seismic anisotropy induced by non-hydrostatic stress changes. We generate seismic models from coupled simulations {{to examine the}} relationship between reservoir geometry, stress path and seismic anisotropy. The results indicate that geometry influences the evolution of stress, which leads to stress-induced seismic anisotropy. Although stress anisotropy is high for the small reservoir, the effect of stress arching and the ability of the side-burden to support the <b>excess</b> <b>load</b> limit the overall change in effective stress and hence seismic anisotropy. For the extensive reservoir, stress anisotropy and induced seismic anisotropy are high. The extensive and elongate reservoirs experience significant compaction, where the inefficiency of the developed stress arching in the side-burden cannot support the <b>excess</b> <b>load.</b> The elongate reservoir displays significant stress asymmetry, with seismic anisotropy developing predominantly along the long-edge of the reservoir. We show that the link between stress path parameters and seismic anisotropy is complex, where the anisotropic symmetry is controlled not only by model geometry but also the nonlinear rock physics model used. Nevertheless, a workflow has been developed to model seismic anisotropy induced by non-hydrostatic stress changes, allowing field observations of anisotropy to be linked with geomechanical models.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>Excess</b> <b>loading</b> {{has been}} {{often cited as}} a reason for the failure of dental {{implants}} or bone loss post-osseointegration. The available data from animal studies have failed to show a clear role for excessive loading in the loss of osseointegration. The present case documentations aimed at providing a deeper insight into the medium- to long-term influence of occlusal loading on osseointegrated implants, and describe the clinical manifestations of such pathology. Material and methods: Two cases of loss of osseointegration are documented with single implants in the posterior maxilla. Implant mobility was in both cases the first and only sign of pathology, with the absence of plaque-induced inflammation and marginal bone loss. Results: Re-osseointegration of the implants was achieved after the removal of the prosthetic reconstruction. Conclusions: The two cases reported that the loss of osseointegration in the absence of plaque-induced peri-implant inflammation is possible, although the clinical manifestations were very different to these of peri-implantitis. Once the occlusal loading was withdrawn, re-osseointegration was clinically confirmed in a period of 6 - 8 months. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

For this study, hexagonal pillar-shaped ZnO nanorods are grown on ZnO electrodes through a chemical bath deposition, onto which CoPi is deposited with different photodeposition times (10 - 30 min). A scanning electron microscopic {{study indicates that}} CoPi deposition does not induce any change of ZnO morphology and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis shows that inorganic phosphate ions (Pi) exist on ZnO surface. Bare ZnO electrodes generate the current of ca. 0. 36 mA/cm 2 at a bias potential of 0. 5 V vs. SCE, whereas ZnO/CoPi (deposited for 10 min) has ca. 50 %-enhanced current (0. 54 mW/cm 2) under irradiation of AM 1. 5 G-light (400 mW/cm 2).
