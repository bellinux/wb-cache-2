30|$|Imperfections in the IQ {{modulator}} represent {{another important}} {{issue in the}} design of a baseband PD. The predistorted baseband signal is up-converted to RF using an IQ modulator. Phase and amplitude imbalances of the modulator affect the estimation of the PD coefficients. This problem motivates the joint compensation of PA nonlinear response and the distortion introduced in the up-conversion process. The latter distortion is due to phase and amplitude imbalances of the local oscillator (LO) and mismatch in the cascade of <b>digital-analog</b> <b>converters</b> (DAC)-low-pass filters in the I and Q branches. The effects of IQ imbalance on predistortion techniques have been presented in [5 – 8]. Joint PD and IQ compensation techniques have been previously considered in several studies for the SISO case [9 – 11].|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the system}} design, the {{modulation}} signal can be created by the COM micro controller. This gives {{the chance to do}} the entire modulation signal processing inside the software. Just one transmitter is needed for all transmission types. The software defines which one is used at which moment.

A well-dimensioned anti-aliasing filter is used to create a high-quality modulation signal. Depending on the actual demands and link quality, modulation is adaptively and automatically changed by handshaking with the operating ground station. As an experimental addition, hierarchic modulation is used to allow two or more different data rates at same time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic element {{matching}} (DEM) {{is widely}} used in multibit <b>digital–analog</b> <b>converters</b> (DACs) to prevent mismatches among nominally identical components from introducing nonlinear distortion. It has long {{been used as a}} performanceenabling technique in delta-sigma data converters which require low-resolution but high-linearity DACs. More recently, segmented DEM architectures have made high-resolution Nyquist-rate DEM DACs practical. However, the previously published segmented DEM DAC designs have been ad hoc. Systematic techniques for synthesizing segmented DEM DACs and analyses of their design tradeoffs have not been published previously. This paper quantifies a fundamental power dissipation versus complexity tradeoff implied by segmentation and provides a systematic method of synthesizing segmented DEM DACs that are optimal in terms of the tradeoff.

Results are presented which show that one type of trimmable current source has a bias condition at which its output current is both trimmable and robust to temperature variations. A model of this potentially useful behavior is presented which suggests that it arises from a combination of the temperature dependence of a MOSFET and the modulation of its source voltage caused by a second MOSFET acting as a voltage controlled resistor. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

The advantage of this architecture over traditional weight based ones is simpler hardware implementation without multipliers or <b>digital-analog</b> <b>converters</b> (DACs) {{as well as being}} suited to time-based computing. The name is derived due to similarity in the learning rule with an earlier architecture called Tempotron. The DELTRON can remember more patterns than other delay-based networks by modifying a few delays to remember the most 'salient' or synchronous part of every spike pattern. We present simulations of memory capacity and classification ability of the DELTRON for different random spatio-temporal spike patterns. The memory capacity for noisy spike patterns and missing spikes are also shown.

New D/A expressions for decoded samples make it clear that greedy and lazy expansions as functions of ν, known as two classic β-expansions, have the same performance in terms of variance of its quantization errors and that ν should be set to the midpoint of its associated greedy and lazy values. Furthermore, a new A/D converter, called negative β-encoder, is introduced which improves the variance of quantization error of β-encoder. Regarding β-expansion as a two-state Markov chain suggests that a negative eigenvalue of its associated transition probability matrix except 1 reduces the variance of quantization errors.

A fourth-order quadrature bandpass continuous-time sigma-delta modulator for a dual-channel global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver is presented. With a bandwidth (BW) of 33 MHz, the modulator is able to digitalize the downconverted GNSS signals in two adjacent signal bands simultaneously, realizing dual-channel GNSS reception with one receiver channel instead of two independent receiver channels. To maintain the loop-stability of the high-order architecture, any extra loop phase shifting should be minimized. In the system architecture, a feedback and feedforward hybrid architecture is used to implement the fourth-order loop-filter, and a return-to-zero (RZ) feedback after the discrete-time differential operation is introduced into the input of the final integrator to realize the excess loop delay compensation, saving a spare summing amplifier. In the circuit implementation, power-efficient amplifiers with high-frequency active feedforward and antipole-splitting techniques are employed in the active RC integrators, and self-calibrated comparators are used to implement the low-power 3 -b quantizers. These power saving techniques help achieve superior figure of merit for the presented modulator. With a sampling rate of 460 MHz, current-steering <b>digital-analog</b> <b>converters</b> are chosen to guarantee high conversion speed. Implemented in only 180 -nm CMOS, the modulator achieves 62. 1 -dB peak signal to noise and distortion ratio, 64 -dB dynamic range, and 59. 3 -dB image rejection ratio, with a BW of 33 MHz, and consumes 54. 4 mW from a 1. 8 V power supply...|$|R
40|$|This brief {{analytically}} {{investigates the}} <b>digital-analog</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC) integrated nonlinearity (INL) {{with respect to}} the accuracy of the DAC unit elements. The main novelty of the presented approach is in the application of the Brownian Bridge (BB) process to precisely describe the INL. This method analyzes the thermometer and binary DAC architectures and is the first to prove that their statistical INL properties are different. The INL of the thermometer DAC is represented as a one-dimensional BB process. For the binary case, the INL is represented as combinations of random variables, the increments of which coincide with a BB process. For both architectures, this brief derives formulas for the INL main statistical properties, e. g., probability density function, mean, deviation, and chip yield. These properties are compared with previous analytical attempts and conclusions are drawn. The results of this brief fill a gap in the general understanding of the most quoted DAC specification- the INL. In particular, for a high-volume chip production, the derived formulas will help engineers to choose the DAC architecture and the allowed mismatch of the DAC unit element...|$|E
40|$|The {{subscriber}} loop forms the final link between the. subscriber {{and the actual}} telephone network. The pair of twisted copper wires which form the loop must be well maintained to avoid poor quality service to subscriber or customer. By conducting periodic testing of the {{subscriber loop}}, the telephone company can ensure the high standards of service that they desire. The purpose of this research project is to design a new loop tester based on a digital signal processing (DSP) chip, replacing the old analog-based testers.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an improved modeling of the ef-fect of random mismatch and current source transient switching {{behavior on the}} performance of current-steering CMOS digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The work considers two current source cell topologies, namely a simple cell and a cascoded cell, obtaining the relation of transistors design parameters to the static and dy-namic models. On the one hand, a mismatching statistical anal-ysis is applied to all the transistors of the current source circuit, which allows to define design expressions relating the circuit pa-rameters to the DAC specifications without the need of arbitrary design margins or Monte Carlo simulations. On the other hand, improved analysis of the current source switching characteristics provides a more realistic modeling of the relation between transis-tors sizes and output current settling time. By including these two improved models into the usual design procedure, circuit sizing for optimum settling time and proper static behavior can be obtained analytically, reverting in smaller current source area, and, hence, in an overall DAC area reduction.
