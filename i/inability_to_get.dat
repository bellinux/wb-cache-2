5|$|Methods to {{diagnose}} {{the likelihood of}} a patient with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 getting cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics. Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{is rooted in}} gender inequality, attempts to control women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who {{see it as a}} source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion. Health effects depend on the procedure. They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E
50|$|According to one story, Arturo Toscanini heard Bonano in New York, then {{hired him}} to come to a {{rehearsal}} of the New York Philharmonic to play a couple of numbers unaccompanied for the orchestra to listen to. After Bonano did this, Toscanini berated his trumpet section at length about their <b>inabilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tones out of their instruments like this jazz musician could.|$|R

Melissa R. and Asia continue their fight during the group rehearsal, while a bemused Mikey and Chelsea look on. They then pretend to sort out their differences and hug each other. At the performance the judges are wowed by all of the girls. But, Chelsea's <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> dance <b>gets</b> her eliminated.|$|R
50|$|Such favors and graft {{become a}} focal point in 1929's reelection campaign, when {{opponent}} Fiorello LaGuardia mocks the mayor publicly and questions the current administration's integrity.

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E
5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county {{for most of his}} career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{attribute}} the Confederacy's weaknesses {{to the poor}} leadership of Davis. His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors and generals, favoritism toward old friends, <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with people who disagreed with him, neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones, and resistance to public opinion all worked against him. Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln. After Davis was captured in 1865, {{he was accused of}} treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe. He was never tried and was released after two years. While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general, Robert E. Lee. Davis wrote a memoir entitled The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot, and he became a hero of the Lost Cause in the post-Reconstruction South.|$|E
50|$|Much humour {{comes from}} Ed's rants and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> stop himself <b>getting</b> carried {{away in his}} angry tirades, often {{triggered}} by learning that somebody younger than him is proving more successful (such {{as the author of}} Eats, Shoots and Leaves, Lynne Truss; one tirade follows Ed receiving several copies of the book as gifts for his birthday and working out how much in royalties Truss will have received because of the book sales).|$|R
5000|$|IPSA {{has been}} criticised {{publicly}} by many MPs, including David Cameron, who told IPSA to [...] "...get {{a grip on}} {{what they are doing}} and do it fast.". Criticism has been largely centred on the perceived high running costs of IPSA, <b>inability</b> of MPs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through on the IPSA helpline, emails and letters going largely unanswered, and the length of time taken to reimburse expenses.|$|R
5000|$|Lugo {{was brought}} on to bat leadoff, but {{was moved by}} manager Terry Francona to the bottom part of the order {{primarily}} due <b>to</b> his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> consistently <b>get</b> on base. From June 15 to July 3 Lugo went 0-31 from the plate. Since 1996, only one other Major League player with more than 250 at bats 80 games into the season has had a lower batting average: Greg Vaughn, [...]163 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2002.After {{the first week of}} July 2007, Lugo turned his hitting performance around, compiling a 14-game hitting streak on July 25, 2007. He was 24-for-54 (.444) during the career-best streak, raising his average from [...]189 to [...]226.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1973 season, {{the aging}} Ewbank {{announced}} that he would retire as coach after the season and as general manager after 1974. The Mets unexpectedly qualified for the World Series, consigning the Jets to another long stay away from Shea. The Jets did not play a home game until the end of October. The team finished with a record of 4–10, though their final game against the Bills attracted considerable media attention. The attention was not for Ewbank's last game, but for Bills running back O. J. Simpson's attempt to become the first NFL player to rush for 2,000yards in a season. Simpson gained 200yards, finishing with 2,003 for the season. Shortly after the 1973 season, the team hired Ewbank's son-in-law, former Cardinals coach Charley Winner, as head coach. The new coach showed an initial <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his team to emulate his last name: the team started the season by losing seven of their first eight games. Namath, who had a reasonably healthy season behind a poor offensive line, predicted the Jets would win their final six games. The first NFL regular-season overtime victory, over the Giants at the Yale Bowl, and the usual large number of home games {{towards the end of the}} season helped New York in its comeback, and a Namath prediction again came true.|$|E
25|$|Social {{conditions}} such as poverty, social isolation and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> or prepare preferred foods can cause unintentional weight loss, {{and this may be}} particularly common in older people. Nutrient intake can also be affected by culture, family and belief systems. Ill-fitting dentures and other dental or oral health problems can also affect adequacy of nutrition.|$|E
25|$|Maxey's new command {{was plagued}} by desertions and his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{supplies}} and equipment. Frustrated and discouraged, {{he was allowed to}} resign on May 22, 1865. He returned home to Paris, and formally surrendered in July to Union Major General Edward Canby (E.R.S. Canby). Although nominally a prisoner of war, he remained at home on parole.|$|E
5000|$|Beckett, in Proust, calls memory [...] "some {{miracle of}} analogy;" [...] he qualifies {{it in the}} {{preceding}} phrase as [...] "an accident". The <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> remember, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the truth, is a focal point in much of his work. Beckett’s characters (e.g. May in Footfalls, Mouth in Not I) seem doomed to repeat themselves, {{as much as the}} accidents or miracles of analogy allow them some momentary insight into their situations. For Beckett, memory is second-hand knowledge. You were not there. Another [...] "you" [...] was. Can you trust what he says he saw and heard? ...|$|R
60|$|To speak next of the premises. Our {{assurance}} of their truth, {{whether they be}} generalities or individual facts, is grounded, in Mr. Spencer’s opinion, on the inconceivableness of their being false. It is necessary to advert to a double {{meaning of the word}} inconceivable, which Mr. Spencer is aware of, and would sincerely disclaim founding an argument upon, but from which his case derives no little advantage notwithstanding. By inconceivableness is sometimes meant, <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> form or <b>get</b> rid of an idea; sometimes, <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> form or <b>get</b> rid of a belief. The former meaning is the most conformable to the analogy of language; for a conception always means an idea, and never a belief. The wrong meaning of “inconceivable” is, however, fully as frequent in philosophical discussion as the right meaning, and the intuitive school of metaphysicians could not well do without either. To illustrate the difference, we will take two contrasted examples. The early physical speculators considered antipodes incredible, because inconceivable. But antipodes were not inconceivable in the primitive sense of the word. An idea of them could be formed without difficulty: they could be completely pictured to the mental eye. What was difficult, and, as it then seemed, impossible, was to apprehend them as believable. The idea could be put together, of men sticking on by their feet to the under side of the earth; but the belief would follow, that they must fall off. Antipodes were not unimaginable, but they were unbelievable.|$|R

25|$|Nagel's replacement, Mike Giddings {{posted a}} record of 9–12 (.429) during the 1966 and 1967 seasons before resigning. Giddings had {{previously}} been an assistant coach at USC under legendary head coach John McKay and brought with him hopes that the Utes football program would be turned around, but an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> recruiting going led to on-field issues that essentially prevented any chance of viable football success.|$|E
25|$|Until Continental Airlines began nonstop {{flights to}} Lagos from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in November 2011, many Nigerians {{had to fly}} through Europe to travel between Texas and Nigeria. Jenalia Moreno of the Houston Chronicle said that the Nigerian {{community}} and the energy companies in Houston have worked {{for a long time}} to get a flight to Nigeria from this city. In 2016 United Airlines canceled the Lagos route, citing a decline in the energy industry and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> currency out of Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) in this breed, which occurs when twisting of the stomach (volvulus or torsion) causes or is caused by excess gas. Symptoms include restlessness, <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> comfortable, pacing, or retching without being able to bring up anything. The dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen, but bloat or torsion can occur without visible swelling. A dog with GDV requires immediate veterinary care. The dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get to a veterinarian in time.|$|E
5000|$|Children {{living in}} rural Canada are {{negatively}} affected by poverty and low income situations; especially children from single parent families. Single parent families {{in rural communities}} {{are more likely to}} have a low income and poor economical status. Child poverty is an issue in rural Canada due to the decreased job opportunities and stability for families in low income situations. In addition, financial support is often not enough to ensure the children are provided with the basic essential of daily living. [...] Children who grow up in poverty are less likely to improve their economical status as they grow older. Children of poverty are less likely to achieve a high school diploma or a post secondary education, due to the financial strain of the family and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> school or to move away. This same idea ties into the issues of young adults and rural areas. Young adults in rural Canada are extremely susceptible to poverty for many additional reasons. Jobs are incredibly hard to find for young adults because of their lack of experience. Employers will often require experience in order to be a successful candidate. With the huge shortage of jobs already existing, young rural Canadians find it challenging to start their careers. [...] In addition, formal education or post secondary is often set aside because of the lack of funding and affordability to leave their community. There are very few post secondary institutions located in remote and rural Canada, meaning that most people would have to travel or relocate in order to attend. This is often impossible for those living in these communities. Furthermore, financial assistance or employment insurance is not always an option because in order to be eligible, one must obtain a specific amount of working hours. If a young adult is unable to find work, this type of assistance would be denied due to the lack of worked hours and employment.|$|R
30|$|With {{regards to}} assistive devices, {{more than half}} {{reported}} that their child always used a wheelchair <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around. Nearly 90 % reported that their child never used a walker, cane, or crutches <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around, but this likely reflects their <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> use these devices rather than their ability to walk. As such, these two items on assistive devices {{were excluded from the}} Mobility scoring algorithm (resulting in an 11 -item scale).|$|R
40|$|A mass-heater {{supplemented}} greenhouse dryer {{is shown}} to be an adaptable technology to post-harvest preservation problems in developing countries. Inadequate harvest preservation in these countries often leads to a cycle of bumper harvest and production cutbacks, famine, <b>inability</b> of famers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their harvest <b>to</b> the market, low quality of exports, and low agro-processing. Drying is a preservation technique that is readily adaptable for developing countries, and the earliest form of this method, open air drying, is still predominant. Rigorous designs are not always possible or economical, but the greenhouse dryer will always outperform open air drying irrespective {{of the quality of}} its design. Greenhouse dryer design parameters are identified, and guidelines for optimizing performance are provided. Mass-heaters based on rocket or top-lit-up-draft heaters, fueled by agricultural wastes, are proposed as supplementary heat sources when the sun is not available at night or during cloudy periods...|$|R
25|$|By September 2014, Gordon King of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was {{the only}} {{prisoner}} still alive who had worked directly on the Great Escape, but {{was not one of}} the escapees. He had been number 141 to escape and operated the pump to send air into the tunnel. Speaking candidly of his low number and resulting <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the tunnel that night, he said he considered himself fortunate. King had been shot down over Germany in 1943 and {{spent the rest of the}} war as a prisoner. He participated in the Battle Scars TV series in his home town of Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|In {{her book}} Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45, Barbara Tuchman wrote that Stilwell was sacrificed as a {{political}} expedient because of his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with his allies in the theater. Some historians, such as David Halberstam in his final book, , have theorized that Roosevelt was concerned that Chiang would sign a separate peace with Japan, which would free many Japanese divisions to fight elsewhere, and that Roosevelt wanted to placate Chiang. The power struggle over the China Theater that emerged between Stilwell, Chennault, and Chiang reflected the American political divisions of the time.|$|E
25|$|By this time, McLain {{had serious}} arm trouble, {{inadvertently}} {{made worse by}} numerous cortisone shots he took for his sore arm. As a result, he essentially stopped throwing fastballs midway through the 1971 season. Due to his arm troubles and his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with Williams, McLain went 10–22. He thus earned the dubious distinction of going from leading his league in wins (tied with Mike Cuellar with 24 wins in 1969) to two years later leading his league in losses. McLain's 22 defeats (a mark later tied by three pitchers, all in 1974) remains the most in a major-league season since Jack Fisher of the Mets lost 24 in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Live Oak, Hurston {{was surprised}} {{not only by}} the gag order the judge in the trial placed on the defense, but by her <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> residents in town to talk about the case; both blacks and whites were silent. She believed that might have been related to Dr. Adams' alleged involvement as well in Sam McCollum's gambling operation. Her articles were published by the newspaper during the trial. Ruby McCollum was convicted by an all-white, all-male jury, and sentenced to death. Hurston had a special assignment to write a serialized account, The Life Story of Ruby McCollum, over three months in 1953 in the newspaper. Her part was ended abruptly when she and Nunn disagreed about her pay, and she left.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the {{security}} surrounding rich infrastructure targets in Britain also had a major effect on IRA team's ability to conduct operations. The seizure of war material and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> newly acquired war material into Britain under wartime restrictions meant increased improvisation, which in turn led to increased exposure to discovery. It {{is also clear that}} the campaign generated a good deal of anti-Irish sentiment, which increased the British public's suspicion of Irish people in general. All these factors led to attacks tapering off around early to mid-1940. The death of Seán Russell on 14 August 1940, (he had already been effectively incommunicado since April 1939), and the succession of Stephen Hayes as IRA Chief of Staff also contributed to the petering out of the attacks.|$|E
25|$|Beckett {{travelled}} in Europe. He {{spent some}} time in London, where in 1931 he published Proust, his critical study of French author Marcel Proust. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with Tavistock Clinic psychoanalyst Dr. Wilfred Bion. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as Watt and Waiting for Godot. In 1932, he wrote his first novel, Dream of Fair to Middling Women, but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 short-story collection More Pricks Than Kicks.|$|E

50|$|A {{consensus}} {{has developed}} among the medical, psychological, {{and social welfare}} communities that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are {{just as likely to}} be well-adjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents. The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology. Based on the robust nature of the evidence available in the field, the Third District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida was satisfied in 2010 that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise; the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption. The most important factors in maintaining the welfare of a child is more dependent on the socioeconomic status and not as dependent on the gender and sexuality of the parents. Issues are brought about from uncontrolled factors such as discrimination or the <b>inability</b> of parents <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married.|$|R
