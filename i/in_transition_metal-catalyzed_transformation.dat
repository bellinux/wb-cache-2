Due to its importance for the DuPont adiponitrile process, most of the literature deals with the nickel-catalyzed hydrocyanation. Ligand electronic and steric effects, as well as the bite angle of chelating ligands, play a dominant role for the catalyst performance. The ligand properties have a major effect on the catalyst stability and on the rate limiting step - the reductive elimination of the products. The DuPont process, comprises three separate steps: a) the hydrocyanation of 1, 3 -butadiene and other conjugated dienes, b) the isomerization of 2 -methyl- 3 -butenenitrile to 3 -pentenenitrile, and c) the hydrocyanation of 3 -pentenenitrile and other monoalkenes. Existing knowledge of these steps is summarized and elucidated. For the latter reactions, Lewis acid cocatalysts are imperative, and their influence on the regioselectivity and the catalyst performance will be discussed. Asymmetric alkene hydrocyanation has attracted considerable interest recently and is covered from a mechanistic viewpoint.

The catalytic cycle is identified as involving typical elementary steps <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> C-C bond formation reactions, such as oxidative insertion as well as beta-H elimination. The computed kinetic and thermodynamic features indicate that a commonly proposed metal hydride species (L(n) M-H) {{is less likely to}} act as the active species as compared to a metal-ethyl species (L(n) M-CH(2) CH(3)).

Chapter 1 provides background for asymmetric catalysis and summarizes applications of trans- 2, 5 -disubstituted pyrrolidine moieties as chiral auxiliaries and as building blocks for chiral ligands. Although these moieties have found many successful applications as chiral auxiliaries in different asymmetric reactions, application of chiral ligands derived from these moieties has been rare. Chapter 2 summarizes the synthesis of several small libraries of chiral ligands derived from trans- 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolidine and trans- 2, 5 -diarylpyrrolidines. A modular synthetic strategy has been followed to ensure ease in constructing these libraries with diversity. Small libraries of pyridine-pyrrolidine ligands, bidentate N-O and N-S type ligands, bidentate and tridentate Schiff-base ligands, aminoalcohol ligands, tridentate N-N-O type ligands, C 2 -symmetric diamine ligands, and a cyclopalladated complex have been prepared. Chapter 3 summarizes the results of using these ligands <b>in</b> several <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> asymmetric processes, including allylic alkylation, cyclopropanation and diethylzinc addition to benzaldehyde. The pyridine-pyrrolidine ligands are effective catalyst precursors for the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation and provided moderate to good stereoselectivities. The stereoselectivity of this reaction catalyzed by palladium complexes of the pyridine-pyrrolidine ligands could be adjusted by changing the substituents on the 6 -position of the pyridine ring {{as well as the}} chelation size of the complexes.

Several widely used reactions are discussed, including ring closing metathesis (RCM), allyl ion transfers, and the Heck reaction. These valuable reactions can lead to the construction of C-C and C-heteroatom bonds {{in the presence of a}} broad range of functionalities under relatively mild conditions. With regards to ring-closing metathesis, we have shown that a readily assembled ionic liquid-tagged Ru carbene complex is a highly efficient catalyst for the RCM of di-, tri- and tetrasubstituted diene and enyne substrates in minimally ionic solvent systems, with the combined advantage of high reactivity and a high level of recyclability and reusability. Both the catalyst and the ionic liquid can be conveniently recycled and repeatedly reused with only a very slight loss of activity. Given the growing interest in the development of catalyst systems suitable for organic transformations in ionic liquids and the widespread application of olefin metathesis in organic synthesis, this new complex should prove to be of unique utility in both areas. We have shown that a new SeCSe-Pd(II) pincer complex is a highly efficient catalyst for the allylation of aldehydes with allyltributyltin. Notable advantages of this catalyst includes its high stability, straightforward synthesis and superb catalytic activity compared to other transition metal catalysts developed to date for this reaction. The allylation reaction proceeds under mild and neutral reaction conditions in the presence of as little as 5. 0 x 10 - 3 mol% of the catalyst.

Several important organic building blocks such as aryl acetates, diaryl acetates, imines, ketones, biaryls, styrenes and polysubstituted alkenes were successfully accessed from carboxylic acids and their derivatives by {{the means of}} C–H activation and decarboxylative cross-couplings. An efficient and practical protocol for the synthesis of biologically important ethyl 2 -arylacates through the dealkoxycarbonlative cross-coupling reaction between aryl halides and malonates was developed. Activation of the alpha-proton of alkyl esters by a copper catalyst allowed the deprotonation of esters even {{in the presence of}} mild bases, leading to a straightforward and efficient approach to alkyl alpha-diarylacetate from simple alkyl acetates and aryl halides. The addition of a primary amine into the coupling reaction of alpha-oxocarboxylic acids and aryl halides led to an unprecedented low-temperature redox-neutral decarboxylative coupling process, providing a green and efficient method for the preparation of azomethines, in which all the three substituents can be independently varied. A minor modification of this protocol allowed us to easily access the corresponding ketones. The decarboxylative coupling of robust aryl mesylates as well as polysubstituted alkenyl mesylates using our customized imidazolyl phosphine ligands was realized, further expanding the scope of carbon electrophiles in decarboxylative coupling reactions. Variation of the ligands led to two complementary protocols, providing the corresponding biaryls and polysubstituted olefins in high yields. The use of a new class of pyrimidinyl phosphine ligands dramatically reduced the reaction temperatures of decarboxylative cross-coupling reactions between aromatic carboxylic acids and aryl or alkenyl triflates.

40|$|The routine {{application}} of Csp 3 -hybridized nucleophiles in cross-coupling {{has been an}} ongoing pursuit in the agrochemical, pharmaceutical, and materials science industries for over 40 years. Unfortunately, despite numerous attempts to circumvent {{the problems associated with}} alkyl nucleophiles, {{application of}} these reagents <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> C-C bond-forming reactions has remained largely restricted. In recent years, many chemists have noted the lack of reliable, turnkey reactions that exist for the installation of Csp 3 -hybridized centers—reactions that would be useful for delivering molecules with enhanced three-dimensional topology and altered chemical properties. As such, a general method for alkyl nucleophile activation in cross-coupling would offer access to a host of compounds inaccessible by other means. ^ From a mechanistic standpoint, the continued failure of alkylmetallics is inherent to the high energy intermediates associated with a traditional transmetalation. To overcome this problem, we have pioneered an alternate, single-electron pathway involving 1) initial oxidation of an alkylmetallic reagent, 2) oxidative alkyl radical capture at a metal center, and 3) subsequent reduction of the metal center to return its initial oxidation state. This series of steps constitutes a formal transmetalation that avoids the energy-demanding steps that plague a traditional anionic approach. Under this enabling paradigm, a host of alkyl precursors (alkyl-trifluoroborates and -silicates) have been generally used in cross-coupling for the first time. ^ In summary, the synergistic use of an Ir photoredox catalyst and a Ni cross-coupling catalyst to mediate the cross-coupling of (hetero) aryl bromides with diverse alkyl radical precursors will be discussed. Methods for coupling various trifluoroborate classes (α-alkoxy, α-trifluoromethyl, secondary and tertiary alkyl) will be covered, focusing on their complementarity to traditional protocols. Finally, a discussion of novel silicate radical precursors and their advantages in a single-electron transmetalation regime will be included. ...|$|R

The use of P-chirogenic phosphine boranes <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> reactions, such as palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation and amination, is also described. Papers I and II describe the synthesis and evaluation of different chiral diamines in the enantioselective deprotonation of alkyl- and aryl-substituted prochiral phosphine boranes. Although (-) -sparteine ligated to sec-BuLi is reported to give high enantioselectivity in the deprotonation of prochiral phosphine-borane, this methodology suffers {{from the lack of}} availability of (+) -sparteine. We have shown that diamines derived from the quinolizidine alkaloid (-) -cytisine, which is extracted from the Golden Rain Tree (Laburnum anagyroides), are excellent substitutes for (+) -sparteine and thus facilitate the preparation of both enantiomers of a P-chirogenic phosphine via enantioselective deprotonation. The utility of P-chirogenic scaffolds obtained by desymmetrization is presented in Papers III, IV and V. A set of new P-chirogenic building blocks was synthesized via asymmetric deprotonation and utilized in the further syntheses of libraries of different P,N ligands or &# 945;-carboxyphosphine boranes. Applications of the phosphine boranes as pro-ligands in palladium-catalyzed reactions are also described. In Paper VI, a novel biocatalytic desymmetrization of prochiral phosphine-boranes mediated by lipase B of Candida antarctica is presented. Both enantiomers can be prepared with good to excellent enantioselectivity either through hydrolysis of a prochiral diacetate or via acylation of a prochiral diol. Finally, Paper VII describes a highly stereoselective and enantioselective Au(I) -catalyzed intermolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This reaction is based on an intermediate gold-carbenoid species, derived via a Rautenstrauch rearrangement of different propargyl esters, which is trapped by olefin to form multi-substituted cyclopropanes with defined regiochemistry and stereochemistry.

40|$|Herein, {{we report}} an optimal {{procedure}} for the preparative-scale synthesis of AB in high yields and purity from sodium borohydride and ammonium salts. The first systematic {{study of the}} <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> methanolysis of AB, the isolation and characterization of the resulting borate salt, and recovery of AB has been described. A comparison of the <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> methanolysis and hydrolysis of AB has been made. We have recognized and quantified the liberation of ammonia during the <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> hydrolysis. It is known that, borazine, by-product of the pyrolysis reaction, is detrimental to the fuel cell membrane. We have reported an improved procedure for the preparation of borazine and shown that {{it can also be}} recycled to ammonia borane via trimethylborate. The solid residue, polyborazylene, formed after pyrolysis of ammonia borane has also been recycled to ammonia borane. Also reported is the direct synthesis of amine boranes form timethyl borate. ...|$|R
