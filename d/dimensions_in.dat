5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of <b>dimensions.</b> <b>In</b> 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> simple games was {{introduced}} {{as a measure}} of the remoteness of a given game from a weighted game. Taylor and Zwicker (1993) demonstrated that the dimension of a simple game can grow exponentially in the number of players. However, the problem of worst-case growth of the <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> complete games was left open. Freixas and Puente (2008) showed that complete games of arbitrary <b>dimension</b> exist and, <b>in</b> particular, their examples demonstrate that the worst-case growth of <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> complete games is at least linear.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other <b>dimensions.</b> <b>In</b> some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E

The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as {{it would not be}} possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted this advice, and no inquiry was ever held.|$|E
5|$|In 1858/59 Inselstraße was {{extended}} {{through the garden}} to connect Köpenicker Straße to the city centre, and the Lodge was forced to sell the larger, eastern portion of the site to the city. The Köllnisches Gymnasium was then built there. How to use {{the remainder of the}} site was discussed for years; a desire to preserve the trees led to the rejection of several commercial proposals. On 15 April 1869, the Assembly of City Deputies (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) decided to establish a public playground (probably one of the first in the city) and 'promenade location' there on plans drawn up by the first city director of gardens, Gustav Meyer, dedicated the necessary funds, and urged rapid execution of the plan. The plan involved some new plantings, fencing, and benches. This renovation was completed in 1873. The park reached its current <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> 1883 after the ditch was filled in. Ludwig Hoffmann, the architect of the Märkisches Museum (completed in 1907), then made some changes including creating views across the park to the new museum. The last major modification of the park took place in 196971 to designs by Eberhard Jaenisch, Stefan Rauner and Roswitha Schulz: a mound which remained {{on the site of the}} bastion was levelled, a children's playground was added, a terrace was built behind the museum, and the Lapidary was created.|$|E
