Despite losing Delle <b>Donne</b> the Huskies were ranked #1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from the 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene who recovered from her knee injury.|$|E
5|$|The concerto delle <b>donne</b> {{transformed}} the musica secreta. In the past, {{members of the}} audience would perform, and performers would become audience members. During the ascendancy of the concerto delle <b>donne</b> the roles within the musica secreta became fixed, as did the roster of those who performed for the Duke's pleasure every night.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle <b>donne</b> spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle <b>donne</b> was so influential and often imitated that it became a cliché of northern Italian courts. The concerto brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dønnes</b> was {{established}} as a municipality on 1 July 1888 when {{the western part of}} the municipality of Nesna was separated to form a new municipality. Initially, <b>Dønnes</b> had a population of 1,348. On 1 January 1962 the municipality of <b>Dønnes</b> ceased to exist. The part of <b>Dønnes</b> on the island of Tomma (population: 80) was merged into Nesna. The remainder of <b>Dønnes</b> (population: 1,348) was merged with the municipality of Nordvik, the part of Herøy on the island of Dønna, and the island of Løkta in Nesna to create the new municipality of Dønna.|$|R

5|$|In these stanzas, <b>Donne</b> {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death <b>Donne</b> finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|The concerto delle <b>donne</b> {{revolutionized}} {{the role of}} women in professional music, and continued the tradition of the Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of the Medici and Orsini. The founding of the concerto delle <b>donne</b> was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important in the development of the madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica.|$|E

40|$|The {{arguments}} in John <b>Donne’s</b> songs and sonnets can be appreciated intellectually, taken apart and put back together like intricate puzzles, because <b>Donne’s</b> ingenuity and wit makes this mental activity pleasurably satisfying. But {{there is a}} subtler aspect to John <b>Donne’s</b> art that transcends the rational patterns of logic and paradox. The speakers in the Songs and Sonnets must be given their share of attention in order to fully appreciate <b>Donne’s</b> total artistic achievement. The discovery of their contributions within the poems demands an imaginative and intuitive analysis of their roles and effects. The arguments do not lose their importance or fascination, but gain their intense impact from the speakers’ dramatic presence...|$|R
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle <b>donne</b> in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle <b>donne.</b> Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle <b>donne</b> performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} musical innovation of the concerto delle <b>donne</b> was the multiplication of the ornamented upper voices, {{from one}} voice singing diminutions above an instrumental accompaniment {{to two or}} three voices singing varying diminutions at once.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{ensemble}} lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who performed for each other {{within the context of}} the Duke's informal musica secreta in the 1570s. The ensemble evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto delle <b>donne,</b> who performed formal concerts for members of the inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time.|$|E

5|$|The singers of {{the second}} era of the concerto delle <b>donne</b> were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, but were hired {{primarily}} as singers. Peverara's musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua {{as part of her}} retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, {{but by the end of}} the century virtuosic bass singing went out of style, and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies' musical duties included performing with the duchess' balletto delle <b>donne,</b> a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court's inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.|$|E
