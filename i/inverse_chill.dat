40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} of alloying elements on the chill formation in Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) is investigated. Chill wedges cast {{in an industrial}} foundry were used to investigate the chill formation. A total number of 19 chemical compositions were studied, including three trials of varying nodularity treatment level; four trials of varying copper content; four trials of varying silicon content; four trials of varying tin content and four trials of varying carbide promoter content. Three wedges were cast for each alloy composition, of which one was used for measuring the temperature at three different heights in the wedge. Contrary to some previous reports, {{the results indicate that}} low-nodularity CGI is not more prone to chill formation (columnar white) than high-nodularity CGI. Trends regarding the effect of alloying elements on chill formation are shown to generally be in agreement with previous work on spheroidal graphite iron and lamellar graphite iron. Most of the samples also show carbide formation in centre line areas of the wedge (<b>inverse</b> <b>chill),</b> this occurrence is also discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Inoculation {{comparisons}} were made between calcium-bearing, foundry-grade 75 % ferrosilicon (FeSi 75) and a proprietary complex alloy tablet (hereafter {{referred to as}} CAT) to determine their effects on late inoculation. In-mold addition rates for FeSi 75 ranged from 0. 1 % to 0. 3 %; the complex alloy tablets, based on oxy-sulfide chemistry, were added in much smaller amounts, 0. 01 % to 0. 03 %. In-mold inoculation was used simultaneously at three inoculant levels in multi-cavity test molds to evaluate chill tendency, microstructure and Brinell hardness characteristics. Thermal analysis also was used to study the solidification behavior of the base iron {{and the effect of}} FeSi 75 and the complex alloy tablet inoculants on graphite nucleation. Thermal analysis of the base low-sulfur iron was characterized by excessive eutectic undercooling. It was found that an addition of 0. 03 % CAT had an inoculation efficiency comparable with 0. 2 % to 0. 3 % calcium-bearing foundry-grade FeSi 75. CAT addition rates of less than 0. 05 % (based on the test casting weight) were extremely effective for late inoculation of grey irons. Irons inoculated with the CAT were less likely to chill (inclusively as <b>inverse</b> <b>chill)</b> and to develop micro-shrinkage formations, compared with calcium-bearing FeSi 75 treatments. The CAT inoculant can be used at significantly reduced addition levels...|$|E
