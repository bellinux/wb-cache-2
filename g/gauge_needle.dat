25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky <b>gauge</b> <b>needle.</b> A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.|$|E
25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small <b>gauge</b> <b>needle</b> for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{diameter}} of the needle is indicated by the <b>needle</b> <b>gauge.</b> Various <b>needle</b> lengths are available for any given gauge. There {{are a number of}} systems for <b>gauging</b> <b>needles,</b> including the Stubs <b>Needle</b> <b>Gauge</b> and the French Catheter Scale. Needles in common medical use range from 7 gauge (the largest) to 33 (the smallest) on the Stubs scale. 21-gauge needles are most commonly used for drawing blood for testing purposes, and 16- or 17-gauge needles are most commonly used for blood donation, as the resulting lower pressure is less harmful to red blood cells (it also allows more blood to be collected in a shorter time). Although reusable needles remain useful for some scientific applications, disposable needles are far more common in medicine. Disposable needles are embedded in a plastic or aluminium hub that attaches to the syringe barrel by means of a press-fit or twist-on fitting. These are sometimes referred to as [...] "Luer Lock" [...] connections, referring to the trademark Luer-Lok.|$|R

40|$|In this work, MEMS based {{fabrication}} is used {{to engineer}} multifaceted enhancements to microfluidic systems such as lab-on-a-chip devices. Two specific elements of microfluidic systems {{are the focus of}} this study: microfluidic chambers and microneedles. Microfluidic chambers, which are back-end passive elements, via proposed material and structural modifications, are shown to exhibit reduced non-specific DNA binding and enable increased cell lysis efficiency. Microneedles, which are front-end interfacing elements, have been fabricated in silicon and in silicon dioxide varieties. The geometry of silicon microneedles has been varied via DRIE processing to yield sharpened tips. Sharpening of microneedle tips provides reduced skin insertion force without compromising structural strength. Variation of skin insertion force of microneedles with change in tip sharpness has been studied, and toughness of human skin derived to be approximately 26 kJ/m². The axial and shear fracture limits of the microneedles have also been studied. Axial fracture of 36 <b>gauge</b> silicon <b>needles</b> takes place at an average force of 740 gf. Shear fracture force of silicon needles varies from 275 gf (33 <b>gauge</b> <b>needles)</b> to 35. 6 gf (36 <b>gauge</b> <b>needles).</b> Fracture limits of circular and square shaped silicon dioxide needles show reduced strength of square needles; which is pronounced in the case of shear fracture...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimShaping {{should be}} complemented by {{antiseptic}} solution. These are often delivered using a needle and syringe. But apical {{penetration of the}} irrigation solution is of only 1 mm beyond its tip. The aim of our study was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} apical preparation on the penetration depth of some needles. Methodology 24 teeth were divided randomly into two groups and prepared in continuous rotation (350 rpm) with Revo-S® or ProTaper® to sizes AS 30, 35 and 40 and F 1, F 2 and F 3 respectively. Four types of endodontic needles were used. Three sizes of stainless steel needles: 25, 27 and 30 gauge and one of nickel–titanium needle: 30 <b>Gauge.</b> Each <b>needle</b> was inserted and its length of penetration measured before the root canal preparation and after the finishing files. ResultsMultivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences for the finishers (p< 0. 0001) and the kind of needle (p< 0. 0001). The PLSD Fisher's test can highlight the differences between the six types of apical shaping used (independently of the needle type). The same differences were observed between the four types of needle (independently of the apical finish) (p= 0. 0232). Variance analysis between the four different needles is statistically significant for each apical shaping (p< 0. 0001 × 6). Variance analysis among the six types of finish is statistically significant for each type of needle (p< 0. 0001 × 4). ConclusionsThis study shows that the apical preparation influences the penetration depth of <b>needles.</b> The 27 <b>gauge</b> <b>needles</b> reach the last millimetre only with the Revo-S® system shaped with AS 40.

50|$|The high {{frequency}} thyroid ultrasound (HFUS) {{can be used}} to treat several gland conditions. The recurrent thyroid cyst that was usually treated in the past with surgery, can be treated effectively by a new procedure called percutaneous ethanol injection, or PEI. With ultrasound guided placement of a 25 <b>gauge</b> <b>needle</b> within the cyst, and after evacuation of the cyst fluid, about 50% of the cyst volume is injected back into the cavity, under strict operator visualization of the needle tip. The procedure is 80% successful in reducing the cyst to minute size.|$|E
50|$|In an {{eye with}} total loss of bag {{where there is}} no capsular bag remnant, glued IOL {{scaffold}} is used. In this first a glued IOL is done behind the cataract pieces. The glued IOL then works as a scaffold and the cataract pieces are removed with the phaco handpiece using ultrasound. Here two partial thickness scleral flaps measuring 2.5 to 2.5 mm are made 180 degrees diagonally apart. Infusion is placed by anterior chamber maintainer and sclerotomies are made below the flaps with 20 <b>gauge</b> <b>needle.</b> The desired IOL is injected below the remaining lens particles in the eye and the remaining lens are positioned on the artificial lens or IOL(Fig 2). The haptics of the IOL are brought out under the flaps as in the glued IOL method and tucked into the scleral tunnel made with 26 <b>gauge</b> <b>needle</b> at the entry site. The phacoemulsification procedure is then continued on the IOL and the anterior chamber is formed {{by the end of the}} procedure. Scleral flaps and conjunctiva are then closed with fibrin glue.In IOL scaffold the IOL is placed above the iris (diaphragm of the eye) or above some remnant of the capsule whereas in glued IOL scaffold as there is not enough iris or capsule support a glued IOL is done which then acts as a scaffold.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent review}} article {{suggested}} the following {{line of treatment}} for suspected breast abscess: initially, antibiotics treatment, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the abscess with an 18 <b>gauge</b> <b>needle,</b> under saline lavage until clear. The exudate is then sent for microbiological analysis for identification of the pathogen and determination of its antibiotic sensitivity profile (antibiogram), which may in turn give an indication for changing the antibiotics prescription. At follow-up, a mammography is performed if the condition has resolved; otherwise the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with lavage and microbiological analysis is repeated. If three to five aspirations still do not resolve the condition, percutaneous drainage in combination with placement of an indwelling catheter is indicated, and only if several attempts at ultrasound-guided drainage fail, surgical resection of the inflamed lactiferous ducts (preferably performed after the acute episode is over) should be considered. It is noted, however, that even the excision of the affected ducts does not necessarily prevent recurrence.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{hemodialysis}} {{is usually}} done {{three times per}} week, for about 3-4 hours for each treatment, during which the patient's blood is drawn out through a tube {{at a rate of}} 200-400 mL/min. The tube is connected to a 15, 16, or 17 <b>gauge</b> <b>needle</b> inserted in the dialysis fistula or graft, or connected to one port of a dialysis catheter. The blood is then pumped through the dialyzer, and then the processed blood is pumped back into the patient's bloodstream through another tube (connected to a second needle or port). During the procedure, the patient's blood pressure is closely monitored, and if it becomes low, or the patient develops any other signs of low blood volume such as nausea, the dialysis attendant can administer extra fluid through the machine. During the treatment, the patient's entire blood volume (about 5000 cc) circulates through the machine every 15 minutes. During this process, the dialysis patient is exposed to a week's worth of water for the average person.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{intrathecal}} {{drugs to}} produce either analgesia or anaesthesia has been limited, in part, by {{the problem of}} post-spinal headache. The headache, which may be disabling, has dis-couraged the use of "spinal anaesthesia", especi-ally in younger patients in whom the incidence {{is said to be}} greater. However, the introduction of fine <b>gauge</b> <b>needles</b> has decreased the risk to less than 1 % with 0. 5 -mm (25 -gauge) and 0. 45 -mm (26 -gauge) needles (Bonica, 1970). One problem in using fine <b>gauge</b> <b>needles</b> (especially for the inexperienced operator) is visualization of the free-flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to confirm the position of the needle tip in the subarachnoid space. The only previous study which examined the in vitro performance of spinal needles (Messahel, Robinson and Mathews, 1983) found considerable differences in flow through two types of 0. 5 -mm (25 -gauge) needle. We have related the dimensions of some currently available spinal needles (0. 7 -, 0. 5 - and 0. 45 -mm; 22 -, 25 - and 26 -gauge) to CSF flow at "high " and "low " pressures (equivalent to the sitting and lying positions for lumbar puncture). We have used the term "time to appearance of CSF " in an attempt to quantify how long the operator may expect to wait, under ideal condi-tions, before 'seeing a fluid meniscus within the needle hub.
