5|$|The {{gene for}} apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5, gene ID 116519, OMIM {{accession}} number – 606368) was originally found by comparative sequencing {{of human and}} mice DNA as a last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins APOA1/APOC3/APOA4/APOA5, located on human chromosome 11 at position 11q23. The creation of two mice models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 <b>knock-out)</b> confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride determination. The transgenic mice had lower and the <b>knock-out</b> mice higher levels of plasma triglycerides, while plasma cholesterol levels remained unchanged in both animal models.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac {{conduction}} {{is mediated}} by gap junction channels that are formed by connexin (Cx) protein subunits. The connexin family of proteins consists of 24 members, varying in their biophysical properties {{and ability to}} combine with other connexins into heteromeric gap junction channels. The mammalian heart shows regional differences both in connexin expression profile and in degree of electrical coupling. The latter reflects functional requirements for conduction velocity, which needs to be low in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and high in the ventricular conduction system. Over the past 20 years, knowledge of the biology of gap junction channels and {{their role in the}} genesis of cardiac arrhythmias has increased enormously. This review focuses on the insights gained from transgenic mouse models. The mouse heart expresses Cx 30, 30. 2, 37, 40, 43, 45 and 46. For these connexins, a variety of <b>knock-outs,</b> heart-specific <b>knock-outs,</b> conditional <b>knock-outs,</b> double <b>knock-outs,</b> knock-ins and overexpressers has been studied. We discuss the cardiac phenotype in these models and compare Cx expression between mice and men. Mouse models have enhanced our understanding of (patho) -physiological implications of Cx diversity in the heart. In principle, connexin-specific modulation of electrical coupling in the heart represents an interesting treatment strategy for cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a modified RNA interference (RNAi) method for generating gene <b>knock-outs</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. We used the sequence of the yellow (y) locus to construct an inverted repeat that will form a double-stranded hairpin structure (y‐IR) that is {{under the control of}} the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL 4. Hairpins are extremely difficult to manipulate in Escherichia coli, so our method makes use of a heterologous 330 bp spacer encoding sequences from green fluorescent protein to facilitate the cloning steps. When the UAS–y–IR hairpin is expressed under the control of different promoter–GAL 4 fusions, a high frequency of y pigment phenocopies is obtained in adults. Consequently this method for producing gene <b>knock-outs</b> has several advantages over previous methods in that it is applicable to any gene within the fly genome, greatly facilitates cloning of the hairpin, can be used if required with GAL 4 drivers to avoid lethality or to induce RNAi in a specific developmental stage and/or tissue, is useful for generating <b>knock-outs</b> of adult phenotypes as reported here and, finally, the system can be manipulated to investigate the trans-acting factors that are involved in the RNAi mechanism.

5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first <b>knock-out</b> round.|$|E

50|$|Mice with {{conditional}} <b>knock-outs</b> in MACF1 in {{hair follicle}} stem cells have defects in cell migration. The focal adhesions in cells lacking MACF1 associate with cables of F-actin, causing cell migration to stall. Wild-type cells with MACF1 present have coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics, which allow for proper cell migration. MACF1 {{plays an important}} role in microtubule organization, and without MACF1, microtubules in migrating cells are bending and curly, instead of straight and radial. When wounded, conditional <b>knock-outs</b> for MACF1 have around a 40% delay in migration over 4 to 6 days after injury compared to the wild-type controls, showing that MACF1 {{plays an important role}} in cell migration.
