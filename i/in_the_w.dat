Although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the Gothic ethnos into the region from the Northwest, Todd argues that its most important origin is Scytho-Sarmatian. Although the Goths certainly contributed to it, so probably did other peoples of the region such as the Dacians, proto-Slavs, Carpi, and possibly the Bastarnae.|$|E

2500|$|The W was of {{potential}} {{value to the}} Confederates for any need to attack Harpers Ferry and did serve a useful role in the movement of Virginia Militia troops to defensive positions in and about Harpers Ferry. [...] Although it could potentially be used to feed Confederate forces into the defenses of western Virginia via the B, by running along the northern border of the Confederate states, {{it would have been}} vulnerable to attack, possibly stranding large units to the west. So, due to its very northern location, and mere spur-like connection to the B, its overall potential usefulness to the Confederacy was not great. The greatest use and value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>W</b> came in the first eight months of the war, from May 1861 to January 1862, when it was utilized to ship light machinery from the Harpers Ferry arsenal down to Winchester, and from there overland to Strasburg and the Manassas Gap Railroad. The real shame was that the light strap rails did not permit heavy shipments, and this was a constant factor until late in the war.|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, {{the family}} moved to Providence. In the fall of that year the General Conference met with Roger Williams Church. It was notable as the first General Conference at which a woman presided over the public meeting of the W.M.S. As President of the W.M.S., she was asked to make the dedicatory address at Myrtle Hall, Storer College, May 30, 1879. For this she made her first journey alone, and, {{preceding}} the dedication, gave an evening of reading to defray the expenses of the journey. Rev. A. H. Morrell invited her to preach for him one Sunday morning. This she did, and thereafter, through the years, did considerable pulpit work. On moving to Providence, Burlingame became actively identified with the W.C.T.U. movement, then only a few months old; first with the Providence Union, then as corresponding secretary of the State Union, and in 1884–1890 as president of the latter. It was during her presidency that the campaign was on which won for a period of three years, 1886–89, State Constitutional Prohibition. Into this, she threw all of her energies, as she did in 1887 into the effort to secure state suffrage for women. Through all the years she has been keenly interested in these two reform movements, and has lived to see both realized nationwide. After giving up her state office <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>W.</b> C. T. U., she was appointed, through Miss Willard's influence, National Evangelist. This gave her credentials to speak for the cause wherever she might be. As a sample of her activities we quote, “For several years I had the work connected with the Presidency of the R. I. W. C. T. U., speaking once or more every Sunday, attending frequent conventions, keeping track of work at Headquarters and the interests of the local Unions, editing a semimonthly edition of the Outlook, and the monthly Missionary Helper.” ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course it}} is ten times {{criminal}} to tell young children facts about sex, or to implicate them in adult relationships. A child has a strong evanescent sex consciousness. It instinctively writes impossible words on back walls. But {{this is not a}} fully conscious mental act. It is a kind of dream act--quite natural. The child's curious, shadowy, indecent sex-knowledge is quite in the course of nature. And does nobody any harm at all. Adults had far better not notice it. But if a child sees a cockerel tread a hen, or two dogs coupling, well and good. It should see these things. Only, without comment. Let nothing be exaggeratedly hidden. By instinct, let us preserve the decent privacies. But if a child occasionally sees its parent nude, taking a bath, all the better. Or even sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>W.</b> C. Exaggerated secrecy is bad. But indecent exposure is also very bad. But worst of all is dragging in the mental consciousness of these shadowy dynamic realities.|$|E
