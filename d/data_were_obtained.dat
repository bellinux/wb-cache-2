25|$|In February 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University {{had started}} to build a {{molecular}} model of the B form of DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's. Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical. Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation {{of the structure of}} the alpha helix by Linus Pauling in 1951, but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Xu et al. at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute {{used the}} 3D VIP-Man phantom to {{simulate}} respiratory motions by adopting the gated respiratory motion {{data of the}} NCAT phantom. The 4D VIP-Man Chest phantom was used to study external-beam treatment planning for a lung cancer patient. In 2007, Xu's research group reported creation {{of a series of}} polygon-based phantoms representing a pregnant woman and her fetus at the end of 3, 6, and 9 month gestations (RPI Pregnant Females). The mesh data were initially obtained from separate anatomical information sources including a non-pregnant female, a 7-month pregnant woman CT data set, and a mesh model of the fetus. In 2008, two triangular mesh-based phantoms were created, named as RPI Deformable Adult Male and Female (RPI-AM, RPI-FM). The anatomic parameters of the phantoms were made consistent with two datasets: the mass and density of internal organs originated from ICRP-23 and ICRP-89, and the whole-body height and weight percentile <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2002). Later on, to study the relationship between breast size and lung dosimetry, a new group of phantoms were produced by altering the breast geometry of RPI-AF.|$|E
500|$|The 1910 approach, {{which came}} into naked-eye view around 10 April {{and came to}} {{perihelion}} on 20 April, was notable for several reasons: {{it was the first}} approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>obtained.</b> Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 AU, making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet. One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen, which led astronomer Camille Flammarion to claim that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas [...] "would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet." [...] His pronouncement led to panicked buying of gas masks and quack [...] "anti-comet pills" [...] and [...] "anti-comet umbrellas" [...] by the public. [...] In reality, as other astronomers were quick to point out, the gas is so diffuse that the world suffered no ill effects from the passage through the tail.|$|E
2500|$|In one {{landmark}} study, {{the effect}} of breed on longevity in the pet dog was analyzed using mortality data from 23,535 pet dogs. The <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> from North American veterinary teaching hospitals. The median age at death was determined for pure and mixed breed dogs of different body weights. Within each body weight category, the median age at death was lower for pure breed dogs compared with mixed breed dogs. The median age at death was [...] "8.5 years for all mixed breed dogs, and 6.7 years for all pure breed dogs" [...] in the study.|$|E
