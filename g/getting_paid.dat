5|$|Initially {{the actors}} who portray the other office workers were {{credited}} as guest stars {{before they were}} named series regulars during the second season. The show's large ensemble has been mainly praised by critics {{and led to the}} series winning two Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Carell was reportedly paid $175,000 per episode starting with the third season. Krasinski and Fischer were paid around $20,000 for the beginning of the series. Starting with the fourth season, the two started <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> around $100,000 per episode.|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not <b>getting</b> <b>paid.</b> During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E

5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals if they saw players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of <b>getting</b> <b>paid,</b> differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had opt-out clauses that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
5|$|Creatures are {{attracted}} via Portals. Which ones come {{depend on the}} dungeon's composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. Creatures include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, creatures can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, {{at the cost of}} their health. Certain creatures, such as Vampires and Skeletons cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where creatures pray, also yield the acquisition of certain creatures. Creatures frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against creatures belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroics forces are composed of different units to keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most creatures have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers' creatures can be converted to the player's cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. Creatures dislike their heroic counterparts, and their company may make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling creatures either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other creatures too. Other things that can annoy creatures and cause rebellions include lack of food, not <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> (creatures require payment on a regular basis), and being slapped.|$|E

Waesche was the first commandant to be promoted to Vice Admiral and Reynolds believed that he, as a retired commandant should be paid {{at the same rate}} as a vice admiral since that was the newly authorized rank for a Coast Guard commandant. Reynolds lost his bid for higher pay because the Comptroller General ruled he was paid retirement pay as a rear admiral, and not as a former commandant. Rear Admiral William E. Reynolds died 25 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|Many male prostitutes offer {{services}} at hotel rooms booked {{for the purpose}} instead of the client's residence. This is because while accompanying a client to his residence prostitutes become vulnerable to assault or robbery. Some prostitutes have sex with clients {{in the back seat}} of the client's car. There are many part-time prostitutes who are students, salespersons, workers in hotels and garages. They become involved in the profession to earn extra money, and often to get a job in the film industry. Some involved in prostitution often manage to save enough money to go abroad in search of a job. Many boys are frequently used by the police without <b>getting</b> <b>paid.</b> Plainclothes police officers are often involved in the extortion and blackmail of male prostitutes.|$|E

Two years after that, Gamboa met with the sculptor again, and this time he tells that Gandarias had lost all hope of ever <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> and that was in Guatemala barely surviving by selling cigarettes in Guatemala City; Gamboa visited Gandarias at his home and tells how the sculptures place was in total disarray, but kept some old paintings and sculptures that he was hoping to sell if he ever went back to Spain.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, a {{much better}} paying job enticed Wood to leave West Texas {{for the first time}} as a head coach. He landed in Victoria, Texas where he reunited with Assistant Coach Morris Southall. That year, Wood also hired Kenneth West as an {{assistant}} coach. West had played for Wood at Stamford in 1951. The two grew to be longtime friends and coached together for twenty years. Their first season at Victoria, Wood, Southall, and West shocked many Victoria fans and brought the team a 6-4 winning season. Then Coach Wood brought Victoria another winning season in 1959 with six wins, three losses, and one tie. Wood was <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> well in Victoria, making about $10,000, but a lack of fan support and homesickness for West Texas convinced him to move back west.

500|$|Frederick George [...] "Steamer" [...] Maxwell (May 19, 1890 – September 11, 1975) was a Canadian amateur {{ice hockey}} player.
