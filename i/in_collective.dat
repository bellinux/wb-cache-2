5000|$|Goldmann noticed, however, {{that the}} {{collective}} consciousness {{did not seem}} to be the necessary intermediary in the new novel because the exchange structure seen in society and the novel form was not existent <b>in</b> the <b>collective</b> consciousness. Moreover, the novel form seems to be not the transposition of something <b>in</b> the <b>collective</b> consciousness, but a search for something missing and implicit <b>in</b> the <b>collective</b> consciousness.|$|R

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E
5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be lost, as well. In Río Bravo, 50families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, San Fernando, San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, Méndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing potable water and electricity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of sown area <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> {{use in the}} table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land <b>in</b> <b>collective</b> farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.|$|E
