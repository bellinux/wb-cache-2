40|$|Theory: The {{adoption}} of EC secondary legislation {{can be analyzed}} {{from the perspective of}} agency theory whereby Member States and the Parliament delegate policy authority to the Commission and design <b>ex-post</b> <b>control</b> procedures (i. e. Comitology). Rational choice and sociological institutionalisms differ in their predictions on the way rules and norms affect the extent of executive discretion. Hypothesis: Three institutionalist hypotheses are tested. The rationalist one derives from a Bayesian game developed by the author. It posits that Commission’s executive discretion in non amending secondary legislation is a function of: 1) formal legislative procedure, 2) information asymmetry and 3) distribution of principals ’ preferences. A fourth variable, legislative instrument, is also included. The ‘diluted rationalist ’ hypothesis substitutes formal with informal procedure in one policy area. The socio-rational hypothesis adds two new variables, that is the opinions of the Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. A final co-graduation test is conducted on whether more discretion leads to more stringent <b>ex-post</b> <b>control.</b> Methods: Given the bimodal error structure of the regression model, I have bootstrapped th...|$|E

Stressing the limits of an exclusively ex-ante control, we show that the possibility to act ex-post on market structures would lead to more virtuous behaviors in the ex-ante control by reducing adverse selection effects. The <b>ex-post</b> merger <b>control</b> would also permit new means of action on agents’ behaviors after the merger. Despite those positive effects, the implementation of an <b>ex-post</b> merger <b>control</b> should be attentively carried out in particular because some legal security problems could emerge.

However, despite more than ten years of efforts, the ranking of Italy among the countries that have facilitated going into business have not improved over the past years. Thus, in 2010 the Italian Government decided to further simplify the procedures by turning the current legislation from the traditional ex ante authorization regime into an <b>ex-post</b> <b>controls</b> regime. Under this new regime, all the required controls have to be operated within a fixed time interval defined by the law. Most often these controls have to be operated by different public agencies, thus determining two main problems: (a) the agencies involved should cooperate in order to make the controls efficient and effective; (b) since these agencies usually suffer from a chronic lack of resources, the only way to safeguard the public interest is by identifying, through a careful analysis of the potential risks involved, what controls really need to be made. In the paper I will consider how the public agencies involved in the functioning of the SUAP can satisfy the requirements determined by the new Italian legislation, by resorting to a form of inter-organizational risk management. In the first section of the paper, I will first provide a full explanation of the Italian model of SUAP and the recent changes in the Italian legislation concerning its functioning, and then I will show why the current regime of <b>ex-post</b> <b>controls</b> requires the SUAP to implement an adequate risk management system. In section 2 I will consider the Team Risk Management (TRM) model that has been originally developed to manage risks in software-dependent development programs involving different organizations. In section 3, I will show how a slight revision of the TRM model can be integrated within the SUAP’s workflows to help all the public agencies involved to cope with the requirements stated by the new Italian legislation concerning starting, transforming or closing a business. Finally, I will discuss what conditions different public agencies should satisfy in order to implement an effective and efficient inter-organizational risk management system...|$|R

Stakeholders may disagree about firms' liquidity choices because they {{differ in the}} allocation of <b>ex-post</b> <b>control</b> rights for the firms' liquidity reserves. Using state-level changes in takeover protection as exogenous shocks to corporate governance, I find that firms increase cash relative to lines of credit when the threat of takeover weakens.

Overall, my findings suggest the choice of corporate liquidity is a channel through which corporate governance works. The Author 2008.

In addition to these classic functions, parties also organise the legislature delegating power to legislators, specifically as committee chairs and party coordinators. Delegation is inherently dangerous, involving potential agency loss. Parties, however, have ex-ante and ex-post institutional mechanisms to deal with agency problems. In this paper, a case study is made of the Portuguese legislature, arguing that parties make use of their pivotal role in selecting legislators as committee chairs and party coordinators {{to keep tabs on}} legislators to thwart shirking from the party line.

40|$|Using a principal-agent {{framework}} and multi-country survey data of over 400 public sector organizations, {{this article examines}} the effect of result control on the use of financial management techniques in public sector organizations. In order to avoid invalid conclusions, we test for heteroskedasticity and model residual variance using a heterogeneous choice model. This model yields important insights into the effect of result control that would be overlooked in a misspecified ordered logit model. Our findings reveal that result control matters, although size and primary task of the organization also prove to be determinants of the use of financial management techniques. Within the context of the continuous attempts being made to improve public sector performance, policy makers should thus develop different strategies for different (individual) agencies, while relying on a strong <b>ex-post</b> result <b>control,</b> when they want to stimulate the use of financial management techniques. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{critical}} {{approach to the}} current regime of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) used by large companies to transfer personal data within the same corporate group to third countries which do not offer adequate levels of data protection. Our study focuses on the substantial and formal shortcomings that multinational companies particularly highlighted {{in connection with the}} implementation of the BCR mechanism. The analysed substantial shortcomings mainly relate to burdensome requirements set by the Working Documents issued by the Article 29 Working Party (“WP”), {{as well as to the}} problem of the binding nature of BCR when they adopt the form of unilateral declarations. The investigated formal shortcomings have to do with the complex and time consuming process to have the BCR approved at the EU/EEA level and from the relevant Data Protection Authorities (“DPAs”). Our thesis statement is that the BCR -as developed today- has proven ineffective. Multinational corporations are nowadays demanding more reliance on their own internal mechanisms of corporate governance to transfer personal data internationally within the same corporate group. Mandated accountability could have been the key in the proposed Regulation to reform the EU Data Protection Directive, combined with a stronger <b>ex-post</b> privacy <b>control</b> by the competent supervisory authorities.

40|$|The {{ascendancy}} of proportional representation as the electoral system of choice, and pervasive concerns with the demographic representativeness of parliaments, both {{testify to the}} importance that is attached to descriptive or microcosmic representation in politics, despite persistent doubts about its desirability. This paper makes three points. First, representation as representativeness presupposes the existence of stable and meaningful social or political collectivities, which can {{be reflected in the}} composition of parliament, and this condition is undermined by the general trend towards individualization, which can be observed throughout Western Europe. Second, this trend necessitates a conceptualization of political representation not as a state, but as a dynamic relationship between the citizen and the representative. This relationship can be characterized both by its direction (from below or from above), and by the moment at which popular control is exercised (before or after the representative s period in office). Third, it is argued that both growing uncertainty about citizen preferences and the transformation of political parties into para-statal agencies push towards representation from above; and that both growing unpredictability of the political agenda and European integration push towards <b>ex-post</b> popular <b>control.</b> These developments call for greater attention to mechanisms of accountability in representative democracies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{political}} support leads ultimately to upward deviations from forecasted public deficits when i) budget procedures are soft, ii) breaking promises made on higher expenditures and the lowering of taxes is costly in political terms, and iii) <b>ex-post</b> <b>control</b> by voters and political opposition is imperfect. This hypothesis is tested using a data set from Spanish municipalities {{during the period}} 1985 - 1995. Econometric estimates demonstrate that single-party majority incumbents are less prone to change forecasted budgets. While their forecasted deficits tend to be higher, they have lower actual deficits, which may be interpreted as the consequence of a higher consistency in the budgetary process. Secondly, upward deviations in deficit tend to rise in election years. While forecasted deficits are not different in election years, actual deficits are. Moreover, elections cause systematic downward deviations in revenues. On the contrary, the incumbent’s ideology is not relevant when explaining deviations in deficit.

40|$|The {{literature}} on implementation committees predominantly emphasizes their informational role and {{relies on a}} sui generis characterization of the European Union. This article reasserts their control function and locates these committees within the core tenets of rational choice and agency theory. It takes McCubbins and Page’s (1987) propositions about the determinants of legislators’ control of executive functions and applies these to the Member States’ control of the Commission’s executive powers. The likelihood of establishing <b>ex-post</b> <b>control</b> procedures and the stringency of control are positively correlated with 1) the uncertainty facing legislators about the optimum policy actions, 2) the conflict among legislators and 3) the need of unanimous agreement in the Council of Ministers. Using logistic regressions and a cumulative logic model applied to a stratified sample of non-amending secondary legislation adopted between 1987 and 1998, the article concludes that unanimity, conflict and uncertainty relevantly {{increase the likelihood of}} procedural control of the Commission’s activities.

40|$|I {{examine the}} effect of {{creditor}} control rights on borrowers’ financing policy both ex-ante and ex-post. The novelty introduced by this thesis is the use of an investor protection variable reflecting the pledgeability of a firm’s assets, both at industry and country level, alongside the contractual allocation of control rights, in understanding financial contracting and capital structure mechanics. At industry level, the empirical analysis is first motivated with a model that allows debt contracts to allocate control rights over the reorganization or liquidation decision of distressed firms and where cash flow pledgeability can vary. The model delivers two main predictions: (1) <b>Ex-post,</b> creditor <b>control</b> should be associated with an increased likelihood of resolving financial distress out of court relative to filing for bankruptcy, particularly in industries where assets are easier to collateralize; (2) Ex-ante, creditor control should be associated with an increased use of leverage, particularly in industries where assets are easier to collateralize. Empirical results provide evidence consistent with these two predictions. At country level, strong judicial effectiveness is found to alleviate {{the effect of}} the contractual enforcement of rights by creditors on financing policy. Net debt issuing activity declines sharply following a covenant violation, when creditors use their contractual acceleration and termination rights to increase interest rates or halt any further supply of credit. The decline is however found to be less pronounced in countries with stronger legal enforcement. This result is also observable for a variety of financial and investment policy measures including capital expenditures, asset growth and cash holdings, therefore highlighting the importance of strong contract enforcement in reducing financial and investment conservatism following a covenant violation and improving firm performance.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims at {{studying the}} fundamental challenges that shape {{the very essence}} of the European Merger Control System. In this respect, the core of the thesis relates to the rationale behind enacting a merger control mechanism in the European legal system and the goals that it is meant to achieve. While investigating these issues, the contribution’s recurrent theme gravitates around concepts such as legal certainty, effectiveness and welfare enhancement, principles which are acknowledged to be essential to the generic functioning and development of the European construction and, more particularly, to the appropriate operation of the competition and merger control policies. We have argued that the European Merger Control System embodies a dual purpose: attaining consumer and societal welfare. One has to go beyond assessing the anti-competitive effects that a merger might induce and investigate the different economy-wide effects that concentration transactions and policy approaches may have. Still, the Commission’s practice to date reveals no clear inclination to take societal welfare considerations into account while appraising concentration transactions, thus emphasizing certain conflicts between the goals set by the Treaties and the means used to achieve them. We have debated on which of the two possible methods of assessment, ex-ante or <b>ex-post</b> merger <b>control</b> serves the purpose of attaining consumer and societal welfare best. We concluded that the ex-ante method of control seems more appropriate for fulfilling the societal welfare goal and the <b>ex-post</b> method of <b>control</b> does better when talking about consumer welfare. In the current setup, the ex-ante method may be flawed, due to the limited capacity of grasping the future outlook of essential elements of the market dynamics, the uncertainty which surrounds the concept of standard of proof, the limited possibility of predicting corporate and competitive strategies, the use of assumptions and template test which base their findings on previous market behavioural patterns. The ex-ante method is designed to attain societal welfare; however, we may suggest that it may miss certain essential elements necessary for fulfilling the consumer welfare goal. These elements and features may be provided under an ex-post scheme. We proposed that a reconstruction of the merger control system would seem necessary. On conceptual grounds, we suggested a clear acknowledgment of the societal welfare goal in the Merger Control Regulation’s text and in the Commission’s appraisal process. We proposed a departure from the current approach of sole hard core (a priori) prevention towards a more complex construction entailing lighter ex-ante scrutiny combined with consistent ex-post monitoring. We consider that by contemplating the proposed reforms aimed at a better use of the direct effect concept, private enforcement and consistent efficiency review in an ex-post judiciary setting, the system would be more susceptible to appropriately test the attainment of its goals. Also, a proper concentration transaction follow-up procedure would alleviate the ‘legal certainty realization’ critique and the current system’s inherent prediction shortcomings would be resolved. Thus, the merger control would contribute in a more active and effective manner to the expansion of the European construction...|$|R

Certainly, public education throughout the Western world has been under attack and scrutiny for its perceived 'low standards' and the 'crisis' said to characterise it (although this crisis is, to many, a 'manufactured' one; Berliner & Biddle, 1995). Power (1994) contends that the tensions and contradictions of high modernity explain the widespread adoption of a model of 'quality assurance' based upon 'the audit', originally a financial phenomenon.

40|$|THE ISSUE The {{strengthening}} of the European Union’s fiscal rules {{with the approval of}} the so-called ‘six-pack’, and the parallel worsening of economic conditions in Europe, re-opened the debate about the relationship between fiscal discipline and growth. Influential voices have argued against the EU’s perceived obsession with fiscal discipline, which risks being self-defeating in bad times. However, EU fiscal rules are not as rigid as commonly thought, but represent a sophisticated system of surveillance and <b>ex-post</b> <b>control</b> that provides sufficient room for manoeuvre under exceptional circumstances. POLICY CHALLENGE The EU fiscal framework has come under attack more because of the timing of the application of the new rules than for substantive reasons. The framework entered into force when most euro-area countries were under the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Linked to this {{is the fact that the}} six-pack suggests that the new surveillance procedure enters into force after EU countries have corrected nominal fiscal deficits. We argue that: a) fiscal surveillance should be prioritised over enforcement of sanctions for excessive deficits; b) it is inconsistent to allow for exceptional circumstances, while not recognising up-front the role of surveillance; c) there is scope to decide that slow growth at member state level and EU levels acts as a constraint on fiscal consolidation: it should be done ex ante in a way that allows governments to use the Commission’s forecasts in their Stability Programmes, and must be decided by the Commission and not by the Council.

40|$|Currently shaping a {{large part}} of the {{development}} and humanitarian agenda the concept of resilience has been embraced by a large number of donors, development agencies, and international NGOs. As a consequence, an increasing number of development interventions that aim at strengthening the resilience of vulnerable households and communities are now being implemented across the globe. Along with these interventions, a growing and urgent call for rigorous monitoring and evaluation has emerged. Unfortunately, the very few resilience measurement frameworks that are available are often too “academics”, data-demanding, and therefore poorly adapted to the reality faced by practitioners on the ground. In this paper we develop a resilience impact assessment framework which addresses this challenge. Using an <b>ex-post</b> treatment vs. <b>control</b> approach, the framework satisfies the requirement for rigor that should be found in any proper impact assessment framework, but remains operational in the data- and resource-constrained situations which characterize most of the current interventions in the field.

40|$|We examine two {{widely used}} {{treatment}} strategies for African animal trypanosomosis in West Africa: preventive drug control ex-ante trypanosomosis infection and curative drug <b>control</b> <b>ex-post</b> trypanosomosis infection. We investigate which {{combination of these}} alternative strategies is economically optimal for cattle farmers. We apply a dynamic optimisation framework to consider both the negative externality of drug resistance development and human behaviour. We develop a bio-economic model to simulate the economic consequences of treatment strategies in a dynamic scenario {{that takes into account}} the interactions among the vector, host and livestock farmers. This model allows for the evolution of drug-resistant trypanosomes through trypanocide misuse and simulates the observed behaviours of cattle farmers based on the elicited risk and time preferences of a sample of 202 cattle farmers in Mali and Burkina Faso. The results show that the private optimal mix of treatment strategies for a risk averse and patient farmer involves preventive treatment for susceptible cattle, supported by a small number of curative treatments for infected cattle. Compared with the treatment strategies observed in the field, this optimal mix of treatment strategies would save approximately 5 % of the annual income of a livestock farmer in the study area and would reduce the prevalence of trypanosomosis. In addition, we demonstrate that a reduction in a farmer's risk aversion is associated with higher treatment rates that can avoid additional losses. By contrast, a decrease in a farmer's patience is related to lower treatment rates that thwart additional benefits. Our results suggest that individual risk and time preferences need to be considered in the development process of disease control interventions. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{increasing}} attention on culture within the school of social policy and the development in theorising the relationship between culture and welfare. However, the cultural analysis of welfare has not been sufficiently supported by empirical evidence. Within the existing research, the causal effect of culture on social policy is either abstract (historical) as the cultural foundations of welfare or nebulous as welfare attitudes which are conversely dependent upon welfare policy. This research aims to find and show the empirical evidence for the effect of culture on social policy. A critical review of prominent theoretical arguments and empirical work {{on the relationship between}} culture and welfare leads us to a conceptualisation of the cultural context for policy making with the societal values which are neither as abstract as the universal human basic values nor as concrete but situation-dependent as public opinion, and of the effect of culture on social policy as twofold: the ex-ante causal effect and the <b>ex-post</b> legitimacy <b>control</b> effect. Drawing on all three waves of European Values Study and corresponding World Values Survey data we attempt to measure the societal values within 22 OECD countries, which are comparable across time and country, equivalently obtainable both at the individual and collective levels and stable over time. Our data analysis shows that so-called welfare states vary in terms of the cultural context and this variation matter in public opinion on welfare issues and welfare policy decisions. We find that public opinion on the cause of poverty and public attitudes toward policy support for the unemployed are strongly dependent upon the levels of societal values of the corresponding society, and that the level of welfare generosity and welfare policy priorities in terms of the proportion of the welfare budget allocated to different groups and areas are partly predictable by differences in the cultural context. It is suggested that the cultural context has an influence on social policy making. We also find that mothers with {{children under the age of}} 5, whose participation in the labour market is strongly supported by family policy, are likely to refer to their traditional family values in making decisions to work. Given that their working would somehow mean their take-up of supports provided by family policy, this implies that their attitudes toward family policy are partly dependent upon their family values. It is suggested that values matter in policy attitudes which are critical not only to the legitimating support of the public for certain policies but also to the take-up/user rate of certain policy instruments. Drawing on the findings, it is suggested that culture matters in social policy not only theoretically but also empirically, that the effect of culture on welfare policy making can be found both at the before and after stages of decision making from the viewpoint seeing the whole policy process and that, more practically, better understanding of the cultural context of society and values of people would contribute to more effective policy making.

40|$|Europeanization and the {{so-called}} “democracy-deficit” {{are two of the}} major issues dividing European publics and national executives. The following analysis intends to elaborate on these two subjects as they relate to the Prüm Treaty of 2005, an agreement between Schengen member states to enhance cross-border security cooperation, which later formed the basis of a 2007 amendment to the EU’s acquis communautaire. Participating states agreed to implement data exchange capabilities and bolster cooperation of police forces. Criticism of the Prüm Treaty tends to focus on two topics: the protection of personal data and the role of national executives and parliaments {{in the course of the}} negotiation process. For this particular treaty, national executives negotiated in almost total secrecy and at a runner’s pace uncommon to the European legislation process. Thus, negotiators bypassed national parliaments and the European Parliament, the legitimate, democratically-elected actors that should have been involved in the treaty’s negotiations from the onset. This paper will detail the interactions between the different national executives and parliaments during the treaty’s negotiation process and reveal how European legislative standards were manipulated in order to secure support and democratic legitimacy. In most cases, national parliaments could only maintain the role of an <b>ex-post</b> <b>control</b> instrument; they could exert little, if any, influence on the contents of the treaty. Another popular criticism of the Prüm Treaty concerns questions regarding Europe’s differentiated integration. Because the Schengen and Prüm frameworks were developed by a minority of member states outside the EU’s institutional framework, some contend that the EU is beginning the process of fragmentation. Still others argue that this legislative flexibility is an asset for the future composition of a widened and deepened European Union. This argument will be analyzed within the context of the provisions of the Nice and Lisbon Treaties...|$|E
