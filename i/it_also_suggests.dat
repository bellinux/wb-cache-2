25|$|The {{first known}} fossil species of callichthyid is Corydoras revelatus from Salta, Argentina, {{of the late}} Paleocene. This species is {{tentatively}} placed in Corydoras, but is unambiguously {{a member of the}} subfamily Corydoradinae. It indicates that the lineages leading to the two callichthyid subfamilies occurred at least by the late Paleocene. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> an earlier differentiation of loricarioids in comparison to other catfishes, or a lack of older fossils of other Neotropical groups.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{analysis}} of Cro-Magnon fossils indicates {{that they had}} larger skulls than modern populations, and possessed a dolichocephalic (long-headed) and low cranium, with a wide face. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that some Cro-Magnons may have had brown skin. The very light skin tone found in modern Northern Europeans is a relatively recent phenomenon. It may {{have appeared in the}} European line as recently as 6 to 12 thousand years ago, indicating that Cro-Magnons had brown skin.|$|E

500|$|During 1994 and 1995, the MTO {{conducted}} {{two studies}} termed the Morningside Transportation Corridor Review.

25|$|A Greenprint for the Valleys was {{published}} in 2011, in which Wood argued for a job creation programme aimed at regenerating the former coalfield areas of the valleys. It contains initiatives including: a Green Construction Skills College; implementing an integrated transport plan for the valleys; creating a land bank for renewable energy and food production; and a programme to renovate heritage buildings. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> providing financial support for home energy efficiency measures and for setting up of green co-operatives.|$|E
25|$|CBS enzyme {{activity}} is {{not found in}} all tissues and cells. It is absent from heart, lung, testes, adrenal, and spleen in rats. In humans, {{it has been shown}} to be absent in heart muscle and primary cultures of human aortic endothelial cells. The lack of CBS in these tissues implies that these tissues are unable to synthesize cysteine and that cysteine must be supplied from extracellular sources. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that these tissues might have increased sensitivity to homocysteine toxicity because they cannot catabolize excess homocysteine via transsulfuration.|$|E
25|$|This equation, {{applicable}} for >10, {{shows the}} mean speed U {{of the jet}} at the orifice as the characteristic speed and the distance h from orifice to the edge as the characteristic dimension. The integer n represents the various vortex modes. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that dynamic similarity is achieved to a first approximation; one deviation is that the speed at the wedge, which is less than that at the orifice, should be the characteristic speed. A weak negative Reynolds number effect is likely. The orifice width d also has some influence; it is related to vortex size and lateral correlation of the shedding process.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 TfL report {{makes it}} clear that only a one-off {{reduction}} of emissions could be expected from the introduction of the charge, whilst further reductions are unlikely to be {{as a result of the}} charge. It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.|$|E
25|$|The tench (Tinca tinca), a {{significant}} food species farmed in western Eurasia in large numbers, is unusual. It {{is most often}} grouped with the Leuciscinae, but even when these were rather loosely circumscribed, it always stood apart. A cladistic analysis of DNA sequence data of the S7 ribosomal protein intron1 supports the view that it is distinct enough to constitute a monotypic subfamily. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> it may {{be closer to the}} small East Asian Aphyocypris, Hemigrammocypris, and Yaoshanicus. They would have diverged roughly at the same time from cyprinids of east-central Asia, perhaps {{as a result of the}} Alpide orogeny that vastly changed the topography of that region in the late Paleogene, when their divergence presumably occurred.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{painted and}} the painted lady have very similar lifestyles and behaviours, but the Australian painted lady {{lives in an}} arid and {{stressful}} environment. Australian painted lady colouration could be induced in painted lady butterflies by injecting the larvae with stress-inducing hormones and subjecting them to lowered temperatures. This demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity, or the tendency for visible traits to vary with changing environmental conditions, of the painted lady butterflies. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that the painted lady is the ancestral form, and environmental stress slowly drove speciation by adaptation into the Australian painted lady. In other words, the Australian painted lady most likely evolved from the painted lady due to the environmental conditions in Australia.|$|E

25|$|The Code of Hammurabi is {{the longest}} {{surviving}} text from the Old Babylonian period. The code {{has been seen as}} an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government — i.e., a primitive constitution. The code {{is also one of the}} earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.|$|E
25|$|Many Rashaida camel farmers own {{approximately}} 50 to 70 animals per household, {{of which}} 60 percent are breeding-age females. Females are bred {{for the first}} time at the age of four to five years, producing their first calves one year later. In dry years, when forage is scarce, maturity is delayed and first conception occurs at a later age. Under such circumstances the sexual activity of male animals is also depressed. This indicates that, although camel herds sustain fewer deaths during severe droughts than other types of livestock, they do suffer deferred effects, such as markedly lower calving rates in the following year. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that the low reproductive rates, which are frequently regarded as the great economic drawback of camels, are at least in part a sound and self-regulatory physiological adaptation that attunes their population sizes to fluctuating forage availability, preventing the overgrazing of resources.|$|E
25|$|His career bears {{witness to}} his rare {{appreciation}} of where real power {{lay in the}} Roman polity and also of the opportunities that prevailing circumstances were opening up for men of equestrian origins such as himself to share in that power. However, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that he also realized the likely limitations that the social co mpact still imposed on men originating from outside the charmed circle of the Senatorial Order. It would seem that, having made this analysis, he pursued the exercise of Real Power with a single-minded diligence as an equestrian. Within {{the constraints of the}} Imperial System of government, he {{seems to have been a}} highly effective statesman and administrator. It is possible that his premature death (however that came about) deprived Rome of the services of a statesman and a general who might have saved the Empire from the humiliations that were to be inflicted on it by Shapur I.|$|E
50|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review suggested that spine manipulation and therapeutic massage are effective interventions for neck pain; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggested,</b> however, that electroacupuncture, strain-counterstrain, relaxation massage, heat therapy and ultrasound therapy are not effective and thus {{not recommended for}} the treatment of neck pain.|$|R

30|$|The {{study showed}} that, with some revisions, the IDS {{can be an}} apt {{professional}} development tool through which Japanese teachers of English can improve their classroom English proficiency. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{more research is needed}} to contextualize the IDS as such a professional tool more fully.|$|R
25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the code is very specific, with each offense receiving a specified punishment. The punishments tended to be very harsh by modern standards, with many offenses resulting in death, disfigurement, {{or the use of}} the [...] "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Lex Talionis [...] "Law of Retaliation") philosophy. The code {{is also one of the}} earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. However, there is no provision for extenuating circumstances to alter the prescribed punishment.|$|E
500|$|The {{themes of}} [...] "Cry" [...] are world {{issues such as}} isolation, war, and brotherhood. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> if {{everyone}} pulls together as one, then they make a change to the world, with Jackson singing, [...] "You can change the world/I can't do it by myself". Music critic Mark Brown of Rocky Mountain News felt that Jackson cries the lyrics [...] "I can't do it by myself". The song's lyrics and themes {{are similar to the}} ones in Jackson's 1988 single [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] and his 1991 single [...] "Heal the World". [...] "Cry" [...] is composed in the key of A major and the song's time signature is common time. [...] "Cry" [...] has a moderate metronome of eighty four beats per minute. The single is built in the chord progression of A–G/A–A–A/G in the verses and [...] A–A/G–D–A in the chorus. The sheet music indicates the vocal range spans A3 to G5.|$|E
