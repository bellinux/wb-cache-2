5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable.</b> At the same time, {{he considers the}} separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues {{that this is not}} because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|With few teams, but a long history, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that intense rivalries have {{developed}} in Canadian football. Far {{and away the}} greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry {{has been with the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E

2500|$|In {{answer to}} a {{question}} from a fellow candidate during the selection of top 5 finalists, Seifert believes that in [...] "Negros Occidental the principal problem {{is that there is no}} waste segregation, it is a problem because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that we all produce waste; out of 13 cities only three of the cities right now are practicing solid waste management.

2500|$|Stephen Hawking, {{along with}} Thomas Hertog of CERN, {{proposed}} that the Universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, {{only a small fraction}} of which contributed to the conditions we see today. According to their theory, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that we find our Universe's [...] "fine-tuned" [...] physical constants, as the current Universe [...] "selects" [...] only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we find ourselves in a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{lowlands}} rainfall {{is most likely}} to occur throughout the year during the night or morning hours, and least likely in mid-afternoon. The most pronounced daily variations in rainfall occur during the summer because most summer rainfall consists of trade winds showers that most often occur at night. Winter rainfall in {{the lowlands}} is the result of storm activity, which is as likely to occur in the daytime as at night. Rainfall variability is far greater during the winter, when occasional storms contribute appreciably to rainfall totals. With such wide swings in rainfall, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that there are occasional droughts, sometimes causing economic losses. These occur when winter rains fail to produce sufficient significant rainstorms, impacting normally dry areas outside the trade winds that depend on them the most. [...] The winter of 2011-2012 produced extreme drought on the leeward sides of Moloka'i, Maui, and Island of Hawaii.|$|E

2500|$|In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a {{newspaper}} reviewer {{called it a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] and the [...] "Biggest Spectacle in History of Motion Pictures," [...] surpassing even D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation:"The photoplay and the spoken drama will be united {{for the first time}} in ... the million dollar masterpiece of Thomas H. Ince ... 'Civilization' is an encyclopedia of the emotions. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> to compare such a picture, epic in its scope, including battles and the upheaval of a nation, to a similar picture, Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation.' Ince has excelled his predecessor in the art of suggestion. In the vivid battle scenes of 'Civllization,' there are four suggestive flashes for every one Griffith gave us. The conception is classically correct. No theater could be conceived that would be adequate in space or speed of action to carry across to an audience what was conveyed in this film." ...|$|E

Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with him about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> ("No Way to Stop It").

2500|$|An {{organisation}} {{with just}} one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, {{there could be some}} duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that someone, or even a team, will take on a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as [...] "one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing". General Motors, for example, developed two in-house CAD/CAM systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used CADAM, UNIGRAPHICS, CATIA and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.|$|E

2500|$|Tommy grows {{dissatisfied}} with the Jaffes, feeling {{that they are not}} helping him. Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert), a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic/absurdist philosophy. She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of [...] "pure being." [...] Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness. In order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt. Caterine tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them furious and lost. Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, and Brad realizes that his whole ascent on the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable.</b> But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E
