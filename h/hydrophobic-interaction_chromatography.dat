40|$|Biotinylated {{derivatives}} of calmodulin (CaM) {{were prepared}} and their biological properties characterized by using enzyme assays, affinity and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Several N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin derivatives [sulphosuccinimidobiotin (sulpho-NHS) and sulphosuccinimido- 6 -(biotinamido) hexanoate (BNHS-LC) ] differing in spacer arm length {{were used to}} modify CaM. The shorter-spacer-arm CaM derivative (sulpho-CaM) activated CaM-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and CaM-dependent protein kinase II; preincubation with avidin blocked its ability to activate these enzymes. The extended-spacer-arm derivative (BNHS-LC-CaM) activated CaM-dependent enzymes both in the presence {{and in the absence}} of avidin, suggesting that the longer spacer arm diminished steric effects from avidin preincubation. Other biotinylated CaM derivatives were prepared with biotinylated tyrosine and/or histidine residues (diazobenzoylbiocytin; DBB-CaM) or nucleophilic sites (photobiotin acetate; photo-CaM). These derivatives activated CaM-dependent enzymes in the presence {{and in the absence of}} avidin. Oriented affinity columns were constructed with covalently immobilized avidin complexed to each biotinylated CaM derivative. The chromatographic profiles obtained revealed that each column interacted with a specific subset of CaM-binding proteins. Elution profiles of biotinyl CaM derivatives on phenyl-Sepharose <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> suggested that several derivatives displayed diminished binding to the matrix in the presence of Ca 2 +. Development and characterization of a series of biotinylated CaM molecules can be used to identify domains of CaM that interact with specific CaM-dependent enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Plant aspartic proteinases (APs) were {{isolated}} from several sources and studied for milk-clotting ability. Extraction of milk-clotting proteinases from intact plants is labor intensive and so, plant cell cultures {{is a viable}} alternative to obtain clotting enzymes. The aim of this work was to isolate APs from established suspension cell cultures of Centaurea calcitrapa and evaluate it's the potential interest for milk clotting. Plant cell extract was purified by ionic-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> Results suggest that the milk-clotting proteinases from cell cultures are synthesized as a 66 -kDa proenzyme which originates a 50 -kDa mature enzyme. The enzyme inhibition of 92 % by pepstatin at 10 μM proved it to be an aspartate proteinase. The clotting time for purified APs suggests that these extracts may be used in the production of dairy products of weak paste or conjugated with other commercial rennets...|$|R
40|$|An {{inducible}} acetylesterase was purified {{from the}} culture medium of Aspergillus awamori strain IFO 4033 growing on wheat-bran culture by ion-exchange, gel-filtration and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> The purified enzyme had an Mr of 31000 and contained Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The enzyme liberated acetic acid from wheat bran, hydrolysed only alpha-naphthyl acetate and propionate when aromatic esters {{were used for}} the substrate, and was tentatively classified as a carboxylic esterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 1). The gene encoding acetylesterase was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that acetylesterase was produced as a 304 -amino-acid-residue precursor, which was converted post-translationally into a 275 -amino-acid-residue mature protein. Part of the sequence of acetylesterase was similar to the region near the active-site serine of lipases of Geotrichum candidum and Candida cylindracea. A unique site of putative Asn-linked oligosaccharides was presented...|$|R
40|$|Aminopeptidase P (EC 3. 4. 11. 9) was solubilized from pig kidney {{membranes}} with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) {{and then}} purified {{by a combination}} of anion-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> Contaminating peptidase activities were removed by selective affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme was apparently homogeneous on SDS/PAGE with an Mr of 91, 000. Enzymic deglycosylation revealed that aminopeptidase P is a glycoprotein, with up to 25 % by weight of the protein being due to the presence of N-linked sugars. The phospholipase-solubilized aminopeptidase P was recognized by an antiserum to the cross-reacting determinant (CRD) characteristic of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. This recognition was abolished by mild acid treatment or deamination with HNO 2, indicating that the CRD was due exclusively to the inositol 1, 2 -cyclic phosphate ring epitope generated by the action of PI-PLC. The activity of aminopeptidase P was inhibited by chelating agents and was stimulated by Mn 2 + or Co 2 + ions, confirming the metallo-enzyme nature of this peptidase. Selective inhibitors of other aminopeptidases (actinonin, amastatin, bestatin and puromycin) had little or no inhibitory effect...|$|R

The characteristic ionic (phosphodiesters) and hydrophobic (nucleobases) properties of RNAs can be exploited for their separation. In this respect anion-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography have been successfully employed in the analysis and/or isolation of RNAs. In some cases, particularly tRNAs, chromatographic separations which rely upon multiple interactions between the solute and mobile and/or stationary phases have been highly effective. Mixed-mode chromatography involving simultaneous ionic and hydrophobic interactions, has been employed to resolve complex mixtures of tRNAs. <b>Hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> using gradients of decreasing salt concentration and weakly hydrophobic stationary phases has allowed the resolution of some tRNA mixtures {{as well as the}} analysis of modified material...|$|E
40|$|The {{monosaccharide}} D-arabinopyranose {{has only}} been found in glycoconjugates of the trypanasomatid parasites Leishmania major, Endotrypanum schaudinni and Crithidia fasciculata. The donor molecule for the relevant arabinosyltransferases {{is known to be}} GDP-alpha-D-Arap in L. major and C. fasciculata, and the latter organism is being used to study the biosynthesis of GDP-alpha-D-Arap. In this study, we describe the structure of the terminal product of arabinose metabolism in C. fasciculata, namely lipoarabinogalactan. This molecule was purified by <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> and studied by a variety of techniques, including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, electrospray mass spectrometry and chemical and enzymic digestions. These data show that lipoarabinogalactan contains a previously described D-arabino-D-galactan polysaccharide component covalently attached to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol type of membrane anchor that is similar to, but not identical with, that found in the lipophosphoglycans of the Leishmania...|$|E
40|$|Chitosan-degrading {{activities}} {{induced by}} glucosamine (GlcN) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) {{were found in}} a culture filtrate of Trichoderma reesei PC- 3 - 7. One of the chitosan-degrading enzymes was purified to homogeneity by precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by anion-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> The enzyme was monomeric, and its molecular mass was 93 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were 4. 0 and 50 °C, respectively. The activity was stable in the pH range 6. 0 to 9. 0 and at a temperature below 50 °C. Reaction product analysis from the viscosimetric assay and thin-layer chromatography and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy clearly indicated that the enzyme was an exo-type chitosanase, exo-β-d-glucosaminidase, that releases GlcN from the nonreducing end of the chitosan chain. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy also showed that the exo-β-d-glucosaminidase produced a β-form of GlcN, demonstrating that the enzyme is a retaining glycanase. Time-dependent liberation of the reducing sugar from partially acetylated chitosan with exo-β-d-glucosaminidase and the partially purified exo-β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase from T. reesei PC- 3 - 7 suggested that the exo-β-d-glucosaminidase cleaves the glycosidic link of either GlcN-β(1 → 4) -GlcN or GlcN-β(1 → 4) -GlcNAc...|$|R
40|$|Adherence of the {{opportunistic}} fungus Aspergillus fumigatus to the {{extracellular matrix}} components {{is considered a}} crucial step {{in the establishment of}} the infection. Given the high carbohydrate content of these glycoproteins and the role of carbohydrate-protein interactions in numerous adherence processes, the presence of a lectin in A. fumigatus was investigated. Different fungal extracts obtained by sonication or grinding in liquid nitrogen from resting or swollen conidia, as well as from germ tubes and mycelium, were tested by hemagglutination assays using rabbit erythrocytes. A lectin activity was recovered in all the extracts tested. However, sonication of resting conidia resulted in the highest specific activity. Purification of the lectin was achieved by gel filtration followed by ion-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> Analysis of the purified lectin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, which {{is similar to that of}} the alkaline protease already identified from different strains of A. fumigatus. However, as evidenced by the use of an alkaline protease-deficient mutant, the two activities were supported by distinct proteins. In addition, hemagglutination inhibition experiments using different saccharides and glycoproteins demonstrated the specificity of the lectin for sialic acid residues. Together these results suggest that this lectin may contribute to the attachment of conidia to the extracellular matrix components through the recognition of the numerous terminal sialic acid residues of their carbohydrate chains...|$|R

It was induced only in the presence of Avicel, hydroxyethylcellulose, and xylan. The addition of the nonionic detergent Tween 80 to the culture medium containing Avicel as the carbon source led to a 10 -fold increase in extracellular proteolytic activity. The protease, which has an isoelectric point of 3. 9, was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate by a combination of anion-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies</b> and was characterized biochemically. The enzyme hydrolyzed gelatin and the chromogenic substrates Azocoll, Azocasein, and Azoalbumin. Its highest activity was determined between pH 7. 0 and 7. 7 and at 55 °C. The proteolytic activity was inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline and EDTA; however, no metal ions were detected {{to be associated with the}} protein. The protease was stable in the presence of 1 M urea and 0. 01 M sodium dodecyl sulfate. The inhibitory effect of alpha- 2 -macroglobulin indicated an endo-mode of proteolytic cleavage. Studies with lectins and sugar analysis by mass spectroscopy indicated that the cellulase (Avicelase) Cel- 1 was neither N nor O glycosylated. Its processing by the protease occurred at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 °C, pH 7. 5, in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol...|$|R

40|$|Ca 2 +-dependent <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> is a {{powerful}} tool for the identification and isolation of a variety of Ca 2 +-binding proteins which expose a hydrophobic site(s) in the presence of Ca 2 + [Gopalakrishna & Anderson (1982) Biochem.

Using this approach, we isolated two potent and specific protein inhibitors of protein kinase C, of 17 kDa [McDonald & Walsh (1985) Biochem. J. 232, 559 - 567] and 12 kDa [McDonald & Walsh (1986) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 14, 585 - 586]. Although these inhibitors were purified by Ca 2 +-dependent <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> and exhibit properties similar to those of calmodulin and related Ca 2 +-binding proteins, we were unable to demonstrate high-affinity Ca 2 + binding to these inhibitors, using equilibrium dialysis. Protein kinase C exhibited half-maximal activity at 0. 6 microM-Ca 2 + in the presence of phospholipid and diacylglycerol, and complete inhibition by both inhibitors was observed over the range of Ca 2 + concentrations examined (10 nM- 10 microM). These observations suggest that the inhibitory action of these proteins does not require Ca 2 +. The inclusion of proteinase inhibitors during isolation of the kinase C inhibitors, as well as two-dimensional peptide mapping and amino acid analysis of the isolated proteins, suggested that the 12 kDa inhibitor is a proteolytic fragment of the 17 kDa protein which is generated during purification. Antibodies raised in rabbits against the bovine brain 17 kDa inhibitor were shown to be specific by Western immunoblotting and the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and were used to study the tissue and species distribution of this protein. The inhibitor was found to be present in several bovine, murine, avian and human tissues, consistent with a role in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions involving the widely distributed protein kinase C...|$|E

The enterocin, E- 760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E- 760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide {{was found to be}} sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 °C and was stable at pH values between 5. 0 and 8. 7. However, activity was lost below pH 3. 0 and above pH 9. 5. Administration of enterocin E- 760 -treated feed significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log 10 CFU.

This purified glucosidase consisted of two same subunits and had Mr of 230 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and gel-permeation chromatography. Maximal β-D-glucosidase activity occurred at 70 ℃ and pH 5. 6. At pH 5. 6 and 50 ℃ the Km for p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was 0. 338 mM and it had a Vmax of 0. 25 mmol nitrophenol/min/mg glucosidase.

The resultant column-purified myosin exhibits properties {{similar to those of}} the non-purified myosin, e. g. actin activation of the Mg 2 +-ATPase requires Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the two 20 kDa light chains. However, unlike the non-purified myosin, the column-purified myosin undergoes a time-dependent transition to a form which no longer requires phosphorylation for actin activation of the myosin Mg 2 +-ATPase. This transition is identified as a time-dependent change in conformation of the column-purified myosin from a 10 S to 6 S form and is caused by slow oxidation of the column-purified myosin, since it could be prevented by storage under N 2 and reversed by 5 mM-dithiothreitol...|$|E

We have purified the alternative oxidase from mitochondria of the thermogenic spadix of Sauromatum guttatum and have identified its polypeptide constituents by using polyclonal antibodies. A 166 -fold purification was achieved through a combination of cation-exchange (carboxymethyl-Sepharose) and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> (phenyl-Sepharose) <b>chromatography.</b> Polyclonal antibodies raised to the CM-Sepharose fractions readily immunoprecipitated alternative oxidase activity and immunoprecipitated four of the proteins that copurify with the activity.

Polyclonal antibodies raised individually to the 37 -, 36 -, and 35. 5 - plus 35 -kDa proteins cross-reacted with all of these proteins, indicating the presence of common antigenic sites. The 37 -kDa protein appears to be constitutive in Sauromatum, whereas expression of the 36 - and 35 -kDa proteins was correlated with presence of alternative pathway activity. The 35. 5 -kDa protein appears with loss of alternative pathway activity during senescence, indicating that this protein may be a degradation product of the 36 -kDa protein.

Activity is optimal at pH 9 and at 60 °C the Km for arginine is 3. 4 mM and Ki(ornithine) is 0. 55 mM. Incubation in 0. 1 M Mops/NaOH buffer (pH 7) causes rapid inactivation at 60 °C (t 1 / 2 (half life) = 4. 5 min) and individually 0. 1 mM Mn²⁺ or 1 mg/ml BSA (bovine serum albumin) increase the t 1 / 2 of arginase activity 4 -fold, but combined they produce > 1000 -fold increase and a t 1 / 2 = 105 min at 95 °C. Aspartic acid and other species that bind Mn²⁺ can replace BSA, and {{it is suggested that}} arginase can be activated by free Mn²⁺.

Three peaks of MLGase activity, designated Mlg 1 a, Mlg 1 b, and Mlg 2, were resolved by cation-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> (HPLC). Mlg 1 a and Mlg 1 b also hydrolyze β 1, 3 -glucan (laminarin), whereas Mlg 2 does not degrade β 1, 3 -glucan but does degrade β 1, 4 -glucan to a slight extent. Mlg 1 a, Mlg 1 b, and Mlg 2 have monomer molecular masses of 33. 5, 31, and 29. 5 kDa, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of Mlg 1 a and Mlg 1 b are identical (AAYNLI). Mlg 1 a is glycosylated, whereas Mlg 1 b is not. The gene encoding Mlg 1 b, MLG 1, was isolated by using PCR primers based on amino acid sequences of Mlg 1 b. The product of MLG 1 has no close similarity to any known protein but does contain a motif (EIDI) that occurs at the active site of MLGases from several prokaryotes. An internal fragment of MLG 1 was used to create mlg 1 mutants by transformation-mediated gene disruption. The total MLGase and β 1, 3 -glucanase activities in culture filtrates of the mutants were reduced by approximately 50 and 40 %, respectively. When analyzed by cation-exchange HPLC, the mutants were missing the two peaks of MLGase activity corresponding to Mlg 1 a and Mlg 1 b. Together, the data indicate that Mlg 1 a and Mlg 1 b are products of the same gene, MLG 1. The growth of mlg 1 mutants in culture medium supplemented with macerated maize cell walls or maize bran and the disease symptoms on maize were identical to the growth and disease symptoms of the wild type...|$|R
40|$|The nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) are a fastidious {{group of}} {{bacteria}} first {{recognized in the}} early 1960 s in the blood cultures of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis. Since that time, the NVS have been implicated in 5 to 6 % of all cases of human bacterial endocarditis. The NVS possess membrane-associated amphipathic molecules different from those described for other streptococci. Unitl recently, chemical characterization of these new amphipathic polymers was hampered by unsuccessful attempts at isolating large quantities of these molecules in a form free from other bacterial components. Presently, stationary-phase-culture supernatants provide an optimum source of crude material for amphiphile purification procedures. <b>Hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> in conjunction with immunoaffinity chromatography yields an NVS serotype I amphiphile preparation free of contaminants, as determined by immunoelectrophoretic and chemical analyses. Tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis of the purified extracellular NVS amphiphile demonstrated that it is immunologically similar to the intracellular amphiphile. Finally, this amphiphile serves as the NVS serotype I antigen...|$|E
40|$|The ATP synthase complex, {{designated}} F 1 F 0, of Escherichia coli {{is composed}} of a water-soluble portion (F 1; membrane-associated ATPase, EC 3. 6. 1. 3) with ATP-hydrolyzing activity and a membrane-integrated part (F 0) with H+-translocating activity. F 0 is built up from three kinds of subunits (a, b, and c). We have isolated the F 0 portion directly from membranes of an E. coli strain (KY 7485) that overproduces the enzyme several fold. Subunit b was extracted from purified F 0 by two methods. One method included prolonged incubation of the F 0 complex {{in the presence of}} trichloroacetate (2. 5 M) and the separation of subunit b and an a-c complex by gel filtration. Alternatively, subunit b was extracted by deoxycholate and separated from the a-c complex by <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Integrated into liposomes, the a-c complex exhibited neither H+ uptake nor binding of F 1. However, a functional F 0 complex was reconstituted by adding stoichiometric amounts of subunit b to the a-c complex...|$|E
40|$|UDP-glucose {{dehydrogenase}} {{is responsible}} for channelling UDP-glucose into the pool of UDP-sugars utilized in the synthesis of wall matrix polysaccharides and glycoproteins. It has been purified to homogeneity from suspension-cultured cells of French bean {{by a combination of}} <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography,</b> gel filtration and dye-ligand chromatography. The enzyme had a subunit of Mr 40, 000. Km values were measured for UDP-glucose as 5. 5 +/- 1. 4 mM and for NAD+ as 20 +/- 3 microM. It was subject to inhibition by UDP-xylose. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity co-purified with alcohol dehydrogenase activity from suspension-cultured cells, elicitor-treated cells and elongating hypocotyls, even when many additional chromatographic steps were employed subsequently. The protein from each source was resolved into virtually identical patterns of isoforms on two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/PAGE. However, a combination of peptide mapping and sequence analysis, gel analysis using activity staining and kinetic analysis suggests that both activities are a function of the same protein. An antibody was raised and used to immunolocalize UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to developing xylem and phloem of French bean hypocotyl. Together with data published previously, these results are consistent with {{an important role in the}} regulation of carbon flux into wall matrix polysaccharides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{biological}} fluids IGF-I and IGF-II {{are bound}} to specific, high-affinity binding protein (BPs). Two human BPs have been isolated, one from serum, which is GH-dependent, the other from amniotic fluid (AF BP), and their cDNAs have recently been cloned. We report here the isolation of another, new species from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where this BP predominates. The protein was purified to homogeneity by a four-step procedure: gel filtration, chromatofocusing, <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> and reverse-phase chromatography. Thereafter, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave an Mr of 34 000 (non-reduced), chromatofocusing gave an isoelectric point of 5. 0, and its affinity for IGF-II (3 × 1010 M− 1) was 10 times that for IGF-I. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 15 residues determined in a BP preparation from the CSF of children was Leu-Ala-Pro-Gly-(/) -Gly-Gln-Gly-Val-Gln-Ala-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly. A similar sequence was found for adult CSF, apart from residues 12 and 13 (-Leu-Leu-). These are highly analogous with the sequences starting from residue 69 of the GH-dependent BP, and from residue 61 of the AF BP. The new BP isolated is therefore related to, but distinct from, the other human BPs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fractionation and {{characterization}} of gonadotropins (GtH) from Fundulus heteroclitus pituitary extracts {{were carried out}} using a biocompatible liquid chromatographic procedure (Pharmacia FPLC system). Chromatographic fractions were monitored for gonadotropic activities (induction of oocyte maturation and steroid production) using homologous follicle bioassays in vitro. Size-exclusion chromatography eluted gonadotropic activity in one major protein peak (M r ~ 30, 000). Anion-exchange and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography</b> (HIC) yielded two distinct peaks of 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) - and 17 alpha-hydroxy, 20 beta-dihydroprogesterone (DHP) -promoting activity with associated oocyte maturation. Two-dimensional chromatography (chromatofocusing followed by HIC) resolved pituitary extracts into two active fractions; both induced E 2 synthesis, but one was relatively poor in eliciting DHP and testosterone production. Thus, using homologous bioassays, at least two quantitatively different gonadotropic (steroidogenic) activities: an E 2 -promoting gonadotropin (GtH I-like) and a DHP-promoting gonadotropin (GtH II-like), which has a lower isoelectric point but greater hydrophobicity than the former, can be distinguished from F. heteroclitus pituitaries {{by a variety of}} chromatographic procedures.

40|$|Enzymatic {{digestion}} {{in vitro}} of the Bacillus thuringiensis protoxin presumably releases and activates the toxin {{in a manner}} analogous to that which occurs when a B. thuringiensis sporulated fermentation preparation passes through the midgut of a lepidopteran larva. Therefore, a sporulated culture of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (serotype 3 a 3 b) HD- 263 was treated with trypsin to release an activated toxin soluble in bicarbonate buffer. A 63 -kilodalton protein, toxic to cabbage looper larvae (Trichoplusia ni) and to lepidopteran cells in culture, was purified to homogeneity from this trypsin digest. The larvicide, a glycoprotein containing 5 % carbohydrate (wt/wt), was purified from the soluble B. thuringiensis trypsin digest by using ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography, and <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Its amino acid composition was high in nonpolar residues and unusually low in lysine and histidine. The isoelectric point was 6. 5, and the amino acid on the N terminus was identified as isoleucine. The toxin was only slightly soluble in aqueous buffers unless the chaotropic agent potassium thiocyanate was added. Partial characterization of the toxin indicated that it corresponds well with reported sequences deduced from cloned genes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physicochemical forces involving the adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes to surfaces. A total of 22 strains of L. monocytogenes were compared for relative surface hydrophobicity with the salt aggregation test. Cell surface charges and hydrophobicity of L. monocytogenes Scott A were also determined by electrophoretic mobility, <b>hydrophobic-interaction</b> <b>chromatography,</b> and contact angle measurements. Electrokinetic measurements indicated that the strain Scott A has a negative electrophoretic mobility. Physicochemical characterization of L. monocytogenes by various methods indicates that this microorganism is hydrophilic. All L. monocytogenes strains tested with the salt aggregation test method aggregated a at very high ammonium sulfate molarities. The hydrophobicity-interaction chromatography results show that L. monocytogenes Scott A cells do not adhere to octyl-Sepharose unless the pH is low. Results from contact angle measurements showed that the surface free energy of strain Scott A was 65. 9 mJ. m- 2, classifying this microorganism as a hydrophilic bacterium. In addition, the interfacial free energy of adhesion of L. monocytogenes Scott A estimated for polypropylene and rubber was lower than that for glass and stainless steel. However, these theoretical implications could not be correlated with the attachment capabilities of L. monocytogenes...|$|E
