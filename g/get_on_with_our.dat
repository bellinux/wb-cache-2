You {{are suffering from}} {{a little too much}} imagination, I am afraid. It is really quite a good fault.

[...] "If you would permit me to offer you just a word of advice, it really doesn't pay to annoy these Chinese too much. They never forget. I didn't like the way that fellow was looking at you.

5000|$|Nunatak {{played the}} Live Earth Antarctica concert on July 7, 2007, to a [...] "sell out" [...] crowd of seventeen, the entire {{population}} of the Rothera Research Station. Their participation fulfilled the event's promise to hold a concert on all seven continents. Lead singer Matt Balmer, 22, said of the event that the band [...] "expected to spend our Antarctic winter here at Rothera quietly <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> work and maybe performing at the occasional Saturday night party. We could never have imagined taking part in a global concert." ...|$|R

[It is a happy situation when creative intelligence is situated in the person of a good and decent man. ] But conferences also offer opportunities and incentives (and deadlines) for <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> common work. In my view, the best way to honor Mayer Zald is to attempt to push forward intellectual projects in which he has played a leading role. A quick preview. In my reading of the record, Zal has been instrumental in providing a bridge between the fields of organizations and social movements. As a student of Charles Perrow (and thus being influenced indirectly by Philip Selznick) Zald was able to introduce important organizational concepts and arguments into the analysis of social movements. The traditional field of collective behavior was reconfigured into an arena of social movemen...|$|R

Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|R

"Look 'ee here, lad," [...] said Trench, {{stopping}} suddenly, {{with his}} legs planted firmly apart as though on the quarter-deck of his ship in a cross sea, while he drove his right fist into {{the palm of his}} left hand argumentatively.

No mystery, Valeria, in that claret--I'll take my oath it's nothing but innocent juice of the grape. If we can't believe in anything else, let's believe in juice of the grape. Your good health, my dear." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So that is {{one thing}} off the poor girl's mind," [...] Miss Cornelia told Anne, [...] "and off mine too. Now, if Dick gets well enough to work again he'll be able to earn enough to pay the {{interest}} on it; and if he doesn't I know Captain Jim'll manage someway that Leslie won't have to. He said as much to me. 'I'm getting old, Cornelia,' he said, 'and I've no chick or child of my own. Leslie won't take a gift from a living man, but mebbe she will from a dead one.' So {{it will be all}} right as far as THAT goes. I wish everything else might be settled as satisfactorily. As for that wretch of a Dick, he's been awful these last few days. The devil was in him, believe ME! Leslie and I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> work for the tricks he'd play. He chased all her ducks one day around the yard till most of them died. And not one thing would he do for us. Sometimes, you know, he'll make himself quite handy, bringing in pails of water and wood. But this week if we sent him to the well he'd try to climb down into it. I thought once, 'If you'd only shoot down there head-first everything would be nicely settled.'" ...|$|E

No doubt they {{had plenty of}} wild 'uns--them as they giv'd names to--but they hadn't a good little tame 'un like you, Cuff; no, nor nobody else, for you're the best dog in the world--if you'd only keep yer spanker-boom quiet; but you'll shake it off, you will, {{if you go on}} like that. There, lie down, an' let's <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> consultation. Well, as I was sayin' when you {{interrupted}} me, wot a happy life we could live here if we'd only got the old girl with us! I'd be king, you know, Cuff, and she'd be queen, and we'd make you prime minister--you're prime favourite already, you know. There now, if you don't clap a stopper on that ere spanker-boom, I'll have to lash it down. Well, to proceed: we'd build a hut--or a palace-- of turf an' sticks, with a bunk alongside for you; an w'en our clo'se began for to wear out, we'd make pants and jackets and petticoats of cocoanut-fibre; for you must know I've often see'd mats made o' that stuff, an' splendid wear there's in it too, though it would be rather rough for the skin at first; but we'd get used to that in coorse o' time. Only fancy Mrs Jarwin in a cocoanut-fibre petticoat with a palm-leaf hat, or somethink o' that sort! An', after all, it wouldn't be half so rediklous as some o' the canvas she's used to spread on Sundays." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{interrupted}} {{himself for}} a comment. “I am something like that myself. I believe it’s a purely professional feeling. Carry one’s point whatever it is. Normally I couldn’t kill a fly. My sensibility is too acute for that. My heart is too tender also. Much too tender. I am a Republican. I am a Red. As to all our present masters and governors, all those people {{you are trying to}} turn round your little finger, they are all horrible Royalists in disguise. They are plotting the ruin of all the institutions to which I am devoted. But I have never tried to spoil your little game, Rita. After all, it’s but a little game. You know very well that two or three fearless articles, something in my style, you know, would soon put a stop to all that underhand backing of your king. I am calling him king because I want to be polite to you. He is an adventurer, a blood-thirsty, murderous adventurer, for me, and nothing else. Look here, my dear child, what are you knocking yourself about for? For the sake of that bandit? Allons donc! A pupil of Henry Allègre can have no illusions of that sort about any man. And such a pupil, too! Ah, the good old days in the Pavilion! Don’t think I claim any particular intimacy. It was just enough to enable me to offer my services to you, Rita, when our poor friend died. I found myself handy and so I came. It so happened that I was the first. You remember, Rita? What made it possible for everybody to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> poor dear Allègre was his complete, equable, and impartial contempt for all mankind. There is nothing in that against the purest democratic principles; but that you, Rita, should elect to throw so much of your life away {{for the sake of a}} Royal adventurer, it really knocks me over. For you don’t love him. You never loved him, you know.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The Trust {{differs from}} other {{charities}} {{in the field}} in that its ethos is rigidly ‘patient perspective’ so that all issues can be faced with empathy and from the point of direct personal experience of the virus.
