40|$|A split-frequency {{harmonic}} {{balance method}} (SF-HBM) is developed to obtain subharmonic responses of a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom oscillator driven by periodic excitation. This method {{is capable of}} generating highly accurate periodic solutions involving {{a large number of}} solution harmonics. Responses at the excitation period, or corresponding multiples (such as period 2 and period 3), can be readily obtained with this method, either in isolation or as combinations. To achieve this, the oscillator equation error is first expressed in terms of two Mickens functions, where the assumed Fourier series solution is split into two groups, nominally associated with low-frequency or <b>high-frequency</b> <b>harmonics.</b> The number of low-frequency harmonics remains small compared to the number of <b>high-frequency</b> <b>harmonics.</b> By exploiting a convergence property of the equation-error functions, accurate low-frequency harmonics can be obtained in a new iterative scheme using a conventional harmonic balance method, in a separate step from obtaining the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>harmonics.</b> The algebraic equations (needed in the HBM part of the method) are generated wholly numerically via a fast Fourier transform, using a discrete-time formulation to include inexpansible nonlinearities. A nonlinear forced-response stability analysis is adapted for use with solutions obtained with this SF-HBM. Period- 3 subharmonic responses are obtained for an oscillator with power-law nonlinear stiffness. The paper shows that for this type of oscillator, two qualitatively different period- 3 subharmonic response branches can be obtained across a broad frequency range.
