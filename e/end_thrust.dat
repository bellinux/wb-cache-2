Based on the nonlinear elasticity theory of a deformable continuous body undergoing large deformation and the linearized incremental theory for a superimposed infinitesimal deformation, an efficient approach for buckling analysis is developed {{and applied to}} the cylinder subjected {{to a combination of}} axial <b>end</b> <b>thrust</b> and internal/external pressure. It is based on the state-space formalism, which naturally avoids the derivatives of instantaneous material constants, enabling a convenient and accurate numerical implementation. Along with the layerwise method, an analytical characteristic equation (i. e. the bifurcation criterion) governing the general asymmetric buckling of the cylinder is derived. Detailed parametric studies are then carried out for a pressurized soft functionally graded hollow cylinder using an incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material model. The effects of material gradient on bifurcation induced either by <b>end</b> <b>thrust</b> or external pressure are discussed through numerical examples. Not only does this study provide an efficient tool for buckling analysis of soft cylinders, some findings that are unique to a functionally graded material are also highlighted.

The beam-column is of variable cross-section and the variation of sectional properties along {{the axis of}} the beam-column is deterministic.

The foundation stiffness coefficient of the Winkler model, the stiffnesses of discrete elastic supports, stiffnesses of end springs and the <b>end</b> <b>thrust,</b> are all considered as random parameters. The material property fluctuations and distributed axial loadings are considered to constitute independent, one-dimension uni-variate homogeneous real stochastic fields in space.

Static response, free vibration and stability behaviour of the beam-column are studied. Hamilton's principle is used to formulate the problem using stochastic FEM.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three reluctance {{machines with}} flux assistance. These machines provide alternative novel geometries that provide high efficiencies with {{a reduction in}} the ampere turns in the armature windings for torque production, lowering armature winding switching losses and reducing the power electronic rating. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a switched reluctance variant of the homopolar inductor alternator topology. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a simplification of the Dual Stack machine. Both machines use a toroidal field winding to provide additional flux. The methods of connecting armature coils on each stator pole to utilise the armature flux and the choice of power electronic circuitry are important. Testing shows that such machines favour unipolar excitation with single coil per pole for the armature windings. Use of the field winding in series with the armature windings improves torque production. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine can have the mechanical angular displacement between the two stator stacks varied to provide an improved back emf waveshape for smoother torque production. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine has parasitic and axial air gaps that pose interesting design issues (e. g. <b>end</b> <b>thrust).</b> Magnets can be placed in steel sections where flux is unidirectional. An ideal candidate for magnet insertion is the Flux Switching Motor. A Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor has been built that replaces the field windings with ferrite magnets. The Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor achieves efficiencies of over 80 %. It adds no additional cost to the fan application as cost savings in lower temperature rated thermoplastics offsets the cost of magnets. A prototyping circuit incorporating a novel micro-processor program to alter the commutation timings as the machine operates has been designed to allow fast optimisation of each machine for minimum input power. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparently}} different {{physical problems}} of lateral vibration and elastic stability are limiting cases {{of a single}} phenomenon, the most general expression being the mode of vibration with <b>end</b> <b>thrust.</b> The theory of straight beams and flat plates is discussed in detail, and it is shown that {{the square of the}} frequency of lateral vibration is approximately linearly related to the end load. The linear relationship is exact if the mode of free vibrations is identical to the buckling mode. In all cases, the load corresponding to zero frequency is the critical buckling load. The analysis is valid only if the boundary conditions do not change with load. Experimental tests were conducted on elastically restrained columns in the form of rigid rectangular frames. It is found that the relationship between the square of the frequency and the load is practically linear, and that the extrapolated load corresponding to zero frequency coincides with the buckling load. Determining the critical load by frequency measurements seems to have the advantage of predicting that load corresponding to the actual boundary conditions which prevail, whereas a theoretical calculation may unjustifiably assume certain conditions which are not exactly realized. In the case of flat plates, tests showed that the linear relationship is not achieved in practice. It is shown that this is probably {{due to the fact that}} the linear plate equations are not valid due to initial curvatures in the plate. Rigid-joint trusses were also tested. Due to the change of end restraint with load, in some cases the relationship between the square of the frequency and the load deviates considerably from linearity. The amount of deviation appears to depend on the section properties of the members of the truss...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrodynamic}} (ED) Tether {{is a long}} thin conductive string deployed from a spacecraft. A part of the ED tether {{near one}} end is rendered positive {{with respect to the}} ambient plasma. This positive potential is maintained by the motion-induced Electromotive Force (EMF) or by the power supply, depending on the application of the ED tether. Some part of the positively biased tether is uninsulated and exposed to the ambient plasma, collecting ionospheric electrons. Collected electrons are driven as a current inside the tether and emitted from the other end. The current interacts with the geomagnetic field and produces Lorentz force (forward or backward). Drag force is obtained by deploying the tether upwards and collecting electrons through the part near the top <b>end.</b> <b>Thrust</b> is instead obtained by deploying downwards, applying a power supply to reverse the current and collecting electrons at the bottom end. An ED tether travels in LEO under mesothermal conditions, meaning that the electron thermal velocity is much faster than the tether's orbital speed whereas the ion thermal velocity is much slower. In the frame of reference moving with the tether, ions approach the tether at hypersonic speed, get deflected by the very large positive potential on the tether and create a wake behind it. Due to the asymmetry of the plasma distribution, the conventional probe theory becomes almost inapplicable. The asymmetric and non-stable plasma conditions entail the necessity of computational work for the prediction of current collection. A numerical code using a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method is developed to calculate the electron current collection to a positively charged electrodynamic bare tether. (cont.) In order to improve the quantitative accuracy, a new treatment of boundary condition, which utilizes the quasi-neutrality condition of plasma, has been introduced. This condition has been tested and shown elsewhere to give a good quantitative approximation to a current collection calculation to a cylindrical probe in a quiescent unmagnetized plasma. In this thesis, the flowing and magnetic effects as seen in the actual plasma environment are incorporated. Calculations for a list of cases with different plasma parameters are performed and compiled so as to provide the pre-flight prediction of the NASA space experiment called ProSEDS, which is planned to be launched Fall 2002. There is an existing theory called the Orbital-Motion-Limit (OML) theory, which gives the upper limit of the current collection in steady state. The results show that the current collection is higher in some cases than the 2 D OML current by a factor of 2 - 3. We discuss the applicability of the 3 D OML theory, which gives a higher limit, to the geometrically 2 D problem. The justification is given by the detailed examination of individual particle trajectories. by Tatsuo Onishi. Thesis (Ph. D.)
