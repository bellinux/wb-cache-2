40|$|A {{focus on}} equity in health {{can be seen}} in many global {{development}} goals and reports, research and international declarations. With the development of a relevant framework and methods, the Campbell and Cochrane <b>Equity</b> <b>Methods</b> <b>Group</b> has encouraged the application of an 'equity lens' to systematic reviews, and many organizations publish reviews intended to address health equity. The purpose of the Evidence for Equity (E 4 E) project was to conduct a priority-setting exercise and apply an equity lens by developing a knowledge translation product comprising summaries of systematic reviews from the Cochrane Library. E 4 E translates evidence from systematic reviews into 'friendly front end' summaries for policy makers.; The following topic areas with high burdens of disease globally, were selected for the pilot: diabetes/obesity, HIV/AIDS, malaria, nutrition, and mental health/depression. For each topic area, a "stakeholder panel" was assembled that included policymakers and researchers. A systematic search of Cochrane reviews was conducted for each area to identify equity-relevant interventions with a meaningful impact. Panel chairs developed a rating sheet which was used by all panels to rank the importance of these interventions by: 1) Ease of Implementation; 2) Health System Requirements; 3) Universality/Generalizability/Share of Burden; and 4) Impact on Inequities/Effect on equity. The ratings of panel members were averaged for each intervention and criterion, and interventions were ordered according to the average overall ratings.; Stakeholder panels identified the top 10 interventions from their respective topic areas. The evidence on these interventions is being summarized with an equity focus and the results posted online, at [URL].; This method provides an explicit approach to setting priorities by systematic review groups and funders for providing decision makers with evidence for the most important equity-relevant interventions...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{decision}} {{usefulness of the}} <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> of accounting from two perspectives. First, I examine the value relevance of information provided under the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> relative to the value relevance of information resulting from measuring investments in affiliates at fair value. For a sample of 221 U. S. investors with publicly-traded affiliates during 1993 - 2011, I find that balance sheet measures of investments in publicly-traded affiliates provided under the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> are associated with investors' stock prices, but income from these affiliates recognized under the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> is not associated with investors' stock prices. In addition, fair value balance sheet and income measures of investments in publicly-traded affiliates are incrementally associated with investors' stock prices after controlling for information provided under the <b>equity</b> <b>method.</b> The incremental value relevance of fair value measures for investments in publicly-traded affiliates exists for both investments identified as held for sale and those identified as strategic, with {{no evidence that the}} incremental value relevance is higher (lower) for investments identified as held for sale (strategic). This result suggests that the 2010 and 2013 proposals by the U. S. Financial Accounting Standards Board to distinguish between investments in affiliates based on management's intended method of value realization are not supported by differences in the relative value relevance of fair value measures for these types of investments. Second, I evaluate whether <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> investors use their significant influence to manage income reported under the <b>equity</b> <b>method.</b> For a sample of 202 U. S. firms from 1993 - 2011, I find that signed discretionary accruals of affiliates are higher when income from affiliates allows investors to meet earnings targets. This result is consistent with <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> investors influencing the financial reporting of affiliates to achieve earnings targets. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} type of jointly controlled entity influences the management choice to report interests {{in this kind of}} joint venture using the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> or proportionate consolidation. We address this gap in the accounting choice literature by exploiting the UK setting where, due to the transition to IFRS, firms had to change their reporting method for interests in jointly controlled entities from the gross <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> to a similar approach (<b>equity</b> <b>method)</b> or to proportionate consolidation. We support our analysis on the classification of jointly controlled entities proposed by Hennart (1988). We hypothesize that venturers are more likely to change their reporting method to proportionate consolidation when the majority of their jointly controlled entities are cases of Link instead of Scale cooperation. After controlling for several variables, our results are consistent with the predictions and thus suggest that {{the type of}} jointly controlled entity {{plays an important role in}} the management decision to report interests in jointly controlled entities using the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> or proportionate consolidation. However, the results also provide empirical evidence supporting the importance of debt covenant costs and monitoring costs in the choice between alternative reporting methods. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to observe the Accounting convergence in the reporting for interests in joint controlled entities (JCEs) using the <b>Equity</b> <b>method</b> or the Proportionate consolidation and to explore the determinants that could explain the application of each accounting option. Assuming that the <b>Equity</b> <b>method</b> improves some key performance indicators, firstly we measure the accounting convergence using the van der Tas H index. Secondly, we observe the distribution of both the accounting choices for JCEs and the P/E ratios – as a measure of the firm’s investors reputation – in order to capture if the market rewards firms using the <b>Equity</b> <b>method.</b> Finally, we conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to capture the existence of latent variables able to explicate the different accounting choices. The data source is the Italian listed companies consolidated financial statements for the period 2006 - 2010 holding JCEs. First remarks show that there is a lack of convergence in the accounting for JCEs. Further, the market seems not to reward companies applying the <b>Equity</b> <b>method.</b> However, the PCA reveals the existence of latent variables that could explain the choice of the reporting method used by the firms of our sample...|$|R
40|$|We examine to {{what extent}} firms adhere to the stated intent of noncompulsory {{accounting}} standards when reporting for intercorporate investments. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Norway strongly recommend that a 20 – 50 % intercorporate investment is {{accounted for by the}} <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> rather than the cost method, if the investment is long-term, of strategic importance, and involves significant influence. Even so, we find that the actual use of the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> is independent of the duration of the investment period, the fraction of equity held, its recent growth, and the investor’s voting power. This lack of compliance suggests that one cannot use the observed choice between the cost <b>method</b> and the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> to infer the underlying characteristics of the investment as specified by the accounting standard. Flexible GAAP may therefore not induce firms to disclose the information that the GAAP were designed to produce...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, Australian {{companies}} have been precluded from adopting equity accounting for investments in associated companies in the consolidated accounts. As reported profits {{were based on the}} cost method (albeit with note disclosures utilising equity accounting procedures), this paper investigates the incentives of Australian firms to manage earnings in a reporting environment which facilitated opportunism. It is argued that the higher the ex ante probability of managing accounting earnings from investments in associates, parties will contract to remove those incentives by restricting the accepted set of accounting procedures to equity accounting. Opportunism {{is more likely to be}} observed for firms for which it is inefficient to ex ante specify the method of accounting for associates. The ability to act opportunistically is defined as the degree of influence which an investor exercises over the financial and/or operating policies of its investees. The results are confirmatory. For firms which have a lower ex ante probability of managing earnings, use of the cost method significantly improves consolidated return on investment compared with returns calculated using the <b>equity</b> <b>method.</b> Firms which are more likely to choose the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> for efficiency reasons have an insignificant difference between cost and equity returns...|$|R
