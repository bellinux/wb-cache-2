50|$|Although Chapman took a keen {{interest}} in his students, research was his main priority. Chapman had a particular interest in the photochemical reaction of hydrogen and chlorine, establishing that minute traces of impurities caused unexpected consequences. He suggested the steady state hypothesis in 1913. He discovered that the <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> light by a rotating sector caused the rate of the reaction to vary with the frequency of the sector and, in 1926, {{he was the first to}} apply this theory to measure the 'mean life' of a reaction intermediate. Other areas of interest were the theory <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in gases (the subject of an important paper that Chapman published in 1899, with reliable calculations <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> speeds; the theory is still known as the Chapman-Jouget treatment) and the distribution of ions at a charged surface (with the name of the Gouy-Chapman layer being given to the surface layer that he envisaged).|$|R

The number <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> waves, however, affected the time needed to reach stable detonation. Besides, there was instability phenomenon in the development <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> waves due to the relation between the number <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> waves and the inlet total pressure.

40|$|Initiation <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the {{cylindrical}} geometry {{is important}} in validating a general theory of initiation, and has particular significance to the interaction of high velocity projectiles with combustible gas. In the present study, an experimental investigation of the direct initiation <b>of</b> gaseous <b>detonations</b> by a line source of condensed explosives (detonating cord) is presented. Due to the high velocity <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the condensed explosive cord (6 [...] 7 km/s), the rapid chemical energy release along its length generates a quasi-cylindrical blast wave in the surrounding combustible mixture. For a sufficiently strong detonating cord, the generated blast wave is observed to decay to a stable Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conical detonation. Below a certain critical energy, the blast wave decays to low velocities without initiating detonation. In the critical regime of initiation, measurements of the combustion front velocity and direct flow visualization indicate that the blast wave decays to sub-CJ velocities before the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation.</b> The onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> is associated with discrete explosion centers. This phenomenon is similar {{to what has been}} previously observed for spherical initiation, suggesting a universal mechanism <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> initiation. The critical shock radius at which the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> occurs is correlated to the detonation cell size (lambda) of the mixture, consistently yielding a radius of 4 to 8 lambda. Using the invariance of the explosion length R 0 in the critical regime of initiation for spherical and cylindrical detonations, it is shown how the critical radii and critical energies scale between the two geometries, clarifying the correct length scales that should be used in the theory of direct initiation <b>of</b> <b>detonation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Blasting {{operations}} in built-up areas, at short distances from structures, impose new requirements on blasting techniques and properties of explosives {{in order to}} mitigate seismic effect of blasting. Explosives for civil uses are mixtures of different chemical composition of explosive and/or non-explosive substances. Chemical and physical properties, along with means of initiation, environment and the terms <b>of</b> application define <b>detonation</b> and blasting parameters of {{a particular type of}} the explosive for civil uses. Velocity <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important measurable characteristics <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> parameters which indirectly provide information about the liberated energy, quality of explosives and applicability for certain purposes.

40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>{{detonation}},</b> in a detonation wave there is a sound plane, named Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) plane. There are certain stationary parameters for this plane. In this work {{the possibility of the}} second CJ plane is shown. This second CJ plane is stationary as well. The physical mechanism of non-equilibrium transition providing the existence of the second CJ plane is presented. There is a non-equilibrium state, when the heat is removed from the reaction zone and the heat capacity decreases sharply. As a result of this non-equilibrium state, the sound velocity increases, and the local supersonic zone with second sonic plane (second CJ plane) appears. So the new mode <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> wave is predicted. Equations describing this mode <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> are presented. The exact analytical solution for the second CJ plane parameters is obtained. The example <b>of</b> double-front <b>detonation</b> in high explosive (TNT) is presented.

40|$|Ya. B. Zel’dovich (1914 – 1987) made {{numerous}} contributions [1] to {{the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>detonation,</b> beginning with his very well known and widely translated article [2] on detonation structure that first introduced the standard Zel’dovich-von Neumann-Döring (ZND) model of shock-induced combustion. Even at that early stage <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> research, Zel’dovich was also considering the application <b>of</b> <b>detonations</b> to propulsion and power engineering. He published these ideas in another paper [3] that has been virtually unknown in the West and has apparently remained untranslated until now. We are indebted to Sergey Frolov of the N. N.

We believe that {{the focus of this}} paper, which is the application <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> waves to power generation and propulsion, is very relevant to the current activity on pulse detonation engines. In particular, Zel’dovich was apparently the first researcher to consider the questions of the relative efficiency of various combustion modes, the role of entropy production in jet propulsion, and the distinction between unsteady and steady modes <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in power engineering and propulsion applications. Even 60 years later, we believe that his results are relevant and can be of value in modern discussions on thermodynamic cycle analysis <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> waves for propulsion [4].

40|$|Abstract. <b>Detonation</b> {{parameters}} <b>of</b> several high explosives {{were calculated}} using own chemical-equilibrium computer program named EXPLO 5. The program {{is based on}} the chemical equilibrium, steady-state model <b>of</b> <b>detonation.</b> It uses the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson’s equation of state (BKW EOS) for gaseous detonation products and Cowan-Fickett’s equation of state for solid carbon. The calculation of equilibrium composition <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> products is done in the program by applying modified White, Johnson, and Dantzig’s free energy minimisation technique.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} geometrical characteristics of the ignition chambers and flow turbulization on the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> {{and the influence of}} temperature and fuel concentration on the unburned mixture. The operation mode <b>of</b> the pulsed <b>detonation</b> wave generator is closely related to the periodical onset and degeneration <b>of</b> a <b>detonation</b> wave. The unsteady-state regimes should be self-sustained to guarantee a reliable operation of such devices. Minimizing the predetonation length and ensuring stability of the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> enables an increased effectiveness <b>of</b> pulsed <b>detonation</b> devices. The presence of one or two turbulizing chambers in the ignition section, the chambers of wider cross-section mounted in the ignition section <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> tube and filled with lean hydrocarbon-air mixtures, and the preheating of the mixture promotes the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) and shortens the predetonation length. The presence of turbulizing chambers makes the DDT process less sensitive to the variation of ignition conditions. The absence of turbulizing chambers increases the predetonation length for similar initial conditions and makes the transition process very unstable with the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> having a sporadic character, the predetonation length varying stochastically, and making the DDT process very sensitive to ignition conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.
