5|$|On 9 September 2014, the {{expedition}} announced that on 7 September it had located one of Franklin's two ships. The ship is preserved {{in very good}} condition, with side-scan sonar picking up even the <b>deck</b> <b>planking.</b> The wreck lies {{at the bottom of}} the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of O'Reilly Island. On 1 October at the House of Commons, Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed that the wreck is indeed HMS Erebus.|$|E
25|$|Oriskany {{returned}} to San Francisco on 13 August 1956, {{and entered the}} shipyard to undergo the SCB-125A modernization program on 1 October. She was decommissioned there on 2 January 1957. Oriskany received a new angled flight deck, aft deck edge elevator, enlarged forward elevator, and enclosed hurricane bow. Powerful new steam catapults replaced the older hydraulic catapults. The wooden flight <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> was also replaced with aluminum planking.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1906, salvage efforts were {{suspended}} for the year, with plans to resume them in 1907. However, an inspection of the ship conducted from 1 to 10 October 1906 found that the action of the sea was driving her further ashore and bending and warping her hull so that her seams were beginning to open, her <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> was coming apart, and her boat davits had collapsed.|$|E

50|$|Prince David was {{suffering}} from neglect, with a badly fouled hull, rotten <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> and bulkheads rusted thin. Holes in the deck plating, crystallized valves and decrepit auxiliary engines augured an expensive refit as well as conversion.|$|R
50|$|King plank - A flat, notched (nibbed) timber laid {{over the}} {{foredeck}} beams between {{the front of}} a cockpit or cabin and the stem. The notches or nibbs are designed so that the tapering <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> do not end in a point which could be a weak point.|$|R
2500|$|The {{machinery}} was amidships {{down in the}} hull, with a {{lower deck}} fore and aft, the crew's quarters being located towards the bow. [...] A full-length main deck was above, enclosed almost to the stern, with circular portholes {{over much of the}} length and larger rectangular windows aft. [...] First-class accommodations were aft, and second-class fore, with dining saloons for each class on the lower deck. [...] The superstructure or promenade deck was open, save for a pilothouse and bridge, a house around the uptakes, and a small house just aft of amidships. The promenade <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> showed provision for conversion to paddle propulsion, in case the turbines proved a failure. Uniquely at that time, a short flying deck supported the two funnels, and a lifeboat {{on each side of the}} funnels.|$|E
2500|$|Liberty—80-foot commuter, {{launched}} 1997—was {{designed by}} Bruce King and {{is described by}} the builder as having a [...] "strong, light hull with distinct round transom" [...] and top and cruising speeds of 33 knots and 25 knots, respectively. The design employs a narrow beam to allow the craft to slice through seas at a higher speed than vessels of similar displacement. The hull is laminated with cedar and mahogany. The construction saves weight with an aluminum honeycomb deck having a teak veneer that resembles traditional wood <b>deck</b> <b>planking.</b> Additionally, the underwater foils and shaft struts are of carbon fiber, instead of bronze. Yachting Magazine chose Liberty {{as one of its}} dozen notable yachts, stating that it [...] "celebrates the great commuter yachts of the 1920s and 1930s—a significant period of yachting history—yet she is built of modern materials, employs up-to-date engines and systems.... Liberty represents the best of old and new." ...|$|E
60|$|And all {{the while}} we sweltered in the terrible heat, for the sun pierced through the <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> of the vessel, and I could feel by her lack of motion that we were {{becalmed}} and drifting. I stood up, and by resting my heels upon a rib {{of the ship and}} my back against her side, I found myself in a position whence I could see the feet of the passers-by on the deck above.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{study found that}} the load {{capacity}} of the trusses remained adequate, but there was significant overstress on the deck. In 1982, the bridge was reconstructed using a new prestressing technique, by which the <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> were laid on their edges and squeezed together with hydraulic jacks to form a watertight slab, and then supported with steel reinforcing rods.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{theoretical}} assessment and ultimate load testing of some prestressed concrete <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> removed from a structure due to alkali aggregate reaction (AAR) cracking. These were the standard precast prestressed concrete <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> used for many bridges in Australia some 3 decades ago. The units showed considerable cracking due to AAR which could affect the structural integrity of the units. All planks were tested as simply supported units subjected to four-point loading. This arrangement approximates the loading from a dual axle. The test results included load deflection response under repeated loading followed by monotonically increased load to failure. Strains in the steel strands and in the compression zone of the concrete were monitored throughout the testing regime. These investigations not only provided information about ultimate flexural behaviour, but also about serviceability performance. Theoretical analysis based on nonlinear finite elements gave results that closely agreed with results obtained in the loading tests, particularly when measured material properties were used...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} all on board {{understood}} that the yacht was to be abandoned, and, {{with the exception of}} those in the engine-room and at the pumps, every one gazed as if fascinated at the clouds of smoke arising from near the bow. Already were tiny curls coming from between the <b>deck</b> <b>planks,</b> and Teddy heard Mr. Walters say in a low tone to Neal's father: ...|$|R
60|$|He shared {{breakfast with}} Skipper, who, instead of eating, washed {{down with a}} cup of coffee fifty grains of quinine wrapped in a {{cigarette}} paper, and who complained to the mate that he would have to get under the blankets and sweat out the fever that was attacking him. Despite his chill, and despite his teeth that were already beginning to chatter while the burning sun extracted the moisture in curling mist-wreaths from the <b>deck</b> <b>planking,</b> Van Horn cuddled Jerry in his arms and called him princeling, and prince, and a king, and a son of kings.|$|E
60|$|Whether, because Miss Castro {{was fond}} of admiration, this was done out of pique at Maxwell's {{indifference}} to her attractions, Dane naturally did not know, but he answered with a bow, and the two strolled forward together. There were no porpoises circling, as they often will, athwart the stem, but the lady who perched herself upon a knighthead seemed in no way disappointed. The sun made rainbows in the spray which whirled beneath her, as each blue ridge fell back shattered from the shearing bows; and nowhere else could one realize so well the swift passage of the quivering hull through the white-topped seas, or feel the same cradle-like {{rise and fall of}} the warm <b>deck</b> <b>planking.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jack {{thought that}} the vessel lifted a little, for he could see one more streak of the <b>deck</b> <b>planking.</b> Mr. Timmins looked round towards the captain, who was {{clinging}} to the wheel. The latter waved his hand, and the mate again began {{to make his way}} forward. He passed the boys without a word, for the loudest shout would have been inaudible in the howling of the wind. He stopped at the main-shrouds again, the axe descended and the mainmast went over the side. The relief from the weight of the mast and the pressure of the wind upon it was immediate; the Wild Wave rose with a surge and her lee-rail appeared above the surface, then she rose no further.|$|E
25|$|They {{planned to}} develop the land {{adjacent}} to Queen Mary, and upgrade, renovate and restore the ship. During their management, staterooms were updated with iPod docking stations and flatscreen TVs and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color. The portside Promenade <b>Deck's</b> <b>planking</b> was restored and refinished. Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.|$|R
2500|$|In 1982, a local archaeological expedition, led by Memphis {{attorney}} Jerry O. Potter, uncovered {{what was}} believed to be the wreckage of Sultana. Blackened wooden <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> and timbers were found about [...] under a soybean field on the Arkansas side, about [...] from Memphis. The Mississippi River has changed course several times since the disaster, leaving the wreck under dry land and far from today's river. The main channel now flows about [...] east of its 1865 position.|$|R
5000|$|CN {{transferred}} {{ownership of}} its properties, including {{the bridge to}} the provincial government and the structure was converted to a pedestrian and cycling bridge using federal and provincial government funding as a [...] "millennium project" [...] {{for use as a}} recreational rail trail; this conversion to pedestrian and cycling use saw the bridge <b>deck</b> <b>planked</b> over and safety guardrails installed. Today the bridge is a popular part of the Sentier NB Trail and is a component of the Trans Canada Trail.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} we fought. The men were {{trampling}} all over my back, and I lay low. Then our rowers on the left side--tied to their oars, you know--began to yell and back water. I could hear the water sizzle, and we spun round like a cockchafer and I knew, lying where I was, {{that there was a}} galley coming up bow-on, to ram us on the left side. I could just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks. We wanted to meet her bow to bow, but it was too late. We could only turn a little bit because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped our moving. Then, by gum! there was a crash! Our left oars began to break as the other galley, the moving one y'know, stuck her nose into them. Then the lower-deck oars shot up through the <b>deck</b> <b>planking,</b> butt first, and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my head." ...|$|E
6000|$|Something rang as {{loudly as}} a ship's bell on the forward plates of the flat-iron, {{something}} spluttered in the water, {{and another thing}} cut a groove in the <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> an inch in front of Bai- Jove-Judson's left foot. The saddle-coloured soldiery were firing as the mood took them, {{and the man in}} the litter waved a shining sword. The muzzle of the big gun kicked down a fraction as it was laid on the mud wall {{at the bottom of the}} house garden. Ten pounds of gunpowder shut up in a hundred pounds of metal was its charge. Three or four yards of the mud wall jumped up a little, as a man jumps when he is caught in the small of the back with a knee-cap, and then fell forward, spreading fan-wise in the fall. The soldiery fired no more that day, and Judson saw an old black woman climb to the flat roof of the house. She fumbled for a time with the flag halliards, then finding that they were jammed, took off her one garment, which happened to be an Isabella-coloured petticoat, and waved it impatiently. The man in the litter flourished a white handkerchief, and Bai-Jove-Judson grinned. [...] "Now we'll give 'em one up the hill. Round with her, Mr. Davies. Curse the man who invented those floating gun platforms. Where can I pitch in a notice without slaying one of those little devils?" ...|$|E

50|$|The hull {{is painted}} black with two white stripes, harking {{back to the}} two gun decks of the ships her design is based on, but she carries only two 6pdr saluting guns in pivot {{mountings}} on the deck, forward of the mainmast. The <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> are of teak wood and must be replaced every three years. Bow and stern are decorated with intricate ornaments; she has a life-size figurehead of Amerigo Vespucci. The stern gallery is accessible only through the Captain's saloon.|$|R
50|$|Keokuk {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{warships}} to be of completely iron construction, with wood used only for <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> and filler in the armor cladding. Her hull construction consisted of five iron box keelsons and one hundred 1-inch-thick (some sources report the thickness as 3/4 inch) by 4-inch-deep iron frames spaced 18 inches between centers. The frames included integral iron cross beams for the decks, with no transverse wood timbers as used on the Monitor. Her bow and stern sections were flooding spaces to allow raising and lowering her waterline.|$|R
6000|$|We sat on {{the open}} deck, like so many trussed fowls, when he asked the question, and the next moment, as the junk heeled to the breeze, we shot down the <b>deck,</b> <b>planks</b> and all, {{fetching}} up in the lee-scuppers with skinned necks. And from the high poop Kwan Yung-jin gazed down at us {{as if he did}} not see us. For many years to come Vandervoot was known amongst us as [...] "What-Now Vandervoot." [...] Poor devil! He froze to death one night on the streets of Keijo; with every door barred against him.|$|R
5000|$|Wreckage {{recovered}} on the scene—deck planks, {{ground cork}} covered with diesel oil, a wooden slat from a vegetable crate with Japanese writing and advertisements on it, pieces of varnished mahogany inscribed in Japanese, {{and a piece}} of <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> containing Japanese builders' inscriptions—indicated a definite [...] "kill".|$|E
50|$|The bridge trusses {{consist of}} eight paneled {{sections}} {{with a total}} span of 100 ft and a width of 20 ft. It rests on granite stone abutments. The decking consists of a base of cross timbers which {{are attached to the}} trusses, with wood stringers, then transverse cross timbers, and finally three inch <b>deck</b> <b>planking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oakum is a {{preparation}} of tarred fibre used in shipbuilding for caulking or packing the joints of timbers in wooden vessels and the <b>deck</b> <b>planking</b> {{of iron and}} steel ships, as well as cast iron pipe plumbing applications. It was forced between the seams using a hammer and a caulking iron, then sealed into place with hot pitch.|$|E
60|$|Massy hissed out {{something}} about bursting the door in. Mr. Van Wyk, to avoid them, crossed {{in the dark}} {{to the other side}} of the deserted <b>deck.</b> The <b>planking</b> of the little wharf rattled faintly under his hasty feet.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to summarize the load and resistance criteria for highway bridge <b>plank</b> <b>decks,</b> and to estimate the reliability of <b>plank</b> <b>decks</b> designed by AASHTO Code. Both transverse and longitudinal planks for a variety of typical stringer spacings and plank sizes are considered. Truck traffic load data is based on the model used to calibrate the 1994 AASHTO LRFD Code. However, for <b>plank</b> <b>decks,</b> wheel load rather than whole vehicle weight is most important, and these statistics are developed for this study. For wood planks, dead load and dynamic load are not significant. The limit state considered is flexural strength, and resistance statistics are presented for wood planks in terms of modulus of rupture. Special flat-wise use data are presented to account for section aspect ratio as well as edge of load application. The reliability analysis is carried out using the procedure developed for calibration of AASHTO LRFD. Reliability indices for both AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Code are presented for <b>plank</b> <b>decks.</b> The results indicate that there are considerable differences in plank reliabilit...|$|R
60|$|The Para was a barque-rigged ship of some {{eight hundred}} tons. At present {{she did not}} show to advantage, her deck being {{littered}} with stores of all kinds that had come on board late. The <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> {{where they could be}} seen were almost black, the sails had been partly loosed from the gaskets, and to an eye accustomed to the neatness and order of a man-of-war her appearance was by no means favourable; but her sides shone with fresh paint, and, looking at her lines from the wharf, Harry thought she would be both fast and a good sea-boat. She was not heavily laden, and stood boldly up in the water. Nodding to Bertie, who was working hard among the men, he went up on to the poop, from which Captain Peters was shouting orders.|$|R

5000|$|... {{they are}} only two covered bridges in Erie County - [...] the Waterford Covered Bridge and the Harrington Covered Bridge; both the Carmen Covered Bridge and Gudgeonville Covered Bridge were lost to arsons in 1996 and 2008, respectively.The bridge has been damaged by {{oversized}} trucks attempting to cross it with the first incident occurring on June 17, 2003 involving a box truck. Another incident on December 9, 2005 involved a FedEx truck that was 8 in taller than the bridge's posted clearance and 3580 lb over the posted load limit, at the time, of 3 ST. Several of the bridge's <b>deck</b> <b>planks,</b> support beams, and cross pieces were damaged, although the bridge's integrity was not compromised and was never closed to traffic. It has also been subjected to repeated vandalism with graffiti marking bridge surfaces. At one point, a deer carcass was even found hanging from the bridge's rafters.|$|R
50|$|On June 11, 2013, most of {{the park}} {{structures}} {{on both sides of}} the gorge were devastated by a man-made wildfire. The fire jumped from the south to the north side of the gorge just west of the bridge and burned 3218 acres, of which 2156 acres was park property, over the next four days until it was contained. The bridge itself sustained only minimal damage with approximately 100 wooden <b>deck</b> <b>planks</b> of 1292 total planks requiring replacement on the south side; however, 48 of the park's 52 buildings were destroyed. No visitors, park employees or any animals in the wildlife park were injured or killed by the fire. The Incline Railway was severely damaged and the aerial tram was destroyed. Park executives announced on June 13 that the bridge would be repaired and the park rebuilt. Rebuilding began about a week after the fire and demolition of all damaged structures took about five months. The new visitor center's groundbreaking ceremony was on January 31, 2014.|$|R
50|$|This bridge now shares its load {{with the}} Dudley Little Bridges (often {{referred}} to as the New Skeena Bridges), a series of two two-way bridges crossing both channels of the Skeena River at Ferry Island and creating a bypass route of downtown Terrace for Highway 16. The new bridges, constructed circa 1975, are fully paved and offer uninterrupted two-way traffic flow, as opposed to the old single-lane bridge controlled by traffic lights. The foundations of the new bridge are prepared for future twinning. The Old Skeena Bridge was once noted for being the largest curved wooden-plank bridge in North America until its decking was replaced with metal grate decking in 2002 due to concerns of safety and upkeep. A concrete-surfaced pedestrian section was installed at the same time, behind an existing divider, to allow for safe bicycle and pedestrian use of the structure with the removal of the solid wooden <b>deck</b> <b>planks.</b>|$|R
