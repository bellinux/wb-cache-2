We first propose and experiment a bi-directional scheme using a single fiber. We {{show that the}} relative stability at 1 s integration time is 7 10 ^ 18 and scales down to 5 10 ^ 21. The same level of performance is reached when an optical link is implemented with an active compensation of the fiber noise. We also implement a real-time two-way <b>frequency</b> <b>comparison</b> over a uni-directional telecommunication network using a pair of parallel fibers. The relative frequency stability is 10 ^ 15 at 1 s integration time and reaches 2 10 ^ 17 at 40 000 s.

40|$|The Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) {{has been}} used as a measure of {{correlation}} between measured and predicted mode shapes for many years.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} and experimentally investigate relevant noise processes arising in {{optical fiber}} links, which fundamentally limit their relative stability. We derive the unsuppressed delay noise for three configurations of optical links: two-way method, Sagnac interferometry, and actively compensated link, respectively designed for <b>frequency</b> <b>comparison,</b> rotation sensing, and frequency transfer. We also consider an alternative two-way setup allowing real-time <b>frequency</b> <b>comparison</b> and demonstrate its effectiveness on a proof-of-principle experiment with a 25 km fiber spool. For these three configurations, we analyze the noise arising from uncommon fiber paths in the interferometric ensemble and design optimized interferometers. We demonstrate interferometers with very low temperature sensitivity of - 2. 2, - 0. 03, and 1 fs/K. We {{use one of}} these optimized interferometers on a long haul compensated fiber link of 540 km.

40|$|Abstract—This paper reports an agile VCO {{frequency}} calibra-tion {{technique and}} its application on a 10 -GHz CMOS integer-N phase-locked loop. The proposed calibration method accomplishes efficient {{search for an}} optimum VCO discrete tuning curve {{among a group of}} frequency sub-bands. The agility is attributed to a pro-posed <b>frequency</b> <b>comparison</b> technique which is based on mea-suring the period difference between two signals. Other mixed-signal circuits are also developed to facilitate this approach. The PLL incorporating the proposed calibration technique is imple-mented in a 0. 18 - m CMOS process. The measured PLL phase noise at 10 GHz is 102 dBc/Hz at 1 -MHz offset frequency and the reference spurs are lower than 48 dBc. The PLL consumes 44 mW in the low-current mode. The calibration time is less than 4 s.
