500|$|The 10th {{resolution}} of CGPM in 2003 declared that [...] "the {{symbol for the}} <b>decimal</b> <b>marker</b> shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line." [...] In practice, the decimal point is used in English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of Latin America and in continental European countries.|$|E
50|$|In SI units {{the middle}} dot or non-breaking space {{is used as}} a {{multiplication}} sign. Only a comma or full stop (period) may be used as a <b>decimal</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Hindu-Arabic {{system is}} {{designed}} for positional notation in a decimal system. In a more developed form, positional notation also uses a <b>decimal</b> <b>marker</b> (at first a mark over the ones digit but now more usually a decimal point or a decimal comma which separates the ones place from the tenths place), and also a symbol for [...] "these digits recur ad infinitum". In modern usage, this latter symbol is usually a vinculum (a horizontal line placed over the repeating digits). In this more developed form, the numeral system can symbolize any rational number using only 13 symbols (the ten digits, <b>decimal</b> <b>marker,</b> vinculum, and a prepended dash to indicate a negative number).|$|E

5000|$|The 22nd General Conference on Weights and Measures {{declared}} in 2003 that [...] "the {{symbol for the}} <b>decimal</b> <b>marker</b> shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line". It further reaffirmed that [...] "numbers may be divided in groups of three {{in order to facilitate}} reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups" [...] (e.g.). This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.|$|E
50|$|International {{standards}} {{may be used}} {{either by}} direct application or by a process of modifying an international standard to suit local conditions. The adoption of international standards results {{in the creation of}} equivalent, national standards that are substantially the same as international standards in technical content, but may have (i) editorial differences as to appearance, use of symbols and measurement units, substitution of a point for a comma as the <b>decimal</b> <b>marker,</b> and (ii) differences resulting from conflicts in governmental regulations or industry-specific requirements caused by fundamental climatic, geographical, technological, or infrastructural factors, or the stringency of safety requirements that a given standard authority considers appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|The International Bureau of Weights and Measures {{states that}} [...] "when {{there are only}} four digits {{before or after the}} <b>decimal</b> <b>marker,</b> it is {{customary}} not to use a space to isolate a single digit". Likewise, some manuals of style state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1000 to 9999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, APA style stipulates a thousands separator for [...] "most figures of 1,000 or more" [...] except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.|$|E
