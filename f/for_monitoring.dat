5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need <b>for</b> <b>monitoring,</b> such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development.

5|$|One of {{the most}} active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc, Cleveland has erupted at least 22times in the last 230years.

The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory relies heavily on satellites <b>for</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The volcano is primarily hazardous to aircraft; many of the flights over the north Pacific approach the vicinity of the volcano, and volcanic ash released from eruptions can damage sensitive electronic equipment and sensors.|$|E
