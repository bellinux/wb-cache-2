40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> {{reservoirs}} {{is always}} associated with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to high pressure isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep reservoirs with high pressure are more prone to such leftover high pressure isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These high pressure isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs to ensure <b>higher</b> ultimate <b>oil</b> recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir. To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, high pressure Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir. The obtained results showed that optimization of well placement, well spacing, and commencement time for any EOR strategy such as miscible CO 2 flooding is very critical in the course of making a Field Development Plan (FDP) for an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir. The results, discussions, and conclusions were finally used by the author to shed light on potential further work on each of the aforementioned challenges in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs such as Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{pressure}} is actually {{created by the}} resistance to {{the flow of the}} oil around the engine. [...] So, the <b>pressure</b> of the <b>oil</b> may vary during operation, with temperature, engine speed, and wear on the engine.

Chevrolet used splash lubrication for their rod bearings until 1953, where it was phased out for the 235 'Six,' and then in 1954 when the 216 was eliminated from their line, and both the solid lifter and hydraulic lifter versions of the 235 had full-pressure lubrication.|$|R

40|$|Study of {{recovery}} mechanism in naturally fractured reservoir (NFRs), such as spontaneous imbibition has high {{interest in the}} oil industry to enhance oil production. Many studies of spontaneous imbibition such as counter-current and co-current imbibition have been carried out by researchers to understand more about the physical process of oil displacement from the matrix to the fracture. Understanding parameters influencing the spontaneous imbibition is a fundamental stage to obtain optimum oil recovery in NFRs. To develop that understanding, the generated model from the successful spontaneous imbibition experiment is required. Experimental setup D has been chosen from spontaneous imbibition experiment with arbitrary fluid viscosity that was conducted by Haugland, H. K (2016). This type of experimental setup represent two ends open free spontaneous imbibition (TOEFSI) boundary condition where the inlet of imbibition tube is contact in with water, while the other side is oil-saturated outlet. As the result of five experiments from this setup, oil production mostly occurred by co-current flow for all experiments, while poor counter-current oil production was determined in one of these experiments. Assuming horizontal homogeneous 1 D model is generated from that setup D with applying TEOFSI boundary condition and allowing both co-current and counter-current imbibition to happen in this model. Corey-type Relative permeability and J-function capillary pressure correlation is used for developing the flow. Assuming atmospheric condition for the model which correspond to the condition of the experiment. Various of the imbibition tube length, viscosity ratio, relative permeability, the shape of capillary pressure curve, and the capillary back pressure are applied during simulation to investigate the change of controller parameters effect on the oil recovery and, analysis and understand the behaviour behind it. As the result, high co-current or total (co + counter current) oil recovery is obtained when oil mobility is increased (i. e. high viscosity ratio (µw/µo)) with a reduction of tube length. These results are satisfied with the Haugland, H. K’s (2016) experimental result for viscosity ratio effect and another conducted experiment by Zhang, et al. (1996) for the increase of the core length effect. High imbibition rate that is induced from those parameters leads to oil to produce co-currently and vice versa. The capillary pressure shape that affects the co-current production has been discovered during this parameter study. The combination of concave up and down-negative slope of capillary pressure curve can increase oil production co-currently. It might be due to high level of capillary back pressure shown in that shape restricts <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> to overcome it. The various capillary back pressure is investigated by changing boundary water pressure. From the simulation result, counter-current production occurs when the boundary water pressure (Pcbw) is lower than the oil pressure inside the model. The reason is <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> overcomes this type of pressure. On the other hand, the counter-current decreases as the Pcbw is higher than the oil pressure.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine valves and stop valves which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and governor valves, operating conditions of the turbine governor control system are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of valve status, time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the governor and stop valves. The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|E

This means not only a mutual understanding of basic design, installation, and operating requirements, but detailed discussions of a myriad of important topics such as startup, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, off-design operation, process upsets, installation, testing, shipment, commissioning, maintenance and construction features as well as various design and construction options...|$|R
