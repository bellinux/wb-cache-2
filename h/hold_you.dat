500|$|The {{next day}} Presley {{recorded}} [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] and [...] "Gentle on My Mind", leaving the studio {{while working on}} the latter to rest his throat. The following night, he did not appear, as his cold worsened, and on January 15 and 16 the house band recorded backing tracks for subsequent sessions. Presley returned on January 20, recording [...] "In the Ghetto" [...] in 23 takes and finishing the vocal track for [...] "Gentle on My Mind". On January 22, he recorded Eddy Arnold's [...] "I'll <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> in My Heart (Till I Can <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> in My Arms)" [...] and the non-album single [...] "Suspicious Minds". Presley then took a break from recording for a vacation trip to Aspen, Colorado to celebrate his daughter Lisa Marie's first birthday.|$|E

500|$|The twelve {{tracks on}} the album were {{selected}} from thirty-one which were recorded in the American Sound sessions. The first song, [...] "Wearin' That Loved On Look" [...] features an electric-bass lead {{for the first time}} in a Presley recording. The second is [...] "Only the Strong Survive", with Presley backed by bass and drums. He plays piano on the third track, the country song [...] "I <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> in My Heart ('Till I Can <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> in My Arms)". Presley's voice is roughened by a cold on the fourth song, the country-rhythm-and-blues [...] "Long Black Limousine" [...] featuring a trumpet solo. The fifth song, Johnny Tillotson's traditional country-western [...] "It Keeps Right on A-Hurtin'", was arranged to sound more like Memphis soul. Side one ends with a version of Hank Snow's country-western [...] "I'm Moving On" [...] with a strong bass line and driving rhythm.|$|E
500|$|Lukather's songwriting {{contributions}} {{grew from}} {{a smattering of}} tracks on early Toto albums to almost every track starting in the late 1980s. He wrote very few of Toto's songs by himself, an exception being the hit single [...] "I Won't <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> Back" [...] from Toto IV. Lukather has said that writing lyrics {{is not one of}} his strengths. Thus, he collaborated with other band members to complete song ideas and make them into viable album tracks. Lukather contributed to all of the songs on Toto's 2006 album Falling in Between.|$|E
500|$|The Harrison–Dylan demo of [...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] {{has never}} {{received}} an official release, although {{from the late}} 1970s, it began circulating among collectors on bootleg compilations, which stated an incorrect recording date of 1 May 1970. According to Dylan chronicler Olof Björner and Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison and Dylan may have recorded the demos for this song and [...] "Nowhere to Go" [...] in Bearsville, during the original composing session in 1968. Both songs appear on bootlegs such as The Dylan Harrison Sessions and The Beatles – 20 x 4.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Unreal Tournament {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, earning {{an overall}} score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay, and level design. Computer and Video Games concluded [...] "Unreal Tournament {{is nothing short}} of a technical and game-playing marvel destined to <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> - as it did us - wailing with happiness and wasting far too many precious hours hammering keyboards. An absolute joy to behold." [...] In March 2000, Unreal Tournament was second on a list of best-selling games in Computer Dealer News trade magazine. However, the development team believed sales would have been higher if the game was released in October 1999.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{reception}} to Gone Troppo {{in their book}} Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note [...] "Circles" [...] as the only track [...] "reflecting weightier matters" [...] on what was otherwise Harrison's [...] "frothiest" [...] collection of songs to date, and they conclude: [...] "Sadly, a decent album {{was lost in the}} shuffle of the rapidly changing marketplace of the early '80's." [...] In a contemporary review for Musician magazine, Roy Trakin found that, following John Lennon's murder two years before, Harrison's [...] "tortured honesty" [...] undermined the album's [...] "attempt to heal those psychic wounds with calm, offhanded music", and he added that [...] "not even Billy Preston can rescue … the maudlin tautologies of the closing 'Circles'." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{began working}} on the Bangladesh {{recordings}} on 2 August, and work continued there at the Record Plant for around a week. Spector later talked of them spending [...] "six months" [...] mixing {{what amounted to a}} total of four hours of music; in fact, the process took just over a month, as Harrison told talk-show host Dick Cavett that November. In their book Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter question the extent of Spector's involvement, citing Harrison's subsequent lauding of Kellgren's role in [...] "capturing the performances" [...] on 1 August, as well as the fact that Spector was [...] "in and out of hospital" [...] during this time, similar to his erratic attendance at the All Things Must Pass sessions in 1970.|$|E

The morning of the 14th the astronauts' wake-up call was the song [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go" [...] by The Clash, {{at the request of}} Shepherd's wife. Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: [...] "May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well." [...] The commander of Discovery, Jim Wetherbee, said [...] ""For Captain Shepherd and his crew, we <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> in admiration as we prepare to bring you home. This has been an arduous duty for you. This ship was not built in a safe harbor. It was built on the high seas." ...|$|E
500|$|Outside of {{the daytime}} rehearsals, Harrison {{finished}} off the songs hastily recorded in England, and mixed the album. Horn and Findley overdubbed flutes, and Richards wobble board onto [...] "It Is 'He'". Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest {{that much of}} the vocals on Dark Horse were taped at this point – a situation that resulted in Harrison overworking and then blowing his voice {{in the middle of the}} tour rehearsals. He was diagnosed with laryngitis. According to Scott, Harrison recorded [...] "Bye Bye, Love" [...] alone one night at A, adding a variety of instruments to his acoustic guitar track, including Moog synthesizer, drums, electric pianos and various electric-guitar parts. [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] is another solo track that was most likely recorded in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E

500|$|... "Isn't It a Pity" [...] {{remains one}} of Harrison's most popular songs with critics and fans alike. AllMusic calls it [...] "deeply moving and powerful", while in their book on the solo Beatles' {{recording}} history, Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter declare: [...] "If any George Harrison song can be called 'majestic', 'Isn't It a Pity' would be the one." [...] In his December 1970 album review for the NME, Alan Smith {{described it as a}} track that [...] "catches the mood of aching tolerance of pain, which Harrison can do so well" [...] and [...] "a ballad which will stand out from the album with the passing of the years". While reviewing the song's pairing with [...] "My Sweet Lord", Billboard magazine wrote of a [...] "powerhouse two-sided winner" [...] with [...] "equally potent lyric lines and infectious rhythms".|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with Gross, for Circus Raves magazine, Scott recalled {{that he was}} the first Western musician that Harrison approached about joining him and Shankar for a tour of the United States and Canada later in the year. The tour would be the first in North America by a former Beatle since the group's 1966 US visit, and Harrison's first live performances since his staging of the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. Rather than include Beatles material on the 1974 tour, however, Harrison planned to present a varied program combining rock, soul/R, jazz, funk and Indian classical music. Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)" [...] was written [...] "simply as a show opener" [...] for the North American concerts, which would also feature Harrison's former Apple Records protégé Billy Preston.|$|E
500|$|With its choruses {{presented}} in what Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "thundering, echo-drenched crescendo", [...] "Let It Down" [...] received a hard rock arrangement that recalls {{the sound of}} Wright's former band Spooky Tooth. Like Huntley, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as the most obvious example of Spector's influence on the album. In their book Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Madinger and Easter also credit the producer with [...] "creating havoc" [...] during the making of All Things Must Pass. According to Harrison's later recollections and those of Molland, Klaus Voormann and orchestral arranger John Barham, Spector's erratic behaviour and alcohol intake became a further burden on Harrison, alongside his marital problems {{and the death of}} his mother in July 1970. During a session at Apple Studio, Spector fell over and broke his arm; that and other [...] "health issues" [...] left Harrison to do much of the production work alone through to 12 August.|$|E

500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement {{when he sat down}} at the keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it to a level of spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And you can blame it on me / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want to <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> back now love".|$|E
500|$|The song {{has invited}} varied {{opinions}} among Harrison and Beatles biographers. In their book Eight Arms to <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as [...] "an inauspicious ending to a half-baked LP". Ian Inglis describes the deceleration into half-time during the verses as [...] "awkward" [...] and notes {{the failure of}} [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] next to Harrison's earlier successes with [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "Hare Krishna Mantra". Inglis concludes: [...] "The gently floating Indian [...] are somewhat undermined by the ponderous nature of the rock-oriented interludes, and the evangelical nature of the English words – 'he who is complete' – finally discourage any attempt at participation." [...] Author Elliot Huntley describes the song as [...] "Krishna-consciousness psychobabble", with a refrain that is [...] "repeated ad nauseam". Writing in The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham views the track as [...] "George at his happy-clappy nadir" [...] and pairs it with [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", which Harrison released as a hoped-for Christmas–New Year hit in the UK, as [...] "two of the worst songs he ever allowed out".|$|E
