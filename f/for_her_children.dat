5|$|In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula {{filed for}} divorce from a {{hospital}} bed where she lay dying of cancer. She claimed {{she was trying to}} preserve some of her estate <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>children.</b> A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending at the time of Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fianc√©e, Amanda Ross.|$|E

5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. Under the reformed Kirk, divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|The quatrains, {{published}} in a book titled Les Propheties (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, {{while many of the}} elite evidently thought otherwise. Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>children.</b> At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E

5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} of the pattern of late {{marriage}} {{for both men and women}} (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> in the 1560s and 1570s.

25|$|In his journals, Alexander Polovtsov, State Secretary during Alexander III's reign, left an unsympathetic {{portrayal}} of Grand Duchess Olga.
