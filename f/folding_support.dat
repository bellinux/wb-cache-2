The specific axial symmetry GroEL structure (two rings of seven units stacked back to back- 524 aa each) and the GroES (single ring of seven units- 97 aa each) polypeptide chains are analyzed using the hydrophobicity distribution expressed as excess/deficiency all over the molecule to search for structureto-function relationships. The empirically observed distribution of hydrophobic residues is confronted with the theoretical one representing the idealized hydrophobic core with hydrophilic residues exposure on the surface. The observed discrepancy between these two distributions seems to be aim-oriented, determining the structure-to-function relation. The hydrophobic force field structure generated by the chaperonin capsule is presented. Its possible influence on substrate folding is suggested...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe lack of small-molecule inhibitors for anion-selective {{transporters}} and channels has impeded {{our understanding}} of the complex mechanisms that underlie ion passage. The ubiquitous CLC “Chloride Channel” family represents a unique target for biophysical and biochemical studies because its distinctive protein <b>fold</b> <b>supports</b> both passive chloride channels and secondary-active chloride-proton transporters. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a specific small-molecule inhibitor directed against a CLC antiporter (ClC-ec 1). This compound, 4, 4 ’-octanamidostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonate (OADS), inhibits ClC-ec 1 with low micromolar affinity and has no specific effect on a CLC channel (ClC- 1). Inhibition of ClC-ec 1 occurs by binding to two distinct intracellular sites. The location of these sites and the lipid dependence of inhibition suggest potential mechanisms of action. This compound will empower research to elucidate differences between antiporter and channel mechanisms and to develop treatments for CLC-mediated disorders...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGalactokinase (GALK), {{a member}} the Leloir pathway for normal {{galactose}} metabolism, catalyzes {{the conversion of}} α-d-galactose to galactose- 1 -phosphate. For this investigation, we studied the kinetic mechanism and pH profiles of the enzyme from Lactococcus lactis. Our {{results show that the}} mechanism for its reaction is sequential in both directions. Mutant proteins D 183 A and D 183 N are inactive (< 10000 <b>fold),</b> <b>supporting</b> the role of Asp 183 as a catalytic base that deprotonates the C- 1 hydroxyl group of galactose. The pH-kcat profile of the forward reaction has a pKa of 6. 9 ± 0. 2 that likely is due to Asp 183. The pH-kcat/KGal profile of the reverse reaction further substantiates this role as it is lacking a key pKa required for a direct proton transfer mechanism. The R 36 A and R 36 N mutant proteins show over 100 -fold lower activity than that for the wild-type enzyme, thus suggesting that Arg 36 lowers the pKa of the C- 1 hydroxyl to facilitate deprotonation...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of scour patterns at bridge piers {{is driven by}} the forces at the boundary of the water flow. In most experimental scour studies, indirect processes have been applied to estimate the shear stress using measured velocity profiles. The estimations are based on theoretical models and associated assumptions. However, the turbulence flow fields and boundary layer in the pier-scour region are very complex and lead to low-fidelity results. In addition, available turbulence models cannot account accurately for the bed roughness effect. Direct measurement of the boundary shear stress, normal stress, and their fluctuations are attractive alternatives. However, most direct-measurement shear sensors are bulky in size or not compatible to fluid flow. A sensor has been developed that consists of a floating plate with <b>folded</b> beam <b>support</b> and an optical grid on the back, combined with a high-resolution optical position probe. The <b>folded</b> beam <b>support</b> makes the floating plate more flexible in the sensing direction within a small footprint, while maintaining high stiffness in the other directions. The floating plate converts the shear force to displacement, and the optical probe detects the plate s position with nanometer resolution by sensing the pattern of the diffraction field of the grid through a glass window. This configuration makes the sensor compatible with liquid flow applications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMicroscopic billow-like wavy folds {{have been}} {{observed}} along slip planes of the Nojima active fault, southwest Japan. The folds are similar in form to Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instabilities occurring in fluids, which implies that the slip zone underwent “lubrication” such as frictional melting or fluidization of fault gouge materials. If the temperature range for generation of the billow-like wavy folds can be determined, we can constrain the physical properties of fault gouge materials during seismic slip. Here, we report on rock magnetic studies that identify seismic slip zones associated with the folds, and their temperature rises during ancient seismic slips of the Nojima active fault. Using a scanning magneto-impedance magnetic microscope and a scanning {{superconducting quantum interference device}} microscope, we observed surface stray magnetic field distributions over the folds, indicating that the folds and slip zones are strongly magnetized. This is due to the production of magnetite through thermal decomposition of antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic minerals in the gouge at temperatures over 350 °C. The presence of micrometer-sized finely comminuted materials in the billow-like wavy folds, along with our rock magnetic results, suggests that frictional heating-induced fluidization was the driving mechanism of faulting. We found that the existence of the magnetized KH-type billow-like wavy <b>folds</b> <b>supports</b> that the low-viscosity fluid induced by fluidization after frictional heating decreased the frictional strength of the fault slip zone...|$|R
40|$|Scheduling {{algorithms}} {{in parallel}} computers {{fall into two}} basic categories: time and space sharing algorithms. Space-sharing based processor allocation algorithms can be contiguous or non-contiguous. Studies show that non-contiguous allocation is superior due to decrease in fragmentation. Other studies have reported that executing jobs on fewer processors (folding) can improve the performance of contiguous and non-contiguous allocation. However, the problem with folding {{is that it is}} not always applicable because of parallel programming languages and parallel operating systems limitations. Most of previous studies used simulation. Our study is an experimental one for studying time and space sharing on a real parallel machine (the PowerXplorer), with eight processors arranged as a two-dimensional mesh. A set of five scientific applications with differing communication characteristics were implemented and executed using time and space sharing. The observed execution times were used to study and compare time-sharing and contiguous and non-contiguous space sharing with and without folding. Our study showed that time-sharing gave comparable results to space sharing allocation. Further, non-contiguous allocation gave better results than contiguous allocation when <b>folding</b> is not <b>supported.</b> However, when <b>folding</b> is <b>supported</b> contiguous allocation gave the best mean turnaround times...|$|R
40|$|Jak {{tyrosine}} kinases have {{a unique}} domain structure containing a kinase domain (JH 1) adjacent to a catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain (JH 2). JH 2 is crucial for inhibition of basal Jak activity, but the mechanism of this regulation has remained elusive. We show that JH 2 negatively regulated Jak 2 in bacterial cells, indicating that regulation is an intrinsic property of Jak 2. JH 2 suppressed basal Jak 2 activity by lowering the Vmax of Jak 2, whereas JH 2 {{did not affect the}} Km of Jak 2 for a peptide substrate. Three inhibitory regions (IR 1 – 3) within JH 2 were identified. IR 3 (residues 758 – 807), at the C terminus of JH 2, directly inhibited JH 1, suggesting an inhibitory interaction between IR 3 and JH 1. Molecular modeling of JH 2 showed that IR 3 could form a stable -helical <b>fold,</b> <b>supporting</b> that IR 3 could independently inhibit JH 1. IR 2 (725 – 757) in the C-terminal lobe of JH 2, and IR 1 (619 – 670), extending from the N-terminal to the C-terminal lobe, enhanced IR 3 -mediated inhibition of JH 1. Disruption of IR 3 either by mutations or a small deletion increased basal Jak 2 activity, but abolished interferon-–inducible signaling. Together, the results provide evidence for autoinhibition of a Jak family kinase and identify JH 2 regions important for autoregulation of Jak 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The highly {{convoluted}} {{shape of}} the adult human brain results from several well-coordinated matu-rational events that start from embryonic development and extend through the adult life span. Disturbances in these maturational events can result in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, resulting in abnormal patterns of morphological relationship among cortical structures (structural covariance). Structural covariance can be stud-ied using graph theory-based approaches that evaluate topological properties of brain networks. Covariance-based graph metrics allow cross-sectional study of coordinated maturational relationship among brain regions. Disrupted gyrification of focal brain regions is a consistent feature of schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if these localized disturbances result from a failure of coordinated develop-ment of brain regions in schizophrenia. We studied the structural covariance of gyrification {{in a sample of}} 41 patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls by constructing gyrification-based networks using a 3 -dimen-sional index. We found that several key regions including anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show increased segregation in schizophrenia, alongside reduced segregation in somato-sensory and occipital regions. Patients also showed a lack of prominence of the distrib-uted covariance (hubness) of cingulate cortex. The abnor-mal segregated folding pattern in the right peri-sylvian regions (insula and fronto-temporal cortex) was associated with greater severity of illness. The study of structural covariance in cortical <b>folding</b> <b>supports</b> the presence of subtle deviation in the coordinated development of cortical convolutions in schizophrenia. The heterogeneity in the severity of schizophrenia could be explained in part by aberrant trajectories of neurodevelopment...|$|R

40|$|Folds with hinge lines subparallel to {{stretching}} lineation {{are common}} features in shear zones and represent extreme cases of fold modification. However, their microstructures {{and in particular}} their kinematic significance remain poorly understood. Here we describe the meso- and micro-scale structures and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of quartz and muscovite from a metric-scale shear-modified fold from Plattjen, Saas Fee, Western Internal Alps. The studied fold is of class- 2 and the samples collected around the fold have essentially the same microstructures. Quartz [c]-axes plotted in the tectonic coordinate system exhibit an apparent reverse obliquity on opposing limbs. Muscovite fabrics are controlled essentially by the orientation of { 001 } planes. If the CPO data are plotted in a common reference frame (e. g. either fold or geographical), all samples exhibit essentially the same patterns for both minerals. In particular, relative to the fold axis and axial surface, the reversal of quartz CPO obliquity on opposing limbs is no longer evident. The small obliquity (~ 15 °) between the intersection lineation of the two planes of { 001 } of muscovite and the fold axis results in the apparent reversal of shear sense on opposite limbs when viewing the CPO related to the macroscopic fabric. The homogeneity of the microstructures and CPOs of quartz and muscovite across the <b>fold</b> <b>support</b> the interpretation that the fold developed during simultaneous activation of heterogeneous and homogeneous simple shear, with the former responsible for fold development and the latter responsible for fold rotation and the overwhelming of the heterogeneous deformation.
