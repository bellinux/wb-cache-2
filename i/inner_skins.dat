40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new design approach for predicting {{the degree of}} soil plugging and the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> friction of axial-loaded open-ended piles. The main objective {{of this study was}} to propose the SPT-based design method considering the plugging effect, since the SPT test is commonly used to identify the subsoil condition in sandy soils. The plugging effect for open-ended piles was quantified using field plugging measurements and the results of three full-scale field pile load tests. Based on the plugging measurements, the relationship of the plug length ratio (PLR) with the soil properties, pile geometry and pile driving condition was established. Additionally, a linear relationship between the PLR and incremental filling ratio (IFR) was proposed. Full-scale tests were performed on three instrumented piles with different diameters (508. 0, 711. 2 and 914. 4 mm). An instrumented double-walled pile system was used to measure the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> friction along the pile shaft. Based on the results of the full-scale field pile load tests, the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> friction of the open-ended piles was proposed as a function of the IFR and pile diameter. The predicted values were consistent with the measured values, such as the IFR and <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> friction. The proposed method can predict the degree of soil plugging and the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> friction of open-ended piles and be selected as convenient option in engineering field...|$|R

The {{change of}} green, hard, and {{tasteless}} vegetable substance into beautifully coloured, soft, and delicious substance, which produces {{what we call}} a fruit, is, in most cases, of the husk only; in others, of the part of the stalk which immediately sustains the seed; and in a very few instances, not properly a change, but a distinct formation, of fruity substance between the husk and seed. Normally, however, the husk, like the seed, consists always of three parts; it has an outer skin, a central substance of peculiar nature, and an <b>inner</b> <b>skin,</b> which holds the seed. The main difficulty, in describing or thinking of the completely ripened product of any plant, is to discern clearly which is the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> of the husk, and which the outer skin of the seed.

50|$|Some sources {{state the}} outer wing panels used double skins {{top and bottom}} with the steam being ducted into a thin space between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>skins</b> for cooling. A {{double-skinned}} panel {{was used in the}} oil cooling system, but surviving photographs of the wings indicate that they were conventionally single-skinned, and that the coolant was simply piped into the open spaces of the structure. Double skinning over such an extensive area would have made the aircraft unacceptably heavy. Furthermore, there was no access to the inner structure to repair damage such as a bullet hole from the inside, as would be needed if the system used a double skin. A similar system was used by the earlier Supermarine Type 224. Contrary to assertions in some references, all of the He 100s that were built used the evaporative cooling system described above. A derivative of this system was also intended for a late-war project based on the He 100, designated P.1076.|$|E

A composição química, características físicas, físico-químicas foram determinadas. Na avaliação sensorial, cem provadores não treinados receberam amostras em blocos balanceados e realizaram testes sensoriais, utilizando escala hedônica de 9 pontos e comparação múltipla. Os dados obtidos foram avaliados por estatísticas descritivas, ANOVA, testes de Tukey e Dunnet. Os resultados revelaram que 100 g da FEM continham 9, 06 g de umidade, 12, 72 g de cinzas, 0, 7 g de lipídios, 1, 20 g de proteínas, 31, 01 g de fibras insolúveis, 45, 21 g de glicídios totais e 192, 75 kcal. Nos bolos experimentais, os pesos, alturas, diâmetros e rendimentos foram maiores e o índice de expansão menor, bem como, o volume aparente do bolo com 30 % FEM foi menor. Os bolos experimentais apresentaram menor pH, maior acidez titulável, maiores teores de fibra e umidade, menores de glicídios totais e reduzido valor energético. Os bolos obtiveram boa aceitação e mais de 60 % dos provadores comprariam os bolos. O bolo com 7 % FEM foi ligeiramente melhor que o controle, diferindo no aroma e sabor do que continha 30 % FEM.

Cakes without watermelon <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> (control) and others containing 7 and 30 % of watermelon inner skin(experimental), a non-wheat flour substitute, were elaborated. The chemical composition, physical, and physicochemical characteristics were evaluated. In the sensory evaluation, one hundred non-trained panelists were assigned blocks of four samples and performed sensorial tests using a nine point hedonic scale and multiple comparison. The obtained data were evaluated by descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and Tukey and Dunnet tests.

The theoretical modelling and physical understanding of the mechanisms of initiation and growth of the macrovoids, notably {{in order to determine}} processing conditions that would allow to make macrovoids free membranes, {{have been the subject of}} a vast literature and a restill controversial. However, experimental data on macrovoids, that could help to discriminate between several ideas are scarce and have been essentially obtained using 2 D imaging systems. A very large number of observations are then needed to obtain statistically significant results and the limitation to 2 D images does not permitto access to an accurate description of the macroporous structure.

40|$|Ice {{accretion}} on {{the wing}} and nacelle leading edges diminishes aerodynamic performance and increases fuel consumption and chances of aircraft crash. For these reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration mandates aircraft manufacturers to demonstrate that their aircraft can fly safely in icing conditions. This study has investigated the thermal performance and measures for improvement of Swirl Anti‐Icing (SAI) systems in preventing ice accretion on nacelle leading edges. A Piccolo Tube Anti‐Icing (PTAI) system with experimental data {{was used as the}} benchmark of this study. PTAI consists of perforated pipe and is installed inside the wing and/or nacelle leading edge. The hot air from the compressor is directed onto <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> through the holes/nozzles in a perforated pipe. As a result, the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> is warmed up and free from icing. In this study, numerical simulations have been performed to analyse the thermal performance of PTAI at 4 different altitudes/scenarios namely Ground Run, Climb, Hold and Descent. The FLUENT CFD results demonstrated excellent agreements with the experimental data obtained by Bombardier Aerospace. Based on the results, the gradient coefficients of the empirical equations proposed by colleagues have been modified {{to take into account the}} ambient air temperature in order to make the correlations suitable for all the 4 conditions analysed. In future, Bias flow Acoustic Liner (BAL) is expected to be employed in engine nacelle and to form part of the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> of nacelle lip. The hotspots produced by PTAI would possibly destroy BAL. Thus, an old and mature technology, SAI, was further investigated in the present study with a hope to get rid of hotspot phenomenon on the <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> and to increase the efficiency of the system. SAI has better temperature distribution along nacelle lip‐skin than that of PTAI. In addition, SAI contains fewer components, requires simple plumbing, and is light and inexpensive both for the system itself and for maintenance of the system compared to PTAI. Some potential modifications of nozzle including sloped nozzle, altered nozzle length and nozzle outlet, rotated nozzle towards <b>inner</b> <b>skin,</b> decreased exhaust area and increased nozzle diameter have been proposed and investigated in order to improve thermal performance of SAI. According to the results, only nozzle directions and nozzle diameters had significant effects on the thermal performance of SAI although all the modifications would have certain effects on anti icing performances of SAI. Thermal performance of SAI was inversely related to nozzle diameter. The hotspot temperature decreased by 18. 53 °C and cold spot temperature increased by 2. 30 °C respectively as the nozzle rotated 13 ° towards <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> at hot air mass flow rate of 0. 0118 kg/s. For hot air mass flow rate of 0. 04536 kg/s, the cold spot temperature decreased from 28. 78 to 6. 37 °C as nozzle diameter increased from 0. 0127 m to 0. 0254 m. In addition, the temperature distribution on the nacelle lip‐skin has improved as the angle of nozzle direction towards <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> increased. Based on the results, novel empirical correlations for SAI system have been developed and presented. The augmentor was employed in SAI system in order to enhance momentum and heat exchanges between hot air and cold air in the D‐chamber. As a result, the uniformity of temperature distribution and thermal performance of SAI on the nacelle lip‐skin were improved. The results showed that the thermal performance of SAI with augmentor increased with the increase of hot air mass flow rate. Although SAI with Augmentor 3 at 2 ° rotation showed poor thermal performance than SAI without augmentor but nozzle rotating at 13 ° with hot air mass flow rate above 0. 028 kg/s, the former showed better thermal performance than latter for hot air mass flow rate equal to or lower than 0. 028 kg/s. The performance of the Final nozzle was also tested and compared with the performances of Circle nozzle and ellipse nozzle 1. The final design of the nozzle has demonstrated the best performance at any given hot air mass flow rate, especially at 0. 04356 kg/s. At this mass flow rate, Ctem deviation, hotspot temperature and cold spot temperature were 13. 19...|$|R

The research activity presented herewith was aimed at supporting the contractor's decision process about the layout of an Active Transparent Façade (Climate Façade typology) for a high-rise office building. An extensive monitoring on a full scale office room mock-up was thus designed to compare two ATF solutions, assessing the most viable trade-off between high performance and costs, taking not only energy efficiency but also thermal, visual and acoustic comfort into account. Two ATF modules with slightly different configurations (type of <b>inner</b> <b>skin)</b> were tested in the mock-up. The energy efficiency analyses showed that, as predictable, the ATF module equipped with the best <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> was able to significantly increase the thermal resistance, reducing the winter heat loss and the summer heat gain, though this impact was not so relevant when the overall energy balance at building level was considered. The <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> played, instead, a relevant role when considering thermal comfort, especially during summer peak conditions. From a visual comfort perspective, the two technologies did not perform in a significantly different way in the presence of the screen, but differences were observed in winter (with retracted screen), since the higher luminance values measured for the single skin could cause glare.
