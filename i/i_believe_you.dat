5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>you</b> were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E

That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts... reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way.

This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December {{to tell him that}} [...] "many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works but I always opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, as <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> will have an [...] of.

500|$|The series win was the Red Sox's first {{title in}} 86years. They {{were also the}} fourth team to win a World Series without {{trailing}} {{in any of the}} games in the series, and the seventh to win it having previously been three outs away from elimination. With the win, pitcher Lowe became the first pitcher to ever win three series-clinching games in a single postseason having also won Game 3 of the ALDS against the Angels and Game 7 of the ALCS against the Yankees. Although the series was won in St. Louis, 3,000Red Sox fans were present at the game, and many stayed after the final out to celebrate with the team, including going on the field when the team came back out of their dugout with the World Series trophy. Ramírez, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, said afterwards [...] "I don't believe in curses, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> make your own destination.

[...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> change laws".

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the month the Cardinals were 2 games behind the Brewers in the standings. However, they lost two of three to Milwaukee on the road Aug. 1–3, then did the same at home on Aug. 9–11, giving the Brewers a four-game lead in the NL Central. The team continued to stumble as the Brewers continued to win. Newly acquired shortstop Furcal hit only [...]240 for the month. The Cardinals went 2–4 on a six-game road trip to Pittsburgh and Chicago, then came home and were swept in three games by a bad Dodger team. After close of business on August 24, the day the Dodgers completed their sweep, St. Louis had fallen ten games behind Milwaukee in the NL Central standings and 10 games behind the Atlanta Braves (and in third place) in the NL Wild Card standings. Manager Tony La Russa said on the struggles: [...] "I guarantee that the team you have seen the past few weeks is not the team we have, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> will start to see our team tomorrow." [...] Chris Carpenter and other veterans called for a closed, player-only team meeting, which was held the day after the Dodgers series ended. St. Louis' odds of making the playoffs stood at 1.3%.|$|E

(The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House."
