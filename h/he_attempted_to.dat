5|$|By February 1864, Admiral Bonard had {{accumulated}} sufficient reinforcements to attack and seize Định's main strongholds in the Tan Hoa and Gò Công areas.

By this time, the French were able to keep Định and the other resistance leaders constantly on the move, aided by a growing network of local informants. In 1863, a famine had broken out, and resistance forces were increasingly unable to find food. With the court providing no practical support, the French gradually wore down the partisans.
