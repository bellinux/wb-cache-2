40|$|AbstractThe {{official}} {{analytical method}} of the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare for testing for veterinary drug residues in foods is the multiresidue analysis of β-agonists. Samples are pretreated through liquid–liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction. This method is time consuming and requires the intensive use of solvents. To improve analytical efficiency and reduce costs, our study incorporated QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) techniques {{to establish a}} new method of multiresidue analysis of β-agonists in animal muscle and viscera. The pretreatment time was shortened and solvent usage was minimized. The modified analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and quantification was performed using multiple reaction monitoring. The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients of the tissue calibration curve were higher than 0. 99 and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1  ppb. The average recoveries in spiked samples varied from 70 % to 120 %, and the relative difference between <b>duplicated</b> <b>analysis</b> results was lower than 10 %.

This paper investigates the end-to-end TCP performance, in terms of normalized throughput, effective goodput, and packet delay, over wireless lossy links with local retransmissions. The results reveal that local retransmissions can increase the normalized TCP throughput in different wireless bandwidth, delay, and error settings, {{at the cost of}} a decrease in effective goodput and an increased packet delay. The performance observation is explained by the explored TCP endpoint behaviors, including the spurious timeout and <b>duplicated</b> acknowledgment. <b>Analysis</b> shows that spurious timeouts with local retransmissions are rare due to the conservative TCP timeout algorithm.
