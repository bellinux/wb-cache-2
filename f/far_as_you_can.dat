25|$|Sago Road, {{where the}} mine is, follows the Buckhannon River {{and a set}} of {{railroad}} tracks. When you arrive just outside the Sago Baptist church, where relatives and friends of the miners have gathered, you see cars. Everywhere, lining the roads, in people's yards, there are cars as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see. Then, you see satellite trucks and TV crews and reporters and photographers. They're also everywhere and you can tell our presence, just under 24 hours at the time, is taking a toll on the small town and the little area we've taken over.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari records {{a number}} of raids against the Byzantine Empire under the period A.H. 49 (9/2/669 - 28/1/670). Though Abu Ayyub was by then an old man, that did not deter him from enlisting. Shortly after {{engaging}} in battle, it is recorded that he fell ill and had to withdraw. Someone asked, [...] "Do you need anything, Abu Ayyub?" [...] To which Abu Ayyub replied, [...] "Convey my salaams (Islamic greeting and farewell) to the Muslim armies and tell them, [...] "Abu Ayyub urges you to penetrate deep into enemy territory, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go; and that you should carry him with you, and that you should bury him under your feet at the walls of Constantinople." [...] Whereupon, he passed away. The Muslim army fulfilled his request and pushed back the enemy's forces {{until they reached the}} walls of Constantinople where Abu Ayyub was finally interred.|$|E

6000|$|You I {{propose to}} move against Johnston's army, to break it up [...] and {{to get into the}} {{interior}} of the enemy's country <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> [...] <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> inflicting all the damage <b>you</b> <b>can</b> against their war [...] resources.|$|R
5000|$|From me out <b>can</b> <b>you</b> that do = 'As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> I'm concerned, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s that landlord," [...] ses Ginger; [...] "there’s straw down in {{the road}} outside, {{and they say that}} he’s dying. Pore old Bill don’t know ’is own strength. The best thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, old pal, is to go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> away <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go, John," [...] {{she told}} the man, [...] "but you must get back at six o'clock. The country, mind--not the shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to windward," [...] he shouted, {{and while}} she awkwardly obeyed the {{half-breed}} got up {{on the side of}} the canoe.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all over; {{get back}} as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to the woods," [...] whispered the oldest Rover boy, {{and led the}} way with the others at his heels.|$|E
50|$|Beach Buggy Blitz {{is built}} around an “infinite drive” {{mechanic}} that challenges <b>you</b> to drive <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> collect coins {{along the way to}} upgrade or paint your car, unlock new vehicles and drivers, even customize the game itself with new powerups and consumables.|$|R
6000|$|Numa growled. [...] "You look hungry, Numa," [...] {{continued}} the ape-man. [...] "You {{must have been}} very hungry to eat all the grass from your lair and even the bark from the tree <b>as</b> <b>far</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> reach. Would <b>you</b> like another German?" [...] and smiling he turned away.|$|R
6000|$|When {{all this}} was done, - I don't know in how many days or how few, but it matters not, - Mr. Hawkyard stepped in at the door, {{remaining}} close to it, and said, 'Go and stand against the opposite wall, George Silverman. As <b>far</b> off <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> That'll do. How do you feel?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "North, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Let's {{get away}} from the boats and {{trippers}} and imagine we're back in the woods where you helped me catch the big gray trout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; {{the family}} {{have always been}} {{respected}} here. Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A beginning. Two men can't do much, {{but more}} are coming. In {{a year or}} two the wheat will run as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, and there'll be homesteads all along the skyline." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> I'm {{concerned}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stay on {{here when}} you've {{got a job}} if it's convenient. The room's there, {{and the woman who}} did for me before can come in to look after the baby." ...|$|R
60|$|HASTINGS. Why, {{strictly}} speaking, he is not. The Doctor {{has gone}} over the road to fetch a paper connected with his proposal. But he hasn't <b>far</b> to go, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see. That's his red lamp {{at the end of}} his grounds.|$|R
30|$|Q 3. Now I {{have a few}} {{questions}} about your planning process for the class I’ll be observing on [fill in day]. I’d like {{you to think about}} how you went about preparing for this class, starting <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> in the planning process, and walk me through the exact steps that you went through, paying particular attention to specific points at which you made important decisions about things like course content and/or teaching strategies-activities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Prescott thoughtfully, [...] "I {{guess that}} would be wiser. You want to keep his mind at rest as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Of course, there's a big chance that I may fail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Herky! You {{run up the}} brook. Light a match, {{and drop}} it every hundred feet. Be sure it catches. Lucky there's little wind down here. Go as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> I'll run down!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Festing thoughtfully, [...] "it {{might be}} better {{to keep out of}} his way as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> I don't know that he's likely to do us harm, but wish he had gone somewhere else." ...|$|E
6000|$|Young Friedrich, as his Father had done, {{considers}} it unnecessary to be crowned. Old Friedrich, {{first of the}} name, and of the King series, we did see crowned, with a pinch of snuff tempering the solemnities. That Coronation once well done suffices all his descendants hitherto. Such an expense of money,--of diluted mendacity too! Such haranguing, gesturing, symbolic fugling, all grown half false:--avoid lying, even with your eyes, or knees, or the coat upon your back, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> easily <b>can!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must do our best," [...] said Ned, [...] "and {{trust in}} God. You keep close to me, Gerald, {{and when you}} want aid I will assist <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> I <b>can.</b> <b>You</b> swim fairly, but scarce well enough, unaided, to get through that surf yonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Six! There now. Add up {{and count}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> six, <b>can</b> <b>you?</b> Well, that's a clever little girl, a clever little girl. And {{if she has}} to drink a spoonful of medicine, she won't make a murmur, I'll be bound. Not like some little girls. What? Eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] he said, [...] "your {{eyes are}} better than mine. You see the road there? Look along it, between the white posts, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> What {{do you make of}} that black speck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Walk {{along as}} <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and get down as lightly as {{possible}} on to a firm piece of ground. It rises rapidly here and is, I expect, a dry soil where {{the upper end of}} the tree lies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I lift {{my voice}} to God, brother," [...] said Gideon, softly, [...] "drop {{on your face}} and crawl as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> in a {{straight}} line in my shadow, then break for the tules. I will stand between you and their first fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{very well}} so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> it goes. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> depend on me," [...] the great man said, [...] "for {{unlimited}} interest. But I'm only, after all, one element in fifty. We must gather in plenty of others. Don't mind who knows. Knows, I mean, that you and I are friends." ...|$|R
500|$|Those {{who attempt}} to {{understand}} works like Show Boat and Porgy and Bess {{through the eyes of}} their creators usually consider that the show [...] "was a statement AGAINST racism. That was the point of Edna Ferber's novel. That was the point of the show. That's how Oscar wrote it...I think this is about <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from racism <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get." ...|$|R
6000|$|The cone {{was then}} {{deposited}} on the table, and [...] "Maud" [...] said: [...] "If Mr. Garland and Mr. Fowler will go quietly up to mama's side, holding {{all the time}} tightly to the threads, 'Mr. Mitchell' will do what Mr. Garland so much desires. Please be {{very careful not to}} touch mama until I tell <b>you.</b> Keep <b>as</b> <b>far</b> apart <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go up to her. When you reach my mama's side, you may put one hand on her head and one on her wrist. 'Mr. Mitchell' says please have Frank take Mrs. Fowler's hands, so that every hand in the circle is accounted for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men, women, and {{children}} live in these houses; {{and if you were}} to spread them all over the ice here, away as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see in every direction, you {{would not be able to}} see the ice at all for the houses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! no!" [...] I hurriedly replied, [...] "I can't do {{anything}} like that. I'm {{going to try to}} just pull him out lengthwise. You take hold of the pole and go in shore as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and I'll try and get hold of the line." ...|$|E
6000|$|Let us confess, then, {{that the}} Passion of Christ, and {{the mystery of}} Good Friday, is as {{reasonable}} a belief to the truly wise, as it is comfortable to the weary and the suffering; let us agree {{that one of the}} wisest of Englishmen, of late gone to his rest, spoke well when he said, [...] "As long as women and sorrow exist on earth, so long will the gospel of Christianity find an echo in the human heart." [...] Let it find an echo in yours. But it will only find one, in as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> enter into the mystery of Passion-week; in as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> learn from Passion-week the truest and highest theology; and see what God is like, and therefore what you must try to be like likewise.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so pretty, {{when the}} vines leaf out and hang down in long festoons," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "The birds build their nests in it. A pair of wild {{canaries}} come here every summer. And ferns grow {{out between the}} stones of the well <b>as</b> <b>far</b> down <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see. The water is lovely. Uncle Edward preached his finest sermon about the Bethlehem well where David's soldiers went to get him water, and he illustrated it by describing his old well at the homestead--this very well--and how in foreign lands he had longed for its sparkling water. So you see it is quite famous." ...|$|R

As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Roxburgh <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> of course, ride as my squire; but beyond, you must travel in disguise. This {{you had better}} procure here, and take with you; for {{although}} the Governor of Roxburgh is a trusty knight, it were best that no soul should know that you go {{on a mission to}} March; and I shall simply give you a letter to him, stating that you are engaged in a venture in my service, and that your horse and armour are to be kept for you, until your return." ...|$|R
