5|$|In early 1859, at {{the close}} of a {{turbulent}} period, Wallachia and Moldavia entered a personal union, later formalized as the Romanian United Principalities, under Moldavian-born Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza (himself a former revolutionary). Having been allowed to return from exile after the Treaty of Paris, most of the surviving revolutionaries played a major part in the political developments, and organized themselves as Partida Națională, which promoted Cuza during simultaneous elections for the ad hoc <b>Divans.</b> The role of Paris-based Wallachian émigrés in promoting sympathy for common Romanian goals was decisive. Partida succeeded in becoming the major factor in Romanian political life, before forming the basis of the liberal current. With Cuza's rule, the pace of Westernization increased, and, during the 1860s, a moderate land reform was carried out, monastery estates were secularized, while corvées and boyar ranks were outlawed.|$|E
25|$|In {{a manner}} similar to Byzantine {{administrative}} practices, Muawiyah instituted several bureaucracies, called <b>divans,</b> to aid him in the governance and the centralization of the caliphate and the empire. Early Arabic sources credit two diwans in particular to Muawiyah: the Diwan al-Khatam (chancellery) and the Barid (postal service), both of which greatly improved communications within the empire.|$|E
25|$|After {{an intense}} campaign, a formal union was {{ultimately}} granted: nevertheless, {{elections for the}} ad hoc <b>divans</b> of 1859 profited from a legal ambiguity (the text of the final agreement specified two thrones, but did not prevent any single person from simultaneously taking part in and winning elections in both Bucharest and Iași). Alexander John Cuza, who ran for the unionist Partida Națională, won the elections in Moldavia on January 5; Wallachia, which was expected by the unionists to carry the same vote, returned a majority of anti-unionists to its divan.|$|E

Abraham Mar Thoma spoke about these notorious acts and visited {{those who were}} jailed by him. He further visited the Maharaja of Travancore and complaint about <b>Divans</b> tyrannical rule. Marthoma church at this point passed a church resolution against Divan and independent Travancore which infuriated the divan and ordered for the Metropolitans arrest and imprisonment. However the arrest order was not executed. It was all done at a point of time when other churches and communities of Travancore praised divan or feared to utter a word against the divan. Later the Marthoma church had {{to pay the price}} for that social action. The land allotted in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram to construct a church by Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal was taken back. Marthoma church was selectively targeted by Divan, by not giving permissions for construction of cemeteries and new church buildings.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{domination}} ended abruptly {{after the}} Crimean War, when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities {{under the tutelage}} of Great European Powers (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Austrian Empire, the French Empire, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, and Prussia). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely. In September 1857, given that Caimacam Nicolae Vogoride had perpetrated fraud in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad-hoc <b>divans,</b> which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a liberal and neutral state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the Paris Convention), whereby a limited union was to be enforced – separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies (a Court of Cassation and a Central Commission residing in Focșani); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around Bolhrad, Cahul, and Izmail.|$|E
25|$|With the {{institution}} in 1932 of a bicameral legislature in Travancore, four Saint Thomas Christians {{found a place}} in among the 24 seats of the lower house, but not comparable with other forward castes. The 1931 census recorded over 31 per cent of the population as being Christian, compared to around 4 per cent in 1820. Some restrictions were imposed on Saint Thomas Christian parishes to start new schools and later on the Diwan attempted {{to take over the}} schools owned by the community. In 1933, some prominent Saint Thomas Christians, including T. M. Varghese, worked to organize other communities on a common platform called the Joint Political Congress, which then decided to abstain from participation in the assembly elections, an action that has become known as the Abstention Movement. There followed a period of fierce confrontation between the Diwan and Saint Thomas Christians—many leaders were arrested, prominent news papers were banned and large banks owned by the community members were liquidated. But the agitations continued and to resolve the issue, government appointed a franchise and delimitation commissioner {{to solve the problem of}} representation in the legislator with special reference to backward communities. Though there was no definite assurance to Saint Thomas Christians, Joint Political Congress decided to withdraw the agitation. According to the recommendations of commissioner, franchise power was extended beyond the caste bars. In 1937, general elections were held and Joint Political Congress played a significant role to attain much better representation for allied communities. T.M. Varghese was elected as the Deputy President of the Assembly where Iyer was the ex officio President. On the collapse of Joint Political Congress due to internal conflicts, Saint Thomas Christian leaders allied with Nairs in a common platform- Travancore State Congress where they fought together for responsible government and also to oust Iyer. Many Saint Thomas Christian bishops like Metropolitans Abraham Mar Thoma, Yuhanon Marthoma, Mar James Kalaserry supported the nationalistic movements in 1930s and 1940s. Abraham Marthoma mobilised Syrian Christians against <b>divans</b> move not to unite with free India. Following intense agitations by the Travancore State Congress, the Maharaja of Travancore announced plans to establish a responsible Government. As per the announcement on 4 September 1947, the new Assembly called the Representative Body was formed to function as a Constituent Assembly. The Assembly held its first sitting on 20 March 1948 with President A. J. John, Anaparambil, a Saint Thomas Christian leader in the chair. In the three-member Cabinet of Travancore formed after the first general elections in 1948, Varghese was a Cabinet Minister. However the first Saint Thomas Christian to become a minister in the central government of India was Padma Vibhushan John Mathai, who served as India's first Railway Minister and subsequently as India's Finance Minister, taking office shortly after the presentation of India's first Budget, in 1948.|$|E

The walls were principally mahogany and gold, with a little color in the comparatively small wall-spaces left between openings.

The viziers then carried out his orders.

40|$|Ankara : Türk Edebiyatı Bölümü, Bilkent Üniversitesi, 2008. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2008. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 123 - 126. There is {{a general}} consensus among Ottoman literary scholars that <b>Divan</b> poetry does not give us the “description” of real “nature” and daily life. This point of view relies {{on the assumption that}} <b>Divan</b> poets could only produce stereotypes. In other words, nature or daily life could not be depicted but could only be “stylized” by <b>Divan</b> poets, each one of whom might be regarded as a stylist. On the other hand, this argument includes some implications that <b>Divan</b> poets have a “static” not a “dynamic” style: in this respect, <b>Divan</b> poetry is viewed as having remained the same for centuries. Another point of view claims that, among <b>Divan</b> poets, only Nedim was able to depict the real world and certain “spaces” which belonged to his daily life. A sample from different periods of <b>Divan</b> poetry demonstrates that the description of real nature and daily life has been the result of a transformation during different periods of <b>Divan</b> poetry. The sample features some poets representative of their periods, such as Necati Bey, Bâkî, Nef’î and Nedim. This thesis aims to display the transformation from stylization of nature to description of certain spaces in <b>Divan</b> poetry by focusing on “nesibs”— the introductory parts of the “kasides”—where one can see nature and space realistically.
