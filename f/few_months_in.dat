5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job for more than a <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> <b>In</b> an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E

He also began teaching young people from deprived backgrounds how to coach in a community scheme called Soccer Skills, and later worked in the special education sector. He set up his own educational consultancy that specialised in working with NEETs, in partnership with Brooklands College.|$|E

For a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|The private ferry {{struggled}} {{to operate at}} a profit, leading Kitsap Transit to consider a new ballot measure to fund a public passenger-only ferry service. A 0.3 percent sales tax {{was placed on the}} February 6, 2007, ballot, and was rejected by 54.5 percent of voters. As a result, Kitsap Transit pulled its funding for the private Kitsap Ferry Company, and the company suspended service on March 30, 2007. Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle after a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E

5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only {{to learn that the}} peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|Glee {{debuted in}} America on the Fox network on May19, 2009. Series creator Ryan Murphy planned to include {{five to eight}} musical numbers per episode, and to release {{accompanying}} soundtrack albums every <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> <b>In</b> the week prior to the broadcast of the pilot episode, Murphy stated that seven different companies had bid on {{the rights to the}} series' first soundtrack. The contenders were narrowed down to four labels, with Fox ultimately signing a deal with Columbia Records as a result of chairman Rob Stringer's belief that Glee would be a success. Stringer appreciated the series' use of both classic and contemporary pop music. He suggested that other record labels underestimated the potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E

It lasted only a few months, as in June 1909 Deakin returned as prime minister {{at the head of the}} new Commonwealth Liberal Party (a merger of the Protectionists and the Anti-Socialist Party).|$|E
