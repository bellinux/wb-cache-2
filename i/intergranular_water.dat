40|$|That the {{equilibrium}} state of impurity-free polycrystalline ice contains {{water has been}} {{expressed in terms of}} free-energy changes, and further developed to show that liquid in cavities formed at grain junctions in a microcrystalline solid containing no impurities affects its electrical properties and increases its heat capacity. General formulas for the volume of a liquid contained in the pockets formed at four-grain junctions and veins formed at three-grain junctions in equilibrium in an impurity-free polycrystalline mass are given. The variation of the volume fraction of <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> in impurity-free ice and the ice's total free energy have been calculated for different grain sizes and temperatures. Calculations also confirm that <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> or premelting contributes significantly to the pure ice's heat capacity. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{forms of}} water and their thermal {{stability}} in bedded salt are crucial in determining the material's suitability for heat-generating nuclear waste storage. Here we show first-of-its-kind incoherent inelastic neutron scattering (IINS) results of bedded salts to distinguish three water environments: <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> molecules confined to grain boundaries, water trapped as brine in fluid inclusions, and structural water in intracrystalline hydrous minerals. Sixteen spectral lines can be distinguished unambiguously in the 0 - 1100 cm(- 1) multiphonon and librational domain, yielding an unprecedented high resolution for a natural material. The spectral response to temperature illustrates the bimodality of the technique enabling the <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> component to be distinguished from that of brine, shedding light on a nearly 30 -year-old problem in characterizing different forms of water in rock salt. This pioneering study shows that IINS provides insight into the cause and effect of moisture migration and its coupling to thermomechanical properties in salt formations. Our results are pertinent to subsurface energy exploration and storage, including nuclear waste storage, in salts...|$|E
40|$|The air {{trapped in}} freshly formed ice gives {{information}} concerning the ice formation processes as weH as concerning severa,l environmental parameters {{at the time of}} ice formation. Air arnount, air composition, and the size and form of bubbles may change with time. Possible processes responsible for such changes are discussed. In very cold ice air content and air composition remain almost unchanged. Samples of ancient atmospheric air are therefore very weH preserved in cold ice. In temperate ice changes of the air amount and air composition depend on the <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> fiow through the glacier.

40|$|The Antarctic CM 2 {{carbonaceous}} chondrite QUE 93005 contains four compositionally distinct carbonates, namely breunnerite, calcite, dolomite and a Ca-poor dolomite. These carbonates can form monomineralic grains, {{or may be}} intergrown as bimineralic grains consisting of dolomite plus breunnerite and dolomite plus calcite, or polymineralic grains containing an intergrowth of breunnerite, Ca-poor dolomite and calcite. Carbonates in all grain types have inclusions of Fe,Ni sulphides and/or Mg-Fe phyllosilicates. In the bimineralic grains dolomite crystallised first to be overgrown by breunnerite or partially replaced by calcite. Polymineralic grains are concentrically layered, with breunnerite crystallising first on pore margins to be later etched, then overgrown and partially replaced by Ca-poor dolomite that was itself partly dissolved prior to being overgrown by calcite. Calcite and dolomite have also cemented fractures that cross-cut the fine-grained rims to aqueously altered chondrules and were formed by expansion of the chondrules during their hydration. Overall, the sequence of mineralisation in QUE 93005 was: (1) dolomite, (2) breunnerite, (3) Ca-poor dolomite then (4) calcite. This secular change in carbonate composition and mineralogy reflects changing solution composition and probably also provenance. Mg-Fe phyllosilicates replaced dolomite, breunnerite and Ca-poor dolomite prior to calcite crystallisation and {{most or all of}} the sulphides formed after both the phyllosilicates and calcite. Following sulphide crystallisation the edges of carbonate grains were abraded, either by impact ‘gardening’ or as a consequence of fluidisation of the matrix during rapid loss of gas or vapour. Determination of the crystallisation age of dolomite via the MnCr system indicates that aqueous alteration of QUE 93005 began on or before 3. 93 &# 177; 0. 23 Ma after the formation of the solar system. Overall, the water/rock ratio and f O 2 during alteration of QUE 93005 was {{similar to that of the}} CM 1 s and CR 1 s, but the lower degree of alteration of QUE 93005 overall suggests that alteration timescales were shorter, possibly due to loss of <b>intergranular</b> liquid <b>water</b> during fluidisation...|$|R

Also, it was performed determination the groundwater quality. The definition of the hydrogeological features was done {{on the basis of}} the data obtained by making several exploitation wells and pollution vulnerability assessment by hydrogeological data and filtration characteristics aquifer’s overlay sediments. The aquifer Grdovski Orman is aquifer with free level, set in collector area of quaternary alluvial sediments built of different granulated sand and gravel which are characterized by <b>intergranular</b> porosity. <b>Water</b> bearing environment extends to a depth of 44 to 50 m and it is not a single continuous aquifer layer here it is presented in aquifers whose number ranges from 1 - 4. Under water bearing environment have insulating environment built from poorly compressed clayed sands and clays with a small percentage of gravel different granulated. Groundwater level in wells is depth which ranges from 2. 97 - 3. 75 m. Projected capacity of the wells ranges from 15 to 40 l/s. Recharging of the aquifer is mostly done by waters of the Bregalnica which is in direct hydraulic connection, and in one part is recharged by water derived from atmospheric precipitation and from surrounding aquifers located at higher hypsometric level. According to data obtained by testing of the exploitation and exploration- exploitation wells medium filtration coefficient of the aquifers is 95 m/day. Overlay sediments represent two-layered porous setting built of two lithological units with different granulometric and filtration characteristics. The first one is built of sand and gravel with a mean filtration coefficient Kf = 52 m / day), and the second is made of sand with minor presence of gravel and dust and has a lower mean filtration coefficient, Kf = 0. 42 m/day. By chemical analyses were analyzed primary compounds of cations: Na, Ca, Mg and anions Cl, HCO 3, SO 4, NO 3 and NH 4, as well as a number of chemical elements that belong to the microcompunds group. According to the mineralization the waters belong to the group of slightly mineralized waters, and after Alekin classification they belong to the hydrocarbon class, calcite group, second type of waters. Based on the hydrogeological and filtration characteristics water bearing and overlay sediments aquifer Grdovski Orman is found that groundwater of this aquifer are within a geological environment that is highly vulnerable to pollution.

40|$|To {{survive in}} deep {{subsurface}} environments, lithotrophic microbial communities require a sustainable energy source such as hydrogen. Though H 2 {{can be produced}} when water reacts with fresh mineral surfaces and oxidizes ferrous iron, this reaction is unreliable since it depends upon the exposure of fresh rock surfaces via the episodic opening of cracks and fissures. A more reliable and potentially more voluminous H 2 source exists in nominally anhydrous minerals of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Our experimental results indicate that H 2 molecules {{can be derived from}} small amounts of H 2 O dissolved in minerals in the form of hydroxyl, OH- or O 3 Si-OH, whenever such minerals crystallized in an H 2 O-laden environment. Two types of experiments were conducted. Single crystal fracture experiments indicated that hydroxyl pairs undergo an in situ redox conversion to H 2 molecules plus peroxy links, O 3 Si/OO 3. While the peroxy links become part of the mineral structure, the H 2 molecules diffused out of the freshly fractured mineral surfaces. If such a mechanism occurred in natural settings, the entire rock column would become a volume source of H 2. Crushing experiments to facilitate the outdiffusion of H 2 were conducted with common crustal igneous rocks such as granite, andesite, and labradorite. At least 70 nmol of H 2 /g diffused out of coarsely crushed andesite, equivalent at standard pressure and temperature to 5, 000 cm 3 of H 2 /m 3 of rock. In the water-saturated, biologically relevant upper portion of the rock column, the diffusion of H 2 out of the minerals will be buffered by H 2 saturation of the <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> film...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSmall-scale shear zones {{within the}} Permian Truzzo meta-granite {{developed}} during the Alpine orogeny at amphibolite facies conditions. In these shear zones magmatic quartz deformed by dislocation creep and recrystallized dynamically by grain boundary migration with minor subgrain rotation recrystallization to a grain size of around 250 – 750 μm, consistent with flow at low differential stresses. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals very low water contents {{in the interior of}} recrystallized grains (in the form of discrete OH peaks, ~ 20 H/ 10 6 Si and very little broad band absorption, < 100 H/ 10 6 Si). The spectral characteristics are comparable to those of dry Brazil quartz. In FTIR spectra, magmatic quartz grains show a broad absorption band related with high water concentrations only in those areas where fluid inclusions are present while other areas are dry. Drainage of fluid inclusions and synkinematic growth of hydrous minerals indicates that a hydrous fluid has been available during deformation. Loss of intragranular water during grain boundary migration recrystallization did not result in a microstructure indicative of hardening. These FTIR measurements provide the first evidence that quartz with extremely low intragranular water contents can deform in nature by dislocation creep at low differential stresses. Low intragranular water contents in naturally deformed quartz may not be necessarily indicative of a high strength, and the results are contrary to implications taken from deformation experiments where very high water contents are required to allow dislocation creep in quartz. It is suggested that dislocation creep of quartz in the Truzzo meta-granite is possible to occur at low differential stresses because sufficient amounts of <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> ensure a high recovery rate by grain boundary migration while the absence of significant amounts of intragranular water is not crucial at natural conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} <b>intergranular</b> <b>water</b> on the {{conductivity}} of polycrystalline brucite, Mg(OH) 2, was investigated using impedance spectroscopy at 2 GPa, during consecutive heating-cooling cycles in the 298 - 980 K range. The grain boundary hydration levels tested here span water activities from around unity (wet conditions) down to 10 − 4 (dry conditions) depending on temperature. Four {{orders of magnitude}} in water activity result in electrical conductivity variations for about 6 - 7 orders of magnitude at 2 GPa and room temperature. Wet brucite samples containing, initially, about 18 wt% of evaporable water (i. e. totally removed at temperatures below 393 K in air), display electrical conductivity values above 10 − 2 - 10 − 3 S/m. A. C. electrical conductivity {{as a function of}} temperature follows an Arrhenius behaviour with an activation energy of 0. 11 eV. The electrical conductivity of the same polycrystalline brucite material dried beforehand at 393 K (dry conditions) is lower by about 5 - 6 orders of magnitude at room temperature and possesses an activation energy of 0. 8 - 0. 9 eV which is close to that of protonic diffusion in (001) brucitic planes. Above ca. 873 K, a non-reversible conductivity jump is observed which is interpreted as a water transfer from mineral bulk to grain boundaries (i. e. partial dehydration). Cooling of such partially dehydrated sample shows electrical conductivities much higher than those of the initially dry sample by 4 orders of magnitude at 500 K. Furthermore, the corresponding activation energy is decreased by a factor of about four (i. e. 0. 21 eV). Buffering of the sample at low water activity has been achieved by adding CaO or MgO, two hygroscopic compounds, to the starting material. Then, sample conductivities reached the lowest values encountered in this study with the activation energy of 1. 1 eV. The strong dependency of the electrical conductivity with water activity highlights the importance of the latter parameter as a controlling factor of diffusion rates in natural processes where water availability and activity may vary grandly. Water exchange between mineral bulk and mineral boundary suggests that grain boundary can be treated as an independent phase in dehydroxylation reactions...|$|E
