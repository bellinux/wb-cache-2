5000|$|In late 1989, Shimano {{introduced}} their [...] "Rapidfire" [...] shifting for mountain bikes. This brought indexed {{shifting to}} the handlebars - something previously only available on downtube shifters or thumb shifters. This mechanism operates like a ratchet, the larger lever applying tension to the <b>gear</b> <b>cable,</b> the smaller one incrementally releasing it. The Rapidfire mechanism was subsequently adapted {{to be used}} in STI levers.|$|E
50|$|After the {{cease-fire}} in Vietnam in 1973, Enterprise proceeded to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, where the carrier was altered and refitted {{to support the}} Navy's newest fighter aircraft - the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. Two of four jet blast deflectors were enlarged to accommodate the Tomcat. The No. 4 propulsion shaft was replaced; it had been bent when its screw became fouled in a discarded arresting <b>gear</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

50|$|Colnago built {{a couple}} of bikes for the Italian cyclocross and MTB {{champion}} Luca Bramati. Bramati rode a yellow steel, lugless Colnago cyclocross bike in the '96 Worlds in Munich, considered {{to be one of}} the most exciting races ever, where he placed third. His bike had a front fork with a traditional brazed fork crown, and full front/rear <b>gear</b> <b>cable</b> brazings. The tubing looks just slightly oversized, and overall the bike looks quite similar to Bramati's Colnago MTB that he raced in Atlanta in the '96 Olympics.|$|E
50|$|The brief rest {{ended when}} the task group sailed {{back to the}} Bonins on 30 June. The task force's planes struck at Iwo Jima on 3 and 4 July, interdicting Japanese efforts to {{reinforce}} Guam. The warship's crew, however, suffered another loss on 4 July when ad arresting <b>gear</b> <b>cable</b> snapped and killed one man and injured three others. In preparation for the landings planned for Guam in mid-July, Bataans aircraft conducted sweeps over Pagan Island on 5 July and then repeatedly bombed Guam from 6 to 11 July. On 12 July, her forward elevator failed permanently and she received orders to head home for repairs. She steamed by way of Eniwetok and Oahu before arriving in San Francisco on 30 July.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} {{decided in the}} seventeenth stage. The rules in 1963 did not allow cyclists to change bicycles, unless there was a {{mechanical}} problem. Anquetil's team director, Raphaël Géminiani, thought that Anquetil could use a different bicycle on the ascent of the Col de la Forclaz, so he advised Anquetil to fake a mechanical problem on the start of that climb; Géminiani cut through a <b>gear</b> <b>cable,</b> and claimed that it snapped. Anquetil could thus use a light bicycle with lower gears, especially suited for a climb, which gave him an advantage on his competitors. Bahamontes {{reached the top of}} the Forclaz first, and only Anquetil had been able to follow him. After the top, Anquetil got his regular bicycle back, and rode to the finish together with Bahamontes. Anquetil won the sprint, and the bonus time made him the new leader. As expected, Anquetil won some more time in the time trial in stage 19, and became the winner of the 1963 Tour.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of containment systems for aircraft landing on elevated STOL-ports was conducted {{as part of}} an overall study of human acceptance problems associated with STOL operations. The study included a survey and feasibility study of different concepts and a computer analysis of four arrestment systems. The principal conclusion was that a system referred to as the FAA system appears to offer the greatest promise. In this system, standard arresting <b>gear</b> <b>cables</b> are stretched across the roof-top, at roughly 100 -foot intervals, but are shielded over the 100 -foot-wide primary landing strip. Thus a pilot can land with an arresting hook down, but will not contact the cable unless he swerves off the landing strip, either because he has made a bad landing, or because his landing gear has failed. It was also noted that a suitable curb or guard rail should be developed. Presently available arresting gears and nylon net barriers were considered satisfactory for the overshoot problem...|$|R
50|$|Cyclo-cross {{bicycles}} generally resemble road racing bicycles. Cyclo-cross-specific frames {{differ with}} their wider tire clearances, knobby tires, cantilever or disc brakes, and lower <b>gearing.</b> <b>Cables</b> are generally routed {{on the upper}} side of the top tube, which allows the rider to carry the bike comfortably on the right shoulder through portage sections, and prevents cable contamination by dirt. Popular on many cyclocross bikes is routing the brakes so that the right brake is often the front brake. This is done to allow the left hand to control speed while approaching obstacles requiring the bike to be carried, while the right hand grips the frame ready to lift the bike onto the shoulder {{as soon as the}} rider`s feet touch the ground. As a high-end bicycle purpose-built for a specific sport competition, they also differ from ordinary cross bikes, which are general-purpose utility bikes fitted with slightly wider 700C tires for use on unpaved paths or trails.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{cable drive}} {{mechanism}} is proposed to implement high reduction <b>gear</b> ratio. <b>Cable</b> drive mechanism has great advantages such as light weight, {{high degree of}} freedom about design aspect and zero backlashes. However, it is restrictively utilized for robotic applications because {{it is difficult to}} implement high reduction gear ratio more than 10 to 1. Proposed mechanism enables multi-level reductions by adopting seamless winding method (SWM) which links the previous output axis and the next input axis. Consequently, this reduces the mechanical complexity significantly and enables high reduction with only one single wire cable. 3 D CAD design was provided and prototyp...|$|R

5000|$|The linear {{movement}} of the inner cable is most often used to transmit a pulling force, although push/pull cables have gained popularity in recent years e.g. as <b>gear</b> shift <b>cables.</b> Many light aircraft use a push/pull bowden cable for the throttle control, {{and here it is}} normal for the inner element to be solid wire, rather than a multi-strand cable. Usually provision is made for adjusting the cable tension using an inline hollow bolt (often called a [...] "barrel adjuster"), which lengthens or shortens the cable housing relative to a fixed anchor point. Lengthening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster out) tightens the cable; shortening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster in) loosens the cable.|$|R

40|$|The paper aims at the {{feasibility}} assessment of an innovative rotating to linear motion magnetic converter incorporating a gearing function for short distance and low capacity electric transport applications. The contact-less {{transmission of the}} mechanical power due to the interaction of two on-board sets of permanent magnets (PMs) enables more efficient and reliable operation with respect to conventional <b>geared</b> or <b>cable</b> driven vehicles. In the paper, first the thrust performances of a preliminary configuration are evaluated by finite element analyses, identifying the condition that maximizes the interaction between low and high-speed magnetic fields. Then, subsequent parametric analyses are operated to optimize the PMs size and magnetization {{as well as the}} shape of the track steel pieces. The final configuration is considered for an example of application in a vehicle, which can be conveniently fitted in urban inclined elevators or people movers...|$|R

5000|$|Progressive {{improvement}} was {{a feature of}} most cars in this period, but the number {{and nature of the}} changes affecting {{the early years of the}} Austin 1800 looked to some as though the car had been introduced without sufficient development work. A month after its launch, in December 1964, reclining front seats and the option of an arm rest in the middle of the back seat were added to the specification schedule. [...] A month later, in January 1965, the final drive ratio reverted to the 3.88:1 value used in the prototype, from the 4.2:1 ratio applied at launch: this was described as a response to [...] "oil-consumption problems": January 1965 also saw the indicator switch modified. [...] At the same time, higher gearing and reduced valve clearances cut the published power output by 2 bhp but cured the [...] "valve-crash" [...] reported by some buyers when approaching top speed on one of Britain's recently constructed motorways. [...] The manufacturer quietly replaced the [...] "flexible, flat-section dipstick" [...] which, it was said, had caused inattentive owners to overfill the sump after inserting the dipstick back to front so that the word [...] "Oil" [...] could not be seen on it. [...] Subsequent modifications included changing, repositioning and re-angling, the handbrake in October 1965, [...] removing the rear anti-roll bar and rearranging the rear suspension at the end of 1965, at the same time adjusting the steering to address a problem of tyre scuffing, [...] and fitting stronger engine side covers in January 1966 along with modified engine-mounting rubbers which now were [...] "resistant to de-bonding". [...] February 1965 saw water shields fitted to the rear hubs [...] and the car's steering rattle cured by the judicious fitting of a spacer, [...] while the propensity of early cars to jump out of first and second gears was addressed by the fitting of a [...] "synchroniser". [...] Further improvements followed the launch of the Morris 1800 early in 1966. <b>Gear</b> <b>cables</b> were revamped to deal with [...] "difficult engagement" [...] of first and third gears in cold weather, [...] and the seat mountings were adapted to increase rake in May 1966.|$|R
