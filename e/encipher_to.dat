50|$|Although the {{characteristics}} method no longer worked, {{the inclusion of}} the enciphered message key twice gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst Henryk Zygalski was able to exploit.

5000|$|A major {{weakness}} of the system, however, was that no letter could be <b>enciphered</b> <b>to</b> itself.

50|$|The Combined Naval Cipher No. 3, {{introduced}} on 20 January 1941, was {{set aside}} for both American and British use, for <b>enciphering</b> communications <b>to</b> and from Atlantic convoys.

50|$|SIGABA {{was similar}} to the Enigma in basic theory, in that it used a series of rotors <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> every {{character}} of the plaintext into a different character of ciphertext.

50|$|The Lorenz {{cipher machine}} had twelve wheels, and was thus most advanced, complex, faster {{and far more}} secure than the {{three-wheeled}} Enigma.

5000|$|The Alphabetum Kaldeorum {{was meant}} {{primarily}} for the encipherment of diplomatic correspondence; its alphabet implies that predominantly Latin texts were coded: u and v are equated; w was to be written as double v; j is missing. For frequently arising letters the Alphabetum Kaldeorum provides several different versions, which were used at random so that a decipherment attempt using the classical frequency analysis method should fail. [...] "Nulla", cipher-letters with no plaintext assignment which were to be ignored, were also often added <b>to</b> the <b>enciphered</b> texts <b>to</b> further render frequency-analysis useless.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was common}} <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> a message after first {{encoding}} it, {{to increase the}} difficulty of cryptanalysis. With a numerical code, this was commonly done with an [...] "additive" [...] - simply a long key number which was digit-by-digit added to the code groups, modulo 10. Unlike the codebooks, additives would be changed frequently. The famous Japanese Navy code, JN-25, was of this design.|$|R
5000|$|The Chaocipher system {{consists}} of two alphabets, with the [...] "right" [...] alphabet used for locating the plaintext letter while the other ("left") alphabet is used for reading the corresponding ciphertext letter.

It ensures that any access to information kept in database is authorized, thus preventing data from unauthorized altering, destroying, and modification. We propose a novel and simple information protection scheme in this paper. The main operations of this system are ceilings and floors functions on integer. The security of our scheme {{is based on the}} difficulty on breaking a trapdoor one-way hash function. In our scheme, a database manager needs to conduct an inner product between the protected information and the <b>enciphering</b> key <b>to</b> encrypt a record of the database. On the other hand, the manager is able to decrypt the record by conducting a multiplication and a modulus operation.

5000|$|In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an {{algorithm}} {{for performing}} encryption or decryption - {{a series of}} well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. <b>To</b> <b>encipher</b> or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, [...] "cipher" [...] is synonymous with [...] "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.|$|R
5000|$|The Stencil Subtractor {{frame was}} a ciphered text recyphering tool that {{was invented by}} British Army Intelligence Officer and {{cryptographer}} John Tiltman [...] and was ready for trial by April 1941 but was not adopted officially by the British Forces until March 1942, and not brought into service until June 1943. [...] It replaced the venerable and vulnerable Subtractor tables which had been previously used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> British military (Military communications) and civilian codes during World War II.|$|R
50|$|When {{captured}} German Enigma operators {{revealed that}} they had been instructed <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word eins ("one") appeared in 90% of messages. Turing automated the crib process, creating the Eins Catalogue, which assumed that eins was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for EINS with that day's wheel order and plugboard connections.|$|R
50|$|Holmes {{has no idea}} {{of which}} disk is used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> which letter, but he does know that the offset between the {{plaintext}} letter and the ciphertext letter must {{be the same for}} all ten characters. This gives him a way of penetrating the cipher by lining up the plaintext and ciphertext characters of the crib; forming them into pairs; determining the offsets for the plaintext letters and ciphertext letters for each disk; and then searching for a common offset in the matrix of offset.|$|R
5000|$|Rejewski also {{exploited}} cipher clerk laziness. Scores {{of messages}} would be enciphered by several cipher clerks, {{but some of}} those messages {{would have the same}} encrypted indicator. That meant that both clerks happened to choose the same three letter starting position. Such a collision should be rare with randomly selected starting positions, but lazy cipher clerks often chose starting positions such as [...] "AAA", [...] "BBB", or [...] "CCC". Those security mistakes allowed Rejewski to solve each of the six permutations used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> the indicator.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their personal weapons (which included an M1 carbine and a Colt automatic pistol for each member) and sabotage equipment, the teams dropped with the Type B Mark II radio, more {{commonly referred to as}} the B2 or [...] "Jed Set", which was critical for communicating with Special Force Headquarters in London. They were also issued pieces of silk with five hundred phrases that they were likely to use in radio traffic replaced with four-letter codes to save time in transmission, and one-time pads <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> their messages.|$|R
2500|$|The Allies had undisputed air superiority. In {{addition}} {{to the results of}} aerial reconnaissance, they also received reports from behind enemy lines from the reconnaissance units V Force and Z Force and the resistance liaison organisation Force 136. However, they lacked the detailed information available to commanders in Europe through Ultra radio intercepts. Japanese radio security was good; rather than cipher machines such as the Enigma machine, which the Ultra operation was able to decipher on a large scale, they used [...] "code books and then extremely tough <b>enciphering</b> methods <b>to</b> conceal the coded text..." [...] Japanese formation headquarters also sent far less compromising radio traffic than their German (or Allied) counterparts. Only {{near the end of the}} battle, when the Japanese signal and staff arrangements largely collapsed, did the Allies gain significant signals intelligence. Also, the Allied armies in the field had too few Japanese linguists, to translate intercepted messages and captured documents.|$|R
50|$|Rejewski {{could look}} at a day's cipher traffic and solve for the {{permutations}} at the six sequential positions used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> the indicator. Since Rejewski had the cipher key for the day, he knew and could factor out the plugboard permutation. He assumed the keyboard permutation {{was the same as}} the commercial Enigma, so he factored that out. He knew the rotor order, the ring settings, and the starting position. He developed a set of equations that would allow him to solve for the rightmost rotor wiring assuming the two rotors to the left did not move.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The simple {{improvement}} of the shift cipher we aimed in this paper is <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> more than twice which guarantee more security of information being sent across a communication channel. We adopt the more radical {{solution to the problem}} of key sharing developed by Diffie-Hellman, 1970, and demonstrate how keys can be exchanged by Romeo and Juliet. The exchange was done twice; the first being a single key while the second exchange was two different keys, making a total of three keys. Finally, we showed how the shift (Caesar) cipher can be modeled mathematically using transpositions in symmetric group, a set of all bijections of an object onto itself...|$|R
