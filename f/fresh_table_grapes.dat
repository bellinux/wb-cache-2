40|$|Aspergillus carbonarius and A. niger {{aggregate}} are {{the main}} fungal contaminants of table grapes. Besides their ability to cause black rot, they can produce ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin that has attracted increasing attention worldwide. The objective of this work was {{to set up a}} simple and rapid molecular method for the early detection of both fungi in table grapes before fungal development becomes evident. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assays were developed by designing species-specific primers based on the polyketide synthases (PKSS) sequences of A. carbonarius and A. niger that have recently been demonstrated to be involved in OTA biosynthesis. Three table grape varieties (Red globe, Crimson seedless, and Italia) were inoculated with A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate strains producing OTA. The extracted DNA from control (non-inoculated) and inoculated grapes was amplified by PCR using ACPKS 2 F-ACPKS 2 R for A. carbonarius and ANPKS 5 -ANPKS 6 for A. niger aggregate. Both primers allowed a clear detection, even in symptomless samples. PCR-based methods are considered to be a good alternative to traditional diagnostic means for the early detection of fungi in complex matrix for their high specificity and sensitivity.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the phenolic profile of Vitis vinifera L. cv. “Italia” table grapes during ripening, as influenced by the harvest date and berry heterogeneity. The results showed that this cultivar is rich in phenolic compounds with health-promoting properties, particularly at early harvest stage (341 and 178 mg/kg berries of total phenols in the skin and pulp, respectively). Caftaric acid was the most abundant compound in the skin (28. 95 – 51. 93 mg/kg), while p-coumaroyl-glucose was the highest in the pulp (6. 39 – 17. 18 mg/kg). Low levels of resveratrol (0. 11 – 0. 29 mg/kg) were found in the skin starting from day 14 of the harvest. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to model the evolution of phenolic compounds in berries during ripening. The regression models were highly significant for protocatechuic acid, catechin, epicatechin and t-resveratrol in the skin, and total hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids in the pulp (R ≥ 0. 80). This modeling could be a tool that would permit better exploitation of maximum accumulation of phenolic compounds in the vineyard by selecting the most suitable combination of sampling date and berry density. An adequate sampling strategy could be implemented to increase the content of specific bioactive phenolic compounds according to consumer preference, thus promoting the health-promoting quality of <b>fresh</b> <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> and ready-to-eat fruit salads...|$|E

40|$|Most {{agricultural}} water sources are often considered contaminated, due to poorly maintained sanitation systems, polluted river streams and other water catchment areas. Agricultural water used for irrigation and reconstitution of pesticides is suspected {{to play a}} direct or indirect role in the transmission of human pathogens to fresh produce. The contamination of <b>fresh</b> <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> during pesticide spraying can therefore {{be seen as a}} potential risk factor. This study focuses on identifying possible sources and levels of bacterial contamination in a river, holding dam and tank in table grape production areas. In addition, the ability of selected pathogens to attach and survive on table grape surfaces was studied using transmission electron microscopy. Water sources sampled in this study were found to be microbiologically contaminated. Microbial populations varied with season, sampling period within a season and water treatment conditions. No human pathogens were detected under natural field conditions on crops irrigated with contaminated water used for reconstituting agricultural pesticides. This study further showed a wide range of pesticide products that permitted survival and multiplication of most of the tested foodborne pathogens i. e. Escherichia coli 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. This information provides insight into the potential risk that may be associated with table grapes due to the use of contaminated water. These findings highlight the importance of considering pesticides used, water quality and spray schedules prior to application. Detailed risk assessment studies on the potential of contaminated irrigation water and the actual link with foodborne disease outbreaks have not been investigated and should in future be determined as well as intervention strategies.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the possibility of}} the domestic viticulture transition to the ecological (adaptive) management system, based on the use of highly adaptive varieties. Methods. Procedures are conventional in viticulture. All stages of agrobiological research were carried out according to the M. A. Lazarevskiy technique. The resistance of genetic resources to fungal diseases was assessed using the 9 -point scale on the natural infectious background with maximum damage. Organoleptic evaluation of wine and fresh grapes was performed using 8 -point and a 10 -point scales respectively.   Results. The main agrobiological traits (resistance to diseases, productivity and yield quality) of 22 perspective grape varieties and forms were studied. The level of resistance to fungal diseases was determined as one of the main criteria of the variety suitability for ecological (adaptive) viticulture. During five years, the average resistance level of this group of table and wine varieties was not lower than the relative one (6. 5 – 7 points), and in ‘Zagrei’ variety – up to 7, 5 points. The level of quality characteristics of products of new grape varieties and forms was determined (wine evaluation, marketability and assessment of <b>fresh</b> <b>table</b> <b>grapes).</b> Samples with a combination of high wine and grape quality characteristics and high productivity were selected. To replenish the gene pool of grapes by adaptive varieties, such perspective hybrid combinations as ‘Opalovyi’ ´ ‘Burmunk, ‘Avgustin’ ´ ‘Oryhinal and ‘Ohoniok tairovskyi’ ´ ‘Kardyshakh’ were studied. The level of group resistance to fungal diseases was identified and the perspective genotypes were preliminarily selected. Conclusions. The level of display of a number of economic characters in the group of perspective table and wine grape varieties and forms was determined. Highly adaptive and highly productive varieties and forms suitable for the use in the adaptive viticulture were defined.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{research}} that is being carried out into the relationship between food and consumers is progressively reinforced by continuous findings in literature confirming that consumers choose foods basing on their functional cognition and sensory perception, especially when buying fruit and vegetables. Therefore, {{it is important for}} table grape producers to be aware of consumers' concerns and preferences both, during the purchasing stage and after, during consumption at home, when experiential attributes have more importance. In both cases, sensory attributes {{play an important role in}} determining consumers' purchase behavior of table grape. Table grapes cv 'Italia' and 'Red Globe' are produced in South Italy (Sicily and Apulia) and appreciated by consumers for their superior taste and other intrinsic qualities, both in Italy and in other European countries. Nevertheless, harvested grapes of these cultivars deteriorate rapidly without post-harvest appropriate treatments, especially in terms of fungal rot, rachis browning, berry drop, softening, moisture loss and off flavor, and this fast deterioration is the main limitation to market acceptance. The objective of this study is to assess consumers preferences in regards to 22 sensory attributes of <b>fresh</b> <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> cv 'Italia' and 'Red Globe', after a cold storage treatment of 90 days at 1 ± 1 °C and 90 ± 2 % RH, combined with low SO 2 concentration.

Consumers were asked to score table grape sensory attributes, using a 9 -pt scale, after long storage of 30, 60 and 90 d. For this study, the table grapes were harvested from two locations, Canicattì and Naro during the last week of September and treated with SO 2 fumigation, with SSC > 14 %, for prolonging shelf life. Analysis of scores revealed that consumers preferred cv 'Italia' for its uniform color and no shades of berries and for a balanced tasting sugar/acidity ratio.

The reason to have these different processed products depends on the extreme perishability of the fruit. As fresh fruit, grapes are very delicate and the loss at harvest and during the distribution is very high.

40|$|The grape {{was one of}} {{the first}} fruits to be {{cultivated}} by man. Since the dawn of civilisation, the fermented product of grapes, wine, has probably been an important way of consuming grapes (McGovern et al. 1995). Wine residues have been identified in 7000 -year-old jars in Iran (McGovern et al. 1996). However, consumption of the fresh and dried fruit has probably always been popular where the vines grew wild. This chapter provides some basic information about the cultivation of grapes (this section) before looking at the physiology and biochemistry of the developing and mature grape berry. The final three sections of the chapter deal with post-harvest aspects of grapes pertaining to the three main product types: beverages (wine and juice), <b>fresh</b> fruit (<b>table</b> <b>grapes)</b> and dried fruit (sultanas, raisins and currants). Although today most grapes are converted to wine, the development of the post-harvest technology for grapes has concentrated on the fresh fruit. This is because all the eating-quality parameters (appearance, texture and taste) must be high in the commercial product. The quality of grapes for wine, drying or for other grape products is primarily dependent on harvesting the right varieties at the right time and preventing unwanted chemical changes during processing.
