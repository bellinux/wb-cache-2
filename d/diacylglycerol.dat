5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; <b>diacylglycerol</b> (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

Vasopressin increased the proportion of arachidonic acid and stearic acid and decreased the proportion of oleic acid present in the <b>diacylglycerols.</b> In hepatocytes prelabelled with [14 C]arachidonic acid, vasopressin increased the amount of [14 C]diacylglycerol. The effects of vasopressin on the total concentration of <b>diacylglycerols</b> and [14 C]diacylglycerol were mimicked by an exogenous phospholipid phosphodiesterase (phospholipase C) from Clostridium perfringens.

In the major thylakoid <b>diacylglycerols,</b> monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol, not only is there an increase in the level of unsaturation at low temperatures, but there is a change in the balance between molecular species of chloroplastic origin (16 / 18 C) and cytosolic origin (18 / 18 C). Radioactivity tracer data indicate that at low temperatures there are two distinct phases of desaturation in the fatty acids of the major <b>diacylglycerols</b> of these leaves. A rapid phase, which appears in plants grown at low temperatures and results in the desaturation of palmitic acid to hexadecadienoic acid and oleic acid to linoleic acid may explain the high levels of unsaturated fatty acids found in the leaf <b>diacylglycerols</b> from plants grown at low temperatures.

The in vivo pattern of labeling of acyl lipids, either from fatty acids synthesized `endogenously' from radioactive acetate or malonate, or from radioactive fatty acids added `exogenously', indicates the involvement of the following pathways in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols.

40|$|AbstractCeramides and <b>diacylglycerols</b> are lipids {{with a large}} {{hydrophobic}} part (acyl {{chains and}} long-chain base) whereas their polar function (hydroxyl group) is small. They need colipids with large head groups to coexist in bilayer membranes. In this study, we have determined how saturated and unsaturated ceramides and acyl-chain matched <b>diacylglycerols</b> form ordered domains in 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine bilayers {{as a function of}} bilayer concentration. The formation of ordered domains was determined from lifetime analysis of trans-parinaric acid. Ceramides formed ordered domains with equal average tPA lifetime at lower bilayer concentration when compared to acyl-chain matched <b>diacylglycerols.</b> This was true for both saturated (16 : 0) and mono-unsaturated (18 : 1) species. This finding suggested that hydrogen bonding among ceramides contributed to their more efficient ordered phase formation, since <b>diacylglycerols</b> do not form similar hydrogen bonding networks. The role of hydrogen bonding in ordered domain formation was further verified by using palmitoyl ceramide analogs with 2 N and 3 OH methylated long-chain bases. These analogs do not form hydrogen bonds from the 2 NH or the 3 OH, respectively. While methylation of the 3 OH did not affect ordered phase formation compared to native palmitoyl ceramide, 2 NH methylation markedly attenuated ceramide ordered phase formation. We conclude that in addition to acyl chain length, saturation, molecular order, and lack of large head group, also hydrogen bonding involving the 2 NH is crucial for efficient formation of ceramide-rich domains in fluid phosphatidylcholine bilayers...|$|R

Arachidonic acid (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound <b>diacylglycerol</b> (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of arachidonic acid into anandamide. Anandamide can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways. Anandamide and 2-AG can also be hydrolized into arachidonic acid, potentially leading to increased eicosanoid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{effector}} of the Gαq/11 pathway is phospholipase C-β (PLCβ), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) {{into the}} second messengers inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) and <b>diacylglycerol</b> (DAG). IP3 acts on IP3 receptors found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to elicit Ca2+ release from the ER, while DAG diffuses along the plasma membrane where it may activate any membrane localized forms of a second ser/thr kinase called protein kinase C (PKC). Since many isoforms of PKC are also activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, both these pathways can also converge on each other to signal through the same secondary effector. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ also binds and allosterically activates proteins called calmodulins, which in turn go on to bind and allosterically activate enzymes such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CAMKs).|$|E

The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain.

25|$|Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) {{functions}} as an intracellular second messenger, which initiates the intracellular release of calcium ions (which activates intracellular enzymes, causes {{the release of}} hormones and neurotransmitters from the cells {{in which they are}} stored, and causes smooth muscle contraction when released by IP3), and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which is then translocated from the cell cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Although inositol trisphosphate, (IP3), diffuses into the cytosol, <b>diacylglycerol</b> (DAG) remains within the plasma membrane, due to its hydrophobic properties. IP3 stimulates the release of calcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DAG is a physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC), promoting its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. PKC is a multifunctional protein kinase which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in many target proteins. However PKC is only active in the presence of calcium ions, and it is DAG that increases the affinity of PKC for Ca2+ and thereby renders it active at the physiological intracellular levels of this ion.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as inositol triphosphate, <b>diacylglycerol</b> and cyclic AMP), G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca2+ channels are able to survive and function {{in the absence of}} cAMP, ATP or protein kinase C when {{in the presence of the}} activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, Gα, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca2+ channel directly as an effector.

This direct gating has also been found in specific Ca2+ channels in the heart and skeletal muscle T tubules.|$|E
