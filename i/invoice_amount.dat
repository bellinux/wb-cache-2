5000|$|The {{sale of the}} {{receivable}} transfers {{ownership of}} the receivable to the factor, indicating the factor obtains all of the rights associated with the receivables. Accordingly, the receivable becomes the factor's asset, and the factor obtains the right to receive the payments made by the debtor for the <b>invoice</b> <b>amount,</b> and is free to pledge or exchange the receivable asset without unreasonable constraints or restrictions. Usually, the account debtor is notified of {{the sale of the}} receivable, and the factor bills the debtor and makes all collections; however, non-notification factoring, where the client (seller) collects the accounts sold to the factor, as agent of the factor, also occurs. The arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. [...] If the factoring transfers the receivable [...] "without recourse", the factor (purchaser of the receivable) must bear the loss if the account debtor does not pay the <b>invoice</b> <b>amount.</b> If the factoring transfers the receivable [...] "with recourse", the factor has the right to collect the unpaid <b>invoice</b> <b>amount</b> from the transferor (seller). However, any merchandise returns that may diminish the <b>invoice</b> <b>amount</b> that is collectible from the accounts receivable are typically the responsibility of the seller, and the factor will typically hold back paying the seller for a portion of the receivable being sold (the [...] "factor's holdback receivable") in order to cover the merchandise returns associated with the factored receivables until the privilege to return the merchandise expires.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The European Economic Union (EEU) {{adopted a}} single currency, the “euro” on January 1, 1999. Such a {{development}} has far-reaching implications {{for development of}} information systems, the engines {{that will have to}} run and control the new monetary order. For example, euro-compliant systems will need to accommodate: (1) six decimal places, a major change for those companies in countries that did not require decimal places (e. g., Belgium and Italy), or even those that require only two, (2) “triangulation ” between curren-cies rather than classic inversion, (3) multiple currencies for each transaction, and (4) differ-ences between <b>invoice</b> <b>amounts</b> and amounts actually paid, since there can be rounding differences on conversions with triangulation. These changes are just the surface require-ments for the euro currency change. Because the euro problem is very new, few companies have begun, let alone completed making, their euro systems changes. As a result, limited research is available regarding the euro. The {{purpose of this article is}} to help fill this void by examining the principal issues of the euro’s impact on information systems and to identify research opportunities related to the euro problem...|$|R

This paper examines, for the first time, the potential cost savings of e-invoicing in Belgium. Our analysis shows that {{the total cost of}} invoicing for Belgian private sector businesses in 2014 amounted to € 3. 47 billion (0. 96 % of GDP) and could be reduced to € 1. 46 billion (0. 38 % of GDP) if all invoices were sent digitally. Furthermore, an analysis of both barriers and enablers of e-invoicing reveals significant concerns that remain regarding the safety of e-invoicing, although a majority of private sector businesses clearly identifies the potential efficiency gains. From our contingent valuation survey among 683 Belgian businesses, we learn that the average willingness to pay (WTP) for the required investments for implementing digital <b>invoicing</b> <b>amounts</b> to € 2, 380.

When we do that, we have no gap between the way we understand problems and the way we implement their solutions. ” Bjarne Stroustrup Bits and transistors get a lot of press. They are the fundamental atoms in our digital world, the basic units that for some reason we often count in order to measure the size and power of our electronic creations. There are surely many professional software engineers who think in terms of bits and transistors when creating device drivers, operating systems or networking libraries. But end-user programmers have little reason to think in these terms. Ask an end-user programmer what his code does, and he will not say, “My application tells the transistors to do X, Y, and Z to my bits. ” Instead, he might explain that his web application collects the names and email addresses of people into a database. Or he might say that his spreadsheet computes the total invoice to be billed for each project. In other words, an end-user programmer’s world involves not bits but rather higher-level abstractions like person names, email addresses, <b>invoice</b> <b>amounts</b> and project numbers. Indeed, many professional software engineers also focus on such abstractions rather than raw bits when designing applications. For the most part, instances of these abstractions are concretely represented in applications as “strings”. Eve...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Global budget per {{calendar}} {{year is a}} traditional method of funding hospitals in Serbia. Diagnose related groups (DGR) is a method of hospital payment based on classification of patients into groups with clinically similar problems and similar utilization of hospital resources. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare current methods of hospital services payment with the projected costs by DRG payment method in urology. Methods. The data were obtained from the information system used in the Clinical Hospital Center “Dr. Dragiša Mišović” - Dedinje in Belgrade, Serbia. The implemented hospital information system was the main criterion for selection of healthcare institutions. The study included 994 randomly selected patients treated surgically and conservatively in 2012. Results. Average costs under the current payment method were slightly higher than those projected by DRG, however, the variability was twice as high (54, 111 ± 69, 789 compared to 53, 434 ± 32, 509, p < 0, 001) respectively. The univariate analysis showed that the highest correlation with the current payment method as well as with the projected one by DRG was observed in relation to the number of days of hospitalization (ρ = 0. 842, p < 0. 001, and ρ = 0. 637, p < 0. 001, respectively). Multivariate regression models confirmed the influence of the number of hospitalization days to costs under the current payment system (β = 0. 843, p < 0. 001) as well as under the projected DRG payment system (β = 0. 737, p < 0. 001). The same predictor was crucial for the difference in the current payment method and the projected DRG payment methods (β = 0. 501, p < 0. 001). Conclusion. Payment under the DRG system is administratively more complex because it requires detailed and standardized coding of diagnoses and procedures, as well as the information on the average consumption of resources (costs) per DRG. Given that aggregate costs of treatment under two hospital payment methods compared in the study are not significantly different, the focus on minor surgeries both under the current hospital payment method and under the introduced DRG system would be far more cost-effective for a hospital as great variations in treatment performance (reduction of days of hospitalization and complications), and consequently <b>invoiced</b> <b>amounts</b> would be reduced...|$|R

40|$|A {{construction}} contract is a contract specifically negotiated {{for the construction}} of an asset or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use. The primary issue in accounting for {{construction contract}}s is the allocation of contract revenues and contract costs to the periods in which the construction work is performed. Four approaches to accounting for construction contracts have developed over time: the completed-contract method, recognition based on cost incurred, the percentage-of-completion method and recognition based on invoicing. The basic principle of the completed-contract method is to recognize revenue only when it is certain, i. e. in the period when the contract is completed. During the period of performance no revenue is recognised and costs are accumulated in the balance sheet. The main disadvantage of this method is the lack of comparability of the presented amounts between single periods. On the other hand the method is based on the finally determined results, which means that the reported values are certain and cannot be manipulated by the company. Recognition based on costs incurred has the basic concept of recognizing profit only when it is certain. Thus the profit is recognised when the contract is finished. During the realization of the project revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred. Contract costs are recognised as an expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The amounts of expense presented in the income statement are fully comparable between accounting periods. The reported revenue has much lower volatility than when using the completed-contract method. This approach provides the users of financial statement with an indication of the volume of a company's business. Under the percentage-of-completion method contract revenue is matched with the contract costs incurred in reaching a stage of completion, resulting in a reported revenue, expenses and profit which {{can be attributed to the}} proportion of work completed. Financial statements based on this method present more accurately the relationships between the gross profit from contracts and related period costs. The main disadvantage is the dependence on estimates of contract revenue, contract costs and percentage of completion. The estimates can be made intentionally or unintentionally inaccurate. In contrast to the other approaches recognition based on invoicing has no theoretical concept. Contract revenue is recognized according to the <b>invoiced</b> <b>amounts</b> in the appropriate period. An expense is recognised in the amount of costs allocated to parts of the project, which are the object of invoicing. The fundamental disadvantage of this approach is the possibility of manipulation of the amounts of recognized revenue and expenses. The presented amounts can be very different in similar economic situations. For the users of financial statements, the percentage-of-completion method is preferable, because this method provides useful information on the extent of contract activity and performance during a period. The presented amounts are fully comparable between accounting periods. On 24 June 2010 the IASB and FASB published an exposure draft Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This new standard should supercede IAS 11. It has another approach to revenue recognition, but it doesn't mean that the presented values of construction contracts will differ significantly...|$|R

50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to accelerate payment for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash discount for early payment of its <b>invoices</b> - the <b>amount</b> of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and freely negotiable.|$|R
