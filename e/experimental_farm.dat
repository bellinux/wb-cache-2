5|$|Agriculture in {{the area}} was spurred by food and fodder {{shortages}} during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916. Fairbanks businessmen also encouraged the growth of farming. Wickersham provided more funding for the <b>experimental</b> <b>farm,</b> the Tanana Valley Railroad provided free grain seed acquired from an <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> in Sweden, and William Fentress Thompson, editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, wrote frequent editorials {{in favor of more}} farming. Prominent Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming. Farmers also created the Tanana Valley State Fair in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success. It is Alaska's oldest state fair and still operates today. Despite these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success. A farmers' bank established in 1917 to provide loans for equipment purchases went out of business two years later, and although the Alaska Railroad allowed for cheaper shipment of tractors and other agricultural equipment, it also permitted a steady supply of food shipments to Fairbanks. In 1929, Alaska farms met only about 10 percent of the state's food demand. By 1931, the University of Alaska had grown {{to the point that the}} <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> was annexed by the school.|$|E
5|$|The {{site for}} the school was {{directly}} north of the U.S. Agricultural Experimental Station (Tanana Valley), an <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> created by Charles Christian Georgeson in 1907. The farm was a project by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explore the agricultural potential of Interior Alaska. By 1916, {{one year after the}} founding of the University of Alaska, the <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> employed 20 people. As mining declined in the Fairbanks area, some miners turned to homesteading. Under the Homestead Act, many miners applied for grants of land from the federal government and established farms around the city. A 1919 survey by the U.S. Geological Survey identified 94 homesteads within six miles of Fairbanks. Also listed were two tungsten mills and 16 gold mills.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{accessible}} {{to the public at}} l'Asinerie nationale de la Tillauderie, an <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in Charente-Maritime, and at the Saintes National Stud. Members of the breed are exhibited at the annual Paris International Agricultural Show. Approximately a dozen horses are exported each year, mainly to Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. A few breeding stallions have been exported to the United States. Breeders in the US have become interested in the conservation of the breed as a draft animal, as opposed to many Europeans, who are looking for a leisure animal. A stud farm also exists in Sweden, and one in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of special}} trains to promote better {{agricultural}} practices {{was developed in}} Canada {{in the early years}} of the 20th century.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, federal {{agricultural}} engineers {{worked in the}} Arizona Territory on an <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> in Sacaton. It was here that Pima Indians cultivated various cotton hybrids seeking ideal traits. By the early 1900s, the botanist Thomas Henry Kearney (1874–1956) created a long staple cotton which was named Pima after the Indians who grew it. In 1910, it was released into the marketplace. While in 1987, Arizona was producing 66% of the country’s Pima cotton, it has dropped to only 2% in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Government {{officials}} {{agreed that}} the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed across the Potomac River, in Arlington County, Virginia. Requirements for the new building were that it {{be no more than}} four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area. Possible sites for the building included the Department of Agriculture's Arlington <b>Experimental</b> <b>Farm,</b> adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and the obsolete Hoover Field site.|$|E

25|$|Adjacent to the Hatfield {{campus is}} the LC de Villiers Sport Grounds & High Performance Centre which were {{developed}} on {{an area of}} 76 ha. Adjacent to the sport grounds is the university's <b>experimental</b> <b>farm,</b> {{which is used to}} conduct field experiments for the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The campus is served by the Hatfield Gautrain station connecting Pretoria and Johannesburg. A university bus shuttle service operates between the Hatfield campus and the Groenkloof and Prinshof campuses, whilst a park-and-ride shuttle service operates between the Hatfield campus and the LC de Villiers Sport Grounds.|$|E
25|$|Some other {{improvements}} did get made. Two {{new terminal}} wings, expanding the building {{by more than}} 50 percent, were built in 1934. A new, glass-walled control tower was also built which markedly improved air traffic control, and the Arlington <b>Experimental</b> <b>Farm</b> permitted Washington-Hoover to reclaim several acres of marshy land northwest of the airport to slightly extend the runways. In September 1935, three years of negotiations bore fruit when the Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) agreed to move its high-tension electrical lines along Arlington Pike (which hindered the flight path near {{the northern end of}} the field).|$|E
25|$|In 1876 William Brown, a {{professor}} of agriculture and then superintendent of the <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> at Guelph, Ontario, was granted permission {{by the government of}} Ontario to purchase Aberdeen Angus cattle for the Ontario Agricultural College. The herd comprised a yearling bull, Gladiolus, and a cow, Eyebright, bred by the Earl of Fife and a cow, Leochel Lass 4th, bred by R.O. Farquharson. On January 12, 1877, Eyebright gave birth to a calf, sired by Sir Wilfrid. It was the first to be born outside of Scotland. The OAC went on to import additional bulls and cows, eventually began selling Aberdeen Angus cattle in 1881.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} has five distributed campuses including, {{in addition to}} the North Campus, two auxiliary satellites: Campus Saint-Jean in southeast Edmonton, and Augustana Campus in Camrose, 90 kilometres southeast of Edmonton. An extensively renovated and refurbished historic Hudson's Bay department store in downtown Edmonton, renamed Enterprise Square, serves as a campus for adult students belonging to the Faculty of Extension. The university owns a set of large parcels of mostly undeveloped land (used as an <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> and the site of several agricultural and sports facilities) slightly south of the main campus, called South Campus (previously the University Farm), in which an entire new university complex of similar magnitude to the North Campus will be constructed.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{urged the}} {{establishment}} of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.|$|E
25|$|Local {{identity}} varies throughout Madison, {{with over}} 120 officially recognized neighborhood associations. Neighborhoods on {{and near the}} eastern part of the isthmus, some of the city's oldest, have the strongest sense of identity and are the most politically liberal. Historically, the north, east, and south sides were blue collar while the west side was white collar, and to a certain extent this remains true. Students dominate on the University of Wisconsin campus and to the east into downtown, while to its south and in Shorewood Hills on its west, faculty have been a major presence since those neighborhoods were originally developed. The turning point in Madison's development was the university's 1954 decision to develop its <b>experimental</b> <b>farm</b> on the western edge of town; since then, the city has grown substantially along suburban lines.|$|E
