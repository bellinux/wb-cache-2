25|$|For infraclavicular block, current {{evidence}} suggests that — when using a peripheral nerve stimulator for nerve localization — a double-stimulation technique <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single-stimulation technique. When compared to a multiple-stimulation axillary block, infraclavicular block provides similar efficacy. However it {{may be associated with}} a shorter performance time and less procedure-related pain for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Many newer {{vehicles}} feature traction control, which partially mitigates {{the poor}} traction characteristics {{of an open}} differential by using the anti-lock braking system to limit or stop the slippage of the low traction wheel, increasing the torque {{that can be applied}} to the opposite wheel. While not as effective as a traction-aided differential, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> simple mechanical open differential with no traction assistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} types of heat pumps are {{compression}} and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while {{absorption heat pump}}s may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or burnable fuels). An absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or LP gas, for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is {{the ratio of the}} energy supplied to the energy consumed, may average only 1.5, that <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> natural gas or LP gas furnace, which can only approach 1.|$|E
25|$|Tests ridden at the Olympic Games are {{scored by}} a panel of seven {{international}} judges. Each movement in each test receives a numeric score from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and the resulting final score is then converted into a percentage, which is carried out to three decimal points. The higher the percentage, the higher the score. However, in eventing dressage the score is calculated by dividing the number of points achieved by the total possible points, then multiplied by 100 (rounded to 2 decimal points) and subtracted from 100. Thus, a lower score <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> higher score.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{learning}} another language, vocabulary presents difficulties. One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this {{problem has been}} overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volapük words. A selection of readings follows, and {{it is suggested that}} the Volapük words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, a quick glance at the translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired. There is a maxim which states that a little study a day <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> lot of study all at once.|$|E

25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} oxytocin {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the Oxytocin Challenge Test (OCT) fail. It is unclear whether a high dose <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> standard dose for labor induction. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously {{used for this purpose}} (ritodrine, salbutamol, and terbutaline).|$|E

Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his expedition account, Heart of the Antarctic. Emily Shackleton later recorded: [...] "The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole was 'a live donkey <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, as far as I am concerned'".|$|E

500|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans. The Greek historian Herodotus described the hippopotamus in The Histories (written circa 440 BC) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote about the hippopotamus in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia (written circa 77 AD). The Yoruba people called the hippopotamus erinmi which means [...] "elephant of the water". Zulu warriors preferred to be as brave as a hippopotamus, since even lions were not considered to match its courage. They would chant their chief: [...] "Een-gonyama Gonyama! Invooboo! Yah-bo! Yah-bo! Invooboo!" [...] which translates as [...] "He is a lion. Yes, he <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> lion – he is a hippopotamus." ...|$|E
500|$|The south porch {{contains}} a water stoup {{that was said}} miraculously never to dry up; the water was traditionally regarded as having healing powers. There is a second entrance {{on the north side}} through a 15th-century arched doorway decorated with carved human heads. Two verses from Psalm 84 (in Welsh) are written on the wall above the doorway: [...] "For one day in thy Courts <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness." [...] These are the only surviving portions of the Biblical texts that once decorated the internal walls.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Benn reiterated his {{opposition}} to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution, saying: [...] "Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors. They believe that a good king <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> bad Parliament. I have never taken that view." [...] This argument has also been used by many on the right-wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Hannan MEP. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian that [...] "For , even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king's whim could change and there'd be nothing you could do about it." ...|$|E

500|$|From the {{beginning}} of spring training, Heyward endured lingering shoulder soreness. [...] After collecting just four hits in 41 at bats in May, the Braves performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on May 12 which revealed an inflamed rotator cuff but no structural damage. [...] He rested and received a cortisone injection, but aggravated the injury days later during batting practice. [...] The Braves placed him {{on the disabled list}} (DL) on May 22. [...] Public criticism from teammate Chipper Jones for not playing through his injuries followed the next month. [...] Said Jones, [...] "I think where Jason might have erred was the comment that he made, 'I'm not coming back until it doesn't hurt anymore.' ... What Jason needs to realize is that Jason at 80 percent is a force, and Jason at 80 percent <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of people in this}} league." [...] Jones later explained that he reassured Heyward in a phone call that he did not intend to misrepresent Heyward's efforts to rehabilitate.|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith and Lavington {{consider}} that Lazenby [...] "had chosen to play Bond {{the same way}} as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity"; they {{went on to say that}} [...] "Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows" [...] in the film, and that [...] "he invariably rises to the occasion". Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard said that, [...] "The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies". Judith Crist of New York Magazine commented that, [...] "This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby". Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice: [...] "Lazenby... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand part-time playmates".|$|E

[...] Socrates does not object to Hippias' literalism, and seems to abandon the literary question, saying that Homer is dead, and the thing cannot be resolved (365d). He tells Hippias that because he agrees with Homer that a simple and true man <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> wily and cunning one, he will let him speak for Homer.|$|E
