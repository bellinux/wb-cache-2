40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, an attempt {{has been taken}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and <b>glyceryl</b> mono <b>stearate</b> (GMS) as solubility enhancers on the release profile of a poorly soluble drug, carbamazepine. Matrix tablets of carbamazepine were prepared by wet granulation technique using hydrophilic polymers (10 % of Methocel K 15 MCR and 10 % of Methocel K 100 LV CR) as release controlling agents. Varying amounts of SLS and GMS were used in six different formulations to observe {{the impact on the}} release rate and mechanism of drug release. The dissolution study of carbamazepine from these extended release matrix tablets was conducted for 24 hours using basket method in 900 ml distilled water as dissolution medium. The data obtained from the dissolution studies were explored and explained with the help of zero order, Higuchi, first order, Korsmeyer-Peppas and Hixson-Crowell equations. It was found that the dissolution rate of carbamazepine with the formulation containing SLS was higher than GMS containing formulation and increased concentration of SLS increasing the release rate. Where there was no SLS or smaller amount of SLS or GMS release rate was decreased. Formulation having equal ratio of SLS and GMS did not show the desire release profile. The drug release mechanism followed mainly super case II transport. These results clearly demonstrated that the dissolution rate, extent and mechanism of carbamazepine release could be changed by optimizing the amount of SLS and GMS in the tablet formulation...|$|R

Peak plasma concentrations vary widely and occur about 1. 5 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. In this study, non pareil seeds were prepared and coated with metoprolol tartrate using polyvinyl pyrollidone and iso propyl alcohol. Drug coated pellets were then coated with different proportion of microcrystalline wax and <b>glyceryl</b> di <b>stearate</b> using carbon tetrachloride as solvent. The release pattern of drug coated pellets and wax coated pellets were evaluated in vitro by dissolution test apparatus. Theoretical sustained release was compared with formulated sustained release. In vivo evaluation of metoprolol sustained release has been studied. A single dose {{was carried out in}} six rabbits with two sequences, cross over study. Blood samples were collected at one hour intervals. The plasma concentration of metoprolol was estimated by reverse phase HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentration of metoprolol and time data. The mean in vitro dissolution curve of the product is compared with the mean in vivo absorption curve generated by Wagner – Nelson method. The mean data for the in vivo percent absorbed were plotted versus time and the in vitro drug release versus time were superimposed on the first plot. The simplest way to demonstrate a correlation is to plot the percentage absorbed in vivo versus the percentage released in vitro at the same time...|$|R

Clozapine formulations developed by the pellitization technique by drug loaded pellets were characterized {{with regard to the}} drug content, size distribution, Scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Xray Diffraction study. Stability studies were carried out on the optimized formulation for aperiod of 90 days, 40 ± 2 oC and 75 ± 5 % relative humidity. The drug content was in the range of 95. 34 – 98. 12 %. The mean particle size of drug loaded pellets was in the range 1018 to 1065 mm. SEM photographs and calculated sphericity factor confirms that the prepared formulations were spherical in nature. The drug loaded pellets were stable and compatible as confirmed by DSC and FTIR studies. XRD patterns revealed the crystalline nature of pure clozapine. Loose surface crystal study indicated that crystalline clozapine was observed in all formulation and more clear in formulation A 5. Higher amount of clozapine released was observed from formulation A 5 and Syclop® 25 mg tablet as compared to all other formulations and mechanism of drug release followed Fickian diffusion.

40|$|Particle size {{enlargement}} or granulation {{is one of}} the most important unit opera-tions in tablet manufacturing and is performed to impart some degree of functionality to particles, such as improved flowability, compressibility, and compactability. Though con-ventional granulation enjoys wider acceptability, various novel techniques such as ex-trusion-spheronization (1), spherical crystalization (2 – 4), melt extrusion (5) and melt granulation/solidification (6) are being developed. Binder is an essential component in this process, since it imparts strength to granules and tablets during processing, hand-ling and packaging. In recent years, melt granulation (MG) has become a popular technique due to its advantages over traditional wet granulation. MG is a well-known process whereby fine powders are agglomerated by means of a molten binder and are processed into spherical or nearly spherical granules of homogeneous size. The MG process is economical in terms of time and energy as compared to conventional wet granulation. Examples of melt binders used in the pharmaceutical literature include polyethylene glycol (PEG), microcrystalline wax, stearic acid, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>stearate</b> (7) ...|$|E

Due {{to the low}} compliance inherent to each multi-dosage regimen, development of prolonged-release formulations could enhance the overall drug efficacy in patient populations. Methods: Repaglinide-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were developed and characterized in vitro. Various surfactants were {{used in this study}} during the nanocarrier preparation procedure and their corresponding effects on some physicochemical properties of SLNs such as size, zeta potential; drug loading parameters and drug release profiles was investigated. Stearic acid and <b>glyceryl</b> mono <b>stearate</b> (GMS) were used as lipid phase and phosphatidylcholin, Tween 80, Pluronic F 127, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) were used as surfactant/stabilizer. Results: The results showed some variations between formulations; where the Tween 80 -based SLNs showed smallest size, the phosphatidylcholin-based SLNs indicated most prolonged drug release time and the highest loading capacity. SEM images of these formulations showed morphological variations and also confirmed the nanoscale size of these particles. The FTIR and DSC results demonstrated no interaction between drug and excipients. The invitro release profiles of different formulations were studied and observed slow release of drug from all formulations. However significant differences were found among them in terms of their initial burst release as well as the whole drug release profile. From fitting these data to various statistical models, the Peppas model was proposed as the best model to describe the statistical indices and, therefore, mechanism of drug release. Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed the effect of surfactant type on SLNs physicochemical properties such as morphological features, loading parameters, particle sizes and drug release kinetic. With respect to the outcome data, the mixture of phosphatidylcholin/Pluronic F 127 was selected as the best surfactant/stabilizer to coat the lipid core comprising stearic acid and GMS...|$|R

Kinetics parameters of decomposition reaction of prednicarbate were obtained using isothermal (Arrhenius equation) and non-isothermal (Ozawa) methods. The reduction of approximately 45 % of activation energy value (E(a)) to the first step of thermal decomposition reaction of drug in the 1 : 1 (mass/mass) physical mixture was observed by both kinetics methods.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the critical formulation parameters controlling distribution and function for the rectal administration of microbicides in humans. Four placebo formulations were designed with a wide range of hydrophilic characteristics (aqueous to lipid) and rheological properties (Newtonian, shear thinning, thermal sensitive and thixotropic). Aqueous formulations using typical polymers to control viscosity were iso-osmotic and buffered to pH 7. Lipid formulations were developed from lipid solvent/lipid gelling agent binary mixtures. Testing included pharmaceutical function and stability as well as in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Results The aqueous fluid placebo, based on poloxamer, was fluid at room temperature, thickened and became shear thinning at 37 &# 176;C. The aqueous gel placebo used carbopol as the gelling agent, was shear thinning at room temperature and showed a typical decrease in viscosity with an increase in temperature. The lipid fluid placebo, myristyl myristate in isopropyl myristate, was relatively thin and temperature independent. The lipid gel placebo, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>stearate</b> and PEG- 75 stearate in caprylic/capric triglycerides, was also shear thinning at both room temperature and 37 &# 176;C but with significant time dependency or thixotropy.

40|$|Serum {{is a type}} of {{emulsion}} {{which consists}} of a number of immiscible liquids and solids which are thermodynamically unstable. Temperature is believed {{to be one of the}} factors to accelerate its instabilities. Considering the fact that temperature has indirect effects on emulsification, which could alter the interfacial tension thus change the viscosity. In order to prevent these kinds of instabilit ies, thickener and emulsifier are incorporated into the emulsion system to minimize the interfacial tension from coalescence and to act like a body to the system. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate topical face serum (o/w emulsion) differing its thickener and emulsifier mixture with respect to storage temperature. The thickeners used in this study were carbopol Ultrez 20 and xanthan gum while the emulsifiers used in this study were PEG 40 hydrogenated castor oil and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>stearate.</b> The formul ations were stored at 4 °C, 25 °C and 45 °C for a period of four weeks to investigate their stability. The parameters are colour, scent, phase separation, viscosity and pH. The results presented in this study showed good stability throughout the experimental period as there are no phase separations observed by centrifugal test. All formulations appeared as white and homogenous emulsions throughout the study. The pH of all samples are slightly acidic, which falls in the range of normal human skin, which are 4. 8 to 5. 8. The viscosities of the face serums were higher in low temperature and lower at high temperature as both viscosity and interfacial tension decrease with the increase in temperature. Thus, storage temperature should be tightly monitored to prevent quality degradation of the serum...|$|E
40|$|Polyglyceryl- 3 Methylglucose Distearate (PMD, TEGO® Care 450, Evonik, Germany) {{is natural}} (vegetable), non-ionic, PEG-free emulsifier, {{suitable}} for the formulation of oil-in-water (o/w) cosmetic creams and lotions. The oil phase components can be selected from mineral oils, vegetable oils and synthetic esters, which enable different variety of application profile of these emulsions. It is possible to prepare stable emulsions using low-level concentration of the PMD (2 - 3 %) if lotions contain 10 - 25 %, and creams 20 - 40 % of oil phase. PMD forms liquid crystal structure {{in the presence of}} stearic acid, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>stearate,</b> fatty alcohols, or their combinations. The o/w type creams, stabilized by these mixed emulsifiers are complex, multiphase systems. The aim of this work was to formulate, prepare and investigate long-term stability of the o/w creams stabilized by mixed emulsifier polyglyceryl- 3 methylglucose distearate/glyceryl stearate/stearyl alcohol, depending on concentration levels of PMD (2 % or 3 %) and oil:water phase ratio (20 : 80 and 30 : 70). The samples were prepared using hot/hot procedure. Organoleptic inspection, centrifugation test, rheological measurements, electric conductivity and pH value measurements were performed 72 h, 1, 3, 12 and 30 months after preparation. The prepared samples were apparently white and homogenous creams. The consistency and homogeneity were preserved after centrifugation of the creams after 72 h, 1, 3, 12 and 30 months storage, and no phase separation could be detected. The pH values obtained are suitable for skin application. Conductivity values (25. 2 - 63. 7 μS cm 1, 72 h after preparation) were attributed to the multiple phase o/w emulsions with high percentages of fixed water. Results of the rheological measurements have shown that the investigated creams exhibited non-Newtonian thyxotropic behavior. The concentration of emulsifier PMD and oil phase content had an influence on the rheological parameters of investigated samples. The creams prepared with higher content of emulsifiers (3 %) and oil phase (30 %) exhibited higher values of apparent viscosities and thyxotropic area. The observed decrease of electrical conductivity and increase of apparent viscosities values, which occurred in the creams during 3 months of storage, were probably attributed to bulk water content decreasing. These changes are mildly expressed in the samples with higher content of oil phase. The obtained results of organoleptic characteristics, pH, electric conductivity value and rheological parameters during 30 months of storage indicate good long-term stability of the o/w creams prepared with mixed emulsifier containing PMD at low concentration levels (2 % or 3 %). Changes during ageing, caused by structuration of creams were less expressed in samples with 30 % of oil phase, however, the observed differences were not related with the PMD concentration. In this case, advantage could be given to o/w cream prepared with 30 % of oil phase, stabilized by using 2 % emulsifier polyglyceryl- 3 methylglucose distearate...|$|E
