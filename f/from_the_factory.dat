5|$|On 15 June 1941 Newkirk {{told his}} sister {{that he had}} {{accepted}} an offer from the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO), for a year, at $600 a month plus bonuses. After the contract was over he would be reinstated in the Navy without any loss of rank or pay. The following day he carried out his final assignment for the U.S Navy. He delivered a new Wildcat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> at Long Island to Norfolk, Virginia, where he signed his Navy discharge papers.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

This brought <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> under <b>the</b> official {{military-industrial complex}} umbrella, and <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was assigned a number [...] - [...] A-1381 [...] - [...] and the location reference was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory's</b> name.|$|R

5|$|The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus {{factory that}} {{produces}} refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> is exported to Jordan. The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight {{restaurants in the}} city and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions. Today, there are only two soap factories still operating in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was constructed}} in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved {{at the start of}} 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang.|$|E
5|$|As {{the women}} {{go back to}} the factory, Micaëla returns and gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother ("Parle-moi de ma mère!"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on {{learning}} this. Just as José declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance ("Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi"); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.|$|E

50|$|Until the 1980s, the Horn was {{polluted}} with {{industrial waste}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factories,</b> warehouses, and shipyards along its shores. It {{has since been}} cleaned, and the local fish, wildlife, and flora have been largely restored.|$|R
40|$|Although mass {{mortality}} of fishes sometimes {{occurs in the}} Osyouzu River, the cause is not necessarily clear. Therefore, the water environment of the river was evaluated by testing the water quality {{for the purpose of}} the conservation of the river. The measured values for COD and total phosphorus were almost unchanged regardless of industrial waste water <b>from</b> peripheral <b>factories.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the determined values for total nitrogen considerably exceeded environmental standards. This indicates that the polluted water effluents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> may occur. Further investigation of <b>the</b> water effluents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> is required for the conservation the water environment of the Osyouzu River...|$|R
5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Plante {{was playing}} for five {{different}} teams – the local factory team, and {{teams in the}} midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories. Plante demanded a salary <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> team's coach after his father {{told him that the}} other players were being paid because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity. Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week—a considerable sum in those days—to play for a team in England, and a similar offer to play for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Plante passed them up because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947. Upon graduation, he {{took a job as a}} clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the Quebec Citadels offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.|$|E
