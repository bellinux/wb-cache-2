5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
