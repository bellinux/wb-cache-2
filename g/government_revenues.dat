5|$|The daric also {{improved}} <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> as {{the introduction}} of the daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This led to the registration of land which was measured and then taxed. The increased <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> helped maintain and improve existing infrastructure and helped fund irrigation projects in dry lands. This new tax system also {{led to the formation of}} state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was Murashu Sons, based in the Babylonian city of Nippur. These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option would}} be to {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) and pollution, i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> and <b>government</b> expenditure is important, given its relevance for policy especially {{with respect to}} the budget deficit. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the {{relationship between}} <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> and <b>government</b> expenditure in Namibia. It investigates the causal relationship between <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> and <b>government</b> expenditure using Granger causality test through cointegrated vector autoregression (VAR) methods for the period the period 1977 to 2007. The paper tests whether <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> causes <b>government</b> expenditure or whether the causality runs from government expenditure to <b>government</b> <b>revenue,</b> and if there is bi-directional causality. The results show that there is unidirectional causality from <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> to <b>government</b> expenditure. This suggests unsustainable fiscal imbalances (deficit) can be mitigated by policies that stimulate <b>government</b> <b>revenue.</b> ...|$|R

Zelaya's elected successor, José Madriz, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, the Estrada forces took Managua, the capital. The U.S. compelled Nicaragua to accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from <b>government</b> <b>revenues.</b> The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops to begin the United States occupation of Nicaragua, which lasted until 1933.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of commercial, {{residential}} property and equity price volatility on the variability of cyclically adjusted <b>government</b> <b>revenue.</b> We find significant evidence that asset price volatility increases the variability of <b>government</b> <b>revenue.</b> A 1 percent increase in equity price volatility increases <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> variability by 0. 37 - 0. 44 percent. An increase in residential property price volatility increases revenue volatility by about 0. 15 - 0. 22 percent, whereas this effect diminishes to 0. 11 percent in case of commercial property price. This evidence reflects the automatic increase of <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> variability due to asset price movements and supports arguments in favour of adjusting fiscal variables for both business cycle and asset price changes. However, we also find evidence that equity price variability increases revenue variability even when <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> is adjusted for both economic and asset price cycles, indicating the presence of more complicated dynamics between fiscal variables and asset price changes.

5|$|There is an {{impending}} real estate boom in Saudi Arabia, with increasing demand and rising prices {{due to high}} population growth and a short supply of housing, which may include a demand for high-end luxury units, {{such as those in}} Jeddah Tower. To boost growth, the Saudi Arabian government is going to invest US$67 billion (SR251 billion) in building 500,000homes throughout the country. According to Saudi officials, about 900 new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, which has nearly quadrupled in the past four decades. Jeddah Tower is also an attempt to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, which, holding a quarter of the world's oil reserves and being one of the founding OPEC nations, is currently largely dependent on its crude oil exportation, which accounts for nearly 75% of <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> and 90% of exports. This generates enough income to support Saudi Arabia as a welfare state, which spends billions of dollars on job creation and housing for its lower income residents.|$|E

25|$|In the pre-reform era, {{government}} {{was funded by}} profits from state-owned enterprises, much like the Soviet Union. As the state sector fell in importance and profitability, <b>government</b> <b>revenues,</b> especially that {{of the central government}} in Beijing, fell substantially and the government relied on a confused system of inventory taxes. <b>Government</b> <b>revenues</b> fell from 35% of GDP to 11% of GDP in the mid-1990s, excluding revenue from state-owned enterprises, with the central government's budget at just 3% of GDP. The tax system was reformed in 1994 when inventory taxes were unified into a single VAT of 17% on all manufacturing, repair, and assembly activities and an excise tax on 11 items, with the VAT becoming the main income source, accounting for half of government revenue. The 1994 reform also increased the central government's share of revenues, increasing it to 9% of GDP.|$|E
40|$|According to the Leviathan-Model, fiscal {{federalism}} {{is seen as}} {{a binding}} constraint on a revenue-maximizing government. The competitive pressure of fiscal federalism is supposed to reduce public sector size as compared to unitary states. However, empirical results concerning the Leviathan hypothesis are mixed. This study uses a state and local-level panel data set of Swiss cantons from 1980 to 1998 to empirically analyze the effect of different federalist institutions on the size and structure of <b>government</b> <b>revenue.</b> Because of the considerable tax autonomy of sub-national Swiss governments, it is possible to investigate different mechanisms by which fiscal federalism may influence government size. The results indicate that tax exporting has a revenue expanding effect whereas tax competition favors a smaller size of government. Fragmentation has essentially no effect on the size of <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> for Swiss cantons. The overall effect of revenue decentralization leads to fewer tax revenue but higher user charges. Thus, revenue decentralization favors a smaller size of <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> and shifts <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> from taxes to user charges. federalism, <b>government</b> <b>revenue,</b> tax competition, tax exporting...|$|R
