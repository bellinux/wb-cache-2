5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the <b>first</b> <b>film</b> was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew.

They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} <b>first</b> <b>film,</b> and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the <b>first</b> <b>film.</b> They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the <b>first</b> <b>film),</b> which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
