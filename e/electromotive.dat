25|$|The Seebeck effect {{refers to}} an <b>electromotive</b> force {{whenever}} there is a temperature gradient in a conductive material.|$|E
25|$|Electro{{magnetic}} or {{magnetic induction}} is {{the production of}} an <b>electromotive</b> force (i.e., voltage) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|In {{electromagnetism}} and electronics, inductance is {{the property}} of an electrical conductor by which a change in current through it induces an <b>electromotive</b> force in both the conductor itself and in any nearby conductors by mutual inductance.|$|E

She reluctantly begins supplying Walt and Jesse with methylamine and helps Walt expand his operation overseas.|$|E
25|$|Walther Hermann Nernst {{developed}} {{the theory of}} the <b>electromotive</b> force of the voltaic cell in 1888. In 1889, he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the free energy change in the chemical reaction producing the current. He constructed an equation, known as Nernst equation, which related the voltage of a cell to its properties.|$|E
25|$|Eddy {{currents}} {{occur when}} a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer {{portion of the}} metal cuts more lines of force than the inner portion, hence the induced <b>electromotive</b> force not being uniform, tends to set up currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume {{a considerable amount of}} energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.|$|E
25|$|When the {{electric}} current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience {{this change in}} magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, d ΦB / d t. Therefore, an <b>electromotive</b> force is {{set up in the}} second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.|$|E
25|$|A Faraday disk {{can also}} be {{operated}} with neither a galvanometer nor a return path. When the disk spins, the electrons collect along the rim and leave a deficit near the axis (or the other way around). It is possible in principle to measure the distribution of charge, for example, through the <b>electromotive</b> force generated between the rim and the axle (though not necessarily easy). This charge separation will be proportional to the relative rotational velocity between the disk and the magnet.|$|E
25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field induces an <b>electromotive</b> force (EMF) in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance). The varying field in this circuit may also induce an EMF in neighbouring circuits (mutual inductance).|$|E
25|$|The EMF {{generated}} by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and {{a magnetic field}} is the phenomenon underlying electrical generators. When a permanent magnet is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an <b>electromotive</b> force is created. If the wire is connected through an electrical load, current will flow, and thus electrical energy is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the drum generator {{is based upon the}} figure to the right. A different implementation of this idea is the Faraday's disc, shown in simplified form on the right.|$|E
25|$|In 1746, William Watson's machine {{had a large}} {{wheel turning}} several glass globes, with a sword and a gun barrel {{suspended}} from silk cords for its prime conductors. Johann Heinrich Winckler, {{professor of physics at}} Leipzig, substituted a leather cushion for the hand. During 1746, Jan Ingenhousz invented electric machines made of plate glass. Experiments with the electric machine were largely aided by the discovery of the Leyden Jar. This early form of the capacitor, with conductive coatings {{on either side of the}} glass, can accumulate a charge of electricity when connected with a source of <b>electromotive</b> force.|$|E
25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (<b>electromotive</b> force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Electrophoresis {{refers to}} the <b>electromotive</b> force (EMF) {{that is used to}} move the {{molecules}} through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not all uniform then, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will affect the species that have different charges and therefore will attract the species according to their charges being the opposite. Species that are positively charged will migrate towards the cathode which is negatively charged (because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell). If the species are negatively charged they will migrate towards the positively charged anode.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (<b>electromotive</b> force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not always easy to locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E
25|$|When solids of two {{different}} materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the contact potential. Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact <b>electromotive</b> force or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and {{there is now a}} built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{disadvantage of}} the mobility analogy {{is that it}} does not maintain the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance. [...] Mechanical impedance is represented as an electrical admittance and a mechanical resistance is represented as an electrical conductance in the electrical equivalent circuit. [...] Force is not analogous to voltage (generator voltages are often called <b>electromotive</b> force), but rather, it is analogous to current.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} the impedance analogy over its alternative, the mobility analogy, is that it maintains the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance. [...] That is, a mechanical impedance is represented as an electrical impedance and a mechanical resistance is represented as an electrical resistance in the electrical equivalent circuit. [...] It is also natural to think of force as analogous to voltage (generator voltages are often called <b>electromotive</b> force) and velocity as analogous to current. [...] It is this basic analogy {{that leads to the}} analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance.|$|E
500|$|At first, in 1899, the tramway was {{designed}} to be steam powered, but by 1895 this had changed to <b>electromotive</b> power. The line was built by the [...] (CTB), and first ran on 21 May 1899. It was [...] between the two termini (the Pont Corneille and the crossroads of the RN 14 and the Belbeuf roads), with timetabling of up to 7 trams. The trams had greater power than their Rouen counterparts, with [...] motors. They could climb steep gradients (up to 9:100) and could accommodate 48 passengers, with 42 more in a trailing car.|$|E
500|$|In {{the analogy}} {{developed}} by Maxwell, {{now known as}} the impedance analogy, voltage is made analogous to force. [...] The voltage of a source of electric power is still called <b>electromotive</b> force for this reason. [...] Current is analogous to velocity. [...] The time derivative of distance (displacement) is equal to velocity and the time derivative of momentum is equal to force. [...] Quantities in other energy domains that are in this same differential relationship are called respectively generalised displacement, generalised velocity, generalised momentum, and generalised force. [...] In the electrical domain, {{it can be seen that}} the generalised displacement is charge, explaining the Maxwellians' use of the term displacement.|$|E
500|$|The first months' service did {{not meet}} Hulin's expectations; {{passenger}} numbers were much lower than expected, the coefficient of use was catastrophic: 0.39. In 1906 a law was passed instituting a weekly day of rest, so it was decided, from 12 January 1907, to extend the line [...] to the Madrillet roundabout {{at the edge of}} the Rouvray Forest, which was popular for Sunday walks. This [...] double-track extension was inaugurated on 27 August 1907. The same year, diesel-electric locomotives (whose [...] "terrible noise" [...] frightened the horses, to the chagrin of their owners) were replaced by <b>electromotive</b> traction. Two Orenstein & Koppel 0-4-0T steam locomotives headed two open carriages each taking 16 passengers. Their chimneys were fitted with spark arresters to prevent forest fires around Rouvray.|$|E
500|$|The ion {{transport}} system moves potassium across the cell membrane using two mechanisms. One is active and pumps sodium out of, and potassium into, the cell. The other is passive and allows potassium to leak {{out of the}} cell. Potassium and sodium cations influence fluid distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments by osmotic forces. The movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This ion pump uses ATP to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, creating an electrochemical gradient and <b>electromotive</b> force across the cell membrane. The highly selective potassium ion channels (which are tetramers) are crucial for hyperpolarization inside neurons after an action potential is triggered, to cite one example. The most recently discovered potassium ion channel is KirBac3.1, which makes {{a total of five}} potassium ion channels (KcsA, KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KvAP, and MthK) with a determined structure.

500|$|Here, permittance is Heaviside's {{term for}} capacitance. [...] He {{did not like}} any term that {{suggested}} that a capacitor was a container for holding charge. [...] He rejected the terms capacity (capacitance) and capacious (capacitive) and their inverses incapacity and incapacious. [...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. [...] Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring. [...] This preference {{was a result of}} Heaviside following James Clerk Maxwell's view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it. [...] In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the <b>electromotive</b> force and is the analogue of velocity caused by a mechanical force. [...] At the capacitor, this current causes a [...] "displacement" [...] whose rate of change is equal to the current. [...] The displacement is viewed as an electric strain, like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring. [...] The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates. [...] This is replaced with the concept of divergence of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the flux}} {{through the surface}} changes, Faraday's law of {{induction}} says that the wire loop acquires an <b>electromotive</b> force (EMF).

2500|$|An emf is induced in a coil or {{conductor}} {{whenever there}} is {{change in the}} flux linkages. Depending {{on the way in}} which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is statically induced. [...] The <b>electromotive</b> force generated by motion is often referred to as motional emf. [...] When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is dynamically induced. The <b>electromotive</b> force generated by a time-varying magnetic field [...] is often referred to as transformer emf.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>electromotive</b> force {{produced}} by primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) cells is usually {{of the order}} of a few volts. [...] The figures quoted below are nominal, because emf varies according {{to the size of the}} load and the state of exhaustion of the cell.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of how batteries (galvanic cells) generate an emf is one that occupied scientists {{for most of the}} 19th century.

2500|$|In 'underhung' {{voice coil}} designs (see below), the coil is {{shorter than the}} {{magnetic}} gap, a topology that provides consistent <b>electromotive</b> force over a limited range of motion, known as Xmax.

Variations on {{this basic}} formula {{describe}} the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called Laplace force), the <b>electromotive</b> force in a wire loop moving through {{a magnetic field}} (an aspect of Faraday's law of induction), and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near {{the speed of light}} (relativistic form of the Lorentz force).|$|E
2500|$|Ohm's law has {{sometimes}} been stated as, [...] "for a conductor in a given state, the <b>electromotive</b> force {{is proportional to the}} current produced." [...] That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied <b>electromotive</b> force (or voltage) to the current, [...] "does not vary with the current strength [...]" [...] The qualifier [...] "in a given state" [...] is usually interpreted as meaning [...] "at a constant temperature," [...] since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to Joule heating of the conducting body, according to Joule's first law, the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current. [...] The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify. [...] Maxwell and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.|$|E
