40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} a reliable method of predicting native joint line and posterior condylar offset (PCO) using true lateral digital radiographs of the distal femur. Methods. PCO was measured {{relative to a}} line drawn parallel to the posterior cortex of the distal femur and the joint line was measured from the posterior condylar flare to the articular surface. A ratio was then calculated for these measurements relative to {{the width of the}} femur {{at the level of the}} flare. Two independent observers measured PCO and joint line ratio for 105 radiographs of the different knees and one repeated these measurements after one week. Results. There was a significant correlation between the width of the femoral diaphysis at the level of the posterior condylar <b>flare</b> with <b>joint</b> line (P= 0. 008) and PCO (P= 0. 003). Joint line and PCO could be predicted within 4 [*]mm and 2 [*]mm, respectively, using the identified ratio between the width of the femoral diaphysis at the level of the posterior condylar <b>flare</b> with measured <b>joint</b> line and PCO. The inter- (P< 0. 001) and intra- (P< 0. 001) observer reliability for these ratios were high. Conclusion. These ratios could be used to predict the native joint line and PCO...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether children with {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) in clinical remission have subclinical synovial disease on ultrasound, and whether ultrasound abnormalities predict an early flare of synovitis. METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive children who had clinically defined inactive disease (ID) {{for a minimum of}} 3 months underwent ultrasound assessment of 52 joints. All joints were scanned for synovial hyperplasia, joint effusion, power Doppler (PD) signal and tenosynovitis. Patients were then followed clinically for up to 2 years until a flare of synovitis occurred in one or more joints, or until the 2 -year visit if the disease remained in clinical remission. RESULTS: Synovial hyperplasia, joint effusion, PD signal and tenosynovitis in at least one joint were detected in 76. 9 %, 66. 7 %, 33. 3 % and 15. 4 % of patients, respectively. During the 2 -year follow-up, 24 patients (61. 5 %) experienced sustained ID, whereas 15 patients (38. 5 %) had a flare of synovitis in a total of 45 joints after a median of 10. 6 months (range 6. 3 - 13. 7 months). At study entry, the rate of synovial hyperplasia, joint effusion and tenosynovitis was comparable between patients with persistent ID and patients with synovitis flare, whereas patients with persistent ID had a greater frequency of PD signal than patients with synovitis flare. Only 17 of the 45 <b>flared</b> <b>joints</b> had ultrasound abnormalities at study entry. CONCLUSION: The authors found that ultrasound-detected synovial abnormalities are common in children with JIA in clinical remission. However, the presence of ultrasound pathology did not predict an early flare of synovitis in the affected joints...|$|R

40|$|Objective Various nonvalidated {{criteria}} for disease flare {{have been used}} in studies of gout. Our objective was to develop empirical definitions for a gout flare from patient-reported features. Methods Possible elements for flare criteria were previously reported. Data were collected from 210 gout patients at 8 international sites to evaluate potential gout flare criteria against the gold standard of an expert rheumatologist definition. Flare definitions based on the presence of the number of criteria independently associated with the flare and classification and regression tree approaches were developed. Results The mean +/- SD age of the study participants was 56. 2 +/- 15 years, 207 of them (98 %) were men, and 54 of them (26 %) had flares of gout. The presence of any patient-reported warm joint, any patient-reported swollen joint, patient-reported pain at rest score of > 3 (010 scale), and patient-reported flare were independently associated with the study gold standard. The greatest discriminating power was noted for the presence of 3 or more of the above 4 criteria (sensitivity 91 % and specificity 82 %). Requiring all 4 criteria provided the highest specificity (96 %) and positive predictive value (85 %). A classification tree identified pain at rest with a score of > 3, followed by patient self-reported flare, as the rule associated with the gold standard (sensitivity 83 % and specificity 90 %). Conclusion We propose definitions for a disease flare based on self-reported items in patients previously diagnosed as having gout. Patient-reported <b>flare,</b> <b>joint</b> pain at rest, warm joints, and swollen joints were most strongly associated with presence of a gout flare. These provisional definitions will next be validated in clinical trials.

40|$|Introduction Reconstitution of {{peripheral}} blood (PB) B cells after therapeutic depletion with the chimeric anti-CD 20 antibody rituximab (RTX) mimics lymphatic ontogeny. In this situation, the repletion kinetics and migratory properties of distinct developmental B-cell stages and their correlation to disease activity might facilitate {{our understanding of}} innate and adaptive B-cell functions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Thirty-five 'RTX-naïve' RA patients with active arthritis were treated after failure of tumour necrosis factor blockade in an open-label study with two infusions of 1, 000 mg RTX. Prednisone dose was tapered according to clinical improvement from a median of 10 mg at baseline to 5 mg at 9 and 12 months. Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were kept stable. Subsets of CD 19 + B cells were assessed by flow cytometry according to their IgD and CD 27 surface expression. Their absolute number and relative frequency in PB were followed every 3 months and were determined in parallel in synovial tissue (n = 3) or synovial fluid (n = 3) {{in the case of}} florid arthritis. Results Six of 35 patients fulfilled the European League Against Rheumatism criteria for moderate clinical response, and 19 others for good clinical response. All PB B-cell fractions decreased significantly in number (P < 0. 001) after the first infusion. Disease activity developed independently of the total B-cell number. B-cell repopulation was dominated in quantity by CD 27 -IgD+ 'naïve' B cells. The low number of CD 27 +IgD- class-switched memory B cells (MemB) in the blood, together with sustained reduction of rheumatoid factor serum concentrations, correlated with good clinical response. Class-switched MemB were found accumulated in <b>flaring</b> <b>joints.</b> Conclusions The present data support the hypothesis that control of adaptive immune processes involving germinal centre-derived, antigen, and T-cell-dependently matured B cells is essential for successful RTX treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether conventional and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters of a previously affected target joint in patients with clinically inactive juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) have prognostic meaning for a <b>flare</b> of <b>joint</b> inflammation during follow-up. Thirty-two JIA patients with clinically inactive disease {{at the time of}} MRI of the knee were prospectively included. DCE-MRI provided both descriptive measures and time-intensity-curve shapes, representing functional properties of the synovium. Conventional MRI outcome measures included validated scores for synovial hypertrophy, bone marrow edema, cartilage lesions and bone erosions. During a 2 -year period the patients were monitored by their pediatric rheumatologist and clinical flares were registered. MRI analysis revealed synovial hypertrophy in 13 (39. 4 %) of the clinically inactive patients. Twelve patients (37. 5 %) had at least one flare during 2 -year clinical follow-up. Persistently inactive and flaring patients differed significantly in the maximum enhancement of the synovium on the DCE-MRI (p < 0. 05), whereas no difference was found between these two groups in any of the baseline scores of conventional MRI.

40|$|Objectives The {{mechanisms}} that trigger flare in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are unknown. In murine arthritis models, dysfunctional lymph node (LN) drainage {{is associated with}} <b>joint</b> <b>flare.</b> To examine if LN alterations are associated with RA flare, we analyzed the change in LN volume via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) in patients with active <b>joint</b> <b>flare</b> at baseline and 16 weeks after certolizumab pegol (CZP) therapy. We also assessed the changes in popliteal or epitrochlear LN volumes versus the Rheumatoid and Arthritis Outcome Score (RAOS) (knee), or the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ; wrist/hand), and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28), at baseline and 16 weeks. Results Total LN volume in 7 of 10 patients with measurable LN on CE-MRI significantly decreased 16 weeks after CZP therapy (mean decrease 37 %; P = 0. 0019). Improvement in knee pain measured by the RAOS (P = 0. 03) inversely correlated with a decrease in total popliteal LN volume (R 2 = 0. 94). All patients demonstrated significant improvement in DAS 28 (mean decrease 1. 48; P = 0. 0002). For flare in the hand, significant improvement in {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) as measured by the MHQ was observed (left hand mean improvement 20 %; P = 0. 02; right hand mean improvement 37 %; P = 0. 03). Conclusion RA patients with the smallest change in LN volume during anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy experienced the greatest pain relief in symptomatic knee joints. Moreover, the remarkably linear inverse correlation between LN volume and joint pain observed in this small clinical pilot provides initial evidence to support the concept that dynamic changes in draining LN volume are a biomarker of clinical response to therapy in RA...|$|R

40|$|Aging and lipotoxicity are {{two major}} risk factors for gout that are linked by the {{activation}} of the NLRP 3 inflammasome. Neutrophil-mediated production of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) drives gouty <b>flares</b> that cause <b>joint</b> destruction, intense pain, and fever. However, metabolites that impact neutrophil inflammasome remain unknown. Here, we identified that ketogenic diet (KD) increases beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and alleviates urate crystal-induced gout without impairing immune defense against bacterial infection. BHB inhibited NLRP 3 inflammasome in S 100 A 9 fibril-primed and urate crystal-activated macrophages, which serve to recruit inflammatory neutrophils in joints. Consistent with reduced gouty flares in rats fed a ketogenic diet, BHB blocked IL- 1 beta in neutrophils in a NLRP 3 -dependent manner in mice and humans irrespective of age. Mechanistically, BHB inhibited the NLRP 3 inflammasome in neutrophils by reducing priming and assembly steps. Collectively, our studies show that BHB, a known alternate metabolic fuel, is also an anti-inflammatory molecule that {{may serve as a}} treatment for gout...|$|R
40|$|AbstractViscosupplementation by {{hyaluronic acid}} (HA) {{injections}} is frequently used for local treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), due to {{ease of use}} and good tolerance. A profusion of linear or reticulated HA derivates are marketed, with varied characters and levels of evidence. Viscosupplementation has demonstrated moderate but significant efficacy (20 %) versus placebo in terms of pain and function, with {{a high rate of}} responders (60 – 70 %) in knee osteoarthritis. It allows reduced administration of opioid analgesics and NSAIDs, with improved risk/benefit ratio, and may delay joint replacement. Cartilage protection remains to be proven. Clinical efficacy shows 1 – 4 weeks’ later onset than corticosteroids, but is maintained for 6 or even 12 months. Systematic association of corticosteroid and HA injection is not justified, and an interval has to be left before undertaking arthroplasty. Intra-articular injection of HA requires a skilled specialist, and may be difficult in a non-swollen joint; some tips and tricks may be helpful. In other joints than the knee, radiologic or ultrasound guidance is recommended. The efficacy of viscosupplementation is a matter of ongoing debate, after discordant findings in some meta-analyses. Some poor results may be due to inappropriate use of HA injections, poorly adapted to the patient's OA phenotype. Viscosupplementation is a treatment for chronic moderate symptomatic OA, and not for <b>flares</b> with <b>joint</b> swelling. Application in sport-related chondropathy has yet to be properly assessed. The optimal response profile remains to be determined. The ideal indication in the knee seems to be moderate femorotibial OA without swelling. Results have been generally disappointing in hip osteoarthritis but promising in OA of the ankle and shoulder (with and without rotator cuff tear). Further studies are needed to determine response profile and optimal treatment schedule, according to the joint...|$|R
40|$|Mucolipidosis II (ML II), {{also called}} I-cell disease, {{is a unique}} {{lysosomal}} storage disease caused by deficient activity of the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine- 1 -phosphotransferase, {{which leads to a}} failure to internalize enzymes into lysosomes. We report on a colony of domestic shorthair cats with ML II that was established from a half-sibling male of an affected cat. Ten male and 9 female kittens out of 89 kittens in 26 litters born to clinically normal parents were affected; this is consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The activities of three lysosomal enzymes from affected kittens, compared to normal adult control cats, were high in serum (11 – 73 times normal) but low in cultured fibroblasts (9 – 56 % of normal range) that contained inclusion bodies (I-cells), reflecting the unique enzyme defect in ML II. Serum lysosomal enzyme activities of adult obligate carriers were intermediate between normal and affected values. Clinical features in affected kittens were observed from birth and included failure to thrive, behavioral dullness, facial dysmorphia, and ataxia.

40|$|Hospitalization in {{arthritis}} {{patients is}} indicated when the disease <b>flares</b> or when <b>joint</b> replacements {{are to be}} placed. Conservative treatment aims to control disease activity and to reduce pain. Joint replacement is indicated when pain or functional limitations due to a destroyed joint impair the activities of daily living. Immobility, preceding and during hospitalization, leads to a deterioration of muscle strength and mobility of joints, resulting in limited physical functioning, which can {{end up in a}} vicious circle. Restoring function by improving the physical fitness immediately after hospitalization is a major challenge. The physical improvement should ultimately lead to an improved quality of life. Some patients will have a severe decrease in functional capacity during hospitalization and as a consequence {{they will not be able}} to be discharged to go home when their medical condition is stable again. In those cases, a rapid recovery of function and physical condition is warranted.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the applicability of}} a lentiviral (LV) serum amyloid A 3 (Saa 3) -promoter luciferase (Luc) reporter for assessing inflammation in experimental arthritis, synovial fibroblasts (SF) from osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: In mice, synovium was transduced in vivo by cholesterol optimised LV, and two <b>flares</b> of acute <b>joint</b> inflammation were induced by injection of streptococcal cell wall (SCW) material into the knee-joint cavity. The time course of synovial inflammation was assessed using ex vivo luciferase assays, and histology. Uptake of (99 m) technetium (Tc) {{was used to assess}} oedema. SF (n= 12) of RA and OA patients were stratified by hierarchical clustering of whole genome expression profiles. Relative Saa 3 -promoter responses were determined in cytokine- or toll-like receptor (TLR) -stimulated SF subgroups. RESULTS: In vivo, the Saa 3 -promoter reporter activity was strongly upregulated at 1 and 2 days after the first and second SCW challenge. The Saa 3 -promoter activities during acute inflammation correlated with Tc uptake measurements but were more sensitive and able to respond to the ongoing synovitis in the chronic phase of SCW arthritis. Molecular stratification defined two inflammatory SF subtypes, unrelated to disease classification. Relative Saa 3 -promoter responses to interleukin 1 beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha and TLR 4 agonist were significantly increased in OA/RA SF with a high compared to a low inflammatory profile subtype. Serum stimulation of the Saa 3 -promoter reporter cell-line could distinguish between healthy and RA patients. CONCLUSION: The Saa 3 -promoter reporter demonstrates a robust and feasible tool for assessing the course and severity of experimental arthritis and for distinguishing molecularly distinct inflammatory SF subtypes from a heterogeneous patient population...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of "rheumatoid disease" (Ellman and Ball, 1948) and Addison's disease is exceedingly rare. Kendall (1951) {{believed that their}} co-existence {{was no more than}} a coincidence. Perera and Ragan (1950) and, more recently, Caughey and McCoy (1951) reported single cases of a combination of the two diseases. The last mentioned refer to the French literature (Dejean, 1947; de Gennes and others, 1947; Laroche, 1947), where rheumatoid joint lesions were also described in conjunction with Addison's disease. Case Report The present case is that of a housewife, aged 53, who was first seen at the Rheumatism Unit in September, 1951. She complained of (a) swelling of both wrists and pain in the second toe of the left foot; (b) physical exhaustion; (c) change in skin colour. History. -Her joint symptoms dated from the early part of 1947. They had begun with severe stabbing pain in both arms and shoulders, followed by swelling of the fingers necessitating the cutting of her rings. Sub-sequently her knees became tender and swollen, and she was instructed to stay in bed for 6 weeks. After this period of rest in bed she received a course of gold injections with considerable benefit to all the affected joints. In 1949 the polyarthritis recurred, and responded to a second course of gold. Later in the same year, she became aware of extreme fatigue after her normal activities and frequently fainted.

40|$|SUMMARY Five {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis and no previous hip joint disease developed an acute disabling arthritis in one hip joint. Roentgenograms were negative and synovial fluid {{from the hip}} joint was inflammatory, but no crystals were seen and cultures were negative. Four of the five patients responded rapidly to intra-articular corticosteroids, {{and none of the}} five has had further hip joint symptoms during a mean follow up period of two years. Key words: transient synovitis. Hip joint involvement in {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be defined clinically, but most published observations addressing the problem have focused on roentgenographic abnormalities; by this definition, hip joint involvement has been recog-nised in 30 - 75 % of patients with RA. 1 - 7 Acute flares of articular synovitis are a well recognised phenomenon in RA, though an acute flare of limited distribution should raise the question of a superim-posed infectious process. 8 Flares in the hip joint in patients with RA could be assumed to occur as often as <b>flares</b> in other <b>joints,</b> but no previously published report has specifically addressed this issue. Because of the apparent rarity, unique clinical features, and dramatic presentation of this phenomenon we report our experience with five cases of acute hip joint arthritis in patients with RA.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease manifested by episodic <b>flares</b> in affected <b>joints</b> that are challenging to predict and treat. Longitudinal contrast enhanced-MRI (CE-MRI) of inflammatory arthritis in tumor necrosis factor-transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice {{has demonstrated that}} popliteal lymph nodes (PLN) increase in volume and contrast enhancement during the pre-arthritic "expanding" phase of the disease, and then suddenly "collapse" during knee flare. Given the potential of this biomarker of arthritic flare, we aimed to develop a more cost-effective means of phenotyping PLN using ultrasound (US) imaging. Initially we attempted to recapitulate CE-MRI of PLN with subcutaneous footpad injection of US microbubbles (DEFINITY®). While this approach allowed for phenotyping via quantification of lymphatic sinuses in PLN, which showed a dramatic decrease in collapsed PLN versus expanding or wild-type (WT) PLN, electron microscopy demonstrated that DEFINITY® injection also resulted in destruction of the lymphatic vessels afferent to the PLN. In contrast, Power Doppler (PD) US is innocuous to and efficiently quantifies blood flow within PLN of WT and TNF-Tg mice. PD-US demonstrated that expanding PLN have a significantly higher normalized PD volume (NPDV) versus collapsed PLN (0. 553 ± 0. 007 vs. 0. 008 ± 0. 003; p 0. 030) and lower (< 0. 016) quartile NPDVs in this cohort of mice, which serve as conservative thresholds to phenotype PLN as expanding and collapsed, respectively. Interestingly, of the 12 PLN phenotyped by the two methods, there was disagreement in 4 cases {{in which they were}} determined to be expanding by CE-MRI and collapsed by PD-US. Since the adjacent knee had evidence of synovitis in all 4 cases, we concluded that the PD-US phenotyping was correct, and that this approach is currently the safest and most cost-effective in vivo approach to phenotype murine PLN as a biomarker of arthritic flare...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To study prospectively the {{clinical}} evolution of {{different forms of}} spondyloarthropathy (SpA) {{in relation to the}} evolution of gut histology in consecutive ileocolonoscopic biopsy specimens. Methods. Ileocolonoscopy was performed in 49 patients with SpA (34 men, 15 women). They also underwent clinical, laboratory, and radiological examinations. Two to 9 years later, a 2 nd and sometimes a 3 rd or 4 th ileocolonoscopy was performed, and the other examinations were repeated. Results. At first ileocolonoscopy, 34 patients (69 %) showed inflammatory gut lesions. At the 2 nd ileocolonoscopy, 16 patients (32 %) were in clinical remission; none were found to have inflammatory gut lesions. Of the 33 patients with persistent locomotor inflammation, 14 had persistent inflammatory gut lesions, predominantly the chronic type. Of these 14 patients, 6 had developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). None of the 15 patients with an initially normal gut histology had gut inflammation at 2 nd examination. Of the 9 with initially acute lesions, 3 developed chronic lesions (1 Crohn's disease). Initial chronic lesions in 25 patients persisted in 9, of whom 5 had developed IBD. Seven of the 19 patients with non-SpA ankylosing spondylitis (non-AS-SpA) developed ankylosing spondylitis (AS); all had initially presented inflammatory gut lesions, which persisted at 2 nd examination. In the 11 patients with more than 2 consecutive ileocolonoscopies, clinical remission was always associated with normal gut histology, and <b>flares</b> of the <b>joint</b> disease were related temporally to the reappearance of gut inflammation. Conclusion. This study demonstrates the close relationship between gut and locomotor inflammation in SpA. Clinical remission was always associated with normal gut histology, whereas active locomotor inflammation was usually associated with the presence of gut inflammation. Absence of gut inflammation in the SpA is a good prognostic indicator, since gut inflammation or IBD never develops in these patients.

40|$|Background: Outcomes in the {{management}} of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been significantly improved through the use of composite disease activity measures (such as the DAS 28) and aggressive DMARD escalation until a lower disease activity target has been achieved. Imaging studies suggest that the DAS 28 may be insensitive to low levels of subclinical active disease that is associated with an increased risk of <b>flare</b> and progressive <b>joint</b> damage. Further, in some cases, elevations of the DAS 28 may not necessarily be related to on going active synovitis. In both instances, relying upon the DAS 28 assessment alone may lead to patients being considered for an inappropriate treatment decision since, patients with active subclinical disease may not be considered for further DMARD escalation whilst patients with non-inflammatory causes of DAS 28 elevation may be offered additional DMARD therapy that is either ineffective or potentially toxic. There is emerging evidence that musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS), gene expression profiles and inflammatory protein microarrays might provide useful additional disease activity information that allows clinicians to reach a treatment decision that is targeted at an individual patient’s specific needs. Objectives: 1. 	To determine whether using MSUS assessment of global disease activity in addition to the DAS 28 produces significantly better short-medium term clinical and radiological outcomes 2. 	To determine whether grouping early RA patients by either RA phenotype or disease activity level is associated with evidence of differential gene expression between the comparator groups 3. 	To determine the degree of correlation and agreement between the Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity (MBDA) test, the DAS 28 and a MSUS disease activity assessment Methods 111 patients with either clinical diagnoses of early RA (symptom duration < 1 year) or anti-CCP antibody positive inflammatory arthritis were recruited to the Targeting Synovitis in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (TaSER) study. Clinical consultations occurred monthly for 18 months and all participants were treated using the same step-up DMARD-biologic escalation protocol. Participants were randomised to either a DAS 28 or MSUS assessment group. In the DAS 28 group, DMARD therapy was escalated until DAS 28 low disease activity (LDAS – DAS 28 < 3. 2) had been achieved. In the MSUS group, MSUS assessment was indicated for instances of DAS 28 LDAS or DAS 28 moderate disease activity (3. 2 ≤ DAS 28 < 5. 1) with minimal clinical synovitis (28 SJC ≤ 1). During MSUS assessment, the bilateral radiocarpal, index and middle MCP, index and middle PIP and 2 nd and 5 th MTP joints were examined for the presence of gray scale synovial hypertrophy and Power Doppler (PD) signal. Active disease was defined as the presence of grade 1 or higher PD signal in 2 or more joints. DMARD therapy was not changed if there had been significant escalation within the preceding 3 months. Intra-articular and intra-muscular corticosteroid injections were administered generously during periods of active disease. Blinded clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and every 3 months until study completion. Plain x-rays of hands and feet and MRI of the dominant wrist and hand were performed at baseline and study completion and will be graded by 2 independent radiologists who are blinded to participant’s randomisation group. Primary outcomes comprised: 1. mean change in DAS 44 from baseline and 18 months, 2. mean change in MRI RAMRIS erosion score between baseline and 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included: between group comparisons of the DAS 44 and ACR-EULAR remission rates, EULAR response criteria, HAQ, EURO-QoL 5 D, CRP, ESR, 10 cm pain visual analogue score, mean change in plain x-ray Sharp score (van der Heijde modification) and mean change in MRI RAMRIS synovitis and bone marrow oedema scores. 79 Participants donated additional blood samples for nested biomarker analysis at baseline, follow-up months 3 and 18. Baseline and 3 month PAXgene RNA samples were analysed {{with the assistance of the}} Systems Biology Group, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow using an Illumina HumanHT- 12 v 4 Beadchip microarray. Baseline, 3 month and 18 month serum samples were analysed by Crescendo Biosciences using their in house MBDA microarray. Additional whole blood, serum and plasma samples remain available for future polyomic analyses. For the gene expression analysis, participants were segregated into comparator groups based upon baseline and 3 month RA phenotypic and disease activity data. Comparator groups were intended to represent common clinical scenarios. Between group comparisons of gene expression were conducted in the R software package using the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) plug-in. An adjusted p value < 0. 05 was considered to represent evidence of differential gene expression. For the MBDA analysis, the degree of correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation) between DAS 28 and MBDA score was calculated at each time point and for all time points pooled together. The percentage agreement between MBDA, DAS 28 and MSUS disease activity state categorisations was also calculated. Results: 111 participants were recruited and 101 (91...|$|R
