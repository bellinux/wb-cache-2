40|$|Monte Carlo {{method is}} used to capture the {{evolution}} of spherulites and shish-kebabs and to predict the crystallization kinetics in isothermal polymer crystallization. Effects of nucleation density and <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> spherulites, nucleation density, and length <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> shish-kebabs, respectively, on crystallization are investigated. Results show that nucleation densities of both spherulites and shish-kebabs strongly affect crystallization rate as well as morphology. An increase in nucleation density of either spherulites or shish-kebabs leads to a quicker crystallization rate and a smaller average spherulite size. It is also shown that nucleation density of shish-kebabs has a stronger impact on crystallization rate. <b>Growth</b> rate <b>of</b> spherulites and length <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> shish-kebabs also have significant effect on crystallization rate and morphology. An increase in <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> spherulites or length <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> shish-kebabs also speeds up the crystallization rate; additionally, a decrease in <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> spherulites or an increase in length <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> shish-kebabs results in a more highly anisotropic shish-kebab structure and a smaller average size of spherulites.

The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter.

The three heterotrophic groups had similar slopes (0. 12 for bacterivorous protists, 0. 10 for herbivorous protists, and 0. 13 for copepods) that were approximately double that of phototrophic protists (0. 06). The massive annual algal blooms observed in high latitudes are due in part to a fundamental difference in the relationship between growth and temperature for phototrophic protists and their grazers...|$|R
