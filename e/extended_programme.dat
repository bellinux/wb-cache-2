40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} participation in the University of Cape Town's Commerce Education Development Unit (CEDU) <b>extended</b> <b>programme</b> is related to the presence of social psychological graduate attributes in second and third year CEDU students (n = 104). This study used second and third year mainstream students as a comparison group (n = 175) as they are assumed to have the required graduate attribute levels for academic success. Data was gathered through a questionnaire using Likert - type scales. A series of analyses were then conducted to test the hypothesis and sub - hypotheses. The main results revealed that after participating in the CEDU <b>extended</b> <b>programme</b> for up to three years, CEDU students have the same perceived levels of the measured graduate attributes as students in mainstream programmes, after the possible effects of three covariates have been taken into account. This study highlights the complexity of developing graduate attributes in previously disadvantaged students of colour in a South African context. The findings of this study provide a basis for future research into the development of graduate attributes in previously disadvantaged students as an antecedent of academic success and employability...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} how {{the cohort}} of extended diploma students enrolled at a comprehensive South African university in 2012 perceived the programmes {{for which they}} were enrolled {{at the beginning of their}} first year and towards the end of the year. Data were gathered using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews involving students enrolled for extended national diplomas in Human Resource Management, Management, Entrepreneurship, Logistics, Management Services, Transportation Management and Public Relations. The study established that while the students had negative perceptions of several aspects of the <b>extended</b> national diploma <b>programmes,</b> they had become positive about most of these towards the end of the year. The paper recommends strengthening of teaching and learning support to the <b>extended</b> <b>programmes</b> at the comprehensive university in order to positively influence students’ perceptions of the programmes for achievement of the ultimate goal of improving students’ retention and success rates...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increase}} in the number of inherited metabolic diseases that can be detected at birth using a single dried blood spot sample, the impact of false positive results on parents remains a concern. We used an economic approach - the contingent valuation method – which asks parents to give their maximum willingness to pay for an extension in a screening programme and the degree to which the potential for false positive results diminishes their valuations. 160 parents of a child or children under the age of 16 years were surveyed and given descriptions of the current screening programme in the UK, an <b>extended</b> <b>programme</b> and an <b>extended</b> <b>programme</b> with no false positives. 148 (92. 5 %) respondents said they would accept the screen for the five extra conditions in an expanded screening programme whilst 10 (6. 3 %) said they would not and two were unsure. When asked to indicate if they would choose to be screened under an expanded screening programme with no false positive results, 152 (95 %) said they would, five (3. 1 %) said they would not, two were unsure, and there was one non-response. 151 (94. 4 %) said they preferred the hypothetical test with no false-positives. The mean willingness to pay for the expanded programme was £ 178 compared to £ 219 for the hypothetical expanded programme without false positives (p[*]>[*] 0. 05). The results suggest that there is widespread parental support for extended screening in the UK and that the number of false-positives is a relatively small issue...|$|E
40|$|This article investigates some central {{aspects of}} the {{relationships}} between programme structure and implementation of sulphur dioxide air quality control policies. Previous implementation research, primarily adopting American approaches, has neglected the connections between the processes of programme formulation and implementation. 'Programme', as the key variable in implementation studies, has been defined too narrowly. On the basis of theoretical and conceptual reflections and provisional empirical results from studies in France, Italy, England, and the Federal Republic of Germany, the authors demonstrate that an integral process analysis using a more <b>extended</b> <b>programme</b> concept is necessary if patterns of interest recognition in policies are to be discovered. Otherwise, the still important question of critical social science cannot be answered, namely, what is the impact of special interests upon implementation processes...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{political}} change in South Africa has resulted in significant changes to higher education (HE) admission policies. Increased admission into South African universities has meant an increase in student diversity and different levels of preparedness of the students negotiating their way through their academic studies. Academic success of students remains a focus and one way of addressing {{this has been the}} introduction of various extended programmes at South African universities. Extended programmes have various academic development initiatives embedded in the coursework. These are designed to assist the academic progress of students. However, student success remains elusive as so many factors may impact. The purpose of this study therefore, was to investigate the perceptions of the National Diploma (Engineering: Electrical) <b>Extended</b> <b>Programme</b> students with regard to the benefits of the academic development initiatives offered by the NMMU, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences as <b>Extended</b> <b>Programme</b> students. An exploratory sequential research design was employed, consisting of two phases of data collection, following each other successively (Creswell, 2012). The first phase of the data collection involved both quantitative and qualitative data. This was followed by a consecutive collection of qualitative data with the aim to enhance the themes that emerged from the first phase of this study. This mixed-methods research design facilitated the gathering of rich data to answer the research questions. The results indicated that these students perceived the academic development initiatives they received as positive and beneficial to their development. In addition, they felt adequately prepared for the mainstream curriculum; acquired and applied many skills relative to their field; and considered themselves to be at an advantage when comparing themselves to their mainstream counterparts...|$|E

A total of 22 246 rural children of 2 - 12 years of age were sampled. Blood samples taken on filter paper were tested by indirect hemagglutination technique to determine the level of circulating antibodies against tetanus toxoid. Tetanus was selected as an index not only because natural antibody against it is practically non existent, but also because protective levels of this antibody can reveal vaccination status of the individuals. Results show that except for few districts where complete protection reaches over 70 %, the immunization status is not commendable. Moreover, no specific pattern for immunization could be detected. These and other results are discussed...|$|E
