50|$|<b>Kingsbury</b> <b>County</b> Grammar School was {{established}} on 15 September 1925 as <b>Kingsbury</b> <b>County</b> School. Prior {{to the establishment}} of the school the area had been served by a number of schools, which, in keeping with the future history of <b>Kingsbury</b> <b>County</b> School, had been subject to the prevailing changes in population and politics of the area.Although there are reports of a school being kept in the area in c. 1530, by John Bishop the curate of Kingsbury, there is no more evidence until the nineteenth century of schooling in Kingsbury. Schooling is mentioned in 1819, and in 1822 a day school was opened. This school was situated near the junction of Kingsbury Road and Roe Green, which itself is looked at open by the current Kingsbury High School. This school has closed by 1876. Other schools existed in the area as well, with nearly all children in Kingsbury said to attend one school or another by 1847.

Kingsbury Board School on Kingsbury Road, opened by the Kingsbury School Board in 1876, was to accommodate 130 pupils. In 1903 this became Kingsbury Council School. In 1922 this became the first senior mixed school in the area after its infants had been transferred to the new Kenton Lane Council School in 1922. This school operated as a junior school after 1928 until it was bombed in the Second World War.|$|E
