5|$|Even {{more than}} his debts, the Earl of Leicester's will {{triggered}} litigation. He had intended his illegitimate son from his early 1570s relationship with Douglas Sheffield, the adolescent Robert Dudley, to inherit Kenilworth {{after the death of}} his brother, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick. Some of the countess' <b>jointure</b> manors lay in the castle's vicinity, while at the same time they had been assigned to the younger Dudley's inheritance by the overseers of Leicester's will. After Warwick's death in February 1590, lengthy legal proceedings ensued over whether particular parts of Lady Leicester's <b>jointure</b> belonged to the Kenilworth estate or not.|$|E
5|$|Lettice Dudley {{was left}} a wealthy widow. Leicester's will {{appointed}} her as executrix and her income from both her husbands' jointures amounted to £3,000 annually, to which came plate and movables worth £6,000. However, her <b>jointure</b> was to suffer greatly from paying off Leicester's debts, which at some £50,000 were so overwhelming {{that she was}} advised to decline the responsibility of dealing with her husband's financial legacy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{domestic}} quarrels between Charles and Henrietta Maria were souring {{the early}} years of their marriage. Disputes over her <b>jointure,</b> appointments to her household, and the practice of her religion culminated in the king expelling the vast majority of her French attendants in August 1626. Despite Charles's agreement to provide the French with English ships as a condition of marrying Henrietta Maria, in 1627 he launched an attack on the French coast to defend the Huguenots at La Rochelle. The action, led by Buckingham, was ultimately unsuccessful. Buckingham's failure to protect the Huguenots – and his retreat from Saint-Martin-de-Ré – spurred Louis XIII's siege of La Rochelle and furthered the English Parliament's and people's detestation of the duke.|$|E

5|$|In 1603 Dudley {{initiated}} {{moves to}} prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and Leicester. If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her <b>jointure</b> rights. Consequently, in February 1604, she filed a complaint against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles Leicester and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of Leicester testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. The other side was unable to cite clear evidence and the King's chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady Leicester. All the evidence was impounded to preclude a resumption of the case.|$|E
25|$|The carved stone {{above the}} door records that Haggs was built in 1585 by Sir John Maxwell of Pollok and his wife Margaret Conyngham (Cunningham). It was built to replace the Maxwell's former residence, the Laigh Castle, a 14th-century {{building}} which stood to the west. Although built as the Maxwell's main residence, it was later used as a <b>jointure</b> house, or dower house, being occupied by the lord's widow. The Maxwells, a covenanting family, were fined for nonconformist activities, although the change of government resulting from the revolution of 1688 saved them from paying up. In 1753 Haggs in turn was replaced as a residence and abandoned when Pollok House was completed.|$|E

Nevertheless, every night Sir Thomas Heneage, Groom of the Stool, came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the City of London to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by <b>jointure</b> at Baynard Castle: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards.

25|$|Joan was {{the widow}} of Robert de Harley of Willey and had a {{daughter}} and heiress, Alice, who married Sir Hamo Peshall or Hamon Peshale. Joan brought a range of properties, acquired from her own family and her first husband, which must have greatly increased Darras's comfort and security while she was alive. She had {{a considerable amount of}} <b>jointure</b> property from her first marriage – in Shropshire at Harley, Gretton, Willey and Kenley, and in Worcestershire part of a manor at Hampton Lovett, known as Over Hall. Some of theses properties passed to Roger Willey, a relative of Sir Robert Harley, in 1400, presumably on Joan's death: Willey was a business associate of Darras. The Hampton Lovett property, however, was destined for Alice, Joan and Robert Harley's daughter, who married Sir Hamo Peshall.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{confusion}} and disputes {{seem to have}} followed Darras's unusual and untimely death. At Sidbury the advowson was contested. On 6 July, as a new rector was needed at Sidbury, Henry St George acted as patron, presenting William Walkebache. On 11 August, however, John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall, also acting as patron and described as lord of Sidbury, presented Walter Lawrence. Talbot, the young son of Richard, Lord Talbot, and Ankaret le Strange, was to emerge as Arundel's main political rival in the county, prepared to fight force with force. On 23 August Bishop Robert Mascall was issued with a writ probiting him from admitting anyone to Sidbury until the issue was decided. The following April the bishop himself presented William Whitehead. By August 1409 Whitehead had resigned and Talbot presented his nominee for a second time, apparently triumphant {{in the struggle to}} take over Darras's lands and rights. The same pattern is shown at Linley, which probably fell into his hands, as his widow, Margaret Beauchamp, Countess of Shrewsbury, held half the manor as a <b>jointure</b> property after his death.|$|E

50|$|Manners' uncle, Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland {{had died}} 14 April 1587.

The 4th Earl died {{less than a year}} later, on 24 February 1588, passing the title on to his son. This meant that Rutland's inheritance was complicated by the demands of two wills and <b>jointures</b> for two dowager countesses and disputes between them. Since he was 11 when his father died, he became a royal ward of Queen Elizabeth. His wardship was originally promised to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, but Dudley died on 4 September 1588 and Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the Queen's Secretary of State and chief advisor, became his guardian.

She pleaded for an augmentation of her <b>jointure</b> with the authorities and, to reach a compromise with the late Earl's executors, threatened [...] "by some froward advice" [...] to claim her dower rights.

It would be so, if every corruptible representative were to find an enlightened and incorruptible constituent. But the practice and knowledge of the world will not suffer us to be ignorant that the Constitution on paper is one thing, and in fact and experience is another. We must know that the candidate, instead of trusting at his election to the testimony of his behavior in Parliament, must bring the testimony of a large sum of money, the capacity of liberal expense in entertainments, the power of serving and obliging the rulers of corporations, of winning over the popular leaders of political clubs, associations, and neighborhoods. It is ten thousand times more necessary to show himself a man of power than a man of integrity, in almost all the elections with which I have been acquainted. Elections, therefore, become a matter of heavy expense; and if contests are frequent, to many they will become a matter of an expense totally ruinous, which no fortunes can bear, but least of all the landed fortunes, incumbered as they often, indeed as they mostly are, with debts, with portions, with <b>jointures,</b> and tied up in the hands of the possessor by the limitations of settlement.

6000|$|Of their {{consequence}} we {{have proof}} {{enough in the}} fact that not only was William Jenkin (as already mentioned) Mayor of Folkestone in 1555, but no less than twenty-three times in the succeeding century and a half, a Jenkin (William, Thomas, Henry, or Robert) sat in the same place of humble honour. Of their wealth we know that in the reign of Charles I., Thomas Jenkin of Eythorne was more than once in the market buying land, and notably, in 1633, acquired the manor of Stowting Court. This was an estate of some 320 acres, six miles from Hythe, in the Bailiwick and Hundred of Stowting, and the Lathe of Shipway, held of the Crown IN CAPITE by the service of six men and a constable to defend the passage of the sea at Sandgate. It had a chequered history before it fell into the hands of Thomas of Eythorne, having been sold and given from one to another - to the Archbishop, to Heringods, to the Burghershes, to Pavelys, Trivets, Cliffords, Wenlocks, Beauchamps, Nevilles, Kempes, and Clarkes: a piece of Kentish ground condemned to see new faces and to be no man's home. But from 1633 onward it became the anchor of the Jenkin family in Kent; and though passed on from brother to brother, held in shares between uncle and nephew, burthened by debts and <b>jointures,</b> and at least once sold and bought in again, it remains to this day {{in the hands of the}} direct line. It is not my design, nor have I the necessary knowledge, to give a history of this obscure family. But this is an age when genealogy has taken a new lease of life, and become for the first time a human science; so that we no longer study it in quest of the Guaith Voeths, but to trace out some of the secrets of descent and destiny; and as we study, we think less of Sir Bernard Burke and more of Mr. Galton. [...] Not only do our character and talents lie upon the anvil and receive their temper during generations; but the very plot of our life's story unfolds itself on a scale of centuries, and the biography of the man is only an episode in the epic of the family.

60|$|Our worthy {{acquaintance}} Mr Malachi Mulligan now {{appeared in}} the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator. Lambay Island. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich <b>jointures,</b> a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} Berkeley family through five generations from 1281 to 1417 and {{attempts}} to study in depth all the aspects of their lives for which material is available. This is far more abundant for the Berkeley family than for many others in a similar position in the late middle ages which makes them a suitable subject for such study. The first lord in the series is Thomas II (lord 1281 - 1321) who had a personal association with Edward I manifested in his close involvement in all the most important events of the reign. He virtually retired from active public life during the reign of Edward II and his heir, Maurice III (1321 - 26), took over as representative of the family. He benefited from the lordship of the earl of Pembroke which brought him several important posts between 1312 and 1318, but he then broke with Pembroke to join the Marcher opposition to the king. He was {{one of the leaders of}} the rebels in the Despenser War of 1321 - 2 and spent the rest of his life imprisoned at Wallingford. His son, Thomas III (1326 - 61), was married to Mortimer's daughter and consequently played an important role during the Mortimer regime, but suffered an eclipse during the 1330 s while undergoing his parliamentary trial for the death of Edward II. He re-emerged onto the national stage in the 1340 s but was principally concerned with domestic and estate matters. His heir, Maurice IV (1361 - 68) was retained by the Black Prince and was wounded and captured while in the Prince's service at Poitiers. The wound made him an invalid for the rest of his life and he was further hampered by the burden of paying off his ransom. His son Thomas IV (1368 - 1417) was a minor until 1374 and then was severely restricted financially by the claims on the estate of two long-lived dowagers until 1390. This was to ascertain extent mitigated by the fortuitous inheritence by his wife of the Lisle estate but he played no important role in the affairs of Richard II's reign. He was prominent, however, in the establishment of Henry IV in 1399 and was a Privy Councillor of that king until 1406 when he appears to have been dropped when Prince Henry's influence at court became important. These activities at court were influenced principally by the lords' personal associations with the current ruler and in normal circumstances they did, not have the status consonant with the right to involvement in affairs of the highest importance. They were, however, at the highest end of the peerage since their income rose to almost comital size and this position was enhanced by marriage alliances with other peerage families of similar high incomes and long establishment. The daughters of the family, however, occasionally married men of lesser status. Portions, <b>jointures</b> and dowers were distributed and received in conformity with the general rules governing such matters but the most prominent and important of their family relations was the loyalty shown by the cadets to Gloucestershire and the main line. This was occasionally of particular importance, such as the alliance between Thomas III and his courtier brother, Maurice (of Stoke Giffard), but was at all times a source of great strength to the lords whose influence in their "country" was thereby greatly extended. A second major factor in the Berkeley lords' dominance of their "country" (which appears to have been, in most respects, the county of Gloucestershire) was the concentration of their estate in that area. This was improved by the acquisition of new lands in the same area and although most of these lands were subsequently granted to younger sons, these cadet branches only served to strengthen the lords' position further. The income derived from that part of the estate which descended with the main line rose from around £ 900 per annum in the late 13 th century to £ 1, 150 per annum by 1360 but on occasions it was considerably higher than this, notably after the Lisle lands came to Thomas IV in 1382 and 1392. Although the, lords' resources, and their ability to concentrate all of them on the one area, was an important element of their influence in the county, a more important factor, perhaps, was the lack of any serious rivals within Gloucestershire. This enabled the Berkeleys to have what amounted to almost a monopoly of lordship and a great deal of influence over appointments to local offices. Their increasing stature is reflected in the changing methods they adopted to impose their will in the area, these growing in sophistication over the period. Their lordship was reciprocated-by the members of their affinity who assisted and supported them in their various endeavours. Detailed study of the manor of Ham (the largest of those making up the honour of Berkeley) showed that there was a huge increase in the number of tenements held by free tenants, and in the rents paid by them, under the lordship of Thomas II. He also cut down the number of villein tenements, the profit from which was restricted by custom, but the principal change in this respect occured after the Black Death when many tenements came to be "held freely" for a greatly increased cash rent. The adverse effects of the Black Death were quickly corrected in the short term but long term effects are apparent in the static nature of the rent-roll from 1360. The use and type of labour changed over the period since Thomas II was content to have a smaller number of famuli and make greater use of villein labour services, while Thomas III used much of the villein labour obligation to support famuli (thus increasing the numbers employed) and making up the deficit with casual labour. Most of the stock on the manor were draught animals and, although many went to the household, sale became more important after 1360 as policy changed it into more of a "cash" manor. There was a large demesne which produced great quantities of wheat and oats and smaller quantities of beans, most of which went to the household. The lords' followed most of the agricultural techniques advised in the treatises but on matters not covered by them, the local wisdom which predominated was not as helpful as it could have been...|$|R
