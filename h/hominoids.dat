25|$|As {{a dental}} anthropologist, Corruccini is most noted {{for his work}} on malocclusion, though his {{research}} is not limited to any particular aspect of human or non-human primate dentition or biology. Much of his early fieldwork in dentition and many of his 250-plus publications focused on twins, immigrants, Australian Aborigines, and on the Indian subcontinent, with this research being funded by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Leakey Foundation. However, Corruccini's research into malocclusion led him to conduct broad and comprehensive studies among a diverse number of subjects, including an isolate population of European-Americans in rural Kentucky, the Pima Tribe, natives of Peru, <b>hominoids,</b> and modern Chinese.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{processes}} in <b>hominoid</b> primates were {{closely related to}} global and/or regional environmental changes, and therefore palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is fundamental for understanding how environmental changes shaped their evolution. Here, we present pollen data from the 16 -m-thick Shuitangba (STB) section, Yunnan Province, southwestern China, bearing remains of the <b>hominoid</b> Lufengpithecus lufengensis of the terminal Miocene; and use principal component analysis to reconstruct the palaeovegetation and palaeodimate during the key period when the <b>hominoid</b> lived. Our results show that before the STB <b>hominoid</b> appeared (Zone A), the vegetation was dominated by subtropical evergreen broad-leaved taxa with a few temperate deciduous taxa (e. g., Quercus, Castanea/Castanopsis, Alnus). The development of aquatic plants commencing at the similar to 12 m depth is a prominent feature, indicating a warm and humid climate. During {{the time when the}} <b>hominoid</b> lived (Zone B), evergreen broad-leaved forests with evergreen Quercus were predominant, while grasses including Poaceae began to expand, and simultaneously conifers decreased, indicating a warm climate. The significant presence of aquatic pollen taxa in subzone A- 2 and Zone B suggests the occurrence of lacustrine or swampy environments. In contrast, in Zone C, the vegetation changed to coniferous forest, indicating cooler and drier conditions. These results provide substantive evidence of the vegetation conditions when the <b>hominoid</b> lived, suggesting that the greater diversity of vegetation and the warm humid climate, compared to the present day, would have favoured its survival.

25|$|The ID {{between humans}} and gorillas was {{determined}} to be 1.09, that {{between humans and}} chimpanzees was determined as 1.14. However the distance to six different Old World monkeys was on average 2.46, indicating that the African apes are more closely related to humans than to monkeys.

500|$|According to Zalmout et al., Saadanius {{may also}} help resolve {{the age of the}} hominoid–cercopithecoid split. Paleoanthropological work has {{typically}} placed the divergence between 25 and 23mya, but genetic-based estimates have placed it in the early Oligocene, approximately 33mya. Despite the predictions from the genetic tests, little fossil evidence has been found for a last common ancestor between 30 and 23mya, favoring a later split. Only isolated teeth of Kamoyapithecus hinted at the existence of potential basal <b>hominoids</b> in the late Oligocene (between 24 and 27.5mya), while the oldest fossil Old World monkey, Victoriapithecus macinnesi, dates to 19mya. [...] With the discovery of Saadanius, Zalmout et al. suggested a later split than the genetic data, dating between 29–28 and 24mya. [...] However, Pozzi et al. later argued that although Saadanius is a significant discovery, because it is a stem catarrhine, it could not be used to date the divergence of the crown group. [...] The presence of stem taxa in the fossil record does not indicate that crown groups have evolved, and stem taxa may survive for millions of years after the crown taxa appear. [...] For this reason, the fossil record can only suggest a hard minimum boundary for divergence dates, which corresponds to the first appearance of a crown taxon. [...] Furthermore, Pozzi et al. pointed out that the supplementary material published by Zalmout et al. demonstrated that Pliopithecoidea were more closely related to living catarrhines than Saadanius.|$|E

They date back 1.83 million years, the oldest evidence of hominid habitation in Southeast Asia. The earliest evidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia is the 40,000-year-old skull excavated from the Niah Caves in today's Sarawak, nicknamed [...] "Deep Skull".

The skull probably belongs to a 16-to 17-year-old adolescent girl. The first foragers visited the West Mouth of Niah Caves (located [...] southwest of Miri) 40,000 years ago when Borneo was connected to the mainland of Southeast Asia. The landscape around the Niah Caves was drier and more exposed than it is now. Prehistorically, the Niah Caves were surrounded by a combination of closed forests with bush, parkland, swamps, and rivers. The foragers were able to survive in the rainforest through hunting, fishing, and gathering molluscs and edible plants. Mesolithic and Neolithic burial sites have also been found in the area.

40|$|SINE-R {{elements}} are {{a class of}} retroposon derived from the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K that {{has been active in}} <b>hominoid</b> evolution and may include some members that are Homo sapiens specific. Both SINE-R elements and the HERV-K class of element have potential relevance to recent genome change. Here we report on sequences in the SINE-R class that can be detected on human chromosomes 7 and 17 and compare them with sequences that we have previously reported on the X chromosome and in <b>hominoid</b> primates. The retroposons on chromosomes 7 and 17 showed a high degree of sequence homology (88 - 96 %) with other human retroposons (SINE-R. C 2, 11, 14, 19, and HS 307 /HS 408). Phylogenetic analysis using the neighbour-joining method revealed that SINE-R-type retroposons on chromosomes 7 and 17 were inter-related with those of <b>hominoid</b> primates, suggesting that various sub-classes of these retroposons have been evolving independently during <b>hominoid</b> evolution. One element (17 - 11) on chromosome 17 shares one hundred per cent identity with a 7 - 11 element on chromosome 7 which suggests either recent transposition or a chromosomal translocation. Thus further investigation of the chromosomal locations of SINE-R elements that together with the HERV-K LTR sequence from which they are derived have the capacity to influence the function of neighbouring cellular genes may be expected to clarify the potential role of these elements in recent <b>hominoid</b> evolution...|$|R

The habitat preferences of extant mammals and the probable feeding preferences in relative abundances of each mammal taxon suggest that the Upper Member of the Namurungule Formation is likely to have been open whereas the Lower one is likely to have included both open and wooded components. In fact, the faunal components are different at various places in {{the lower part of the}} formation. Near the <b>hominoid</b> bearing site, SH 22, the palaeoenvironment seems to have been more wooded. Several places are likely to have been open environments.
