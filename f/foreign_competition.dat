5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from <b>foreign</b> <b>competition.</b> The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E
5|$|Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector, {{which was}} usually run by oligopolies of old family firms and {{required}} political connections to prosper {{was faced with}} <b>foreign</b> <b>competition,</b> including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, focusing on designing new products and relying on low labour costs and technology.|$|E
5|$|Bo also {{oversaw the}} {{restructuring}} of the Ministry, formed from the amalgamation of the National Economics and Commerce Bureau and the Department of International Trade. Bo sought to balance {{the amount of attention}} given to foreign investors and domestic commercial institutions. He began tackling the imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to that point was largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by <b>foreign</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E

Manufacturing sector in {{addition}} to mining, quarrying, electricity and gas together account for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. Economic reforms introduced after 1991 brought <b>foreign</b> <b>competition,</b> led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. In recent years, Indian cities have continued to liberalise, but excessive and burdensome business regulations remain a problem in some cities, like Kochi and Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Board of Trade, William Gladstone, {{resigned}} from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from <b>foreign</b> <b>competition,</b> but making the cost of bread artificially high. Peel hoped that {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain would relieve the condition of the poor, and in particular the suffering caused by successive failure of potato crops in Ireland—the Great Famine.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating <b>foreign</b> <b>competition</b> in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

It would operate on high-density low yield tourist routes in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly the Japan–Hawaii services; with a fleet of four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and five Boeing 747s.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional transport infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased <b>foreign</b> <b>competition</b> began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth marked McKinley's presidency.

McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict, but when negotiation failed, he led the nation into the Spanish–American War of 1898; the U.S. victory was quick and decisive. As part of the peace settlement, Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; Cuba was promised independence, but at that time remained {{under the control of the}} U.S. Army. The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} FDI in the Chinese economic development process of the past decades and tries to predict imminent trends and their consequences. It is found {{that the type of}} FDI prevalent will most likely shift from the primarily efficiency-seeking kind producing for markets abroad towards the more market-seeking kind both in manufacturing sectors hitherto closed to <b>foreign</b> <b>competitions</b> and in service sectors. This trend will pose problems as market-seeking FDI proposes fewer benefits than efficiency-seeking FDI as the new kind of FDI is more likely to crowd out domestic firms and investment. Moreover, market-seeking FDI tends to be a burden on the current account in the medium and long term as companies repatriate their earnings. This might force China to rely on capital imports to finance domestic absorption and make the country more vulnerable for currency crises...|$|R

25|$|Industry {{accounts}} for 26% of GDP and employs 22% {{of the total}} workforce. According to the World Bank, India's industrial manufacturing GDP output in 2015 was 6th {{largest in the world}} on current US dollar basis ($559 billion), and 9th largest on inflation-adjusted constant 2005 US dollar basis ($197.1 billion). The industrial sector underwent significant changes due to the 1991 economic reforms, which removed import restrictions, brought in <b>foreign</b> <b>competition,</b> led to the privatisation of certain government-owned public-sector industries, liberalised the foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, improved infrastructure and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector was faced with increasing domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>competition,</b> including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, and relying on cheap labour and new technology. However, this has also reduced employment generation, even among smaller manufacturers who previously relied on labour-intensive processes.|$|E
