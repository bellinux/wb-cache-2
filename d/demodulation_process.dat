The cancellation is here determined by the last two detected symbols and the sampling phase. Scheme- 2 operates without a memory. The cancellation is achieved by signal level compensation. The performances of these schemes, operating with different detectors, are compared with the performance of the system when a non-linear equaliser is applied to the digital data in the absence of ADPCM distortion. Tests were conducted using two channels: CH- 1 which introduces mild distortion into the transmitted digital signal, and CH- 2 which introduces significant distortion. The detectors used in the tests are a linear equaliser, a non-linear equaliser and a near-maximum-likelihood detector.

40|$|Introduction. A modern {{methods of}} digital signal {{processing}} are capable to embed imperceptibly an additional information into audio signals using so called digital watermarks (DWM). DWM are characterized by the main parameters: payload, fidelity and robustness. One {{of the most important}} methods for DWM is based on quantization of certain signal parameters. But quantization methods are very sensitive to amplitude scaling and doesn?t proved appropriate fidelity and robustness. The main part. The designed embedding algorithm is based on quantization of correlation coefficient between signal vector generally in a complex L-dimensional space and real random vector. Algorithm keeps signal norm that allows signal normalization in modulation and <b>demodulation</b> <b>processes</b> and minimizes the embedding distortions. Variants of correlation coefficient quantization in the forms of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation and Amplitude Modulation in the frequency domain of discrete Fourier transform are considered. The proposed multichannel algorithm provides robustness against intersymbol interference (ISI). It is proved advantages of data embedding in the frequency domain versus time domain and row-wise forming of signal vector for ISI resistance. It is shown by computer simulation the ability of flexible regulation of watermark performances by means of appropriate choosing of algorithm parameters. Practical implementation of the proposed algorithm is based on sliding processing in the whole and comparison of received and calculated hash functions. Conclusion. The proposed algorithm demonstrates watermarks inaudibility because of preserving signal power before and after data embedding and proportional watermarking according to instantaneous carrier signal power. Watermark payload ? fidelity ? robustness compromise is provided by appropriate parameters choosing N, L, K, ? in watermarking algorithm.

Different networks can have different modulation types and different frequencies, which require an intelligent receiver that has the ability to recognise and identify any incoming signal. For the purpose of this thesis, the receiver 'consists of two parts; the optical part and the decision system: The main function of the optical part is to receive. an optical signal and suitably convert it to an electrical signal. Most important is how to improve the low optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) due to the background noise and safety limitations on the optical power. Therefore, the main components of the optical receiver have been discussed and the optimal choices have been suggested. The automatic decision/system has the automatic ability to recognise and identify an incoming signal even if the OSNR is very low. It consists of three identifiers; to differentiate between analogue signals and digital signals, to classify the analogue signals and to recognise common digitally-modulated signals. The analogue identifier may be classified as the statistical approach, and is based on the Hilbert transform and wavelet transform (WT) to extract its key features. Conversely, the digital identifier covers the statistical and decision approaches, and is based on the WT to extract Its key features.. Key features for pattern recognition purposes used were based on their simplicity, speed and their ability to recognise a signal in low SNRs. Therefore, some previously-used features that work in a very low SNR were employed, some features having been extended to include other types of signals, and many new key features were developed and implemented. Despite the fact that the ~ecision system does not require any prior knowledge, the scheme has also been investigated for usefulness in the carrier frequency, SNR and symbol rate estimation which serves to simplify the classification task and help in the <b>demodulation</b> <b>processes.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
