5|$|In the mid-1940s, {{the club}} invented {{the notion of}} penyes, a mix between a fan club and a {{financial}} support club, {{during a time when}} the club was in need of financial and public support in face of the hostility of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. The first Penya Solera, was formed in 1944 by a group of supporters and former players of the team. The penyes would later exhibit their financial prowess in 1953, when they proposed the building of the Camp Nou. Inspiration was drawn from the <b>financial</b> <b>plan</b> Athletic Bilbao, a rival team, used to build San Mamés, where an association of penyes pledged to finance the construction. As a result, the subsequent construction of the stadium put the club into its supporters' hands, giving the penyes political influence over the club, which still lasts today.|$|E

25|$|Based on The ACS-Zachry Preliminary <b>Financial</b> <b>Plan</b> (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C) {{funding the}} TTC-35 Corridor awarded to ACS-Zachry showed that 22%(1) {{of the initial}} {{infrastructure}} costs were shown to be funded with equity provided by ACS-Zachry. The other 78% was to be provided by bank loans or bonds arranged by ACS-Zachry. Based on then-current federal regulations these bonds could have been tax-exempt. It was also noted in the <b>financial</b> <b>plan</b> that ACS-Zachry expected to have 12% return on investment for their equity partners. The 12% return was after taxes, {{which would have been}} approximately equivalent to 16% before taxes. The plan called for paying off the bank loans and the bonds prior to retiring the equity as shown in cash flow diagrams of the Preliminary <b>Financial</b> <b>Plan</b> (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C). With usual bond financing there is a 3:1 ratio between total fees collected and value of capital infrastructure built. With TTC-35 the ratio was in the order of magnitude of 13:1. So while TTC-35 committed to construct $8 billion in infrastructure ACS-Zachry expected to collect $114 billion in toll revenues as shown in the preliminary plan. A report by the Texas State Auditor estimated the toll to be collected for TTC-35 to be $104 billion or more, confirming the order of magnitude of tolls collected.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of research to discover if and how computerized <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> is conducted in United States school districts. The aim of the project was to assist school board members and administrators with <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and decision making. The methodology included a literature survey of long range business and academic <b>planning,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>financial</b> models and modeling. It was concluded that long range <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> has been successfully implemented in business and tertiary educational institutions and would be effective for school districts. An integrated academic and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> model for school districts was normatively derived based on the literature. Primary planning variables reflecting academic policy decisions were identified, and tentative sub models for enrollments, staffing, and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> were described. Empirical work was conducted to fill "gaps" in the literature and gather descriptive evidence concerning the current state of <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>financial</b> model design. As part of the empirical work, questionnaires were sent to all school district treasurers (616) in the State of Ohio. More than forty percent (43. 3 %) replied. It was found {{that more than half of}} the respondents (54. 5 %) have long range <b>financial</b> <b>plans,</b> but few school districts (20. 5 %) conduct <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> on computers. Of the districts operating computerized financial models, 68. 5 % use micro computers in preference to mainframes or minis. School district treasurers and superintendents take part in almost all <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and/or budgeting whereas school board members participate only occasionally. Most school districts (96. 5 %) recognize the need for long range <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and would consider using computerized <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> models designed specifically for school districts. The research suggests that important barriers to computerized <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> are lack of money and expertise to design models appropriate for school districts. The integrated academic and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> model was computerized and tested by practitioners in the United States for completeness and usefulness. Changes were made to the model based on empirical work and field testing. The model is inexpensive, easy to use, and considered to be generic.
