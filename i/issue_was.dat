5|$|God of War is a six-issue American {{comic book}} limited series {{set in the}} God of War universe. The series was written by Marv Wolfman, {{illustrated}} by Andrea Sorrentino, and the cover art for each <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> produced by Andy Park, who was also an artist for the video game series. The first five issues of God of War were published by WildStorm. Due to the company's closure in December 2010, the final <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> published by their parent company, DC Comics. The series' launch coincided {{with the release of}} the video game God of War III in March 2010. The final <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> published in January 2011, and a collected edition was published in March 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 2011, Charlie Hebdo was firebombed {{right before}} its 3 November <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> due; the <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> called Charia Hebdo and satirically {{featured}} Muhammad as guest-editor. The editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, and two co-workers at Charlie Hebdo subsequently received police protection. Charb {{was placed on}} a hit list by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula along with Kurt Westergaard, Lars Vilks, Carsten Juste and Flemming Rose after editing an edition of Charlie Hebdo that satirised Muhammad.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} August 3, 2011, {{and quickly}} sold {{out at the}} distributor level, prompting Moore to announce a second printing eight days later.

5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> August 1970.|$|E
50|$|These {{are known}} to have <b>been</b> <b>issued</b> during the 1890s, but the dates of when they began to <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> and ceased to <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> <b>is</b> not yet known, as {{information}} about these <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> extremely sketchy.|$|R

5|$|A six-page {{preview of}} the first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> {{included}} with 3 Story: Secret files of the Giant Man, a one-issue continuation of another work by Kindt, in April 2012. The same month, three short stories were released online for free to promote the series. They were later printed as issue #0 in November 2012.|$|E
5|$|After {{elections}} in 1884, a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing {{public financial support}} for religious schools. Religious education became compulsory in all schools in 1895. The Catholic Party's triumph in the <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> another blow to the already-weakened Liberal Party, and ushered {{in a period of}} almost unbroken Catholic government until World War II.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} {{the area was}} held by British forces with their main bases at Romani and Kantara.
