5|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of {{representative}} democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression. This paves the way for discussion {{of the state of}} affairs in the country, as expressed by representatives of the people, which include members of the ruling party elected <b>into</b> <b>government</b> as well as opposition politicians. Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations. This is justified in the name of public interest as the legislature, administration and governmental institutions will then strive to make improvements.|$|E

5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits <b>into</b> <b>government</b> bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went <b>into</b> <b>government</b> coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as {{the party}} of free enterprise, in {{contrast}} to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays <b>into</b> <b>government</b> operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of Alberta Government Telephones. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company, which held a monopoly over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.|$|E

5|$|Tamar's youth {{coincided with}} a major {{upheaval}} in Georgia; in 1177, her father, George III, was confronted by a rebellious faction of nobles. The rebels intended to dethrone George {{in favor of the}} king's fraternal nephew, Demna, who was {{considered by many to be}} a legitimate royal heir of his murdered father, David V. Demna's cause was little but a pretext for the nobles, led by the pretender's father-in-law, the amirspasalar ("constable") Ivane Orbeli, to weaken the crown. George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on the defiant aristocratic clans; Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia. Prince Demna, castrated and blinded on his uncle's order, did not survive the mutilation and soon died in prison. Once the rebellion was suppressed and the pretender eliminated, George went ahead to co-opt Tamar <b>into</b> <b>government</b> with him and crowned her as co-ruler in 1178. By doing so, the king attempted to preempt any dispute after his death and legitimize his line on the throne of Georgia. At the same time, he raised men from the gentry and unranked classes to keep the dynastic aristocracy away from the center of power.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Party came <b>into</b> <b>government</b> {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{laboratory}} on the Castellania's {{second floor}} {{which was used}} by the Malta Fever Commission was restored and converted into The Brucellosis Museum in 1980, and it is now open to the public by appointment. Since the British period some of the prison cells were modified and converted <b>into</b> <b>government</b> offices and at present still serve this purpose. Other parts of the Castellania's interior, including the chapel and one of the prison cells, were restored in the 1990s. The restored cell appears on the front cover of the book Kissing the Gallows: A Cultural History of Crime, Torture and Punishment in Malta, 1600–1798, authored by William Zammit. There were further plans to restore the façade in the late 1990s, but nothing materialized. The façade is again on plan to be restored as part of a number of projects of the Valletta 2018 - European Capital of Culture. A detailed study for the restoration of the façade has taken place, which gave the way to call for a public tender, and work began in June 2017.|$|E
