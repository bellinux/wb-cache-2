5|$|Following the pier's {{decommissioning}} on 12 November 2006, <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> started amidst protests. The demolition {{was originally}} {{scheduled for the}} early part of 2007, but demolition was brought forward by 3 months, to 12 December 2006. The government ignored a nonbinding motion in September in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong urging it to retain the pier and clock tower.|$|E

5|$|Despite damage {{sustained}} {{during the}} Second World War and <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> during {{the construction of}} Wood Green Shopping City in the 1970s, Noel Park today remains largely architecturally intact.

5|$|The Belgian III Corps, and its 1st Chasseurs Ardennais, 2nd Infantry and 3rd Infantry Divisions had {{withdrawn}} from the Liège fortifications to avoid being encircled. One regiment, the Liège Fortress Regiment, stayed behind to disrupt German communications. Further to the south, the Namur fortress, manned by VI Corps' 5th Infantry Division and the 2nd Chasseurs Ardennais with the 12th French Infantry Division, fought delaying actions and participated {{in a lot of}} <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> while guarding the position.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} assumed {{ownership of}} the now-disused observatory building and was originally going to abandon it. Louis Beaufort Stewart, a lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, campaigned {{for it to be}} saved for the Department of Surveying and Geodesy. He eventually arranged for the building to be re-constructed on a more suitable site. <b>Demolition</b> <b>work</b> was carried out in 1907: the stones were simply left in place over the winter, and were used the following year to construct a re-arranged building just east of the main University College building (south of Hart House).|$|E
5|$|Turgut Reis {{was laid}} up again on 30 October 1918, and was {{refitted}} at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard from 1924 to 1925. After returning to service, {{she served as}} a stationary training ship based at Gölcük. At the time, she retained only two of her originally six 28cm guns. She was decommissioned in 1933 and was thereafter used as a barracks ship for dockyard workers, a role she filled until 1950, {{when she began to}} be broken up at Gölcük. By 1953, the ship had been broken down into two sections, and these were sold to be dismantled abroad. <b>Demolition</b> <b>work</b> was finally completed between 1956 and 1957.|$|E

5|$|Wallingford Castle was {{probably}} built by Robert D'Oyly between 1067 and 1071. Robert had married Wigod's daughter Ealdgyth, and ultimately inherited {{many of his}} father-in-law's lands. The wooden castle {{was built in the}} north-east corner of the town, taking advantage of the old Anglo-Saxon ramparts, with the motte close to the river overlooking the ford, and required substantial <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> {{to make room for the}} new motte-and-bailey structure. Unusually, it appears that the castle was constructed on top of high-status Anglo-Saxon housing, probably belonging to former housecarls. The motte today is 60 metres (197 feet) across and 13 metres (43 feet) high. Robert endowed a sixteen-strong college of priests within the castle, which he named St Nicholas College.|$|E
5|$|As war approached, it {{was decided}} to retain her as a {{minelayer}} and most of the extra fire control equipment was removed. She was transferred to Brest as part of the reorganization of the 5e Escadre. She sailed for Casablanca, French Morocco on 2 September with 125 Bréguet mines embarked. She was ordered to lay a defensive minefield there on 4 September, but this order was rescinded the next day, after the mines had already been fuzed, and the ship was ordered to disembark the mines. While landing the mines on 13 September one of them exploded, destroying the ship and killing 186 people. A further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris. One gun and some armor was salvaged during the war, but <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> did not begin until October 1952 and was completed by July 1953.|$|E
5|$|The castle was garrisoned by parliamentarians {{during the}} English Civil War {{during which time}} it was badly damaged. At {{the time it was}} {{estimated}} that the damaged to the castle and surrounding area would take £1,000 to repair. Wressle Castle was slighted (partially demolished) on several occasions in 1646–50. The 1648 <b>demolition</b> <b>work</b> was focused on the castle’s battlements, with a contemporary letter noting that “ agents would show no care in preserving any of the materials, but pitched of the stones from the battlements to the ground” Destruction was more extensive two years later, when Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, was ordered to demolish everything that remain except the south range of the castle. The earl would be allowed to use the surviving range as a manor house. The damage was not confined to the castle buildings, and probably affected the ornamental landscape.|$|E
