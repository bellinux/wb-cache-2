500|$|Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe {{praised the}} {{chemistry}} between the series' main characters {{and the performance}} of Jansen as Aida, but said [...] "most of this is just preamble to the sight of two <b>guys</b> <b>with</b> a lot of attitude and similar pyrokinetic powers unleashing holy hell on one another in a building chock full of explosives. I am [...] than okay with this." [...] The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy graded the episode a 'B', praising the episode for focusing the season's overarching storyline and for the emotional reunions between Johnson and the core S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He was positive of the ongoing Ghost Rider storyline and the episode's action sequences, but thought Aida's story was [...] "the much more intriguing long-term story ... it offers the unusual opportunity for Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. to dig into some juicy subtext and weighty concepts".|$|E

Later in December that year, the song appeared on the theatrical film Waiting to Exhale, which the trio had also recorded a new song for its accompanied soundtrack album called [...] "This Is How It Works". In 2010, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Waterfalls" [...] were played on the comedy film The Other <b>Guys,</b> <b>with</b> its running gag that Michael Keaton's character Captain Gene Mauch always subconsciously referencing TLC's lyrics without having any idea who the group is. In literature, South African poet and novelist Mandla Langa mentioned the trio's music video on his book The Memory of Stones in 2000, referring to them as [...] "the legend."

500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr. When Gooden came to bat {{in the fifth}} inning, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball. Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting <b>guys</b> <b>with</b> [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money well spent. Sometimes you just have to defend yourself and your teammates." ...|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old <b>guys</b> <b>with</b> beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of Chris Owens as Jeffrey Spender. Owens previously appeared in earlier episodes, the first being [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", in which he played the younger version of The Smoking Man. Owens later reprised this role in episode [...] "Demons". During the fifth season of the show, Owen was cast to play the part of The Great Mutato in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus". After his stint on The X-Files, Owens attempted {{to get a job}} as a waiter in Vancouver, to no avail. One day, however, he ran into series creator Chris Carter at a bar, who humorously told him, [...] "I didn't know they served <b>guys</b> <b>with</b> two faces here", a reference to his portrayal of The Great Mutato. Carter explained that David Duchovny had [...] "taken careful notice" [...] of Owens acting abilities and requested that he return to the series in some capacity. Heeding Duchovny's advice, Carter created the role of Jeffrey Spender just for him. In addition, the episode was the first to introduce the recurring character of Cassandra Spender, played by Veronica Cartwright. Rick Millikan, the series' casting director, was very pleased with Cartwright's performance, noting, [...] "She's got a voice that adds a little creepiness and a little mystery that I thought played really well. She was just the perfect X-Files person." [...] "Patient X" [...] was the first episode in which Nicholas Lea was credited under the Also Starring tag, alongside Mitch Pileggi and William B. Davis.|$|E

Police officers in Bell said in interviews in August 2010 that they frequently spent their shifts pulling over vehicles for small infractions [...] hoping that they would be unlicensed drivers.

Ellington’s band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: “So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating on the tables, instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, rolled-up newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm.
