She said after the 2008 election that she would like to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2006 {{following}} {{the completion of}} Jump Ultimate Stars as Ganbarion's first original title. The main concept was born from the desire to create a game scenario based around purification and love. Character numbers and plot twists were {{kept to a minimum}} to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> on Elena's plight. Due to recurring problems implementing the relationship mechanics and working with the Wii's controls, Pandora's Tower went through an extended development period. Despite releasing in Europe, Nintendo did not plan a North American release: prior to the announcement of Xseed Games picking up the title, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. Upon release, Pandora's Tower had modest commercial success and was met with mixed to positive reviews; praise went to the story and elements of combat, while the control scheme and graphics were faulted.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> on the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} the visual catchiness (saliency) of {{relevant}} information impacts user engagement metrics such as <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> and emotion (affect). Participants completed tasks {{in one of}} two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, <b>focused</b> <b>attention,</b> and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lackof-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of <b>focused</b> <b>attention,</b> which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement.

5|$|The woman, who is {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> on the sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that}} the angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E

40|$|<b>Focused</b> <b>attention</b> {{impairments}} in AD and MCI 2 Reaction time (RT) tasks take various forms, and can assess psychomotor speed, (i. e. simple reaction time (SRT) task), and <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> (i. e. choice reaction time, (CRT) task). If cues are provided before stimulus presentation (i. e. cued choice reaction time (CCRT) task), then a cueing effect {{can also be}} assessed. A limited {{number of studies have}} addressed the nature of <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> {{impairments in}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, it is unknown whether similar impairments occur in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The current study used three RT tasks to address the nature of <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> impairments in AD and MCI subjects. The results suggest that there were significant CRT and CCRT differences in AD subjects when compared to NECs. Furthermore, slowed RTs were also present in the MCI group, which provides evidence for impaired <b>focussed</b> <b>attention</b> and the inability to benefit from a cue in both the MCI and AD groups. The implications of the impairments related to the MCI group could potentially prove useful in early diagnosis of cognitive impairments in the elderly...|$|R

25|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{say that}} the scrying medium initially serves to <b>focus</b> <b>attention,</b> removing unwanted thoughts from the mind {{in much the same}} way as repetition of a mantra, concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what they see, in a mental feedback loop.|$|E

40|$|We report two {{experiments}} in which different {{features of the}} display of multiple channels of information are varied in their proximity to one another.

On other trials the value of individual indicators is estimated, requiring focused at-tention. In Experiment 1 the spatial proximity between indicators and their dis-tinctiveness in color were manipulated. Spatial proximity {{had little effect on}} ei-ther <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> or integration, whereas a distinct color code improved <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> and disrupted integration. In Experiment 2 the three indicators were presented as a bar graph or were combined as features of an object display, either with or without color coding of the separate dimension.

25|$|Although lead is {{the least}} {{expensive}} dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a toxic substance causing biological damage to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no safe level of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to <b>focus</b> <b>attention,</b> and academic ability. Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered corrosion products, however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater. Absorption through skin is not likely for metallic lead and inorganic corrosion products.|$|E

This distraction helped keep Britain from intervening on the continent and contributed to twenty years of peace in Europe, while continuing unrest forced the British state to develop repressive strategies with networks of spies and informers as well as increasing its standing army. While Jacobitism increasingly appealed to the disaffected, it inherently bowed to higher authority and thus reinforced the social order. It left the British state strengthened {{to deal with the}} more revolutionary movements that developed later in the 18th century.|$|E
40|$|Observers {{are often}} unaware {{of changes in}} their visual {{environment}} until attention is drawn {{to the location of}} change. Without <b>focused</b> <b>attention,</b> object representations are ephemeral and conscious detection of change does not occur. <b>Focused</b> <b>attention</b> appears to mediate change perception by giving objects coherence across space and time. To study the relation between <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> and aware/unaware perception of change, we recorded Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from subjects performing a change blindness task. A complex scene was repeatedly presented for 500 ms, separated by a 300 ms blank mask. After several cycles, a change was introduced in the scene. Original and modified versions alternated for 40 flickers (unaware change, unattended location of change), or until the change was reported. A semantic cue was then displayed to help subjects identify the changing region. During the subsequent 30 to 40 flickers, subjects attended to that location and reported when the change was removed (aware change, attended location of change). Next, subjects looked for a second change in the same scene, usually absent (no change, unattended location of original change). Finally, subjects <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> at the location of the original change to report its re-occurrence (no change, attended location of change). Preliminary analyses suggest different effects of <b>focused</b> <b>attention,</b> aware, and unaware perception of change...|$|R
