5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat.</b> Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving his mouth as if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E

Both Kashmere and Acid were eliminated from the Cage of Death match, and Hi-V broke up after that night.

5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

25|$|At {{least one}} fake explosivea metal pipe stuffed with cloth made to {{resemble}} a pipe bombwas thrown at the police during the pursuit. The SUV exited the freeway onto North Tippecanoe Avenue and briefly stopped at a stoplight, where a pursuing officer observed the perpetrators putting on tactical vests and equipping themselves with rifles. The SUV then continued onward onto East San Bernardino Avenue and entered a suburban area, where the shooter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat,</b> identified as Malik, began firing at police through the back window at 3:08:43p.m.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the gang}} members remove all {{evidence}} of the skirmish {{in order to avoid}} attracting outside attention. Bishop hopes that someone has heard the police weapons firing, but the neighborhood is too sparsely populated for nearby residents to pinpoint the location of the noise. Wells is chosen to sneak out of the precinct through the sewer line and hot-wire a car, but is killed by a gang member hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat.</b> However, two police officers responding to reports of gunfire find the dead body of a telephone repairman hanging from a pole near the police station, and call for backup.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{broke the}} magazine's longstanding taboo against {{treating}} photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon {{to be its}} first staff photographer. She also approved controversial covers from {{a new crop of}} artists, including Edward Sorel's October 1992 cover that had people buzzing about the meaning of a punk rock passenger sprawled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of an elegant horse-drawn carriage: was it Brown's self-mocking riposte to fears she would downgrade the magazine? A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
25|$|After Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis {{drives him}} {{to the train station}} for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion.

A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Connie and Edward argue and, out {{of anger}} and frustration, Edward says {{that he wanted to}} kill her instead of Paul. In the days that follow, while looking at the {{underside}} of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they {{will find a way to}} move on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat,</b> Edward stops the car at an intersection. Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her.

25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
25|$|The next day, August 10, 1977, police {{investigated}} Berkowitz's {{car that}} was parked on the street outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street in Yonkers. They saw a rifle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat,</b> searched the car, and found a duffel bag filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Omega Task Force. Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment, rather than risk a violent encounter in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried that their search might be challenged in court. The initial search of the vehicle {{was based on the}} rifle that was visible in the back seat, although possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State and required no special permit. The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00p.m. and entered his car. Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car. Falotico pointed his gun inches from the temple of the person of interest, while Detective Sgt. William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side.|$|E

2500|$|John Farrar was {{the captain}} of the Edgartown Fire Rescue unit and diver who {{recovered}} Kopechne's body.

Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile {{with a cup of coffee}} in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat,</b> but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E
500|$|The second part, titled [...] "Partition", is {{preceded by}} the sound of paparazzi camera clicks and a window {{whirring}} up, which separates it from the first part [...] "Yoncé". [...] "Partition" [...] has a fractured production and is lyrically about the female protagonist having sex with her romantic interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of a limousine. Caitlin White, writing for The 405, highlighted that the song details a romantic relationship in which women do not act as sexual objects during sexual intercourse but rather use [...] "the physical act of love as a form of agency", from which they derive pleasure. [...] "Partition" [...] gained significant attention for its explicit lyrics, with frequent references made to the opening lines of the first verse in which Beyoncé asks her driver to put up the partition.|$|E
