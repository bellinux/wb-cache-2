25|$|In other words, the {{considerable}} observable differences {{between humans and}} chimps may be due {{as much or more}} to genome level variation in the number, function and expression of genes rather than DNA sequence changes in shared genes. Indeed, even within humans, there {{has been found to be}} a previously unappreciated amount of copy number variation (CNV) which can make up as much as 5 – 15% of the human genome. In other words, between humans, there could be +/- 500,000,000 base pairs of DNA, some being active genes, others inactivated, or active at different levels. The full significance of this finding remains to be seen. On average, a typical human protein-coding gene differs from its chimpanzee ortholog by only two amino acid substitutions; nearly one third of human genes have exactly the same protein translation as their chimpanzee orthologs. A major difference between the two genomes is human chromosome 2, which is equivalent to a <b>fusion</b> <b>product</b> of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13. (later renamed to chromosomes 2A and 2B, respectively).|$|E

25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to Bremsstrahlung power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} <b>fusion</b> <b>products</b> is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the <b>fusion</b> <b>products</b> move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the <b>fusion</b> <b>products</b> themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, <b>fusion</b> <b>products</b> will build up. If the <b>fusion</b> <b>products</b> are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|R
