40|$|The {{problem of}} {{unsteady}} convective diffusion of miscible solute in a fully developed micropolar fluid flow in a cylindrical tube is solved for {{the cases of}} no chemical reaction at the bounding walls of the tube and when there is <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> The convection and dispersion coefficients of all time validity are obtained {{when there is no}} chemical reaction. The exchange coefficient arises in the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> case. The time dependent expression for the exchange coefficient is obtained explicitly and is found to be independent of the velocity distribution of the flow; however it does depend on the initial solute distribution. Because of the complexity of the interphase mass transfer problem only an asymptotic long time analysis is made of the convection and dispersion coefficients. The expression for the mean concentration distribution of the solute is also evaluated in both non-reactive and reactive cases. The problem succeeds in demonstrating the generality of the Eringen micro-continuum model by spanning the results of a few continuum fluid models as limiting cases of the present study...|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} dispersion of a solute in peristaltic flow of a reactive incompressible micropolar biofluid is studied {{as a model}} of chyme transport in the human intestinal system with wall effects. The long wavelength approximation, Taylor's limiting condition and dynamic boundary conditions at the flexible walls are used to obtain the average effective dispersion coefficient in the presence of combined homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions. The effects of various pertinent parameters on the effective dispersion coefficient are discussed. It is observed that average effective dispersion coefficient increases with amplitude ratio which implies that dispersion is enhanced in the presence of peristalsis. Furthermore average effective dispersion coefficient is also elevated with the micropolar rheological and wall parameters.
