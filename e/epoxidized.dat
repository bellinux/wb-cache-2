50|$|In its {{application}} as an epoxy oil, vernonia oil competes with soybean or linseed oil, which supply {{most of the}} market for these applications. Its low viscosity makes it more desirable than fully <b>epoxidized</b> linseed or soybean oils. It is more comparable to partially <b>epoxidized</b> linseed or soybean oil.|$|E

50|$|It is used {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} {{as a catalyst for}} the epoxidation of allylic alcohols by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The VO(acac)2-TBHP system exclusively <b>epoxidizes</b> geraniol at the allylic alcohol position, leaving the other alkene of geraniol untouched. By comparison, m-CPBA, another <b>epoxidizing</b> agent, reacts with both alkenes, creating the products in a two to one ratio favoring reaction at the alkene away from the hydroxyl group. TBHP oxidizes VO(acac)2 to a vanadium(V) species which coordinates the alcohol of the substrate and the hydroperoxide.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of Chloramine-M (CH 3 SO 2 NClNa), benzaldehyde, and benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTEAC) {{was found to}} <b>epoxidize</b> {{a wide range of}} olefins. While epoxidation of trans-olefins provided exclusively trans- epoxides, cis-olefins (cis-stilbene, cis-β-methylstyrene, and 4 -cis-octene) gave trans-epoxides as major products. Good to excellent diastereoselectivities were obtained for epoxidation of two substituted cyclohexenes. Chloramine-T was found to give a slower reaction than Chloramine-M. cis-N-Sulfonyloxaziridine D is proposed to be the <b>epoxidizing</b> agent in this novel epoxidation reaction {{on the basis of the}} mechanistic studies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The {{next steps}} of JH {{biosynthesis}} differ between orders. In Lepidoptera and mosquitoes farnesoic acid or its homologs is <b>epoxidized</b> by a P450 dependent farnesoic acid methyl epoxidase, {{then it is}} methylated by a JH acid methyl transferase In most orders, farnesoic acid is methylated by farensoic acid methyl transferase, and then is <b>epoxidized</b> by a P450 dependent methyl transferas.|$|E
50|$|In {{substrates}} containing multiple double bonds, {{the most}} electron-rich double bond {{can usually be}} selectively <b>epoxidized.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unsaturated esters may be <b>epoxidized</b> {{using either}} electrophilic or {{nucleophilic}} methods. Lanthanide-mediated epoxidation {{has been successfully}} applied to cinnamates and β-heteroaryl unsaturated esters. Amides are also <b>epoxidized</b> under lanthanide-mediated conditions.(11)Epoxidations of other electron-deficient double bonds (substituted by electron-withdrawing groups other than carbonyls) are limited in scope, although a few examples have been reported. The ability of the carbonyl group to coordinate Lewis acidic functionality is critical for most existing methods.|$|E
50|$|Electron-poor double bonds {{take much}} longer to <b>epoxidize.</b> Heating {{may be used}} to {{encourage}} oxidation, although the reaction temperature should never exceed 50 °C, to avoid decomposition of the dioxirane.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the best}} ketones for the second {{strategy}} are derived from carbohydrates. For instance, Shi's catalyst 1 is derived from fructose, and <b>epoxidizes</b> both di- and trisubstituted alkenes with high enantioselectivity.|$|R
50|$|Nucleophilic {{epoxidation}} is {{the formation}} of epoxides from electron-deficient double bonds through the action of nucleophilic oxidants. Nucleophilic epoxidation methods represent {{a viable alternative to}} electrophilic methods, many of which do not <b>epoxidize</b> electron-poor double bonds efficiently.|$|R
50|$|The centre also {{developed}} {{an entirely new}} material, thermoplastic <b>epoxidized</b> natural rubber. This has excellent oil-resistance and heat resistance.|$|E
50|$|Epoxidations of alkynes and allenes proceed by concerted {{mechanisms}} {{analogous to}} epoxidations of simple alkenes. Often, these <b>epoxidized</b> products are unstable and undergo further oxidation reactions via different mechanisms, such as Y-H insertion.|$|E
50|$|Polymer {{networks}} {{other than}} epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A {{have been used}} in vitrimer technology, such as polylactic acid (polylactide), polyhydroxyurethanes, <b>epoxidized</b> soybean oil with citric acid, and polybutadiene.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ease with}} which Jacobsen's {{catalyst}} selectively <b>epoxidizes</b> cis-alkenes {{has been difficult to}} replicate with terminal and trans-alkenes. [...] Structural changes to the ligand and adaptations to the protocol for the epoxidation reaction, however, have led to some successes in these areas. [...] For example, derivatives of Jacobsen's catalyst with minor structural changes to the salen backbone have been used in conjunction with low temperatures and the oxidant m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to <b>epoxidize</b> the terminal alkene styrene. The low temperature of the reaction favors only one pathway, the cis pathway, while m-CPBA is used because of water's high freezing point. Little success has occurred with the epoxidation of trans alkenes by manganese compounds but other salen coordination compounds, such as oxochromium complexes, can be used.|$|R
50|$|Although dioxiranes {{are highly}} electrophilic, they <b>epoxidize</b> both electron-rich and electron-poor alkenes in good yield (although the latter react much more slowly). Electron-poor epoxide {{products}} also exhibit enhanced hydrolytic stability, {{meaning that they}} can often survive in situ conditions. Epoxidations of electron-rich double bonds have yielded intermediates of Rubottom oxidation. Upon hydrolysis, these siloxyepoxides yield α-hydroxyketones.|$|R

High yields of primary, secondary and tertiary furyl hydroperoxides have been achieved employing catalytic amount of Mo(CO) (6). A radical mechanism is in agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
50|$|One of the alkenes can be <b>epoxidized</b> using mCPBA, peroxybenzoic acid, or dimethyldioxirane (DMDO). Using a peracid (mCPBA or peroxybenzoic acid), the epoxy product quickly rearranges, catalyzed by {{the acid}} {{byproduct}} of the epoxidation.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 19982, 5 -dihydroxyacetanilide {{epoxidase}} from Streptomyces LL-C 10037 (DHAE I) catalyzes the epoxidation of hydroquinone 4, to form epoxyquinone 7. DHAE I {{has been}} purified to homogeneity, {{with an overall}} purification factor greater than 23, 000. N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences have been obtained from the purified enzyme so that the epoxidase gene may be cloned by using reverse genetics. The epoxidation reaction of DHAE I requires only molecular oxygen and no added cofactors. The detailed chemical mechanism has been elucidated using isotopically labeled oxygen. DHAE I is a dioxygenase belonging to a new and unrecognized class of dioxygenases that are described as "hydroquinone <b>epoxidizing</b> dioxygenases. " DHAE I and another <b>epoxidizing</b> enzyme which acts on the same substrate but producing the enantiomeric epoxide, DHAE II from Streptomyces MPP 3051, have had their active sites examined for structural latitude. DHAE II shows more flexibility toward substrate analogs than DHAE I. However, both enzymes are very specific for the correct substrate. From these studies, crude three dimensional models of the two active sites have been constructed...|$|R
50|$|In {{combination}} with BINOL ligands and cumene hydroperoxide, lanthanide alkoxides {{can be used}} to <b>epoxidize</b> both trans and cis enones with high enantioselectivity. Studies of non-linear effects with these catalyst systems suggest that the active catalyst is oligomeric.(5)Homopolymers of amino acids (polypeptides) {{can also be used to}} effect enantioselective epoxidations in the presence of an enone and a peroxide. Structure-reactivity relationships have not emerged, but enantioselectivities in these reactions are often high, and polypeptides can often be used when other methods fail.|$|R

5000|$|A {{recent example}} of the Fürst-Plattner rule {{can be seen from}} Chrisman et al. where {{limonene}} is <b>epoxidized</b> to give a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. Exposure to a nitrogen nucleophile in water at reflux provides only one ring opened product in 75-85% ee.|$|E
40|$|Selected {{species of}} the order Peronosporales, which are unable to <b>epoxidize</b> {{squalene}} and thus synthesize sterols, are able to metabolize exogenous cycloartenol to lanosterol and in some organisms to fucosterol, ergosterol, and cholesterol. Lanosterol was less effectively utilized but some ergosterol and cholesterol were yielded. Fucosterol was very efficiently metabolized by most species to ergosterol, Δ 7 -ergostenol, Δ 5 -ergostenol, cholestanol, and cholesterol. Several unknown sterols were observed in most trials. These data suggest a vestigial sterol synthetic pathway derived from cycloartenol, followed by possible isomerization to lanosterol and then to other sterols...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of a-silylated allylic alcohols with <b>epoxidizing</b> reagents afforded {{in a highly}} stereocontrolled fashion a-silylated aldols. The transformation is proposed to proceed either by a reaction cascade involving stereospecific epoxidation of the allylic-alcohol moiety followed by an acid-supported pinacol-type rearrangement, or by a sequence consisting of a p-face-selective electrophilic attack at the allylic silane moiety with hyperconjugative stabilization of the evolving carbocation, followed by rearrangement of the thus obtained pentacoordinated silanium ion (see Scheme 3). Depending on the reaction conditions, the p-face selectivity of the oxidation step {{is controlled by the}} stereogenic C-atom or the more remote Si-center of chirality...|$|R

II was prepd. by first <b>epoxidizing</b> I, then treating this epoxide with a Lewis acid in presence of thiophenol. The rearrangement that ensued placed an alc. at C- 5 position and trapped the nucleophile at C- 8 position, allowing the reintroduction of the double bond by oxidn. of the sulfide followed by a thermal elimination.

5000|$|This {{procedure}} generates epoxides {{with high}} enantiomeric excesses from trans-disubstituted alkenes and trisubstituted alkenes. Cis-disubstituted alkenes and styrenes are asymmetrically <b>epoxidized</b> using a similar catalyst.

One-pot multicomponent processes and one-pot consecutive processes have been discovered that allow compounds to be prepared without having to isolate and purify the intermediates, thereby minimizing the waste. As part of a senior capstone project, a one-pot synthesis for chalcone epoxides has been developed. Various chalcone epoxides can be synthesized from substituted benzaldehydes and acetophenones by one-pot consecutive reactions of aldol condensation and epoxidation.
