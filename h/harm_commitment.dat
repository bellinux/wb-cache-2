I survey experimental developments suggesting that ordinary people often tacitly reason in terms of such deontological rules. It’s now unclear whether we should posit a traditional form of the Doctrine of Double Effect. However, further research suggests that a range of non-consequentialist factors influence moral judgment, including: intentions, commissions, personal <b>harm,</b> and agent-centered <b>commitments.</b> Many, if not all, such factors appear to affect how involved the agent is in bringing about an outcome...|$|R
30|$|Long {{investment}} cycles in infrastructures (e.g., {{road and}} rail construction) can hinder radical and rapid change. One strategy {{to cope with}} lock-ins related to a transition to sustainable mobility {{is to develop a}} long-term policy vision at the EU-level. 12 Policy instruments that can contribute to reducing lock-in also include provision of financial support and (green) public procurement [58]. It is not easy to break a lock-in, because the coalitions that benefit from it are likely to resist any change [59]. Thus the development of simultaneously flexible and robust policy-mix packages is essential {{in order to deal with}} negative (rejection or environmental <b>harm)</b> and positive (<b>commitment)</b> lock-in effects [60]. Moreover, the historically nexus of social and technical connection of automobiles to everyday lives has created a lock-in situation of an “automobility culture” synonymously seen as a symbol of ‘good life’ and “freedom” of citizens (‘citizenship of mobility’) [61].|$|R
40|$|Nationwide in the United States, 70 % {{of faculty}} members in higher {{education}} are employed off the tenure-track. Nearly all of these non-tenure-track (NTT) appointments share a quality that may produce stress for those who hold them: contingency. Most NTT appointments are contingent on budget, enrollment, or both, {{and the majority of}} contingent faculty members are hired for one quarter or semester at a time. Significant research has investigated the effects of contingency on teaching, students, departments, colleges, and universities; however, little research has focused on the psychological experiences of NTT faculty. The current study examined perceptions of workplace stressors and <b>harm,</b> organizational <b>commitment,</b> common coping mechanisms, and depression, anxiety and stress among NTT faculty using a longitudinal design that spanned two to four months. Results indicate that NTT faculty perceive unique stressors at work that are related to their contingent positions. Specific demographic characteristics and coping strategies, inability to find a permanent faculty position, and commitment to one’s organization predispose NTT faculty to perceive greater harm and more sources of stress in their workplaces. Demographic characteristics, lower income, inability to find a permanent faculty position, disengagement coping mechanisms (e. g., giving up, denial), and organizational commitment were associated with the potential for negative outcomes, particularly depression, anxiety, and stress. Our findings suggest possibilities for institutional intervention. Overall, we argue that universities would be well-served by attending to the needs of NTT faculty on campus in order to mitigate negative outcomes for institutions, students, and faculty...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the news}} {{that a number of}} Eurocare members and EPHA {{partners}} representing young people have withdrawn from the European Alcohol and Health Forum (EAHF) (1), a number of inaccurate claims have been made by the alcohol industry to undermine an ambitious future EU Action Plan on alcohol-related <b>harm</b> and NGO <b>commitments</b> to achieve this. In several media articles, alcohol industry representatives (2) have attempted to misrepresent the reasons why these civil society organisations resigned from the EAHF. EPHA and Eurocare would like to address this and reiterate our concerns about the reliance by the European Commission on self-regulation (3) and the role of economic operators (4). The primary obligation of the drinks industry is to increase shareholder value by increasing sales of alcohol, whereas the primary obligation of the health community is to prevent alcohol related harm by advocating for proven policies with a strong evidence base (5). The drinks industry has significantly greater financial power for activities targeting the media and lobbying budget and uses this power to oppose any evidence based policy which is likely to reduce their profits, the majority of which come from sales to hazardous and harmful drinkers. As such the two sets of organisations have inherently opposed objectives...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 86 % of children aged 2 to 14 are subjected to sexual, emotional and physical abuse globally. Regardless of the vulnerable situations, which expose children {{to the risk of}} being harmed, it is very possible to prevent children from <b>harm</b> by having <b>commitments</b> and deliberate efforts by different actors such as families (including kin), communities, states, NGOs, international organizations, or other stakeholders concerned with the best interests of children. The purpose of this thesis was to explore experiences of collaboration between Advocacy Non Governmental Organizations and Government Social Welfare Officers in preventing children from sexual, emotional and physical abuse in Arusha, Tanzania. The thesis is a fieldwork study employing in-depth interviews as method of data collection. Secondary data was also used in this study. The study included three government social welfare officers and three representatives from advocacy nongovernmental organizations. The study findings indicated that collaboration between advocacy NGOs and government social welfare officers exists. Furthermore, the study also disclosed opportunities and challenges of collaboration between advocacy NGOs and government social welfare officers Apart from getting their experience of protecting children from harm, the sample was able to demonstrate nature and experience of collaboration between Arusha City Social Welfare Officers and Advocacy NGOs working in the child sector in Arusha...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} waiting time, number of delays, and {{correlations}} of non-commitment to the systematic referral to the outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) among {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery (CABG) patients. Methods The cross-sectional study data were gathered through evaluations related to 1, 187 CABG patients who were referred to the outpatient CR of 1 hospital in western Iran during 2010 to 2014. The instruments included were demographics and actual risk factors checklist, single item of perceived risk factors, and Beck depression inventory (BDI). Data was analyzed via chi-square test, ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test, and binary logistic regression analysis. Results Among 1 187 patients (830 male), 27 % had delayed referral, {{and the number of}} delays decreased from 2010 (49. 3 %) to 2014 (7. 6 %) (P < 0. 001). The mean of the waiting time to receive outpatient CR in western Iran was an estimated 59 days. This mean has been reduced from 66 days (2010) to 53 days (2014) (P < 0. 001). After adjustment for all demographics, the results indicated that diabetic patients (P = 0. 002) and patients with biological (P = 0. 002), behavioral (P = 0. 003), or psychological (P = 0. 002) perceived risk factors have less commitment. In addition, a family history of cardiac increases the possibility of commitment as 2. 41 times (P < 0. 001). Conclusions Despite the progressive process of patients’ admittance and acceptability of the present waiting time, especially after 2014, it seems that more attention to diabetic patients and patients without a family history of cardiac, and modification of attitudes about multiple risk factors can associate the self-care with more responsibility and it may also be affective in the control of <b>harm</b> consequences through <b>commitment</b> to the systematic referral...|$|R
40|$|Building on a {{long history}} and culture of tolerance, the Dutch responded to illicit drugs with decades of pragmatic {{measures}} free of judgment. A central element of modern Dutch drug policy was a crucial decision to establish a legal and practical separation of cannabis [...] judged to pose "acceptable" risks to consumers and society [...] from hard drugs associated with unacceptable risk. This policy effectively decriminalized possession and use of cannabis {{and opened the door}} for tolerated outlets for small-scale cannabis sales that eventually took the form of the well-known Dutch "coffee shops. " By all measures, the coffee shops succeeded in enabling cannabis consumers to avoid exposure to hard drug scenes and markets. Dutch cannabis consumers have also been spared the profound costs of carrying a criminal record, and the public has not had to bear the cost of incarceration for minor offenses. Drug policy in the Netherlands was characterized by a pragmatic bottom up development in which policies developed through trial and error at a local level often initiated by local officials in consultation with representatives from civil society who were supported by national policy makers. With respect to heroin and other hard drugs, the Dutch government at national and municipal level put a premium on reduction of individual and social <b>harm.</b> This <b>commitment</b> has been reflected in the government's investment in comprehensive health and social services. Low-threshold methadone and safe consumption rooms as well as needle exchange programs proliferated earlier and with higher coverage than in most of Europe. Even before these services were established, however, tolerance for sale and consumption of illicit hard drugs in designated "house addresses" greatly reduced the dangers of an open drug scene, including exposure to uncontrolled criminal elements. It also contributed to a preference for drug consumption not involving injection. The Netherlands was spared the major druglinked HIV epidemic that devastated drug users and their families in other European countries. An important element of this success, at times, was not only pragmatic national policy but also the degree of autonomy that municipal officials had to exercise of practices that did not conform to the letter of the law. None of this was without its challenges. For example, while the coffee shops provided a venue for safe and controlled consumption of cannabis without exposing consumers to harmful hard drug scenes, successive governments have not successfully addressed the so-called back door problem [...] coffee shops being supplied with cannabis by an illegal market. While there were instances of popular support for the complete legalization or government regulation of the cannabis market, which would address this problem, there were always political challenges to securing such a policy. Though confidently preserving the core of their policy and continuing to focus on reduction of individual and social drug-related harm, successive Dutch governments have felt international pressure to not "step over the line" into areas such as legalization and regulation of drugs. In addition, attempts to address drug tourism by making coffee shops exclusive Dutch-only clubs seem to create more problems than they solve, evoking opposition from proprietors, patrons, civil society, legal experts and city mayors alike. Nevertheless, some municipalities continue to complain of drug tourism while enjoying the substantial revenue generated by coffee shops. This report is an in-depth analysis of the politics and the practicalities that enabled or led the Dutch authorities at national and local levels to make the drug policy decisions that have shaped the lives of people who use or are otherwise affected by drugs in the Netherlands. It is the authors' hope that it will be of use to those outside the Netherlands, in government and civil society, who seek drug policy solutions that are respectful of human rights and based strongly in science and good public health practice. If there is one lesson to take away from the Dutch experience, it is that when taking steps toward regulating cannabis or other psychoactive substances meant for human consumption, these should include the entire chain of supply, from production to consumptio...|$|R
