Rep 20 is very specific for this parasite, and is made of 21 bp units, organized in repeated blocks with direct and inverted orientation. Based in this particular organization, we selected a unique consensus oligonucleotide (pf- 21) to drive a PCR reaction coupled to hybridization to non-radioactive labeled probes. The pf- 21 unique oligo PCR (pf- 21 -I) assay produced <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>fingerprints</b> when was applied on purified P. falciparum DNA samples (Brazil and Colombia), {{as well as in}} patient's blood samples from a large area of Venezuela.

Coupled to non-radioactive hybridization the pf- 21 -I performed better than the traditional microscopic method with a r= 1. 7 : 1. In the case of mixed infections the r value of P. falciparum detection increased to 2. 5 : 1.

The <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> (DAF) technique was used to generate fingerprint profiles of a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF- 10 A) and a human breast cancer cell line (MCF- 7). When compared with one another, a polymorphic biomarker gene (262 base pairs (bps)) was identified in MCF- 10 A but was not present in MCF- 7. This gene was cloned from the genomic DNA of the MCF- 10 A cell line, and subjected to Genbank database analysis. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence polymorphic marker (Genbank account: AC 079630) shows that this biomarker has 100 % homology with the nucleotide sequence of human chromosome 12 BAC RP 11 - 476 D 10 (bps 19612 - 19353). The nucleotide sequence was used for possible protein translation product and the result obtained indicated that the gene codes for hypothetical protein XF 2620. In order to evaluate the effects that the 262 bps biomarker {{would have on the}} morphology of MCF- 7 cells, it was transfected into MCF- 7 cells.

40|$|AbstractA {{theoretical}} framework for prediction {{of the dynamic}} evolution of chemical species in <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> reactions, for any specified sequence and operating conditions, is reported. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as an example, we developed a sequence- and temperature-dependent kinetic model for <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> using first-principles biophysical modeling of DNA hybridization and polymerization. We compare this kinetic model with prior PCR models and discuss the features of our model that are essential for quantitative prediction of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> efficiency for arbitrary sequences and operating conditions. Using this model, the kinetics of PCR is analyzed. The ability of the model {{to distinguish between the}} dynamic evolution of distinct DNA sequences in <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> reactions is demonstrated. The kinetic model is solved for a typical PCR temperature protocol to motivate the need for optimization of the dynamic operating conditions of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> reactions.

Virol. 64, 3012 – 3018). In an attempt to define domains of Rep which are {{required}} for this effect a set of expression constructs was generated for Rep mutants with either N-terminal and/or C-terminal truncations, with small internal deletions, or with point mutations. In transient cotransfection assays these mutants were tested for the inhibition of HSV-induced <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> and in parallel for DNA replication of a rep-defective AAV genome. Our data show that the C-terminal region of Rep where spliced and unspliced proteins differ is dispensable for both AAV DNA replication and inhibition of HSV-induced <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification.</b> The N-terminus of Rep is required for AAV DNA replication, whereas the first 174 amino acids can be deleted without loss of function for the inhibition of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification.</b> Rep 52 which starts at methionine 225 is neither sufficient, nor required for this effect. We further analyzed the region between amino acids 174 and 225 : A stretch of 16 highly hydrophilic amino acids is dispensable for the inhibition of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification,</b> but it is required for AAV DNA replication. Deletion of two short motifs spanning putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites each strongly reduce both AAV DNA replication and inhibition of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification,</b> whereas a single amino acid substitution of one of these sites abolished AAV DNA replication with no effect on the inhibition of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification.</b> Our data show that most, but not all, of the sequence elements within the N-terminus of Rep 78 required for AAV DNA replication coincide with those required for the inhibition of HSV-induced <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification.</b> A replication-negative version of Rep 78 comprising the internal 60 % of the protein still carry the entire inhibitory function for HSV-induced <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification...</b>|$|R

40|$|Phoma exigua is {{considered}} to be an assemblage of at least nine varieties that are mainly distinguished on the basis of host specificity and pathogenicity. However, these varieties are also reported to be weak pathogens and secondary invaders on non-host tissue. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish P. exigua from its close relatives and to correctly identify isolates up to the variety level, because of their low genetic variation and high morphological similarity. Because of quarantine issues and phytosanitary measures, a robust DNA-based tool is required for accurate and rapid identification of the separate taxa in this species complex. The present study therefore aims to develop such a tool based on unique nucleotide sequence identifiers. More than 60 strains of P. exigua and related species were compared in terms of partial actin gene sequences, or analysed using <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> (DAF) with short, arbitrary, mini-hairpin primers.

Radio-labelled <b>DNA</b> <b>Amplification</b> <b>Fingerprinting</b> was used to indicate the level of genetic variation within C. brewsteri. Phylogenetic analyses supported the maintenance of the four native Cassia taxa at species level and the division of C. brewsteri into two subspecies. Ecological parameters associated with 124 sites of natural or cultivated occurrence were characterised in terms of soil and vegetation type, and potential cultivation areas predicted using the climate modelling software BIOCLIM. A broad area of eastern Queensland was shown to be suitable for the cultivation of the tree. Reproductive phenology of the tree was documented and found to allow for a confined harvest period (once per year). Seed germination was achieved most effectively by mechanical scarification while propagation by rooted cuttings was unsuccessful.

The genetic relatedness among isolates within each VCG, {{and between the}} 8 different VCGs of Foc present in Australia was determined. The DNA fingerprint patterns were VCG-specific, with each VCG representing a unique genotype. The genetic similarity among isolates within each VCG ranged from 97 % to 100 %. Among the different VCGs of Foc, 3 major clusters were distinguished which corresponded with race. All Race 1 and 2 isolates (VCGs 0124, 0125, 0128, and 01220) were closely related and clustered together, the Race 3 isolates from Heliconia clustered separately, and all Race 4 isolates (VCGs 0120, 0129, 01211, and 01213 / 16) clustered together. Fifteen isolates from Alstonville, NSW, were characterised because although they were classified as Race 2 based on their recovery from cooking banana cultivars, they belonged in VCG 0124, which had previously contained only Race 1 isolates. The occurrence {{of more than one}} race within a VCG means that vegetative compatibility grouping cannot be used to assign pathotype to pathogenic race as previously thought.

Fahari yielded the highest concentration of crude protein (46. 51 mg/mg dry leaf) while Vegetable cowpea yielded the lowest (24. 41 mg/mg dry leaf). The influence of manure was also found to be effective by increasing the crude protein content of the genotypes as shown by Fahari dark with an average of 53. 53 mg/mg dry leaf as opposed to 39. 85 mg/mg dry leaf without manure application. Although some small clusters grouped accessions of the same growth habits, a general lack of agreement between clustering and morphological features was observed. It can therefore be concluded that the significant differences between the molecular genetic analysis using DAF-PCR markers, morphologic characters and yield traits can be important tools to identify and discriminates the different cowpea genotypes...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica {{is among}} the {{principal}} etiological agents of food-borne illness in humans. Increasing antimicrobial resistance in S. enterica is a cause for worldwide concern. There is concern at present {{in relation to the}} increasing incidence of human infection with antimicrobial agent-resistant strains of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium, in particular of phage type DT 104. Integrons appear {{to play an important role}} in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes in many Enterobacteriaceae including S. enterica. In this study the antimicrobial susceptibilities and phage types of 74 randomly collected strains of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium from the Cork region of southern Ireland, obtained from human, animal (clinical), and food sources, were determined. Each strain was examined for integrons and typed by <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> (DAF). Phage type DT 104 predominated (n = 48). Phage types DT 104 b (n = 3), - 193 (n = 9), - 195 (n = 6), - 208 (n = 3), - 204 a (n = 2), PT U 302 (n = 1), and two nontypeable strains accounted for the remainder. All S. enterica serotype Typhimurium DT 104 strains were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, Sulfonamide Duplex, and tetracycline, and one strain was additionally resistant to trimethoprim. All DT 104 strains but one were of a uniform DAF type (designated DAF-I) and showed a uniform pattern of integrons (designated IP-I). The DT 104 b and PT U 302 strains also exhibited the same resistance phenotype, and both had the DAF-I and IP-I patterns. The DAF-I pattern was also observed in a single DT 193 strain in which no integrons were detectable. Greater diversity of antibiograms and DAF and IP patterns among non-DT 104 phage types was observed. These data indicate a remarkable degree of homogeneity at a molecular level among contemporary isolates of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium DT 104 from animal, human, and food sources in this region...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{cells in}} blood may {{represent}} “a real time liquid biopsy” through the interrogation of single cancer cells thereby determining the outspread of their heterogeneity and guiding therapy. In this thesis, {{we focused on}} single cancer cell analysis downstream of the isolation of cancer cells from blood. We designed and developed various microfluidic devices for genetic and phenotypic characterization of single cancer cells. The limited DNA content in a single cell requires <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> to evaluate genetic information at the single cell level. We designed a microfluidic device for 8 parallel <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> reactions in 20 nanoliter chambers. Button-shaped valves were integrated to enhance mixing of reagents in closed chambers. A 1, 000 -fold <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> was achieved and 33...|$|R
40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> is {{ubiquitous}} {{in the biological}} world [1]: programmed amplification of genes occurs during development [2], and selection for DNA amplifi-cation can underlie cancerous growth [3], as well as drug resistance [4, 5]. In Leishmania, protozoan para-sites of humans, the frequency of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> events {{gave rise to the}} concept of genome plasticity [6 – 9]. Selection, for instance, enriches for Leishmania with amplifications of genes that encode drug targets, transporters or metabolic enzymes, such as R DNA (DHFR-TS), G DNA (NAGT), and H DNA (PTR 1 and PGPA) [6, 8, 10, 11]. However, <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications</b> have been found even in Leishmania strains that do not appear to have undergone selection [12 – 14]. The prod-ucts of amplification in Leishmania are generally smal...|$|R
40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> is a {{molecular}} process {{that increases the}} copy number of a chromosomal tract and often causes elevated expression of the amplified gene(s). Although gene amplification is frequently observed in cancer and other degenerative disorders, the molecular mechanisms {{involved in the process}} of DNA copy number increase remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that small DNA fragments could be the trigger of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> events. Following our findings that small fragments of DNA in the form of DNA oligonucleotides can be highly recombinogenic, we have developed a system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to capture events of chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> initiated by small DNA fragments. Here we demonstrate that small DNAs can amplify a chromosomal region, generating either tandem duplications or acentric extrachromosomal DNA circles. Small fragment-driven <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> (SFDA) occurs with a frequency that increases with the length of homology between the small DNAs and the target chromosomal regions. SFDA events are triggered even by small single-stranded molecules with as little as 20 -nt homology with the genomic target. A double-strand break (DSB) external to the chromosomal amplicon region stimulates the amplification event up to a factor of 20 and favors formation of extrachromosomal circles. SFDA is dependent on Rad 52 and Rad 59, partially dependent on Rad 1, Rad 10, and Pol 32, and independent of Rad 51, suggesting a single-strand annealing mechanism. Our results reveal a novel molecular model for gene amplification, in which small DNA fragments drive <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> and define the boundaries of the amplicon region. As DNA fragments are frequently found both inside cells and in the extracellular environment, such as the serum of patients with cancer or other degenerative disorders, we propose that SFDA may be a common mechanism for <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> in cancer cells, as well as a more general cause of DNA copy number variation in nature...|$|R
