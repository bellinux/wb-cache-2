2500|$|What {{makes the}} lives of {{transgender}} individuals in Jamaica different from those in other countries {{is the fact that}} Jamaican society has an exceptionally low tolerance for LGBTQ individuals, especially male-to-female transgender women, according to a case study done by the University of West Indies’ Sir Arthur Lewis <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Economic <b>Studies.</b> [...] The stigmas placed upon these individuals influence their perception of the world, and upon internalising these stigmas, the treatment process becomes more difficult. [...] The viewpoint arises that doctors will stigmatise patients or treat them badly because of the unconventionality of the treatment being carried out. [...] Ultimately, low tolerance leads patients to obtain less treatment overall.|$|R
