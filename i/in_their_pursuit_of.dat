5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E

One of Parākramabāhu's ambitions was the reunification of these groups into one order, as had existed {{at the time of}} Dutugamunu.

However, he refused to fight alongside them against Uthman's successor, Caliph Ali (r. 656–661) at the Battle of the Camel. Instead, he settled in Mecca. Despite not participating in the war with Ali, Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), a leading opponent of Ali, appointed Sa'id governor of Medina in 669.

The Assyrians were able to establish their independence on two occasions, during the Old Assyrian Kingdom and the Middle Assyrian Kingdom, with the latter reaching as far as Babylon <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> conquest. However, military tactics mainly involved using troops raised from farmers who had finished planting their fields and so could campaign for the king until harvest time called for their attention again. The result was that military campaigning was limited to {{a few months of}} the year. As a result, armies could not conquer vast amounts of land without having to rest (and hence allow their enemy to recover) and even if they did they {{would not be able to}} garrison conquered lands with troops for long.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} time in less than a month, Glenn McGrath was ruled out of a test due to injury – this time with elbow problems. Australia also dropped Jason Gillespie from their side after taking just three wickets so far in the series. In contrast, England {{remained}} with their original starting XI from the first Test. They carried on their first innings form with their best of the series (477 all out), before England's bowlers managed to swing the ball prodigiously to leave Australia at 99/5 and 175/9. Despite the best efforts of Brett Lee, Australia finished 259 runs behind England and were asked to follow-on – {{for the first time in}} 17 years. However, with the need to bowl for two innings in a row, Simon Jones, England's best swing bowler, started showing signs of injury and was taken to hospital for a scan on his ankle.

Haru's father tries to reveal this group's leader after he is reformed, but an assassin kills him. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, and goes on a mission into Sae's Palace when she discovers their identities. Following her defeat, the group is forced to split up when they are confronted by police, and the protagonist is arrested, leading to the interrogation in the frame story. Akechi is subsequently revealed to be a traitor working for the conspiracy. The protagonist convinces Sae of his righteousness and hatches a scheme to use the reality within Sae's still-intact Palace to save himself when Akechi attempts to kill him in a staged suicide. Failure to complete any Palace prior to this point or revealing the identities of the other Phantom Thieves results in Akechi killing the protagonist.|$|E

The 5th Michigan Cavalry captured the lot, but left Custer cut off from Sheridan, and <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> the fleeing wagons, lost a number of their own men and much of their bounty. One of Wright's regiments, the 7th Georgia, got between Custer's force and Trevilian Station. Custer ordered the 7th Michigan to charge, driving the Georgians back. Hampton now learned of the threat in his rear area and sent in three brigades. Suddenly Custer was virtually surrounded, his command in an ever-shrinking circle, as every side was charged and hit with shells. Sheridan heard the firing from Custer's direction and realized he needed help. He charged with two brigades, pushing Hampton's men back {{all the way to}} the station, while a third brigade swung into Fitzhugh Lee's exposed right flank, thus pushing him back. Hampton fell back to the west, Lee to the east, and the battle ended for the day with the Federals in possession of Trevilian Station.|$|E
