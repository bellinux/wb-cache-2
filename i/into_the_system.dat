5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa between August 15 and August 16. The wave moved westward at 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h), and developed atmospheric convection along the wave axis. It slowly organized, developing a low-level circulation, and formed into a tropical depression on August 20 while located about 775miles (1,250km) east of Barbados. A reconnaissance aircraft flight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> on August 21 confirmed the existence of a depression, which reported winds of only 23mph (37km/h) with a pressure of 1,012 mbar. The depression slowly strengthened and organized, and after turning to the west-northwest, it intensified into Tropical Storm Emmy on August 22 while located 370miles (600km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe. The tropical wave from which Emmy developed from continued westward through the Caribbean Sea and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Joanna in the eastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235miles (375km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved {{further into}} the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual {{weakening}} trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, {{as well as the}} presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August21 and early on August22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> could not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were worked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to address this.|$|E
5|$|Bret {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August5. The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August15 in the western Caribbean Sea, and spawned a low-pressure area. Convective activity developed around the low, and by August18 the system was over the Yucatán Peninsula. Later that day, the disturbance emerged into the Bay of Campeche and a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1:00pm CDT (1800UTC), the third of the 1999 season. Initially, moderate wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over the system. By August19, the wind shear relented, allowing deep convection to develop over the center; later that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Bret. A small tropical cyclone, Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north. By the morning of August20, rainbands began to form.|$|E

5|$|By this time, {{the central}} {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> By this time, the storm had also begun a southeastward track.|$|E
5|$|Charley {{originated}} {{with a large}} swirl of clouds which parted off of {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a well defined center, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation center was present. The following morning, a second flight reported that a center had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression. Initially, the center was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.|$|E
5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; {{this was}} the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early on July26, the {{thunderstorms}} {{along the}} tropical wave became more concentrated {{to the south}} of Cuba, in association with a low-pressure area. The system continued to organize, and by 0600UTC on July27, the surface circulation became defined enough for it to be classified as a tropical depression about 60mi (95km) northeast of Cancún, Mexico. Within twelve hours, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Operationally, the system was not known to be a tropical cyclone until 2100UTC on July27, after a reconnaissance aircraft flight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> confirmed the presence of a closed, albeit elongated, circulation center. At that point, the NHC classified it as Tropical Storm Don. Upon forming, the storm moved to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level ridge over the northern Gulf of Mexico. Due to generally favorable conditions, including warm waters and light to moderate wind shear, the NHC predicted steady intensification to winds of at least 65mph (100km/h). However, none of the tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated much strengthening.|$|E
5|$|Early on September7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{noted that}} {{although}} Maria {{was in an}} area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did not anticipate any strengthening. The system changed little in organization over the next 24hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible satellite imagery depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear. The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) on September8 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> early on September9, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a non-tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands. Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance. When the system approached the northern Leeward Islands on September10, satellite imagery and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40mi (65km) east-southeast of Antigua.|$|E
