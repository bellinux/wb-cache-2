40|$|This studys primary {{objective}} was to evaluate sportsmanship and violence in soccer matches. In order to do so, all the trainers and referees {{in one of the}} feeder teams categories of the Zaragoza and Vitoria Football Clubs took part as experts and judges in drafting a football match evaluation checklist. Two trainers and a referee used this checklist after each match to evaluate the degree of sportsmanlike/unsportsmanlike behaviours that had taken place. The results of the evaluations of all the matches in the 2005 - 2006 season show that parents and spectators displayed the most unsportsmanlike behaviours, followed by the same types of behaviour in players and trainers. There was a lower incidence of violent, unsportsmanlike behaviours. This studys second {{objective was to}} evaluate a protocol to prevent violent incidents during <b>high-risk</b> <b>matches</b> in the leagues second round. This process consisted in signing a collaboration agreement with the training staff of teams that had displayed violent behaviour in the leagues first round. The trainers of these teams were trained to hold meetings and conduct specific exercises during team training sessions to encourage parents and players to behave in a sportsmanlike manner. The results show the positive contribution of these protocols, not only in the absence of violent incidents during <b>high-risk</b> <b>matches,</b> but also in the higher scores on the football match evaluation checklist achieved by participant trainers during the leagues second round, compared with non-participant trainers in the same category...|$|R

50|$|The Estadio Alberto Gallardo is a {{football}} stadium in the Rimac District of Lima, Peru, named after Alberto Gallardo, a former Peruvian football player and manager who played several years for Sporting Cristal. It {{is the home}} of football club Sporting Cristal. Sporting Cristal are among the first sports clubs from the Andean states (geographically and politically) with over 1 million followers on Facebook, together with Atlético Nacional, Alianza Lima, Barcelona SC, Leones del Caracas, Millonarios, Sporting Cristal and Universitario.

40|$|Background Prolonged cold ischemic time (CIT) and {{increased}} donor age are well-known factors negatively influencing outcomes after liver transplantation (LT). Aims The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether the magnitude of their negative effects is related to recipient model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Methods This retrospective study was based on a cohort of 1402 LTs, divided into those performed in low-MELD (0), moderate-MELD (10 – 20), and high-MELD ([20) recipients. Results While neither donor age (p = 0. 775) nor CIT (p = 0. 561) was a significant risk factor for worse 5 -year graft survival in low-MELD recipients, both were found to yield independent effects (p = 0. 003 and p = 0. 012, respectively) in moderate-MELD recipients, and only CIT (p = 0. 004) in high-MELD recipients. However, increased donor age only triggered the negative effect of CIT in moderate-MELD recipients, which was limited to grafts recovered from donors aged C 46 years (p = 0. 019). Notably, utilization of grafts from donors aged C 46 years with CIT C 9 h in moderate-MELD recipients (p = 0. 003) and those with CIT C 9 h irrespective of donor age in high-MELD recipients (p = 0. 031) was associated with partic-ularly compromised outcomes. Conclusions In conclusion, the negative effects of pro-longed CIT seem to be limited to patients with moderate MELD receiving organs procured from older donors and to high-MELD recipients, irrespective of donor age. Varying effects of donor age and CIT according to recipient MELD score should be considered during the allocation process in order to avoid <b>high-risk</b> <b>matches...</b>|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMajor {{amputation}} {{is often}} selected over infrainguinal bypass {{in patients with}} severe systemic comorbidities because it is assumed to have lower perioperative risks, yet this assumption is unproven and largely unexamined. MethodsThe 2005 to 2008 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database was used to identify all patients undergoing either infrainguinal bypass or major amputation using procedural codes. Patients with systemic or local infections were excluded. A subset of high-risk patients were then defined as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4 or 5, or ASA class 3 with renal failure, dyspnea at rest, ventilator dependence, recent congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarct. Propensity score matching was used to obtain two <b>high-risk</b> patient groups <b>matched</b> for preoperative characteristics. ResultsNo significant differences in demographic, preoperative, or anesthetic variables {{were found between the}} <b>matched,</b> <b>high-risk</b> amputation or bypass groups (792 and 780 patients, respectively). Bypass was associated with a lower 30 -day postoperative mortality than amputation (6. 54 % vs 9. 97 %; P =. 0147). Amputation was associated with higher rates of pulmonary embolism (0. 9 % vs 0 % for amputation vs bypass groups, respectively; P =. 009) and urinary tract infection (5. 2 % vs 2. 7 %; P =. 01), while bypass was associated with higher rates of return to the operating room (14. 1 % vs 27. 6 %; P <. 001) and a trend toward higher postoperative transfusion requirements (0. 9 % vs 2. 1 %; P =. 054). The postoperative time to discharge did not differ between the two groups. ConclusionThe decision to perform an infrainguinal bypass or amputation should depend on well-established predictors of graft patency and functional success rather than presumptions about different perioperative risks between the two procedures...|$|R

METHODS: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 459 consecutive HLA-typed patients who underwent perforating keratoplasty (PKP) between 1983 and 2001. Grafts were postoperatively transparent after donor-recipient selection by HLA-A, -B and -DR typing. Patients were divided into a low- and a high-risk group based on their preoperative diagnosis. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation between the number of HLA mismatches and the rate of allograft rejections: a donor-recipient match of two or more alleles in HLA-A, -B or -DR reduces the rejection rate by at least 10 % in low-risk (10 years after PKP; P< 0. 04) and 40 % in high-risk patients (3 years after PKP; P< 0. 0001). Especially HLA-B mismatches are important prognostic factors for both low- and high-risk patients. Considering both HLA-B and -DR mismatches significantly reduces the rate of allograft rejection, particularly in <b>high-risk</b> patients. <b>Matching</b> on a split typing level offers no significant advantage over broad level matching. CONCLUSION: Clinical results confirm theories developed to explain the function of the HLA (MHC) receptor. The closest possible donor-recipient match of HLA antigens based on broad level typing significantly reduces the rate of allograft rejection and thus improves the prognosis for long-term transparency of corneal grafts in both high- and low-risk patients. Besides HLA or major antigens, there are other immunologically relevant tissue surface molecules such as the non-MHC antigens of which blood groups and minor antigens are the most important. Therefore, this thesis also summarizes the discussion and different matching strategies, possibilities and limitations of HLA and tissue typing in perforating corneal transplantation...|$|R
40|$|In the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE) trial, {{clopidogrel}} {{showed a}} statistically significant superiority over aspirin {{in the prevention of}} ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. More recently, post-hoc analysis of the data also showed that repeat hospitalization for ischaemic or bleeding events was decreased with clopidogrel compared with aspirin. Complementary analyses show that the benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin is amplified in a large population at very high risk of further atherothrombotic events (diabetics, patients with high cholesterol, and patients with previous manifestations of atherothrombosis). A potential clinically useful advantage of clopidogrel is its low propensity for adverse interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, contrary to what may be seen with aspirin, as observed in a post-hoc CAPRIE analysis. The putative aspirin-ACE inhibitor interaction is being tested prospectively in the Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure (WATCH) trial - a randomized comparison of warfarin, clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with chronic heart failure. The good gastrointestinal tolerance of clopidogrel seen in CAPRIE has been further demonstrated in a study in healthy volunteers where there was a markedly lower gastroduodenal erosion score after 8 days' administration of clopidogrel 75 mg/day compared with aspirin 325 mg/day (p < 0. 001). Following the positive findings obtained with clopidogrel plus aspirin in the Clopidogrel Aspirin Stent International Cooperative Study (CLASSICS) trial, other studies of clopidogrel plus aspirin have been initiated or are planned.

MethodsConditional logistic regression examined associations with CVD before and after adjustment for conventional risk factors and confounders. Effect modification for the association of GDM with CVD by body mass index (BMI), smoking and chronic hypertension was assessed by stratification and interaction testing. Adjustment for diabetes post-pregnancy evaluated its mediating role. Main outcome measuresInpatient diagnoses or causes of death identifying ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis or peripheral vascular disease. ResultsThe adjusted odds ratios (and 95 % confidence intervals) for the association of CVD with GDM are 1. 51 (1. 07 - 2. 14), 2. 23 (2. 01 - 2. 48) for smoking, 1. 98 (1. 71 - 2. 29) for obesity and 5. 10 (3. 18 - 8. 18) for chronic hypertension. In stratified analysis the association of CVD with GDM was only seen among women with BMI 25, with an odds ratio of 2. 39 (1. 39 - 4. 10), but only women with a BMI < 30 accounted for this increased risk. Adjustment for post-pregnancy diabetes attenuated it somewhat to 1. 99 (1. 13 - 3. 52).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Influenza {{vaccination}} strategies aim at protecting {{high-risk population}} from severe outcomes. Estimating {{the effectiveness of}} seasonal vaccines against influenza related hospitalisation is important to guide these strategies. Large sample size is needed to have precise estimate of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against severe outcomes. We assessed the feasibility of measuring seasonal IVE against hospitalisation with laboratory confirmed influenza through a network of 21 hospitals in the European Union. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre study in France (seven hospitals), Italy (one hospital), and Navarra (four hospitals) and Valencia (nine hospitals) regions in Spain. All ≥ 18 years hospitalised patients presenting an influenza-like illness within seven days were swabbed. Cases were patients RT-PCR positive for influenza A (H 3 N 2); controls were patients negative for any influenza virus. Using logistic regression with study site as a fixed effect we calculated IVE adjusted for potential confounders. We restricted the analyses to those swabbed within four days. RESULTS: We included, 375 A(H 3 N 2) cases and 770 controls. The overall adjusted IVE was 24. 9 % (95 %CI- 1. 8; 44. 6). Among the target group for vaccination (N =  1058) the adjusted IVE was 28. 8 % (95 %CI: 2. 8; 47. 9); it was respectively 36. 8 % (95 %CI:- 48. 8; 73. 1), 42. 6 % (95 %CI:- 16. 5; 71. 7), 17. 8 %(95 %CI:- 40. 8; 52. 1) and 37. 5 % (95 %CI:- 22. 8; 68. 2) in the age groups 18 - 64, 65 - 74, 75 - 84 and more than 84 years. DISCUSSION: Estimation of IVE based on the pooling of data obtained through a European network of hospitals was feasible. Our results suggest a low IVE against hospitalised confirmed influenza in 2011 - 12. The low IVE {{may be explained by}} a poor immune response in the <b>high-risk</b> population, imperfect <b>match</b> between vaccine and circulating strain or waning immunity due to a late season. Increased sample size within this network would allow more precise estimates and stratification of the IVE by time since vaccination and vaccine types or brands...|$|R
40|$|Infants born {{extremely}} prematurely (ie. < 29 weeks gestation) or with {{extremely low}} birth weight (ie. < 1000 grams) are at high-risk of major and minor motor sequelae that persist into the school years. Most {{of the research on}} the outcome of these high-risk infants has concentrated on the prevalence of major disability. The majority of high-risk children at school age have normal intelligence and no sensorineural disability. Despite this, these &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children have a higher incidence of minor morbidities. Motor coordination problems are frequently reported, yet further investigation into the emergence of minor motor dysfunction, or its impact on academic achievement and everyday activities is seldom explored. The aim of this thesis was to provide a comprehensive investigation into motor dysfunction, which is commonly found in &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children. This was addressed in a series of five studies that intended to provide insight into the emergence, prevalence, nature, and prediction of motor dysfunction in otherwise &# 145;normal&# 146; high-risk children. Study 1 examined the development of gross and fine motor skills from infancy to school age using a longitudinal cohort study design. &# 145;Apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children (n= 58) were assessed with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales at 18 months corrected age, 3 and 5 years. A significant proportion continued to have fine motor deficits to school age (64 %), reflecting a persistent problem with fine motor skills throughout this period. The proportion of infants with gross motor deficits significantly increased from 18 months to 5 years (81. 1 %), particularly for the &# 145;micropreemies&# 146;. Whilst there was no gender difference found, the development of gross and fine motor skills appeared to be influenced differently by the home environment. Study 2 examined the impact of motor dysfunction on performance at school age. The prevalence of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) in &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children was determined using a controlled cohort study design. In addition, the nature of DCD in this population was explored by testing sensorimotor abilities that possibly underlie the motor dysfunction. Fifty (50) high-risk children with IQ< 85 and no identified sensorineural disability were assessed at 8 years of age along with a matched control from their respective class at school. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and a battery of sensorimotor tests were administered. Results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of DCD (42 %) in the high-risk group in comparison to the control group (8 %). In relation to sensorimotor abilities that may influence motor performance, the high-risk group scored significantly lower on most of tests, however it was neurological &# 145;soft signs&# 146;, postural praxis, and sequencing praxis that contributed to DCD in the high-risk group. Study 3 was designed to investigate the impact of motor dysfunction on a motor-based task performed within the school setting. Specifically, this study described handwriting skills in &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children, determined the prevalence of handwriting dysfunction, and investigated sensorimotor abilities that may be associated with problematic handwriting. The <b>high-risk</b> cohort and <b>matched</b> controls described in study 2 were also administered a number of handwriting tests. High-risk children were found to have poorer handwriting legibility and speed in comparison to their classmates. The prevalence of handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk group was 46 %, significantly higher than controls (18 %). Hand preference, pencil grasp used, and pain whilst writing were comparable to the control group. The contribution of underlying sensorimotor abilities to handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk population however was not evident. By using the same subjects in studies 2 and 3, the co-morbidity of handwriting dysfunction with DCD could be determined. Of those high-risk children identified with DCD, 43 % had co-morbid handwriting dysfunction. Study 4 explored the relationship between perinatal and environmental variables to Developmental Coordination Disorder and handwriting dysfunction in high-risk children. Perinatal and environmental variables of the 50 &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children that participated in the previous study were analysed. Results indicated prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were significantly and independently associated with DCD, perhaps reflecting the impact of the antenatal infection process and visual development related to ROP on motor outcome in high-risk children. Perinatal variables were not associated with handwriting dysfunction, but high-risk males {{were more likely to have}} handwriting dysfunction. Maternal education and paternal occupation were associated with aspects of handwriting. Whilst handwriting is a motor-based activity, it appears to be influenced by environmental variables, similar to other academic areas for the high-risk population. Study 5 sought to determine whether a motor assessment at an earlier age could predict DCD in the &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk population at school age. Motor assessment at 12 months, 3 and 5 years for the high-risk subjects who participated in study 2 were analysed using Receiver Operator Curves (ROC curves). The 3 year assessment with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales was the best predictor of DCD at 8 years, with the Griffiths Locomotor Scale at 3 years yielding a similar result. Findings suggest that high-risk children who scored below the specified cut-off points on 3 year motor assessments and who had a history of PROM or ROP were at greater risk of having motor-based problems that had the potential to interfere with functioning at school...|$|R
40|$|Housing is {{typically}} the greatest investment, {{and the most}} valuable asset, of any household. Overall, it dominates the household portfolios and is crucial in the accumulation of wealth over time. Since housing assets can serve as collateral, people are granted large mortgages, and thus even modest returns yield great wealth boosts due to the sheer magnitudes of the investments. Naturally, owning a home also produces housing benefits of great value to the owner-occupier. Everyone needs {{a place to live}} and owning a home secures a steady flow of dwelling services that would otherwise have had to be bought in the rental market. It is no surprise then that Norwegian households' asset portfolios are undiversified: using data from the Income Distribution Survey 2002 from Statistics Norway, we find that the average portfolio has a housing-to-wealth ratio of 1. 175, a stocks-to-wealth ratio of 0. 089, and a debt-to-wealth ratio of 0. 264. These figures mirror findings in similar surveys of other economies. Breaking the average holdings down to age cohorts shows that young households hold much more housing and debt relative to their wealth than older households. It is also evident that wealth accumulates a great deal over the life-cycle: when population average wealth is normalised to unity, the cohort relative wealth goes from 0. 074 for the youngest households, via 2. 233 for 55 - 66 year olds, and finally down to 1. 177 for households with head older than 80. The absence of equity holdings are further notable throughout the study: even the portfolios of the wealthiest quartile contain only 10 % stocks. Our key motivation is then the apparent question; is this behaviour optimal and can the allocations be rationalised by formal models? If not, what are then the theoretical recommendations? For our model experiments, the return on risk-free holdings (i. e., bank deposits, loans and bonds) is estimated by an average of Norwegian real bond rates over 1992 - 2006 less 28 % tax, and amounts to a rate of 0. 03 annually. Stock return is set to the price appreciation (less 28 % tax) plus the dividend rate on the Oslo stock exchange, less inflation, over the same time period. Housing return is similar as it also consists of a capital gain component and a dividend stream. While the former is easily observed by the house price index from Statistics Norway, the latter is not readily available due to lack of observations. However, with justification in rental data and in theory of the benefit to the owner-occupier, we settle on the before-tax, real risk-free rate as proxy for housing dividend. We further elect to follow advice from the literature on the riskiness of single-home housing investments, and set the standard deviation equal to 60 % of that in the stock market. The latter is found be 0. 2 annually for the 1992 - 2006 period. The reason for not simply using the risk exhibited by the house price index as our measure is that this aggregates market transactions and thus cannot capture the risk of buying a single house. We find mean rates of returns from housing and stocks of 0. 11 and 0. 188 respectively, with a correlation of 0. 33. Real prices on stocks and housing have appreciated tremendously since the early 1990 s. In fact, real prices were fairly stable [...] or even decreasing [...] over most of the 20 th century, before going through a boom-bust period in the mid-to-late eighties, and then literally taking off around 1993. Since then, real prices have grown by roughly 490 % and 260 % respectively, and the returns to equity- and house owners have clearly been enormous over these years. Our first attempt at explaining or rationalising the observed household behaviour mentioned above is the employment of a static mean-variance model of portfolio choice. We assume that the investor only cares about the expected return and variance of the portfolio and that the objective is to minimise this variance given a requirement on the expected return (this is of course equivalent to maximising expected return given some risk tolerance). There are two risky assets, housing and stocks, and one risk-free asset, simply called "risk-free. " The two-fund separation theorem ensures that any investor household will choose a combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio. While the latter is determined by the properties of the assets available to all investors, each investor will put a weight on the risky- and the risk-free portfolio according to his or her level of risk aversion. The solution to such a setup will then be a set of shares of housing, stocks and risk-free. With return estimates based on observed asset performances over 1992 - 2006 we find that the holdings of stocks and housing should be virtually equal in magnitude (the market portfolio composition of risky assets). The less risk averse the household is, the more stocks, housing and debt should it take on. More risk averse households on the other hand, should hold less of the risky assets and positive amounts of the risk-free asset (i. e., bank deposits or bond holdings). Since this result is very far from the observed holdings, we seek an alternative solution by using different return estimates. Reliable data on equity dividend and on house- and stock prices are available from 1966, so we collect asset properties for the 1966 - 1991 period and calculate a new set of estimates. The resulting portfolio model solution is uplifting: the framework now prescribes far less stocks relative to housing, which we know is closer to actual allocations. For example, with a risk aversion coefficient equal to 3 we find an "optimal" housing share of 1. 129, a share of stocks of 0. 484, and a residual risk-free share of - 0. 613. This is not very far from the observed, average household portfolio barring the weight on stocks (which is much lower in the data). Further, {{there seems to be a}} clear relationship between age and level of risk aversion. That is, for both sets of results, the <b>high-risk</b> aversion portfolios <b>match</b> the observed holdings of older households better, while the model portfolios with lower risk aversion coefficients are better fits with younger households' allocations. We have mentioned that younger households have the largest shares of housing in their overall portfolio, and that the share tends to decline with age. If we now, as an extension of the applied portfolio model, assume that the amount of housing is fixed and determined by the households' demand for housing service consumption, it may be interesting to find the optimal portfolios given the housing share of each cohort. That is, what are the optimal shares of stocks and risk-free when the household is already equipped with a certain expected return and risk from the housing holdings? Unfortunately, our analytical results make no sense in this case due to the absence of a credit constraint: the model prescribes outrageously high portfolio shares of stocks and debt. However, by imposing a limitation on how much the households are allowed to borrow ("no more than minus the housing holdings") in a simple numerical procedure in Excel, we obtain far more reasonable results. But, with the 1992 - 2006 estimates the model recommends an equity share (which is never higher than 0. 12 in the data) between 0. 75 and 1 for all cohorts and a debt share consistently greater than that in the data. When we instead assume that the 1966 - 1991 estimates hold, the match with data is almost perfect: low portfolio shares of stocks throughout and a share of risk-free virtually in sync with the Norwegian observations from 2002. It thus seems like people either disregard the tremendous returns of the nineties and early noughties as extraordinary and unsustainable, or that they enjoy even greater utility from housing than what we have accounted for in our efforts. In any event, the older return estimates are better able to explain the observed 2002 holdings than estimates based on asset returns seen in the years around the observation itself. Our second main exercise is the employment of a dynamic life-cycle model. This approach allows a far richer economic environment to be constructed for the household as we now can consider intertemporal investment-consumption choice and explicitly model the consequences of decisions. It is then assumed that the household receives utility from regular consumption and from housing consumption, and that the objective is, at all stages of life, to maximise the present value of the remaining lifetime utility. While there are still two risky assets and one risk-free asset, we are now adding a stream of labour income which is to be optimally allocated between investment/savings and immediate consumption. As the lifetime optimisation problem is virtually impossible to solve analytically, we resort to the well-known numerical method of value function iterations. This procedure basically entails approximating an unknown function (the present value of remaining lifetime utility [...] the value function) by identifying the values of the choice variables that yield the greatest lifetime utility at any point in time, and for all possible past investment decisions. Using this function we next find consumption- and investment rules that prescribe optimal actions given any previous set of allocations and asset returns, and thus solve the household's problem. It is further assumed that the representative household begins life at age 20, dies at age 80, and that every period in the model corresponds to five years. For computational tractability we abstract from income/human capital uncertainty and simply set the household's income equal to the (normalised) average Norwegian income in 2002 for every period/age. Since the solution is that of a representative household, we simulate the "lives" of 400 individual households, find the average allocations and interpret these as our solution. With the 1992 - 2006 asset return estimates we find that the household should invest quite heavily in housing from the get-go by taking on the maximum amount of debt (relative to the housing investment), while equity investment and regular consumption are chiefly postponed till age 35. From then on however, consumption levels grow tremendously and lie far above labour income throughout. While equity holdings also grow over the life-cycle and stabilise nicely between housing holdings and labour income, debts are responsibly paid down by the simulated households. Moreover, as the stock holdings accumulate and debts are abolished, housing stays fairly constant over time. A possible explanation is that households are using the capital gains from their housing asset to increase consumption, pay down the mortgage and invest in the stock market, rather than reinvesting it back into more housing. This makes perfectly good sense in our model, but may not be too reasonable in the real world. With the 1966 - 1991 asset return estimates we find mostly the same average profiles except for holdings of stocks and housing being consistently greater than with the 1992 - 2006 estimates. This sounds a bit curious since the former asset returns are lower than the latter: why would the households invest more now? One rationale is that the amounts invested in various assets must be higher when expected returns are lower in order for the household to attain a comfortable level of precautionary savings, and to be able to push up future consumption. On the other hand, lower returns on savings also means that future consumption is more expensive, thus households should save less and "eat" more. As our model output shows that regular consumption is pushed forward but attains lower overall levels over the life-cycle compared to the output with the 1992 - 2006 estimates, both above effects are recognised. In the final periods of these exercises, equity investments drop to zero since we assume that there is no value in leaving anything behind. But what if we instead say that the household draws utility, while alive, from bequeathing its end-of-life worth to a younger generation? Solving this modified problem we find, as expected, that the simulated households consume less and save more at the end of their lives. Such a specification is of course much closer to reality since it is commonly assumed that bequest motives exist, and because of the inherent uncertainty of the time of death (which we characteristically have abstracted from in our theoretical escapades). Finally, we compare the performance of the (bequest) model, with the two sets of estimates, to the observed Norwegian life-cycle holdings, surveyed in 2002. We find that the newer estimates allocations lie much closer to the actual holdings than those of the older estimates. This is immediately interesting because the static portfolio model produced the exact opposite conclusion: older estimates were able to better explain observed behaviour than newer ones. Even though predicted stock holdings are still wildly out of tune with observations, the dynamic model solved with the 1992 - 2006 estimates can explain the broad features of households' behaviour...|$|R
