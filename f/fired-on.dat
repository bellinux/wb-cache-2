50|$|The Automatic Gun-Laying Turret (AGLT) was a British radar-aimed FN121 turret {{fitted to}} some Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax bombers in 1944. The AGLT system was devised {{to allow a}} target to be tracked and <b>fired-on</b> in total darkness, the target's range being {{accurately}} computed as well as allowing for lead and bullet drop. The system was referred to by the codename Village Inn during development, and given the number TR3548.|$|E
50|$|Her second foray {{was split}} into two parts. During the second, longer portion, the boat sank the William Hopper, {{a former member of}} the notorious convoy PQ 17 on 4 July 1942. The ship had already been badly damaged in an air attack. In a scuttling attempt, she was <b>fired-on</b> by a British escort vessel, but stubbornly refused to sink. Later that same day, U-334 fired two 'coup de grâce' torpedoes at the ship; the first was defective, the second missed. The wreck was {{eventually}} sunk by fire from the boat's deck gun.|$|E
50|$|Excellent {{reference}} {{books on the}} subject are:Anchor Hocking's Fireking and More by Gene Florence. A Collector's Guide to Anchor Hocking's Fire King Glassware, by Garry and Dale Kilgo and Jerry and Gail Wilkins Fire-King solid glass colors come in rose-ite (creamy pink), turquoise blue, azur-ite (light pale blue), white, and ivory. It can also be a <b>fired-on</b> coating over crystal in shades of pastel green, pastel blue, pastel peach, pastel yellow, primary orange, primary blue, primary yellow and primary green. These fired on colors are part of the pattern Rainbow. Rainbow is not technically Fire-King, but included in the same category with most collector books. There is also a fired on Lustre color finish that comes in several patterns and a few colors, grey, white and the most popular Peach.|$|E
40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of some features of {{hybrid integrated circuits}} that make their use advantageous in miniature biotelemetry applications. The various techniques for fabricating resistors, capacitors and interconnections by both thin film and thick film technology are discussed. The use of chip capacitors, resistors, and especially standard IC chips on substrates with <b>fired-on</b> interconnection patterns is emphasized. The review is designed primarily to acquaint biotelemetry users and designers with an overview of this fabrication technique {{so that they can}} better communicate their needs with an understanding of its limitations and advantages to facilities specializing in hybrid construction...|$|E
40|$|High {{permittivity}} ceramics with ϵ_eff > 10 ^ 5 can {{be realized}} from semiconducting BaTiO_ 3 by the two-step processing namely, sintering the donor doped samples in static air followed by electroding with the <b>fired-on</b> silver/glass composites. Doping with Sb^ 5 ^+ and Bi^ 3 ^+ not only enhances the grain conductivity but also increases the grain size (10 – 60 μ m), when sintered at 1370 ^oC in static air. The ceramic samples are electroded with the paste containing nanometer particles of silver dispersed in varied amounts of low melting (600 - 900 ^oC) glass compositions PbO + Bi_ 2 O_ 3 + B_ 2 O_ 3 ± SiO_ 2 ± CuO. High permittivities are obtained for these capacitors stable over {{a wider range of}} temperature and over a broad frequency range. The grain boundary layer effect superimposed with the contributions from the barrier layers formed during electroding, related to ceramic microstructure is proposed to be responsible for the unusual high permittivity in semiconducting BaTiO_ 3. The energy dispersive X-ray analyses indicate selective melting reactions at the grain boundary layers with higher concentrations of the low melting oxides at the grain boundaries near to the electrodes. Impedance spectroscopy on BaTiO_ 3 ceramics demonstrates that they are electrically heterogeneous with insulating grain boundaries together with the ceramic/electrode interface acting as barrier layers. On the basis of the symmetrical Schottky-barrier model of the grain boundary region, the barrier height ϕ and donor concentration N_d of the grains were obtained by the modified 1 /C^ 2 -V plot. These modified boundary layer capacitors having high field strength withstandability {{can be used in a}} wide range of frequencies...|$|E
