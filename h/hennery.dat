In 1893, The New York Times reported that the 14th Duke of Veragua (a livestock farmer) and a large party visited the farm on the afternoon of June 16; at that time, the farm had about 330 cattle and 100 sheep. The party went from New York to Scarborough, proceeding by carriage to Briarcliff, and visited the farm's poultry yard, <b>hennery</b> and stables. After observing the farm's heifers and stallions, they went to the creamery to taste Briarcliff butter. The guests went to Law's Yonkers home, Hillcrest, for dinner before returning to New York.

5000|$|Henry [...] "Hennery" [...] Peck, {{popularly known}} as Peck's Bad Boy, is a fictional {{character}} created by George Wilbur Peck (1840-1916). First appearing in the 1883 novel Peck's Bad Boy and His Pa, the Bad Boy has appeared in numerous print, stage, and film adaptations. The character is portrayed as a mischievous prankster, and the phrase [...] "Peck's bad boy" [...] has entered the language to refer to anyone whose mischievous or bad behavior leads to annoyance or embarrassment. Described as [...] "a vicious little swaggerer" [...] and [...] "no more than a callous brute", <b>Hennery's</b> antics were more mean-spirited than those of earlier boyhood characters like Huckleberry Finn, and modern criticism views the violence and racism in the original stories as objectionable or politically incorrect.|$|R

To provide his Boston diners with the freshest and finest food {{products}} available, Whipple established his own 2,500-acre dairy farm in New Boston, New Hampshire. Valley View Farm was divided into Dairy, Piggery, and <b>Hennery</b> Departments, employing some ninety people. In order to make daily deliveries to Boston, Whipple helped build a railroad depot in New Boston and connected it to existing main lines with a spur track later leased to the Boston & Maine Railroad.|$|E

They were also known as <b>Hennery</b> and Kennery, respectively. On 15 September, 150 men under Mai Nayak sailed towards Khanderi. The Deputy Governor of Bombay, under British rule, asked Mai Nayak to leave the island alone, as it belonged to Bombay. However, the Maratha fleet paid no heed to the English demand. The English decided to invite {{the help of the}} fleet under Daulat Khan to oppose the Maratha fleet, if it tried to protect the fortifications. Both the English and the Siddhi fleets {{appeared}} there to prevent the takeover by the Marathas, and Shivaji stopped the fortification.|$|E
40|$|Zoonotic {{bacterial}} diseases are considered {{as the most}} important human infectious diseases. In this category, a disease that transfer and infect human through food has an special role. Among foods with animal origin, eggs due to their application as food ingredient in food products, like sauces, spices, ice creams and other food products that may use in half cooked or crude forms, always has the potential to transfer microbial pathogens to human. This study is about to prove that presence of remainder feces on eggshells leads the penetration of bacterial agents into egg yolk. A total of 120 daily egg samples (with and without fecal contamination) were collected from <b>henneries</b> around Tabriz and transferred immediately to microbiology laboratory. After performing microbial examinations (using BHI Broth, BHI Agar, Blood Agar, Selenite F, Tetrationate, XLD,SS Agar),Gram Staining, Oxidase and Catalase tests, bacteria of eggshells and egg yolks has been identified. Out of 120 eggs, 15. 83 % bacterial contaminants were found in egg yolks samples. Among them, 73. 68 %  were gram negative and 26. 31 % were gram positive. Among gram negatives, Pseudomonas with occurrence of 8. 3 % and in gram positives group, Bacillus with abundance of  4. 16 % were the most frequent bacterias. Also in samples collected from eggshells, 99. 16 % of the eggs demonstrated bacterial contamination which 23. 55 % of positive samples were among gram negative group and 76. 44 % were gram positive. The most contribution of eggshell gram negative bacterias were relevant to Pseudomonas, E. coli, Proteus and Citrobacter with respectively 18. 33 %, 10. 83 %, 5. 83 % and 4. 16 % rations. Among gram positive bacteria that isolates form eggshell samples for the most frequent bacterias, were Bacillus, Staphylococccus, Streptococcus, Rhodococcus and Micrococcus with respectively 80. 00 %, 34. 16 %, 15 %, 9. 16 % and 7. 5 % rations. Use and consumption of eggs with shells contaminated with faces in food products is a serious risk factor for human health and can lead to zoonotic {{bacterial diseases}} by transferring bacterial pathogens...|$|R
5000|$|By sluice („barrage”), {{usually the}} full sluice {{system as well}} as the sluice gates {{themselves}} were referred to in live speech. The couple-of-hundred-meter-long section of the river above the mills that can be swollen by (wooden) sluice gates is called the head race. The river banks right above the sluice gate were often protected by concrete walls from erosion. On this river section, the lowered sluice gate barred and „swelled” or „held” water behind it as one of the preparatory steps of grinding. By the way, the higher or lower position of the sluice before the turbine chamber and before the run-out to the mill-pond, one could control the volume of the water running through the turbine chamber to rotate the turbine. This latter ensured the energy necessary for milling. When grinding, the water was let out to flow onto the turbine encased in the turbine chamber protected by a lattice. From thereon, the water left the turbine chamber via its outlet into the mill pit. (Driftwood and other debris were cleared from the lattice by a rake.) Of course, in the meantime, the water level in the head race continuously decreased as the water was „let out” or „released”. Sluice gates could be raised or let down by specific iron structures. Directly above the sluice gate, practically annexed to it stood the sluice bridge that made it possible to get close to the sluice gates. One could also cross the river using this little bridge. There also used to be a larger bridge on the head race suited for the transportation of grains and flour, but it had usually been ruined by the 1950s and 1960s. During swelling, if the water level in the head race reached the upper edge of the lowered sluice gate, the water cascaded over it, and showered onto a concrete surface producing characteristic sounds, and then rushed into the wide and (3-to-8-meter) deep mill pit. The mill pit was used to be called mill pond in other locations. The expressions appearing in this paragraph aren’t uniformly used anyway. It is certain though that the anglers in Zalaegerszeg used these terms in the 1950s. At {{the lower end of the}} mill pit that narrowed again, usually a crescent-shaped gravel islet formed. The following outflow section was shallow, and continuously deepened again. The water often meandered along an extended tract, flowing ever slower, and getting ever deeper, to become the head race of the following mill. In some cases, the river was bifurcated above the mill by digging a new branch leading to the mill (and serving as its „head race” or „leat”). On the other branch („small branch) there was also a sluice called „small sluice”. (If I remember well, the related smaller „mill pond” was also called a small pond by the anglers in the past.) By the sluice, one could control the amount of water flowing towards the main branch of the river. The small pond located behind the small sluice flowed into the small branch to rejoin the main branch after about 100 to 200 meters. As far as I recall, small branches and small sluices could only be found in Zalaegerszeg or further downward on the river Zala (but not even there in all the cases: e.g. in the 50’s the Baumgartner mill in Zalaegerszeg didn’t feature a small sluice). In the riverbed hollows or incavations could form while in other tracts the water was shallow and running. During floods, everything got messed up: in the stead of the river Zala and its meadow, a spectacular, uninterrupted expanse of water appeared that a few days later receded. In several comments, we refer to piles sticking out from or standing in the water in the immediate vicinity of the mills. The corner of the mill closest to the water was often supported by such a pile. In other cases, the piles upheld a proper planking above the water. Standing on such a planking, one could do maintenance work on the sluice gates, e.g. defrost them. But similar piles may also be remains of old-time wooden bridges. The structure equipped with its own little roof and window often raised on top of the mill building is the ventage of the powder-house, but it could also be used to accommodate the protruding end of the elevator. One could often see a „rain panel” sticking out above the door of the building that protected the people and the sacs from the rain during loading. The by-products of grinding could be used to feed pigs and poultry. Therefore, apart from the stable housing the work-horses, there were often piggeries, <b>henneries</b> or even pigeonries in the vicinity of the mills.|$|R

Sloane, moved with his family to the area and began devoting his time to agriculture. He rapidly added to his holdings, buying about forty parcels in less than ten years; by 1900, Law owned more than 5000 acre of Westchester County and was its largest individual landholder. Some previous owners became tenant farmers; Law received half of the hay and straw from a 160 acre farm formerly owned by Jesse Bishop, and one-third of everything else. Law and Briarcliff Farms initially deepened the Pocantico River for 2 mi, taking out rifts so the stream would flow and adjacent swamps would drain. Workers also cut rock and took out trees lining the swamps to reclaim land for farming.|$|E

40|$|Concentration {{levels of}} six natural and {{anthropogenic}} origin steroid estrogens, namely, diethylstilbestrol (DES), estrone (E 1), estradiol (E 2), estriol (E 3), ethinylestradiol (EE 2), and estradiol- 17 -valerate (Ev), from different effluents in Beijing were assessed. Sampling sites include two {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs), a chemical plant, a hospital, a pharmaceutical factory, a <b>hennery,</b> and a fish pool. In general, concentrations of estrogens in the effluents varied from no detection (nd) to 11. 1 ng/l, 0. 7 to 1. 2 x 10 (3) ng/l, nd to 67. 4 ng/l, nd to 4. 1 x 10 (3) ng/l, nd to 1. 2 x 10 (3) ng/l, and nd to 11. 2 ng/l for DES, E 1, E 2, EE 2, E 3, and Ev, respectively. The concentration levels of steroid estrogens from different effluents decreased {{in the order of}} pharmaceutical factory and WWTP inlets > hospital > <b>hennery</b> > chemical factory > fish pool. This study indicated that natural estrogens E 1, E 2, and E 3 and synthetic estrogen EE 2 are the dominant steroid estrogens found in the different Beijing effluents. For source identification, an indicator (hE = E 3 /(E 1 + E 2 + E 3)) was used to trace human estrogen excretion. Accordingly, hE in effluents from the hospital and WWTP inlets exceeded 0. 4, while much smaller values were obtained for the other effluents. Human excretions were the major contributor of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater. Estimation results demonstrated that direct discharge was the major contributor of steroid estrogen pollution in receiving waters...|$|E
