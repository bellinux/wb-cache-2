5000|$|The <b>Humanoids</b> are {{spreading}} out from Wing IV to every human occupied planet to implement their Prime Directive. Sledge and Underhill attempt {{to stop the}} <b>humanoids</b> by aiming a rhodomagnetic beam at Wing IV but fail. The <b>humanoids</b> take Sledge away for surgery. He returns with no memory of his prior life, stating {{that he is now}} happy under the <b>humanoids</b> care. Underhill is driven home by the <b>humanoids,</b> sitting [...] "with folded hands," [...] as there is nothing left to do.|$|R
50|$|<b>Humanoids</b> are bipeds of Small or Medium size {{with few}} or no supernatural or {{extraordinary}} abilities. Most <b>humanoids</b> can speak, and usually have well-developed societies. Larger bipeds are giants (see above), and bipeds with more special abilities are fey, monstrous <b>humanoids</b> or outsiders. In 3.0 and 3.5 editions, the Player's Handbook races (humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, half-elves, half-orcs) are all <b>humanoids.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Monstrous <b>humanoids</b> are a [...] "creature type" [...] in the 3rd and 3.5 {{editions of}} the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy {{role-playing}} game. Monstrous <b>humanoids</b> are differentiated from <b>humanoids</b> by their monstrous or animalistic features, and not all are technically [...] "humanoid" [...] in body form. They also often have supernatural or extraordinary abilities.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{features}} six <b>humanoid</b> {{races for}} players {{to choose from}} when creating a character. Each race has two subdivisions and males and females of all races are available, unlike in the original release.|$|E

50|$|In January 2004, <b>Humanoids</b> {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with DC Comics aimed at integrating the <b>Humanoids</b> publications into the DC Comics catalog. This agreement enabled <b>Humanoids</b> to gain a greater visibility in the market, while DC Comics obtained the distribution rights for the English-language versions of <b>Humanoids</b> works. Certain works published since 1998 were reprinted, while new titles were also translated in English (El Niño, Victor Levallois, Megalex, Basil et Victoria, etc.). However, the books were expensive and success was limited, leading DC Comics to announce the end of the agreement in April 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The band will {{continue}} not playing live shows, however, due to <b>Humanoid's</b> illness, with Schizoid saying that [...] "We do {{not plan to}} play live, Jose's <b>Humanoid's</b> diagnosis doesn't allow it.".|$|R
5|$|Callisto– The {{mother of}} Kratos and Deimos. Kratos found his ailing {{mother in the}} city of Atlantis. As she {{attempted}} to reveal the identity of Kratos' father, she was punished by Zeus and transformed into a deformed <b>humanoid</b> beast, which Kratos was forced to kill. Before dying, Callisto advised Kratos to find Deimos. Her body was later buried next to Deimos by the Gravedigger. Deanna Hurstold voiced the elder Callisto while Jennifer Hale voiced the younger Callisto in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
5|$|Dragonlance {{is set on}} {{the world}} of Krynn. The {{majority}} of the novels {{take place in the}} various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common <b>humanoid</b> race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells. During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian <b>humanoid.</b> The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three <b>humanoid</b> races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the {{gigantic}} Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players {{to focus on the}} action and not to be burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E
50|$|Charting {{together}} with the original Catch Me, <b>Humanoids</b> had first week sales of nearly 12,000 according to the Gaon Chart, peaking at number one.

5|$|Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct bipedal <b>humanoid</b> race of reptilian {{creatures and}} loyally serves the series' {{recurring}} villain Shao Kahn in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has {{been featured in}} almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the 2011 reboot, {{he had yet to}} be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.|$|E
5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features <b>humanoid</b> creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels {{are composed of}} keratin, which has been suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person {{view and}} {{gameplay}} places {{a greater emphasis}} on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter were added to the game. More <b>humanoid</b> than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed to reflect James' subconscious. References to history, films and literature can also be found in the game.|$|E

5|$|The Ninth Doctor is an {{incarnation}} of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's revival in 2005. Within the programme's narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling, <b>humanoid</b> alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their <b>humanoid</b> form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E

40|$|The {{broad range}} of methods for virtual <b>humanoids</b> and their {{evaluation}} as avatars in virtual environments is handled in this thesis. The enabling methods, as well as experimental evaluations are the main contributions of the thesis. The central conclusion of the work {{can be summed up}} as the fact that virtual <b>humanoids</b> are beneficial for a number of interaction scenarios typically found in virtual environments. The thesis presents the technology required for an interactive simulation of virtual <b>humanoids</b> in virtual environments. It presents the VRZula toolkit and its main features, mainly a layered data structure derived from functional anatomy, separation of data and simulation algorithms, and the control and propagation of modifications to the data. This elementary approach leads to an extendible and flexible system for virtual <b>humanoids.</b> The toolkit is capable of simulating even sophisticated models of virtual <b>humanoids</b> in complex distributed virtual environments. It integrates a variety of current approaches to the representation of virtual <b>humanoids,</b> as well as methods for kinematic and physiology simulation. Substantial improvements and novel approaches are introduced in the areas of deformation of musculature, multimodal representation and synchronization, construction of motion graphs, and synchronous body tracking. Within the scope of this work, the VRZula toolkit is used for the evaluation of several hypotheses regarding the application of virtual <b>humanoids</b> in virtual environments. The two studies presented contribute {{to the understanding of the}} influence of virtual <b>humanoids</b> on the sensation of presence. It has been shown that avatars equipped with synchronous kinematics affect the real motion of the user and optimize the kinematics in the virtual world. Even though the mental and attentional resources bound to the exocentric virtual body representation led to a decrease of presence scores in room-mounted virtual environments, a strong identification of the user with the avatar has been shown. In addition, correlations between presence scores and physiological, as well as performance measures have been found. The results of the two studies are the basis of the evaluation of virtual <b>humanoids</b> used as avatars in typical interaction scenarios of virtual environments, and identify beneficial areas of application in certain navigation tasks and most manipulation scenarios. The use of avatars equipped with synchronous kinematics is clearly recommended. The VRZula toolkit developed within this work and the experimental evaluations have contributed to the prevailing knowledge on virtual <b>humanoids</b> and their application in virtual environments. The thesis demonstrates that virtual <b>humanoids</b> are the central methodology in future interaction techniques of sophisticated virtual environments...|$|R
