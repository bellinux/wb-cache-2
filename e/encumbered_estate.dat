It was headed [...] "Another missing heir," [...] and ran: [...] "We are getting used to having our railroad-shovelling and trail-cutting done by scions of the British aristocracy, and seldom ask them {{what they did in}} the old country so long as they behave {{themselves}} decently in this one. Twice recently, as mentioned in these columns, the successor to an English property of some value was discovered, in the one case peddling oranges, and in the other digging a rancher's ditches, while now we have another instance in the Somasco valley. It appears that long ago there was a family quarrel at Carnaby, England, and though {{we do not know what}} it was all about, the owner of what we understand is an <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate</b> turned out his son, who had the good sense to come out to this country, where he did pretty well. He died and left a son, Mr. Henry Alton, well known in the Somasco district, who appears to be a credit to the country which took his father in. The owner of Carnaby dying later, left the ancestral property to him, and, as in this case there does not seem to be a wicked uncle, Mr. Deringham, the next of kin and a distinguished London financier who has, we believe, had some dealings in local mines, has come out to look for him. Mr. Alton of Somasco will probably stop right where he is if he is the sensible man his neighbours seem to think him." ...|$|E
60|$|If mere parsimony {{could have}} made a man rich, Sir Pitt Crawley might have become very wealthy--if he had been an {{attorney}} in a country town, with no capital but his brains, it is very possible that he would have turned them to good account, and might have achieved for himself a very considerable influence and competency. But he was unluckily endowed with a good name and a large though <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate,</b> both of which went rather to injure than to advance him. He had a taste for law, which cost him many thousands yearly; and being a great deal too clever to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his affairs to be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all equally mistrusted. He was such a sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants; and such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the ground, whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she granted to more liberal husbandmen. He speculated in every possible way; he worked mines; bought canal-shares; horsed coaches; took government contracts, and was the busiest man and magistrate of his county. As he would not pay honest agents at his granite quarry, he had the satisfaction of finding that four overseers ran away, and took fortunes with them to America. For want of proper precautions, his coal-mines filled with water: the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon his hands: and for his coach-horses, every mail proprietor in the kingdom knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country, from underfeeding and buying cheap. In disposition he was sociable, and far from being proud; nay, he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a horse-dealer to that of a gentleman, like my lord, his son: he was fond of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was never known to give away a shilling or to do a good action, but was of a pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his glass with a tenant and sell him up the next day; or have his laugh with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour. His politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca Sharp--in a word, the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England, did not contain a more cunning, mean, selfish, foolish, disreputable old man. That blood-red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in anybody's pocket except his own; and it is with grief and pain, that, as admirers of the British aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is in Debrett.|$|E
50|$|Topcliffe died in November or December 1604 {{at the age}} {{of about}} 73. His heir, Charles, succeeded to a heavily <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate.</b> Like Walsingham, Topcliffe impoverished himself by his service to the crown.|$|E
5000|$|William was {{the eldest}} son of George Bowes of Streatlam and Dorothy Mallory and succeeded to his father's <b>encumbered</b> <b>estates</b> in 1580. He was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland in 1593 ...|$|R
5000|$|Praed married Lucy Basset, {{daughter}} of John Basset of Tehidy, Illogan, Cornwall {{shortly before his}} death. He left all his personal property {{to his wife and}} his <b>encumbered</b> <b>estates</b> to his brother John.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was offered}} for sale at the <b>encumbered</b> <b>estates</b> court on 3 June 1853 and was bought by a Dr. Fitzgibbon for £1,350. In 1870 {{it was in the}} hands of Mrs Eliza Fitzgibbon.|$|R
50|$|On {{the death}} of her father, she {{inherited}} a heavily <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate</b> of 200000 acre. In the following two years her remaining fortune was destroyed in the potato famine as she attempted to alleviate its effects on her tenants. Penniless, she emigrated with her husband to Belgium where she contributed to a number of periodicals, notably Encyclopaedie Des Gens Du Monde.|$|E
50|$|Carbery succeeded {{his father}} in his (Irish) barony in 1783 and {{inherited}} a heavily <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate.</b> On 18 February 1793, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire. After the Earl of Westmorland raised a Northamptonshire volunteer cavalry regiment in 1797, Carbery was appointed its lieutenant-colonel on 20 April 1797. He {{was elected to the}} House of Commons for Rutland in 1802, a seat he held until his early death two years later.|$|E
50|$|Lord Carbery married Susan, {{the natural}} {{daughter}} and heiress of Colonel Henry Watson, in 1792. Watson {{had left her}} the fortune he made as chief engineer for the East India Company. Her wealth offered the possibility of repairing his <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate,</b> {{but he had to}} agree to a marriage settlement granting her a jointure of £2,000 per year; she was not only to keep her own fortune but to receive his English estates if he died without issue by her.|$|E
50|$|Lygon married Elizabeth Harwell, {{daughter}} of Edward Harwell of Besford, in around 1590 and had three sons and two daughters. His son William, who inherited the <b>encumbered</b> <b>estates,</b> {{had to sell}} off more of them.|$|R
50|$|He {{served for}} twenty-eight {{years in the}} Bombay Presidency, mainly in the Sind Division. Over his career he was an {{educational}} inspector, manager of <b>encumbered</b> <b>estates,</b> district magistrate, judge of the Karachi District and acting Judicial Commissioner. He {{was viewed as a}} progressive administrator, joining the British Committee of the Indian National Congress and supporting the Morley-Minto Reforms.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} a judge at Madras in 1835 but resigned that office {{in order to}} become Solicitor-General for Ireland in the same year, and he became Attorney-General for Ireland the following year. He {{was appointed}} a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1837 and held that office until 1859; he also served as a judge of the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Court.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Moore, 4th Earl of Drogheda (7 October 1700 - 29 May 1727), styled Viscount Moore from 21 May to 7 June 1714, was an Irish {{peer and}} rake who briefly {{served in the}} Parliament of Great Britain. He {{inherited}} his title and estates {{at the age of}} 13, when his father and grandfather died in quick succession. Drogheda rapidly became a debauchee, and after squandering large sums, {{died at the age of}} 26, leaving his younger brother a heavily <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, the estate passed to a descendent of the Marquis de Fortia, Paul-Antoine de Fortia, who further {{expanded}} the vineyard plantings and buildings on the estate. By 1815 there were outside records of a castle La Fortiasse on the estate. In 1843, the Count de Ripert Monclar wrote favorably of the estate and described the hermitage that was among the vineyards. That same year, Paul-Antoine died and the estate passed to his heir Louis de Séguins-Pazzis, comte du Pazzi, who held the financially <b>encumbered</b> <b>estate</b> for {{only a short time}} before selling it to a local tax collector, M. de Orollée Virville. The estate continued to pass from owner to owner {{for the rest of the}} nineteenth century, being owned at one point by the French branch of the Gondi family, until it was purchased by Bernard Le Saint in 1890. Le Saint was a former director who maintained the official journal of the Egyptian government. He further expanded the estate and gave it its current name, Château Fortia. In 1919, his daughter Edmée married a decorated World War I pilot, Baron Pierre Le Roy de Boiseaumarié.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} programme mustn't {{have been}} as rewarding as Denis Kelly expected, for in 1863 we find the entire Kelly estate being offered for sale by the courts, under the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act. Denis retired to Araghty Grange, a small estate he owned near Athleague. He died in 1877 and is buried in the old Church in Killeroran. The Kelly estate, 12000 acre complete with Castle and town, was bought by Christopher Neville Bagott for £105,000.|$|R
5000|$|The {{political}} {{background to}} the movement was the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act and the resultant change in land ownership at landlord level. In the North of Ireland, Protestant and Presbyterian ministers feared that the new landlords would destroy the [...] "Ulster custom" [...] of tenancy, which compensated tenants for any improvement undertaken. Concurrently, in the South of Ireland politically minded young Catholic priests were agitating for the adoption there of the Ulster custom {{as a measure of}} reform.|$|R
50|$|Coulson {{was long}} the {{parliamentary}} draughtsman or {{counsel for the}} home department. The act {{for the sale of}} <b>encumbered</b> <b>estates</b> in Ireland was draughted by him and Lord Romilly. When the major change in the administration of Indian affairs occurred, the duty of collecting information on its laws and of drawing up a legal code was offered to Coulson; but he turned it down. He acted as a Commissioner on the Royal Commission that led to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.|$|R
5000|$|Trollope, in his autobiography, {{said the}} {{following}} concerning The Macdermots of Ballycloran:"As to the plot itself, I {{do not know}} that I ever made one so good,- or, at any rate, one so susceptible of pathos. I am aware that I broke down in the telling, not having yet studied the art. Nevertheless, The Macdermots is a good novel, and worth reading by anyone who wishes to understand what Irish life was before the potato disease, the famine, and the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Bill." ...|$|R
5000|$|Abbeville was {{the seat}} of the Hemsworth family from the early 18th century until c1890, when Thomas Gerard Hemsworth sold up and emigrated to Canada. Some land was sold to the Dawson family through the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Court c1850, but the Hemsworths still had 387 acre in c.1870. The Killeens bought the entire estate from the Hemsworths in about c.1900, and ever since, the house is still {{currently}} owned by the Killeen family. The park retains the remains of a canal to the north.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of the Irish famine of 1845-6 Hodgkin {{assisted}} {{in the work of the}} relief committees established by Quakers in Dublin and London. He struggled long, but in the end unsuccessfully, to introduce improved methods of fishing among the seafaring population of the Claddagh near Galway. He also had a large share in the preparation of the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act (1849), a measure which, as he hoped, would remove some of the economic troubles under which Ireland was labouring. The position of one of the judges of the court founded by this act was offered to him by Lord John Russell, but he declined it.|$|R
25|$|Irish {{people at}} home were facing {{discrimination}} from Great Britain based on the former's religion. Evictions only increased after {{the repeal of the}} British Corn Laws in 1846 and the new <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act being passed in 1849 as well as the removal of existing civil rights. There had been agrarian terrorism against landlords which these new laws were implemented to stop the retribution. Any hope for change was squashed with the death of Daniel O'Connell in 1847, the political leader championing for Ireland, and the failed rising of the Young Irelanders in 1848. More was to be gained by immigrating to America from Ireland and the 1848 discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada lured away more.|$|R
50|$|After {{the wars}} of the 1680s, the castle was granted to the Wellesley family who held it until Arthur Wellesley (the Duke of Wellington), sold it to the Leslies. In {{following}} years it passed via the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Court {{into the hands of}} the Dunsany Plunketts. They left the lands open and from time to time allowed various uses, with part of the Castle Field rented for some years by the Town Council as a municipal dump, and a small meeting hall for the Royal British Legion erected. The Dunsanys held the Castle and surrounds until 1993, when after years of discussion, Lord Dunsany sold the land and buildings to the State, retaining only river access and fishing rights.|$|R
50|$|In Clonbrock sat the Dillon family. Lord Clonbrock {{was listed}} as a {{resident}} proprietor in county Galway in 1824. At the time of Griffith's Valuation, Lord Clonbrock {{was one of the}} principal lessors in the parishes of Ahascragh, Fohanagh, Killalaghtan and Killosolan in the barony of Kilconnell and Killoran in the barony of Longford. In the 1870s the Clonbrock estate in county Galway amounted to over 110 km2 (28,000 acres). Lands, house and demesne at Cahir, barony of Clonmacnowen, owned by James Dillon, were offered for sale in the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> court in July 1854. In 1906 Lord Clonbrock held over 8.1 km2 (2,000 acres) of untenanted land and the mansion house at Clonbrock.|$|R

5000|$|The festering {{sense of}} native {{grievance}} was magnified by the Great Irish Famine of 1845-52, {{with many of}} the Ascendancy reviled as absentee landlords whose agents were shipping locally produced food overseas, while much of the population starved. Ireland remained a net exporter of food throughout most of the famine. About 20% of the population emigrated. The <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act of 1849 was passed to allow landlords to sell mortgaged land, where a sale would be restricted because the land was [...] "entailed". Many landlords (10%) went bankrupt as their tenants could not pay any rent due to the famine. One example was the Browne family which lost over 50000 acre in County Mayo.|$|R
50|$|The {{second son}} of Henry Long (1564-1612) and Rebecca Bailey, Long was educated at Lincoln's Inn. He had {{inherited}} no land at his father's death, {{but when his}} elder brother Henry died soon after, he inherited the extensive but heavily <b>encumbered</b> family <b>estates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Samuel's son, Peter, was {{the sixth}} and last of the Ashfield Gales. Peter Gale {{received}} both bachelor and masters degrees from Trinity College. Well educated, Peter authored a book concerning certain social conditions in Ireland. [...] On 20 June 1837, Peter married Anna Maria Harriett Lynch. [...] In addition to the estate at Ashfield, Peter owned {{a house in the}} City of Carlow, about five miles from Ashfield. In accordance with the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act of 1849, Peter was forced to sell all of his real property on 11 November 1851, to cover debts which he attributed to the economic devastation caused by the potato famine. Peter Gale died on 28 October 1857, and is buried in Monkstown Parish, County Cork.|$|R
50|$|After being knighted in 1882, Sir John was {{appointed}} to the old West India Colonies, now united into the Leeward Islands, as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands. While there, he contributed most materially to overthrow the custom of consignee's lien, which favoured the London merchant at the expense of local creditors; and also the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Court, which made West Indian properties change hands in London without giving people in the locality a chance to bid. Sir John drafted with great labour an ordinance to introduce Indefeasible Titles, and to give security for local advances. This ordinance ultimately became law, and Sir John received a unanimous vote of thanks from the Leeward Islands Legislature. Appointed Chief Justice of Trinidad in 1885 he was asked to remain in the Leeward Islands until 1886.|$|R
50|$|MacLeod of MacLeod {{attempted}} many costly improvements at Dunvegan Castle, {{as well as}} unsuccessful {{ventures in}} farming; and greatly <b>encumbered</b> the clan <b>estates</b> and thus ruined himself.|$|R
25|$|At his death, Jefferson {{was greatly}} in debt, {{in part due}} to his {{continued}} construction program. The debts <b>encumbered</b> his <b>estate,</b> and his family sold 130 slaves, virtually all the members of every slave family, from Monticello to pay his creditors. Slave families who had been well established and stable for decades were sometimes split up. Most of the sold slaves either remained in Virginia or were relocated to Ohio.|$|R
40|$|In the nineteenth-century, landlords {{occupied}} {{the top of}} the social hierarchy in Ireland. Historians have proposed two major interpretations of their role. Some historians view them as being responsible for Ireland’s economic backwardness since they did not improve their estates. Other historians hold a sympathetic attitude towards them and attempt to focus their study on the difficulties experienced by the land owning class. The main objective {{of this article is to}} examine the degree of the landlords’ involvement in local affairs in the 1840 s. It could be understood as a contribution to the post-revisionist historiography that departs from the polarisation of Irish history writing. It attempts to examine the way in which the Rate-in-Aid was implemented in order to make the provision of aid to the needy in Ireland a completely local charge. It also examines the implementation of the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act which stipulated the sale of the insolvent landlords’ properties. Accordingly, it seeks to show that mid-nineteenth century Irish landlords were the scapegoats of the British politicians’ ideological agendas...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history of}} the O’Donel estate in West Mayo, from the purchase of the estate by Sir Neal O’Donel {{in the late eighteenth century}} to the sale of most of the estate, in the 1850 s in the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Court, by his grandson Sir Richard Annesley O’Donel. The estate was purchased from John Thomas Medlicott and Thomas John Medlicott for £ 33, 589 19 s 4 d, which was equal to nineteen years and a half purchase of the rental income minus the head rent amounting to £ 1722 11 s 3 d per year. 1 The O’Donels owned land in three baronies of Mayo, the Tarmon estate in the barony of Erris, the Cong estate in the barony of Kilmaine and the Newport estate in the barony of Burrishoole. Included in the sale of lands by the Medlicotts was also land in Counties Tipperary, Kilkenny and Waterford but this was probably disposed of almost immediately as the only reference to it in the O’Donel papers is in the deed of sale of 17 July 1774...|$|R
25|$|The Wilson family {{claimed to}} have arrived in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, with William of Orange in 1690, but may well {{have lived in the}} area prior to that. They prospered in the Belfast {{shipping}} business in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century and following the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act of 1849 became landowners in counties Dublin, Westmeath and Longford. Wilson’s father James, the youngest of four sons, inherited Currygrane in Ballinalee, County Longford (1,200 acres, worth £835 in 1878), making him a middle-ranking landowner, more than a large farmer but not a “Big House” Ascendancy landlord; by 1901 the Currygrane estate had 49 Catholic and 13 Protestant (10 of them the Wilson family) inhabitants. James Wilson served as a High sheriff, a Justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Longford, there being no elected local government in Ireland until 1898, and he and his oldest son Jemmy attended Trinity College, Dublin. There is no record of Land League activity on the estate, and as late as the 1960s the IRA leader Sean MacEoin remembered the Wilsons as having been fair landlords and employers. The Wilsons also owned Frascati, an eighteenth century house at Blackrock, near Dublin.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the famine}} in Ireland and {{the passing of}} the <b>Encumbered</b> <b>Estates</b> Act in 1849, a court of three commissioners, of which Hargreave was one, was {{appointed}} to sit in Dublin to receive applications for the sale of the estates. Hargreave received a salary of £2,000 a year. In August 1849 he took up his residence in Dublin, where for nine years he was occupied with official duties. The amount of work accomplished by the court during this period was large, with important part being reading in private of titles, statements, petitions, and affidavits. The applications being made ex parte, the rights of absent persons, infants and others, had to be protected by the commissioners themselves. The number of petitions filed from October 1849 to 31 August 1857 was 4,413. The lands sold on these petitions were conveyed to the purchasers by means of upwards of eight thousand deeds of conveyance. The gross amount produced by sales of estates was £25,190,389. Hargreave, in reply to a question put by a parliamentary committee, stated that [...] "no mistake of consequence was ever made by the court".|$|R
50|$|In 1837, he sold Witley Court and {{the heavily}} <b>encumbered</b> Great Witley <b>estate</b> to {{trustees}} of William, Lord Ward for £890,000. No longer {{having to pay}} interest on the debts charged on that estate, he was left considerably better off, {{as a result of}} the sale.|$|R
