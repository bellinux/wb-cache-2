500|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari [...] "to {{determine}} whether an Indian tribe may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> {{cause of action}} for a violation of its possessory rights that occurred 175 years ago," [...] ultimately agreeing with the District Court and Second Circuit that the tribe may. On appeal, the counties did not dispute the District Court's findings that the Oneida held aboriginal title to the lands in question, and that the 1795 conveyances of the lands to the state violated the Nonintercourse Act. The counties instead argued that the Nonintercourse Act preempted the Oneida's cause of action, that any cause of action was time barred, nonjusticable, and abated, and that any conveyance was ratified by the federal government.|$|E
500|$|International {{music was}} chosen as the primary music style of Strange Days due to its variety of sounds and instruments. According to music {{supervisor}} Randy Gerston, who previously worked on True Lies, this type of music helped the film-makers create a futuristic atmosphere, noting that [...] "the world is shrinking and people are getting acclimated to strange languages being part of the pop vernacular." [...] Musicians featured on the soundtrack also included French duo Deep Forest, British trip hop artist Tricky, and British alternative rock band Skunk Anansie. The latter was encouraged to jam between takes at the film's New Year event so that Bigelow could record them live and give the rave a greater authenticity. Although the band would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> sound on the film, they ultimately had to lip-sync. A soundtrack album was released shortly before the film's opening. In addition, 60,000 promotional CD-ROMs, which contained production material from the film and music clips from the soundtrack, was made available only through the [...] "College Special" [...] issue of Rolling Stone magazine that was sold at record stores.|$|E

2500|$|The Stars, {{along with}} the Buffalo Sabres, are {{one of only two}} NHL teams to {{simulcast}} the entirety of their games on TV and radio, which the team has done since their 1993 arrival in Dallas. The original broadcast team from 1993–1996 was (play by play) Mike Fornes and (color) Ralph Strangis. [...] Fornes left the broadcast team after the 1995–96 season; Strangis moved to the play-by-play role and color commentator Daryl [...] "Razor" [...] Reaugh was added. Although both the DFW-area's large media market and the team's fan base could theoretically support separate television and radio broadcast teams, the Stars have continued simulcasting due to the popularity of [...] "Ralph and Razor" [...] (as they are known) among local listeners and viewers. Like other NHL teams, the Stars now <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> radio broadcast transmitted inside American Airlines Center on 97.5 FM. This is done because AM radio signals often cannot penetrate concrete and steel building exteriors.|$|E
2500|$|LSU Athletics is {{represented}} by its mascot, a live Bengal tiger named Mike the Tiger. LSU {{is only one of}} two institutions of higher education in the United States to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> tiger as their mascot; the other is the University of Memphis. The tiger was named after Mike Chambers, LSU's athletic trainer in 1936, and was bought for $750 from the Little Rock Arkansas Zoo. Mike V reigned from 1990–2007 and remained housed in his on-campus habitat until his death due to kidney failure on May 18, 2007 at age 17.

2500|$|Yamaguchi {{attempted}} {{to keep working}} on the song after submitting it for the commercial, but suffered from writer's block, and instead worked on the songs [...] "Eureka" [...] and [...] "Good-Bye". The song was revisited when the band was contacted to write a song for the film Close Range Love (2014), called [...] "Hasu no Hana". The band discussed releasing [...] "Hasu no Hana" [...] and [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] as a single with their management at Victor Entertainment, who agreed to the idea. The song was entirely rearranged and re-recorded for its 2014 release, based around only the initial version's chorus, with the original verses removed in favor of new ones. Instead of the synth sounds present in the band's other music and the commercial version of the song, Yamaguchi wanted [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> rock band sound. Yamaguchi felt that by recording the song in this manner, it had lost its summer music festival-like vibe. During the recording process, Yamaguchi incorporated a wide dynamic range, having felt influenced by listening to jazz and neo soul musicians Robert Glasper and Taylor McFerrin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{intent of}} OBD-I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable {{emission control systems}} that remain effective for the vehicle's [...] "useful life". The Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) of OBD-I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive 'scan tool'. Each manufacturer used their own diagnostic link connector (DLC), DLC location, DTC definitions, and procedure to read the DTCs from the vehicle. DTCs from OBD-I cars are often read through the blinking patterns of the 'Check Engine Light' (CEL) or 'Service Engine Soon' (SES) light. By connecting certain pins of the diagnostic connector, the 'Check Engine' light will blink out a two-digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition. The DTCs of some OBD-I cars are interpreted in different ways, however. Cadillac (gasoline) fuel-injected vehicles are equipped with actual on-board diagnostics, providing trouble codes, actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display. Holding down 'Off' and 'Warmer' for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode {{without the need for}} an external scan tool. Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC. General Motors, some 1989–1995 Ford vehicles (DCL), and some 1989–1995 Toyota/Lexus vehicles <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> sensor data stream available, however, many other OBD-I equipped vehicles do not. OBD-I vehicles have fewer DTCs available than for OBD-II equipped vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Though plagued {{since its}} {{inception}} by low overall Nielsen ratings, Passions was historically top-rated in key demographics, namely the female 12–17 demographic; Passions and Days of Our Lives usually occupied the top two positions among all soaps in this age group. The series was not renewed by NBC for a full ninth season in 2007, with NBC instead deciding to extend its morning news and talk show Today to a fourth hour. NBC began shopping the series to other networks. In April 2007, Satellite provider DirecTV bought exclusive broadcasting rights from NBC to continue airing Passions, with most principal cast members staying on. As the series {{was coming to an}} end on NBC, the Passions Live talk show hosted by Eric Martsolf premiered in August 2007 every Thursday night on original-programming channel The 101, giving fans the chance to telephone the show and interact live with Passions cast members, making Passions the first and only soap opera to ever <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> talk show in U.S. history. Passions Live continued to air on Thursday nights after the series moved to DirecTV, until October 2007. The live show was also streaming live on the official Passions website at NBC.com. Passions ended its NBC run on September 7, 2007, and new episodes began airing on The 101 on September 17, 2007, making Passions both the first soap opera broadcast on a direct broadcast satellite service and the first series to make such a transition from broadcast television. The series ran Monday to Thursday at 2:00 pm ET/11 am PT on DirecTV, with repeats airing later in the day and on weekends. NBC.com continued to maintain Passions official website after the move to DirecTV. Initially, new episodes were only available on DirecTV and not at NBC.com or for purchase at iTunes. On September 27, 2007, DirecTV announced they would provide an [...] "All Access Pass to Passions" [...] to view all new episodes at NBC.com for a monthly fee. This service began on October 1, 2007 for $19.99 a month then reduced to $14.99 a month when Passions schedule was cut from four episodes a week to three episodes a week. After the series moved to DirecTV, the subscription service added a special feature where a trivia question relating to Passions would pop up, on each episode airing on The 101, for viewers to use their remote control to answer. Passions was the first soap opera to ever have this type of feature.|$|E
