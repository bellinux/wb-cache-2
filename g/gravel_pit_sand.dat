50|$|Hatherton was a {{very wealthy}} man, partly because of his {{inherited}} interests, {{and partly because of}} his own business activities. The Littleton inheritance brought almost the whole of the manor of Penkridge, as well as the former Penkridge deanery manor, and other estates in that area - land accruing {{in the hands of the}} Littletons since 1502. The Walhouse inheritance brought large coal mines in Cannock and Walsall, as well as extractive works supplying the construction industry, including sandstone and limestone quarries, brickyards, <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> and <b>sand</b> <b>pits.</b> This made him immensely influential as a landlord and employer across a large tract of south and central Staffordshire.|$|R

40|$|Severely {{disturbed}} habitats such {{as military}} training grounds, <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> and <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> {{contribute to the}} species diversity of the agricultural landscape in Europe. They host a number of red-listed species not found elsewhere, illustrating that many plant species are threatened by extinction due to too little soil disturbance. Implementing a suitable disturbance regime is therefore crucial to ensure species-rich environments. We have reviewed the literature on soil disturbance as a restoration measure in dry sandy grasslands, with a special focus on xeric sand calcareous grasslands as these are severely threatened. Our objective was to elucidate the relations between diversity and disturbance regimes, and to determine how disturbance {{can be used to}} counteract acidification, to reduce nutrient availability and to create gaps in the vegetation. Our findings indicate that the current disturbance regime should be based on the historical disturbance regime, the productivity of the habitat and the propagule supply, in order to promote diversity at a landscape scale. Based on earlier studies and on the diversity/disturbance theory, we propose a conceptual model {{that can be used to}} determine the appropriate soil disturbance regime for restoration purposes. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering soil productivity, soil chemistry and dispersal limitations when choosing restoration measures and disturbance regimes for the conservation of biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{vegetation}} and overburden changes the naturalwater purifying processes and thus decreases the groundwaterprotection in <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> areas. The <b>sand</b> and gravel depositsusedfor aggregate extraction in Sweden are also often valuablefor extraction of groundwater as a drinking water resource. TheSwedish legislation requires that <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> be restored afterthe cessation of extraction, the aim being to reestablishvegetation and to reinstate groundwater purifyingprocesses. The {{objective of this}} study was to improve our understandingof the processes governing groundwater protection andvegetation establishment so that these could be applied toimproving restoration methods for reestablishing naturalgroundwater protection. The focus was on the importance of soilphysical properties of the topsoil for vegetation establishmentand groundwater recharge. Actual field methods for restoration were reviewed. Conflicts between aggregate extraction and groundwaterinterests were common. In many cases the actual restorationcarried out differed from pre-planned specifications in permitdocumentation. Commonly available substrates that might be used forrestoration of <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> were investigated. The soils weredescribed as regards texture, organic content, porosity, waterretention and hydraulic conductivity. The way in which acombination of the water retention characteristic and theunsaturated conductivity influenced the behaviour of thesoil-plant-atmosphere system was demonstrated using aprocess-orientated simulation model.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Open-cut {{excavations}} {{formed as}} a result of exploitation of mineral deposits are the least studied ecological sites. Habitat het-erogenity is reflected by remarkable floristic and phytocoenotic diversity. Being isolated by the sur-rounding vegetation of contrasting types – they can be considered as “habitat islands”. Twenty excavations (area from 100 m 2 to 2 ha) were selected – 10 located in cropland, 10 – in coniferous forest. The intensiveness of <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> exploitation was differentiated. Some of them were exploited, other ones were abandoned 10 – 30 years ago. The floristic records were taken during summer period in each pit and in near-by vegeta-tion at the distance not larger than 200 m. As much as 280 species of vascular plants were found in 10 selected <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> surrounded by coniferous forest communities, which con-tained only 111 taxa. The flora of mid-field exca-vations was definitely richer that the flora of their surroundings. Sörensen’s similarity index (So) for mid-forest <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> and their surroundings ranged between 27 % and 40 % while that for mid-field <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> and their neighbourhood – from 15 % to over 27 %. The U Mann-Whitney test demonstrated that the number of species noted in selected <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> significantly differed from that in the surrounding. It was true for both (mid-forest Z = 3. 70; P = 0. 00021) and mid-field <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> (Z = 3. 78; P = 0. 00016). Native species were dominating in the flora of both mid-field and mid-forest excavations (77 % and 82 % respectively). Hemicryptophytes were found to dominate (46 %) over other groups of life forms in both types of <b>gravel</b> <b>pits.</b> A high contribution of terophytes – over 19 % in mid-for-est excavations and over 25 % in mid-field ones is noteworthy. The results showed that <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> could play a role of enclaves for natural and semi-natural vegetation thus acting as local centres of floristic diversity in human modified monotonous agri-cultural or monospecies pine forest landscape.
