5000|$|The Odrysian kingdom (Ancient Greek, [...] "Βασιλεία Όδρυσων") was a {{union of}} Thracian tribes that endured between the 5th century BC and the 3rd century BC. The Odrysian state was the first Thracian kingdom that {{acquired}} power in the region, by the unification of many Thracian tribes under a single ruler, King Teres 5th century BC. It became involved in wars and military conflicts against the Romans, Greek colonies, the kingdom of Macedon and the Diadochi, the Persian Empire, Paeonians, Dacians, Celts, Scythians and Thracian tribes. Sometimes it was allied with various Ancient Greek tribes or Greek city states. During the Peloponnesian war, Thracians were the allies of Athens. The Thracians fought alongside Athenians and Macedonians {{against the forces of}} the Spartans. Greek generals like Iphicrates and Charidemos fought for the Odrysae as well. The Thracians served under Scythian kings in 310 BC. Odrysian military strength was based on intra-tribal elite making the kingdom prone to fragmentation. Although the kingdom was wealthy, a large proportion of its <b>income</b> was <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and suitable portions had to be paid to the tribal chiefs. The army was mostly fed and paid by plunder. Sitalces was able to raise an army supposedly 150,000 strong for his invasion of Macedonia in 429 BC but these economic and political factors (plus the onset of winter) meant that this army only held together for about six weeks and any Thracian conquests were ephemeral.|$|R
5000|$|In real history, {{wage labour}} arises {{out of the}} {{dissolution}} of slavery and serfdom—or of the decay of communal property, as with Oriental and Slavonic peoples—and, in its adequate, epoch-making form, the form which takes possession of the entire social being of labour, out of the decline {{and fall of the}} guild economy, of the system of Estates, of labour and <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> of industry carried on as rural subsidiary occupation, of small-scale feudal agriculture, etc. In all these real historic transitions, wage labour appears as the dissolution, the annihilation of relations in which labour was fixed on all sides, in its income, its content, its location, its scope, etc. Hence, as negation of the stability of labour and of its remuneration. The direct transition from the African's fetish to Voltaire's [...] "Supreme Being", or from the hunting gear of a North American savage to the capital of the Bank of England, is not so absurdly contrary to history, as is the transition from Bastiat's fisherman to the wage labourer.|$|E
50|$|In China, as {{in other}} countries, an {{important}} determinant of the affluence of a household was the dependency ratio - the number of nonworkers supported by each worker. In 1985 {{the average cost of}} living for one person in urban areas was ¥732 a year, and the average state enterprise worker, even with food allowance and other benefits added to the basic wage, had difficulty supporting one other person. Two average wage earners, however, could easily support one dependent. Families with several workers and few or no dependents had substantial surplus earnings, which they saved or used to buy nonessential goods. An important positive influence on the per capita consumption levels of urban families was a {{decline in the number of}} dependents per urban worker, from 2.4 in 1964 to 0.7 in 1985. In farm families the dependency ratio fell from 1.5 in 1978 to 0.7 in 1985. Farm incomes rose rapidly in the 1980s under the stimulus of the responsibility system but on average remained considerably lower than urban incomes. Household surveys found that in 1985 average net per capita income for rural residents was ¥398, less than half the average per capita urban income, which was ¥821. The value of goods farmers produced and consumed themselves accounted for 31 percent of rural income in 1985. The largest component of <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> was food, 58 percent of which was self-produced.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{argument}} are those who contend that no surplus value was generated from labour activity or from commodity markets in the socialist planned economies and therefore claim that there was no exploiting class, even if inequalities existed. Since prices were controlled and set below market clearing levels there was no element of ‘value added’ at the point of sale as occurs in capitalist market economies. Prices were built up from the average cost of inputs, including wages, taxes, interest on stocks and working capital, and allowances to cover the recoupment of investment and for depreciation, so there was no ‘profit margin’ in the price charged to customers. Wages did not reflect the purchase price of labour since labour was not a commodity traded in a market and the employing organizations did not own the means of production. Wages were set at a level that permitted a decent standard of living and rewarded specialist skills and educational qualifications. In macroeconomic terms, the plan allocated the whole national product to workers in the form of wages for the workers’ own use, with a fraction withheld for investment and imports from abroad. The difference between the average value of wages and the value of national output per worker did not imply the existence of surplus value since it was part of a consciously formulated plan for the development of society. Furthermore, the presence of inequality in the socialist planned economies did not imply that an exploiting class existed. In the USSR communist party members were able to buy scarce goods in special shops and the leadership elite took advantage of state property to live in more spacious accommodation and sometimes luxury. Although they received privileges not commonly available and thus some additional <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> there was no difference in their official remuneration in comparison to their non-party peers. Enterprise managers and workers received only the wages and bonuses related to the production targets that had been set by the planning authorities. Outside of the cooperative sector, which enjoyed greater economic freedoms and whose profits were shared among all members of the cooperative, there was no profit-taking class.|$|E
40|$|It {{results from}} the essence of social fund of consumption, {{that it is a}} source of {{increasing}} total incomes of population. Services renderred from that fund are then — besides wages — additional incomes of the society members. They amounted to 2000 złoty in 1960, and to 6915 złoty for one inhabitant in the year 1976. Housekeepings receive <b>income</b> directly <b>in</b> a monetary form {{as well as in the}} form of definite means of consumption and of non-pecuniary services. It depends on material or pecuniar forms of distribution. Housekeepings can freely dispose of <b>incomes</b> received <b>in</b> virtue of social pecuniary services. They may also freely decide on certain consumption goods. From such poin of view these incomes do not differ from incomes received by division according to labour and they are not included into personal <b>incomes.</b> Social services <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> are not included into personal incomes of the people taking advantage of these services. That's why the common accessibility of these services produces a risk of waste. Services from social fund of consumption reduce <b>income</b> disproportions <b>in</b> particular social groups. They do not, however, equalize incomes of the whole society. Such fact would cause breach of principles of functioning the wages policy. An excessive restraint of the role of wages can contribute to decrease in effectivennes and to professional qualification decline. The task of incomes received by the people from social fund of consumption does not consist in levelling differences in wages but it is connected with diminishing social disproportions in working groups with low incomes for one family member.

The Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) {{is the source of the}} microdata on households from 2008 - 09 onwards. Previously, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS) was the data source. Derived variables are created using information from LCF/EFS and control totals from a variety of different government sources including the United Kingdom National Accounts (ONS Blue Book), HM Revenue and Customs, Department for Transport, Department of Health, Department for Education and Employment, and Department for Communities and Local Government.

The five income measures are: original income: includes income from employment, private pensions, investment income and income from other non-government sources gross income: original income plus cash benefits disposable income: gross income minus direct taxes (income tax, employees' National Insurance contributions and local taxes) post-tax income: disposable income minus indirect taxes final income: post-tax <b>income</b> plus benefits <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (from education, the National Health Service (NHS), travel and housing subsidies) Standard Measures: Households are ranked by equivalised disposable income using the McClements equivalence scale (see methodology notes in the documentation for further details) ...|$|R

Friedman and Tobin proposed a universal income-support system to provide an income guarantee (G) or “negative tax ” at a zero level of income, and a tax rate (t) at which benefits are reduced as income rises. A universal system of this sort, or negative income tax (NIT), was presented as an alternative to a welfare system that provides <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and discourages work through high implicit tax (benefit-reduction) rates. Changes in the welfare system to provide both a reasonable guarantee and work incentives through reduced tax rates on earned income neces-sarily extend the income range of program coverage to persons previously outside the welfare system.

40|$|The present work {{is trying}} to {{estimate}} inequality and poverty in Greece after the access in EMU. The data {{used in this study}} came from the last Household Budget Survey (HBS) of the entire population of Greece conducted from February 2004 to January 2005 by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG). For the purpose of this study, we used data on both consumption expenditure and household income. Consumption expenditure was defined as including the value of goods and services purchased plus imputed consumption expenditure (consumption of own production, <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> imputed rent, etc.). These expenditures were also added to the current income of households. Inequality and poverty in Greece is measured and decomposed to explore the association with particular characteristics of the household or the household head. These characteristics are residence in rural areas, large household size, low educational level, old age of the household head, households headed by farmers and retired persons. We explore the characteristics of the households which are close to the boundary line of poverty. In regard of the common methodological issues, we chose the individual as the unit of analysis of inequality and the distribution data were equivalised to make allowances for economies of scale and differences in needs between adults and minors (known as "family equivalence scales") ...|$|E

With various economic conditions in the background, they have always worked away from home and, their wage level having been very low, their income has been only to their household economy. Under these circumstances home products have supported the lives and household budgets of these poor peasants and wage laborers.

Owing to the fall of our feudal system, the lower ex-military class added to the number of wage laborers, and these poor ex-warriors were not blessed even with small amounts of agricultural products.

The objective of this thesis is, firstly, to examine the livelihood of those laborers without farms in their background in order that we can revaluate the role of such income in kind; secondly, to inquire into the self-consciousness of ex-warriors as laborers, and, with these two points at the base, to investigate synthetically how these lower ex-military workers have undergone transitions in their lives after the Imperial Restoration in 1868...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are twofold: (1) one is to {{estimate}} the size of the second economy in the Soviet Union as a whole and in each republic from 1969 to 1988, based on household budget surveys which belong to the collection of the Central Statistical Directorate (f. 1562) of the Russian State Archive of Economy, (2) and the other is to compare the results of this estimation among union republics in terms of their size, dynamics, and component structure. Although a number of {{attempts have been made to}} estimate the size of the second economy, they have suffered either methodological deficiency or limitations in the scope of time and regions mainly because of data unavailability. Even Kim Byung-Yeon's recent pioneering work on regional variation in informal household economic activities confines its research period to the year of 1989. In order to tackle these unresolved problems, we reconstruct our own statistical database of household incomes, expenditures, and items traded by the republics, using declassified archival materials on household budget surveys. Based on these data, we estimate the size of the second economy with specified structural components. On the income side, the second economy consists of three components, namely, (i) <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from private plots, (ii) sales of privately produced goods and services to the state sector, and (iii) the so-called parallel "market," that is, retail turnover outside the state and cooperative sectors. The latter two components are distinguished by the price setting mechanism. While the prices of sales to the state are set and mainly fixed by the state, parallel market prices are assumed to be set according to the demand and supply of the goods. On the expenditure side, the consumption of self-produced goods and the parallel market are two components of the second economy. A structural analysis of the second economy is quite important from the viewpoint of forced savings and repressed inflation. For a comparative analysis of the second economy of the union republics, cluster analysis allows each of them to be classified into one of three groups. The first group consists of Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Estonia; the second group [...] Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Moldova; and the third [...] Uzbekistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kirgizstan, Tajikistan, Armenia, and Turkmenistan. This classification makes variance among groups clearer. The main findings {{of this study}} are as follows. First of all, the size of the second economy is unevenly distributed across the republics. The size of the third group, that is, the share of the second economy income out of total household income, is 25. 1 % on average during the period investigated. This figure is almost twice that of the first group with 14. 6 %. The second group also holds a substantial size of the second economy with 24. 5 %. A similar situation can be seen on the expenditure side: the first group holds 16. 6 % and the third [...] 34. 2 %. Secondly, dynamics among the three groups are different. While the second group shows a drastic decline from 30. 0 % to 20. 2 % toward the late Soviet period, this tendency does not appear in the other groups with a 5 -percentage-point decline at most. In contrast, the third group shows a decline in the early 1970 s from 23. 2 % to 21. 0 % and then demonstrates an upward trend to 25. 1 %, finally showing a diminution to 20. 7 %. On the expenditure side, while the size of the second group shrinks from 34. 0 % to 20. 5 %, the other groups show a more moderate decline. In the third group, the size of the second economy remained at almost the same level throughout the period investigated. Thirdly, it is possible to observe differences in component structure. The share of <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> occupies the largest portion in the second group with 13. 3 %, which is larger than that of the parallel market. In the other groups, the relative size of <b>income</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> is either smaller or comparable to that of the parallel market. In the third group, these shares are respectively 8. 9 % and 11. 1 %. On the expenditure side, while the size of consumption of the self-produced goods in the second group is comparable to that of the parallel market, the other groups have a self-consumption share half the size of the parallel market. From these findings, the first group including Russia is characterized as republics with a less developed second economy; the second group is distinguished by a self-sufficient natural second economy; and the third, which includes Georgia and Uzbekistan, is identified as having a highly developed second economy with market orientation...|$|E
