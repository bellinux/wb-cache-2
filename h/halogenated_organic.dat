40|$|Drinking water {{chlorination}} {{is known to}} produce <b>halogenated</b> <b>organics</b> such as total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and other chlorine-containing species. Laboratory findings show that pure chlorine dioxide, however, produces virtually no TTHMs (or other <b>halogenated</b> <b>organics).</b> In the late 1970 s, the USEPA recognized replacement of chlorine with chlorine dioxide as a preoxidant and BAT (Best Available Technology) for preventing THM formation in drinking water treatment. ^ When chlorine dioxide is generated and applied, some excess chlorine may also be applied, the amount depending on the generation process {{and the degree of}} control exercised. Some of this chlorine may react with organics to produce THMs. Studies conducted in the late 70 s showed, however, that the amount of THMs formed by chlorine in conjunction with chlorine dioxide is less than the quantity formed if the same dose of chlorine were fed alone. Additional work has been reported only sporadically in this area since then. There is little or no literature addressing speciation phenomena arising from mixed chlorine/chlorine dioxide treatment.

Nitrosomonas europaea is also capable of degrading benzene as well as a variety of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> compounds, including trichloroethylene and vinyl chloride.

50|$|POPs {{typically}} are <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> compounds (see lists below) {{and as such}} exhibit high lipid solubility. For this reason, they bioaccumulate in fatty tissues. Halogenated compounds also exhibit great stability reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward hydrolysis and photolytic degradation. The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern. They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels. Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as PBTs (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic) or TOMPs (Toxic Organic Micro Pollutants).|$|E
5000|$|From all LRP methods, Atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerization}} or ATRP {{is the most}} studied and since its development in 1995 an exhaustive amount of articles has been published about this topic. An excellent review written by the pioneer in the field, Matyjaszewski, covers the developments in ATRP from 1995 {{until the end of}} 2000. Atom transfer radical polymerization or ATRP involves the chain initiation of free radical polymerization by a <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> species {{in the presence of a}} metal halide. The metal has a number of different oxidation states that allows it to abstract a halide from the organohalide, creating a radical that then starts free radical polymerization. After inititation and propagation, the radical on the active chain terminus is reversibly terminated (with the halide) by reacting with the catalyst in its higher oxidation state. Thus, the redox process gives rise to an equilibrium between dormant (Polymer-Halide) and active (Polymer-radical) chains. The equilibrium is designed to heavily favor the dormant state, which effectively reduces the radical concentration to a sufficiently low level to limit bimolecular coupling.|$|E
