Its jute jacket on, it was then coiled away in tanks full of water, where it was constantly kept submerged and continuously tested for insulation. Last of all the top coat was put on. This consisted of ten wires of peculiarly fine and strong iron. Each of these ten wires had put on it a special coat of its own, made of tarred Manilla yarn, to protect it from rust as well as to lighten its specific gravity. The core being brought from its tank, and passed round several sheaves, which carried it below the factory floor, was drawn up {{through a hole in the}} centre of a circular table, around the circumference of which were ten drums of the Manilla-covered wire. A stout iron rod, fastened to the circumference of the table, rose from between each drum to the ceiling, converging in a cone which passed through to the floor above. Our core rose in the middle of all, and went through the hollow of the cone. When all was put in noisy and bewildering motion, the core which rose from the turning-table and whirling drums as a thin jute-clad line, came out in the floor above a stout iron-clad cable, with a Manilla top-dressing, possessing strength sufficient to bear eleven miles of its own length perpendicularly suspended in water--or a margin of strength more than four and a half times that required,--and with a breaking strain of seven tons fifteen hundredweight.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the effect of introducing <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> on the mechanical properties of concrete. Jute fibre is produced abundantly in Bangladesh and hence, very cheap. The investigation on the enhancement of mechanical properties of concrete with <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> as reinforcement, if enhanced, will not only explore a way to improve the properties of concrete, it will also explore the use of jute and restrict the utilization of polymer which is environmentally detrimental. To accomplish the objective, an experimental investigation of the compressive, flexural and tensile strengths of <b>Jute</b> <b>Yarn</b> Reinforced Concrete composites (JYRCC) has been conducted. Cylinders, prisms and cubes of standard dimensions have been made to introducing <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> varying the mix ratio of the ingredients in concrete, water cement ratio, length and volume of yarn to know the effect of parameters as mentioned. Compressive, flexural and tensile strength tests had been conducted on the prepared samples by appropriate testing apparatus following Standards of tests. Mechanical properties of JYRCC were observed to be enhanced for a particular range of lengths of cut (10, 15, 20 and 25  mm) and volume content of <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75  %). The maximum increment of compressive, flexural and tensile strengths observed in the investigation are 33, 23 and 38  %, respectively with respect to concrete without <b>jute</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
30|$|In the {{experimental}} investigations {{conducted in the}} study, it was found that, the addition of <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> contributes enriched results for mechanical properties of concrete composites for a particular yarn length and yarn content. More specifically, compressive, flexural, and tensile strength are found to enhance significantly for volume content of 0.1 and 0.25  % and the yarn cut length of 10 and 15  mm. However, with larger yarn length and content the mechanical properties were found to affect adversely. Finally the <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> shows the positive contribution to minimize irregular mixing disabilities of concrete composites that creates major problem regarding fibre reinforcement. So JYRCC can be developed with locally fabricated <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> in Bangladesh. The least cost of <b>jute</b> <b>yarn,</b> its being renewable resources, the reduced weight of the JYRCC and the environmental compatibility would clearly show the socioeconomic viability of JYRCC.

30|$|According to the {{previous}} study (Mansur and Aziz 1982; Chakraborty 2013; Meddaha and Bencheikh 2009; Bezerra et al. 2004) a number of difficulties are encountered while mixing natural fibres to produce composite. For instance, Meddaha and Bencheikh (2009) mentioned that inhomogeneous distribution of fibres yields bulk and surface flaws. The stress concentration at these flaws would accelerate crack propagation which results lower fracture strength of the mortar specimens (Bezerra et al. 2004). Chakraborty (2013) also reported to use natural fibres in FRCC that the agglomeration could not be avoided. The amount of fibres that {{can be added to}} a mix is limited by the tendency of ‘bailing’ (Mansur and Aziz 1982) where the fibres frequently intermesh and form fibre balls which is critical to be separated. The bailing of fibres results in an ineffectual and segregated mix which produces a highly porous and honeycombed concrete. As a result, a remarkable strength fall of the concrete composite occurs. From the above elucidation, it can be concluded that the fibre mixing plays a vital role in the perfection of mechanical properties of fibre reinforced concrete composites. On the other hand, <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> processing covers a long process line during its manufacturing along with fibre opening, cleaning, faults removing and parallelizing (Muttaki 2013). Furthermore, the loose dust is eliminated by softener where dirt falls off and pieces of bark and stick become damaged from the jute fibre during the process (Atkinson 1985). Carding machine initiates the parallelizing of the jute fibre and eventually drafting and doubling section also adds value to it (Atkinson 1985). However, the effect of using <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> on the mechanical behaviour of concrete reinforced with <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> has yet to be investigated. Additionally, the use natural fibres in concrete made with crushed stone have been universally used. The use of crushed bricks are very common (Rashid et al. 2009) in Bangladesh, parts of India and some other countries having scarcity of stone. Additionally, the mechanical properties of concrete made with crushed bricks are quite different than those made with crushed stone (Mansur et al. 1999; Mohammed et al. 2015). Investigative studies have not yet been conducted to evaluate the effect jute fibre or <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> on the concrete made with crushed bricks. To this end, it is very much rationale to determine the effect for exploring potential use of jute for obtaining enhanced concrete with low cost, without affecting the environment and minimum health hazard. With this background, the main objective of the study is to develop jute yarn-reinforced concrete composites and to investigate the effect of yarn length and content (volume fraction) on its mechanical behaviour.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to understand the influence of fibre surface treatment as well as yarn twist on the tensile properties of unidirectional (UD) jute polyester composites. Jute and polyester are chosen in this work as both are cheap. As received <b>jute</b> <b>yarn,</b> physical and chemical surface treated <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> and raw jute fibre are used to manufacture UD composites. Physical surface treatment includes removing yarn hairs, sizing by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), water treatment, sizing by cellulose nano-particle (CNP) and chemical treatment includes mercerisation with and without applying tension. Composites manufactured with unsized hairy yarn show an increase in tensile modulus {{and a decrease in}} strain at failure compared to composites manufactured with unsized hairless yarn in the longitudinal direction. However yarn hairs do not affect the tensile strength of composites. Application of HEC improves the tensile properties of composites with respect to composites manufactured with unsized yarn. Water treatment of yarn with tension enhances the tensile properties of composites and water treatment of yarn without tension decreases the tensile properties of composite with respect to composites manufactured with untreated yarn. Similar to water treatment, composites manufactured with alkali treated yarn with tension show higher tensile strength with respect to composites manufactured with alkali treated yarn without tension. Non-dried CNP treatment of yarn improves the tensile properties of composites. Composites manufactured with raw fibres have increased tensile properties with respect to composites manufactured with twisted yarn...|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 {{represents}} the variation of compressive strength {{with respect to}} yarn content and yarn length for concrete mix ratio 1 : 1.5 : 3. A particular curve {{represents the}} variation of the compressive strength with volumetric content of yarn. It is to mention that 0  % yarn content represents that no yarn was mixed which indicates plain concrete. From the figure no specific trend with yarn length with yarn content can be observed. Compressive strength increment {{up to a certain}} yarn content that is 0.1  % with yarn lengths can be seen for 10, 15, and 20  mm yarn while that is found to decrease for 25  mm yarn. The rate of increase for 15  mm yarn with 0.1  % content is the largest. With further increase of yarn content the compressive strength is seen to decrease for different lengths of yarn. The reason for irregular variation can be interpreted in the following way. In the case of larger yarn length (yarn length > 15  mm) and content (> 0.25  %) difficulties were encountered to maintain consistency in concrete mix. Since numerous studies have considered reinforcing materials i.e. fibres or yarns as similar to coarse aggregate, the inclusion of <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> leads to an increase of coarse aggregate fraction in spite of the fine aggregate fraction which could result in a high porosity in the cement matrix. For decreasing trend with yarn content can be explained that with the addition of <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> in concrete reduces the specific gravity of the composites and due to the low specific gravity, inadequate mixing and high porosity of the JYRCC, a lower compressive strength with respect to the reference concrete particularly, when a high volume and larger length of yarn was added. Similar results were obtained by Shimizu and Jorillo (1992). However, the short yarn length with smaller content, which act as short jute fibre was firmly bound the composite constituent, and develop an intact material which results the more resistance to applied force. Similar trends can be observed in Fig.  5 which represents the results for concrete mix ratio 1 : 2 : 4. In Fig.  5, the maximum compressive strength increment can be seen for 15  mm yarn and 0.1  % yarn content. Similar complexities in making concrete composites with different fibre length and content have been reported by Barr et al. (1996). The maximum improvement of compressive strength was found for 15  mm yarn length and 0.10  % content both 1 : 1.5 : 3 and 1 : 2 : 4 mix ratio. The improvements are 33  % and 12  % for 1 : 1.5 : 3 and 1 : 2 : 4 mix ratio with respect to plain concrete, where fine distribution of reinforcing materials i.e. <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> are obtained. Finally, {{it can be said that}} JYRCC with < 15  mm yarn cut length with ≤ 0.10  % volumetric dozing is the more promising combination for compressive strength increment.|$|E

From Fig.  6 {{significant influence on}} the flexural strength for yarn length 10  mm and 15  mm with volumetric content from 0.1 to 0.25  % cab be observed. In contrast the flexural strength fall can be seen for the further increment of yarn length and content. Almost similar results were obtained for mix ratio 1 : 2 : 4 shown in Fig.  7. However, the considerable decrements of strength were found for higher yarn length and content. The increment of yarn length (> 15  mm) and yarn volume (> 0.25  %) in concrete causes the balling of JYRCC creates high porosity and weak zones in the specimen, therefore, a decrease in flexural strength was observed. Similar trend has also been observed regarding the incorporation of fibre in concrete by (Meddaha and Bencheikh 2009). Failure of such beam specimen, are initiated by formation of cracks that would proceed along the pre-weak zones with smaller cracking load {{as compared with the}} intact specimen or with specimen with lower yarn content.
