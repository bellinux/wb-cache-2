50|$|Congressional pension is {{a pension}} made {{available}} {{to members of the}} United States Congress. Members who participated in the congressional pension system are vested after five (5) years of service. A full pension is available to members 62 years of age with 5 years of service; 50 years or older with 20 years of service; or 25 years of service at any age. A reduced pension is available depending upon which of several different age/service options is chosen. If Members leave Congress before reaching retirement age, they may leave their contributions behind and receive a <b>deferred</b> <b>pension</b> later. The current pension program, effective January 1987, is under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which covers members and other federal employees whose federal employment began in 1984 or later. This replaces the older Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) for most members of congress and federal employees.|$|E
50|$|Defined benefit {{pension plans}} will offer {{various types of}} benefit {{according}} to the mode by which the employee leaves the employer. For example, if the employee remains in employment until his retirement age, then he may be entitled to a pension, often calculated by reference to his average salary in the period running up to their exit. The pension might be payable {{for the remainder of}} his life, and when he/she dies, at a reduced rate to his/her spouse for the remainder of his/her life. But if he leaves service before being entitled to a pension, he might receive a benefit such as a return of contributions, or a <b>deferred</b> <b>pension</b> payable from normal retirement age, depending on length of service. In many cases, defined benefit pension plans are funded and hold assets in order to meet those promised benefits.

Established in 1800, it consisted mostly of law books which were burned by the British in 1814, but the library collection was restored afterwards with significant gifts from the collection of Thomas Jefferson. One of the Library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public and is the [...] "largest library in the world" [...] according to one source, with over a hundred million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, and graphics, and materials in over four hundred and fifty languages.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} for public pension schemes to offer individuals {{the option to}} delay benefit claiming until after the normal retirement age, and increase the annual benefit level as a result. Existing literature shows that for non-liquidity constrained individuals, delaying benefit claiming {{for a number of}} years after retirement is optimal from a utility perspective in a wide variety of cases. In this paper we focus on non-liquidity constrained individuals who wish to <b>defer</b> <b>pension</b> benefits, and investigate the attractiveness of an alternative deferral strategy. The alternative deferral strategy consists of claiming benefits immediately, and using them to buy deferred annuities from an insurance company. We first determine conditions under which the accrual offered by the public pension scheme for delaying benefit claiming is less than actuarially fair from the viewpoint of an insurer who uses the prevailing term structure of interest rates to determine the expected present value of missed and additional benefits. Actuarial unfairness can be generated by, e. g., age-independent accrual rates or slow adjustments of the accrual rates to changes in interest rates. We find that, in particular for men, the degree of actuarial unfairness is such that there is ample room for insurers to profitably offer annuity products that make the alternative deferral strategy preferred to deferring benefit claiming. If individuals choose to strategically exploit these alternative deferral strategies, this will affect benefit claiming behavior in public pension schemes, which in turn affects long run program costs...|$|R
40|$|Pension policy reforms {{across the}} world in recent decades are a {{reaction}} to the changing demographic and socioeconomic environment. While pension scheme redesign has received much attention, the tax treatment of contributions, returns, and benefits of retirement savings remains mostly unattended and the taxation of internationally portable pensions is terra incognita for economists. This paper focuses on the huge differences in old-age pension taxation within and across OECD countries and highlights fiscal equity and efficiency issues that emerge in a world of internationally mobile workers and pensioners. It highlights that pension taxation differs widely not only across countries but also across pension pillars within a country, creating savings and mobility distortions and fiscal equity problems at individual and country level. The paper offers explanations for this heterogeneity and proposes a switch from deferred taxation towards front-loaded taxation of retirement savings to meet the demographic challenges of a globalized world. Three policy options presented differ in the way taxes are paid, but all of them are claimed superior to single-country measures taken to uphold <b>deferred</b> <b>pension</b> taxation or to rely on renegotiations of bilateral double taxation treaties...|$|E

The corridor method has made it possible for companies to defer its actuarial gains and losses. Now that the corridor approach abolished then the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses immediately be covered by equity, which involves very large amounts of some companies. Why the amounts have grown so big is much because of the discount rate. The discount rate is a controversial parameter, and there is disagreement on how it should be fixed. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine the accounting implications this will have for the company applied the corridor method, and if there is some parameters in the actuarial assumption that is more important than others. Methodology: The thesis has mainly been based on a qualitative research through qualitative interviews with a small sample that is affected by this change. There are quantitative elements to a greater depth by examining the annual reports, discount and <b>deferred</b> <b>pension</b> liabilities of the various companies. The approach is exploratory as it is a qualitative study and there was little knowledge of the subject before the work of it started. Therefore, a study of literature, regulations and previous research before the empirical study. This made it possible to gain a broader understanding of the subject and to shape relevant and essential interview questions. Conclusions: The conclusion shows that the largest accounting consequences for the companies in the study in conjunction with the change is that the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses will now be covered by equity and that the expected return on plan assets is based on the discount rate. The study also shows that it is the discount rate which is considered the most important parameter that the companies are looking at in the actuarial assumption. The conclusion also provides a shared sense of the true and fair picture of the companies after the revised IAS 19. Suggestions for further research: That after 2013 to study how the actual result of this rule change did this compare to the expected. Look at the problem of determining the discount rate. How will the IASB look at it if more and more begin to deviate from the standard?

40|$|With {{the threat}} of {{longevity}} risk to the insurance industry becoming increasingly apparent in recent years, insurers and reinsurers are concerned about how to better model and manage longevity risk. However, modeling and managing longevity risk is not trivial, {{due in part to}} its systematic nature and in part to the excessive amount of risk factors that constitute the risk. The theme of this thesis is modeling and managing longevity risk. In particular, this thesis focuses on four types of uncertainties among all possible risk factors. These four risk factors include 1) mortality jump risk; 2) longevity drift risk; 3) population basis risk; and 4) cohort mismatch risk. In the current literature, a number of stochastic mortality models with transitory jump effects have been proposed to capture mortality jump risk. Rather than modeling the age pattern of jump effects explicitly, most of the existing models assume that the distributions of jump effects and general mortality improvements across ages are identical. Nevertheless, this assumption {{does not appear to be}} in line with what can be observed from historical data. In this thesis, we addressed this disconnect by introducing a Lee-Carter variant that captures the age pattern of mortality jumps by a distinct collection of parameters. The model variant was then further generalized to permit the age pattern of jump effects to vary randomly. We illustrated the two proposed models with mortality data from the United States and English and Welsh populations, and further used these data to value hypothetical mortality bonds with similar specifications to the Atlas IX Capital Class B note that was launched in 2013. The features we considered were found to have a significant impact on the estimated prices. We then explored longevity drift risk, which is the uncertainty about the mortality trend itself. We tackled longevity drift risk by introducing the locally-linear CBD model in which the drifts that govern the expected mortality trend are allowed to follow a stochastic process. Compared to the original CBD model, this specification results in median forecasts that are more consistent with recent trends and more robust relative to changes in the data sample period. Furthermore, the proposed model also yields wider prediction intervals that may better reflect the possibilities of future trend changes. To mitigate the risk associated with changes in drifts, we proposed a new hedging method called the generalized state-space hedging method which demands less stringent assumptions. The proposed method allows hedgers to extract more hedge effectiveness out of a hedging instrument, and is therefore useful when there are only a few traded longevity securities in the market. To incorporate population basis risk, we further extended the proposed generalized state-space hedging method to a multi-population setting. In this extended hedging method, the hedging strategy is derived by first reformulating the assumed multi-population stochastic mortality model in a state-space representation, and then considering the sensitivities of the hedge portfolio and the liability being hedged to all relevant hidden states. Inter alia, this method allowed us to decompose the underlying longevity risk into components arising solely from the hidden states that are shared by all populations and components stemming exclusively from the hidden states that are population-specific. The latter components collectively represent an explicit measure of the population basis risk involved. Through this measure, a new metric called standardized basis risk profile was developed. This metric allowed us to assess the relative levels of population basis risk that q-forwards with different reference populations, reference ages, and times-to-maturity may lead to. The proposed methodologies were illustrated using real mortality data from various national populations. Similar to population basis risk, cohort mismatch risk is another risk that is related to population differences when conducting an index-based longevity hedge. It arises when the hedger chooses to link hedging instruments to different cohorts. Although existing index-based longevity hedging strategies mitigate the risk associated with period effects, they often overlook the risk associated with different cohorts. The negligence of cohort effects may lead to sub-optimal hedge effectiveness if the liability being hedged is a <b>deferred</b> <b>pension</b> or annuity which involves cohorts that are not covered by the data sample. We proposed a new hedging strategy that incorporates both period and cohort effects. The resulting longevity hedge is a value hedge which reduces the uncertainty surrounding the τ-year ahead value of the liability being hedged in terms variance or Value-at-Risk. We further developed a method to expedite the evaluation of a value longevity hedge. By utilizing the fact that the innovations of the stochastic processes for the period and cohort effects are not serially correlated, the proposed method avoids the need for nested simulations that are generally required when evaluating a value hedge...|$|E

However, available evidence suggests that the impact in Denmark of recent policy changes is of minor importance for postponing retirement till after age  65 (Amilon and Nielsen 2010; Larsen and Ellerbæk 2012). Mainly men, highly educated and people holding advanced positions have chosen to defer their OAP – individuals that wanted to continue working after the official retirement age and, in many cases, might have done so without the opportunity to <b>defer</b> their <b>pensions.</b> Similarly, the impact of reducing means testing of supplementary OAP against income from work seems to be limited. Yet, people in the potential target group were not well informed about either the possibility to defer OAP or the reduction of means testing of supplementary OAP from income from work. More importantly, however, among employed Danes in the age group  65 – 75 the vast majority state that they work because they have preferences for continued work, while only 30 % also mention economic reasons as their motive for working (Larsen et al. 2011), cf. also the results of the analyses focusing on motivation discussed in Sect.  2.

Extant literature argues that besides equity and cash, managers are also compensated with debt-like instruments such as <b>deferred</b> compensation and <b>pensions.</b> These compensation components are typically unfunded and unsecured and expose the CEO to default risk similar to that faced by external debtholders (Edmans and Liu, 2011). As a result, managers with large inside debt holdings are expected to display lower financial risk tolerance (Cassel et al., 2012). Motivated by this argument, I first examine {{the effects of}} CEO inside debt compensation on corporate financial policy choices. I document a negative association between inside debt holdings and firm book leverage and a positive relationship between CEO inside debt holdings and firm solvency. Subsequently, I examine whether women, who are perceived to possess a risk profile similar to a manager with significant inside debt holdings receive similar inside debt compensation to men.

The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, formerly known as ONS Opinions Survey or Omnibus, is a regular, multi-purpose survey which {{was carried out in}} eight months of the year until April 2005. From this point it has run monthly. It started operating commercially in 1990 and was set up originally {{to meet the needs of}} government departments for a survey that used short and simple sets of questions, had greater statistical reliability than private sector omnibus surveys and a properly designed random sample. Now, however, an increasing number of academics are finding it a valuable research tool. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is used for a number of purposes, for example: to provide quick answers to questions of immediate interest to provide information on topics that do not require a full survey to develop and pilot questions for other surveys to sift for subgroups that can be followed up in another survey History From January 2008 the ONS Omnibus Survey changed its name to the ONS Opinions Survey (OPN) and became part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS). As a result, certain classificatory variables were altered to harmonise with the rest of the surveys that form the IHS. For further information, see detailed breakdown of the changes contained within the documentation for 2008 studies onwards. Subsequently, in January 2010, the OPN component was dropped from the IHS due to only one individual per household being interviewed, while the IHS requires questions to be asked of all household members. This process significantly increased the length of the OPN interview and, therefore, OPN reverted back to interviewing one household member, but still contains questions harmonised to the IHS. From April 2012 the ONS Opinions Survey changed its name to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey following the merger of the non-EU-SILC questions from the General Lifestyle Survey. Special Licence Access Opinions and Lifestyle Survey data With effect from 2008, the decision was made by ONS to make all new and existing Disability Monitoring data (Module 363) and Contraception data (Module 170) issuable only to Approved Researchers under Special Licence access conditions due to the disclosive nature of the modules. See the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey Special Licence Access datasets page. Main Topics : Each month's questionnaire consists of two elements: core questions, covering demographic information, are asked each month together with non-core questions that vary from month to month. The non-core questions for this month were: Working conditions (Module 346) : this module was asked on behalf of researchers at the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and questions asked relate to assessing the way people work and their levels of job-related stress. <b>Deferring</b> state <b>pensions</b> (Module 349) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and questions relate to the respondent's knowledge of <b>deferring</b> the state <b>pension,</b> whether respondents believe they can continue working after they become eligible for the state pension and awareness of financial incentives for delaying.

Still, the focus of both academics and policy makers appears largely limited to the alignment of managerial incentives with the interests of shareholders. The unintended consequence of it is the resulting conflict of interests between debt and equity holders, in particular, excessive risk taking by the executives (which may harm the creditors). A combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques is applied to study UK public firms and investigate the role that the design of managerial incentive schemes could have in mitigating (or exacerbating) agency conflicts of debt financing. Specifically, the project analyses relations between companies' capital structure and the design of their executives' compensation packages. It also verifies if <b>deferred</b> compensation and <b>pension</b> entitlements of executives serve as a remedy for mitigating the conflict of interests between shareholders and debt holders, or if they represent excessive managerial remuneration. Finally, it examines the effects of the executive pay-mix design on managerial actions and on the investors' wealth. The project will contribute to academic literature and will provide evidence informing policy makers on transparency and governance guidelines regarding managerial compensation and incentive schemes...|$|R

Extending the age pension to 70 by 2035 has aroused anxiety for senior Australians not sure whether their skills, health and longevity in work can be assured at that age. Concurrently, the Budget foreshadowed that age pensions would be indexed according to the CPI from 1 July 2017, and not benchmarked to male total average weekly earnings. This measure has been estimated to reduce individual pensions by 500 per year based on inflation. The present policy of <b>deferring</b> the age <b>pension</b> to 70 will require a great leap forward in policy to become more than a speculative target. Currently the workforce participation for those over 70 and over is tiny, with 7...|$|R
5000|$|While an {{executive}} may be any corporate [...] "officer"—including president, vice president, or other upper-level manager—in any company, {{the source of}} most comment and controversy is the pay of chief executive officers (CEOs) (and {{to a lesser extent}} the other top five highest paid executives) of large publicly traded firms. Most of the private sector economy in the United States is made up of such firms where management and ownership are separate, and there are no controlling shareholders. This separation of those who run a company from those who directly benefit from its earnings, create what economists call a [...] "principal-agent problem", where upper-management (the [...] "agent") has different interests, and considerably more information to pursue those interests, than shareholders (the [...] "principals"). This [...] "problem" [...] may interfere with the ideal of management pay set by [...] "arm's length" [...] negotiation between the executive attempting to get the best possible deal for him/her self, and the board of directors seeking a deal that best serves the shareholders, rewarding executive performance without costing too much. The compensation is typically a mixture of salary, bonuses, equity compensation (stock options,etc.), benefits, and perquisites. It has often had surprising amounts of <b>deferred</b> compensation and <b>pension</b> payments, and unique features such as executive loans (now banned), and post-retirement benefits, and guaranteed consulting fees.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents {{pension benefit}} choices made by {{public school teachers}} enrolled in the Illinois Teachers 2 ̆ 7 Retirement System (TRS), where they choose between taking a lump-sum withdrawal of their refundable contributions and <b>deferring</b> a <b>pension</b> benefit. The analysis explores {{the extent to which}} vested teachers enrolled in TRS separate from service with positive pension wealth, estimates how much money is 2 ̆ 2 left on the table 2 ̆ 2 at a conventional discount rate, and investigates what types of teachers display higher or lower discount rates as indicated by cashout patterns. To control for the relative attractiveness between choices, the analysis relies on three central measures: the pension-wealth-to-cash-out-ratio, net pension wealth, and the internal rate of return. Thirty-six percent of classroom teachers in TRS choose to withdraw their refundable contributions, and this estimate arguably provides a lower bound for similar 2 ̆ 2 final salary 2 ̆ 2 defined benefit pension plans in other states. Results from behavioral models find higher cashout rates among male, African American, and Hispanic teachers; teachers who work in rural districts; and teachers who did not receive a degree from an elite institution in Illinois. These results indicate higher discount rates among these groups. I find no evidence in the data of a relationship between subject endorsements and cashout decisions. Behavioral findings are consistent across models that assume different discount rates. The analysis concludes with an estimate of the aggregate leakage that occurs among TRS members who take a refund claim. Leakage is defined as NetPW for refund claimants who quit when the value of their pension wealth outweighs their refundable contributions. Leakage that refund claimants experience since 1980, adjusted for taxes and penalties, amount to 34, 120 per refund claimant among all members and 35, 229 per refund claimant among classroom teachers. Over four-fifths of this leakage, however, occurred since 2000. Annuitants incur about 9, 000 per member. Relative to the overall fiscal health of TRS, total leakage by members since 1980 as a percentage of pension debt is 0. 2 percent. The findings in this analysis suggest a set of policy implications, both for retirement security and for how some teachers value their retirement benefits...|$|R
40|$|The labor {{participation}} rate in Slovenia has been {{lower than in}} the EU- 15 (the members states prior to May 2004), particularly for the low-income and older individuals. Using simulations of tax and social benefits and public pensions, the paper shows how the current tax, welfare, and pension systems create disincentives to work among these groups. The paper finds that incentives to retire early are strong for men, especially low-wage earners. The marginal effective tax rates also make it costly for low-income individuals to work and negatively affect the probability of participating. The paper proposes reform measures to enhance work incentives and labor participation, which will be crucial for dealing with population aging and for achieving higher potential growth in Slovenia.

40|$|For both {{economic}} and regulatory reasons, most developing countries have underdeveloped pension funds and insurance sectors, and their social security systems face many financial and organizational problems. Wide-ranging reform would produce considerable economic and social benefits. A restructured social security system would avoid financial involvency and {{be better able to}} meet its objectives of redistribution. The development of pension funds and insurance business would generate long-term financial resources that could stimulate the growth of capital markets and might help provide adequate, affordable long-term benefits to members and policyholders. The main objectives of an ambitious reform program should be to: a) prevent the insolvency of the social security system (a longer run problem for developing countries with young populations) and thus ensure adequate but affordable, sustainable pension generate long-term financial resources that could stimulate the growth of capital markets and might help provide adequate, affordable long-term benefits to members and policyholders. The main objectives of an ambitious reform program should be to: a) prevent the insolvency of the social security system (a longer run problem for developing countries with young populations) and thus ensure adequate but affordable, sustainable pension benefits; b) remove incentives that encourage the strategic manipulation, and hamper the efficient functioning, of labor markets; c) control the occurrence of perverse, capricious redistribution by removing the many design faults that afflict security systems in most developing countries; and d) generate long-term financial savings that can help stimulate the modernization and growth of capital markets, finance long-term investments, and facilitate privatization. Although there is no single optimal way to sequence and pace a reform program, the full benefits of reform will not be realized until social pension systems are restructured and downsized, contribution rates lowered, and the scope for private pension funds (whether voluntary or mandatory) increased. One often-ignored imperative is to <b>defer</b> indexing the <b>pension</b> system until its many design flaws are corrected. Finally, reform of the insurance sector is essential for the whole program to succeed, because of the close links between pension reform and the provision of life, disability, and annuity insurance services.

40|$|Debt holding by managers, i. e., inside debt, aligns the {{incentives}} of managers {{more closely with}} those of debtholders, reducing agency costs of debt (Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Edmans and Liu (2011)). My thesis investigates the effect of managerial ownership of debt on corporate risk-taking, bank loan contracting, and accounting conservatism. In the first chapter I {{examine the effect of}} managerial ownership of debt on agency costs of debt problems related to risk-taking. I find that higher managerial ownership of debt implements lower corporate risk-taking, in terms of less investment in R&D, more investment in capital expenditures, and more corporate diversification. The role of inside debt in moderating risk-taking is more pronounced in firms with high level of default risk. These findings suggest that managers with large inside debt holdings are less likely to pursue risky projects that potentially transfer wealth from debtholders to shareholders. In the second chapter I examine how terms of bank loans are related to managerial ownership of debt. Specifically, the analysis uncovers significant evidence of lower loan spreads for firms with larger debt ownership by CEOs. The negative relation is more pronounced when creditors face higher expropriation risk and when the CEO's expected retirement horizon is beyond loan maturity. I also find that loans to firms with larger managerial debt holdings are associated with smaller lending syndicates, fewer covenant restrictions, and less collateral requirement, consistent with lenders anticipating lower expropriation risk at these firms. In the third chapter I examine the relation between accounting conservatism and managerial ownership of debt. Consistent with debt holdings by managers mitigating the debtholder-shareholder conflicts and reducing debtholders' demand for accounting conservatism, I find significant evidence of less conservative financial reporting at firms whose CEOs have accumulated more <b>deferred</b> compensation and <b>pension</b> benefits. This negative relation is more pronounced in firms with higher expected agency costs of debt and in firms that can credibly commit to a higher level of conservatism if required by debtholders. These findings are robust to using a number of alternative accounting conservatism measures and to correcting for potential endogeneity of managerial ownership of debt. Xin, Xiangang.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} case studies on various areas of financial accounting. The areas of financial accounting discussed include inventory valuation, relevant income and assets, statement of cash flows, accounts receivable and estimations, inventory and revenue recognition, depreciation, international accounting standards, long-term debt, stockholders’ equity, securities, income and regulation, <b>deferred</b> taxes, and <b>pension</b> and retirement plans. In the financial accounting case on inventory valuation, two companies’ financial statement values were analyzed through evaluating the related balance sheets and income statements to determine which company would be a better investment. Through ratio analysis related to profitability and liquidity of the companies, it was determined that Glenwood Heating, Inc. is the better potential investment. For the second case on financial accounting, several different kinds of income and assets were evaluated to determine which income statement and balance sheet accounts are most relevant for investors and other users of the financial statements. The income accounts that were considered include persistent income, equity income, interest income, and other income from operations. The the asset accounts that were determined critical for decision making by investors and other users of the financial statements include total operating assets, assets from affiliates, and investments. The third case provides a thorough discussion and explanation on the purpose, format, and usage of the statement of cash flows. The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to report cash receipts or inflows and cash payments or outflows during the fiscal period. For the fourth case, Accounts Receivable and Estimations, several different contributors to the accounts receivable account are discussed and analyzed for a specific company, Pearson. Accounts that affect accounts receivable include current receivables, trade receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts, and allowance for sales returns. Additionally, journal entries are expressed to show how the specific account affects accounts receivable. The fifth case addresses the revenue recognition financial accounting principle to determine if a specific company, GAC, has accurately calculated financial statement accounts, such as revenue, accounts receivable, inventory, and unearned revenue. Through an evaluation of the revenue recognition principle and GAC’s financial statements, it was determined that the company was breaking the revenue recognition principle and must change the account values accordingly. The sixth case evaluates different depreciation methods considering both legal and illegal methods for decreasing depreciation expense in the fiscal period. Northwest, Delta, and United Airlines used legal methods to depreciate the same asset different over a certain period, but Waste Management used illegal depreciation methods to falsify earnings to investors, the public, and the SEC. The seventh case explains the differences between GAAP and IFRS when accounting for various liabilities. For the eight case, long-term debt was evaluated in Rite Aid to explore different kinds of debt, methods of issuance, interest expense, and discounts on bond payables through journal entries and calculations. The ninth case, Stockholders’ Equity, evaluates the common stock, treasury stock, dividends, and related ratios in two companies to consider different method for accounting for these values and transactions and to determine what the resulting values tell investors about the company. For the tenth case, State Street Corporation’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what securities the company current held. Through exploration of the unclassified balance sheet, it was established that State Street Corporation held trading securities, listed at fair value, available-for-sale securities, listed at fair value, and held-to-maturity securities, accounted for at amortized cost. The eleventh case considers several large corporations’ business models to establish what risks these companies face and which aspects of the financials are most important in determining risk. It was decided that revenue and revenue growth are more important than income and income growth. For the twelfth case, ZAGG, Inc. ’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what factors contribute to the total income tax calculation for a company with international operations. The factors included in the income tax calculation were tax at federal statutory rate, state tax, non-deductible expense, domestic production activities deduction, return to provision adjustment, and increase in valuation allowance. The thirteenth case, explores and explains defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and considers related advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
