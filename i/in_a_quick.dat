5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Quick</b> Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Quick</b> Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|At 13:10, the RAF {{formation}} {{flew over}} the mud flats {{to the west of}} Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions, 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> briefing, JG 1's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack was dangerous, as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire. One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar {{returned}} on the June 15 {{episode of}} Raw {{as a fan}} favorite, being chosen by The Authority as the number one contender to Rollins' WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Battleground. On July 4, Lesnar made his first non-televised wrestling appearance for WWE since his 2012 return, defeating Kofi Kingston at The Beast in the East live event in Tokyo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> winning effort; he also delivered F-5s to Kingston's New Day stablemates Big E and Xavier Woods after the match. At Battleground on July 19, Lesnar dominated Rollins, delivering thirteen suplexes, but mid-pinfall, after performing an F-5, he was attacked by The Undertaker (who incapacitated Lesnar with a chokeslam and two Tombstone Piledrivers), thus ending the match with Lesnar winning by disqualification and Rollins retaining the championship.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma's first second-half drive {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> three-and-out. After a 58-yard punt by Tress Way {{which was}} downed at the Texas A 9-yard line. Despite the poor field position, the Aggies {{put together a}} 7-play, 91-yard drive highlighted by a 35-yard pass from Manziel to Uzoma Nwachukwu and finished with a 7-yard touchdown run by Malena. Oklahoma had another three-and-out on their next drive. Texas A subsequently established a 7-play, 89-yard drive that featured three consecutive completed passes from Manziel to Malcome Kennedy and concluded with a 30-yard rushing touchdown by Trey Williams. Oklahoma's next drive was their third consecutive three-and-out. Texas A then scored their third consecutive touchdown, this time on a 33-yard pass from Manziel to Ryan Swope making the score 34–13. Oklahoma then ran a 7-play, 31-yard drive before punting to end the quarter.|$|E
5|$|In June 1990, {{while still}} {{working for the}} PNW, Adams debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Crush, the third member of the Tag Team Champions Demolition. With Adams joining Demolition, the trio {{exercised}} the Freebird Rule allowing any combination of the three to defend the tag team title, which allowed Crush to become a Tag Team Champion. He was brought in {{as a substitute for}} Ax to defend the titles with Smash. Crush debuted at a live event on June 5, where he and Smash successfully defended the titles against The Rockers. Crush made his televised debut with Demolition on the June 23 episode of Superstars, teaming with Smash <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> victory over Paul Diamond and Joe Champ. On the July 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, Crush and Smash retained the titles against The Rockers, after Ax (who was the illegal man) clotheslined and pinned Shawn Michaels. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Demolition, with new member Crush, lost the title to The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match with Crush getting pinned for the final fall to lose the title. After SummerSlam, Demolition shifted focus from the belts to their already incipient feud with The Legion of Doom which had intensified after the latter team interfered in the title change match. Adams continued to perform as part of Demolition until after WrestleMania VII where he and Smash lost to Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kitao. After WrestleMania, the WWF decided to disband Demolition as a team.|$|E
5|$|Only six {{tropical}} cyclones {{were observed}} in the Eastern Pacific during this season, which is well below the 1949–2006 average of 13 per year. Of the six tropical cyclones, two only attained hurricane status. In addition, none of the tropical cyclones became a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Although it is an oddity for no major hurricanes to occur during a season since the satellite era began, nearly all hurricane seasons during this time period lacked a major hurricane. However, {{it is likely that}} other tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific basin in 1949 went operationally unnoticed, due to lack of modern technology such as satellite imagery. In addition to the six tropical cyclones, another tropical cyclone developed in the Eastern Pacific basin, but was included in the Atlantic basin hurricane database, rather than the Eastern Pacific. Most of the seven tropical cyclones did not differentiate in intensity during the duration, with the exception of Hurricane Six. The first two tropical cyclones of the season formed in quick succession in during mid-June, however, the months of July and August went dormant in terms of tropical cyclogenesis. The last five tropical cyclones, including the additional storm, also developed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> sequence, all of which forming from in a span of 17 days. By October 1, all tropical cyclonic activity had completely ceased.|$|E

This cost him 26 points for the green jersey which could prove vital in the end.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} for the infiltrators to mingle with the local populace and incite them to rebellion. Meanwhile, guerilla warfare would commence, {{destroying}} bridges, tunnels and highways, as well as Indian Army installations and airfields, creating conditions for an 'armed insurrection' in Kashmir. If the attempt failed, Pakistan hoped to have raised international attention to the Kashmir issue. Using the newly acquired sophisticated weapons through the American arms aid, Pakistan believed that it could achieve tactical victories <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> limited war.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the outcome}} of the battle was an {{important}} boost to Southern confidence and morale. Along with the Confederate victory at the Battle of First Bull Run (Battle of First Manassas) six weeks later, it provided what proved to be undue encouragement and confidence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> victory in the war to the Confederates. Union morale was correspondingly damaged but as events proved, the Northern public and military showed resilience and determination in the face of several early defeats.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of hostilities, a superior rifle {{was not the only}} advantage held by the Boers. The British forces in southern Africa were still composed mostly of infantry, while most of the Boers were skilled horsemen, who used their superior mobility to good advantage. Realising that continuing to engage the British in set-piece battles where British troops could utilize their superior numbers would result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> defeat, the Boers adopted tactics of hit-and-run guerilla attacks, picking off men, and disrupting supply lines.|$|E
25|$|Invasion {{over land}} is the {{straightforward}} entry of armed forces {{into an area}} using existing land connections, usually crossing borders or otherwise defined zones, such as a demilitarized zone, overwhelming defensive emplacements and structures. Although this tactic often results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> victory, troop movements are relatively slow and subject to disruption by terrain and weather. Furthermore, {{it is hard to}} conceal plans for this method of invasion, as most geopolitical entities take defensive positions in areas that are most vulnerable to the methods mentioned above.|$|E

In spite of such events the ceremony took place. Calderón entered the Congress chamber through a back door directly onto the podium, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> ceremony took the Oath of Office. Then, rather than deliver his inaugural address to Congress (the traditional follow-up to the oath taking), he left through the back immediately after the National Anthem was sung, and delivered the address in the National Auditorium, filled with supporters.|$|E
25|$|Placed {{under the}} command of the 2/32nd Battalion the {{squadron}} landed on 12 June and began patrol operations nine days later. In the following eleven days the squadron was involved in a number of contacts, suffering one man killed and two wounded, while capturing one Japanese soldier and killing 27 others. The most notable incident occurred on 26 June 1945, when, following a Japanese raid on the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit (BBCAU) area two days earlier, a section from the 2/12th contacted the group that had been responsible for the raid and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> engagement 14 Japanese were killed and two Australians wounded.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} State Department message {{stressed the}} need to publicly emphasize {{the fact that the}} coup was an expression of national will by citing the near unanimous support of key military and civilian leaders. The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an interim regime. Lodge replied affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with the assurance that the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed quietly to avoid the appearance that it was a payoff for the coup.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialised}} passes {{that can be used}} during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if they are unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as they release the ball, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed with a flick of the wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply popped up in a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.|$|E

She came third at the World's Best 10K, forming an Ethiopian sweep with Sentayehu Ejigu and Dire Tune. She claimed victory at the Daegu Marathon, running a race record time of 2:25:52 for the test course of the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. She ran a personal best of 2:24.25 hours at the 2011 Berlin Marathon, which was only enough for fourth place behind Paula Radcliffe <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> field. At the Great Ethiopian Run in November she came third behind fellow marathoner Tiki Gelana.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> {{drive to}} the Rhine, Ludwigshafen fell on 21 March, and two other {{important}} river cities, Speyer and Germersheim, were secured on 24 March, clearing the Saar Palatinate. Maintaining the rapid pace, the 12th crossed the Rhine River at Worms on 28 March over pontoon bridges, advanced toward Würzburg, and captured that city along with elements of the famed 42nd Infantry Division (United States). After assisting in the seizure of Schweinfurt, the division continued toward Nuremberg on 13 April, taking Neustadt, then shifted south toward Munich on 17 April. Elements of the 12th raced from Dinkelsbühl to the Danube, where they found the bridge at Lauingen had been blown. Moving quickly they captured the bridge at Dillingen intact before demolition men could destroy it. This bridge provided a vital artery for Allied troops flooding into southern Bavaria.|$|E
40|$|A {{field of}} {{research}} currently gaining much interest is the irradiated-pollen-induced ovule transformation in plants.

The successful demonstration of such gene transfers have been achieved in Nicotiana (Pandey, 1975; Jinks et al., 1981), Brassica (Banga et al., 1983) and Lycopersicum (Zamir, 1983) for both qualitative and metric traits...|$|R
50|$|As with AMR, CNR had {{the cost}} savings {{potential}} for manufacturers by removing analog I/O components from the motherboard. This allowed the manufacturer to only certify with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the CNR card, {{and not the}} entire motherboard. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> production-to-market time for new motherboards, and allowed mass-production of CNR cards to be used on multiple motherboards.|$|R
5000|$|Business {{acquisition}} is {{the process}} of acquiring a company to build on strengths or weaknesses of the acquiring company.
