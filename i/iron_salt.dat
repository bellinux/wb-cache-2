25|$|The {{absorption}} of dietary iron is a variable and dynamic process. The amount of iron absorbed {{compared to the}} amount ingested is typically low, but may range from 5% {{to as much as}} 35% depending on circumstances and type of iron. The efficiency with which iron is absorbed varies depending on the source. Generally the best-absorbed forms of iron come from animal products. Absorption of dietary iron in <b>iron</b> <b>salt</b> form (as in most supplements) varies somewhat according to the body’s need for iron, and is usually between 10% and 20% of iron intake. Absorption of iron from animal products, and some plant products, {{is in the form of}} heme iron, and is more efficient, allowing {{absorption of}} from 15% to 35% of intake. Heme iron in animals is from blood and heme-containing proteins in meat and mitochondria, whereas in plants, heme iron is present in mitochondria in all cells that use oxygen for respiration.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} either <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> or <b>iron</b> {{chelators}} on the biosynthesis of transferrin receptors in human erythroleukemic lines was investigated. Addition of these compounds induced a rapid and marked decrease (<b>iron</b> <b>salts)</b> or increase (<b>iron</b> chelators) {{in the level}} of transferrin receptors synthesis. Both phenomena were inhibited by actinomycin D. In contrast, the increase in the synthesis of ferritin induced in these cells by addition of <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> was not inhibited by actinomycin D. These results suggest that <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> modulate the synthesis of transferrin receptors and ferritin via different molecular mechanisms, of transcriptional and translation type, respectively...|$|R

More than a dozen sites on the southwest coast of the Bohai Bay show that the Dawenkou culture was already producing salt from underground brine more than 6,000 years ago during the Neolithic. In the same region, the late Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046) produced salt {{on a large scale}} and moved it inland in [...] "helmet shaped-vessels" [...] (kuixingqi 盔形器). These pottery jars may have served as [...] "standard units of measurement in the trade and distribution of salt". Oracle bones mention [...] "petty officers for salt" [...] (lu xiaochen 鹵小臣), suggesting that the Shang had officials who oversaw salt production and provisioning. The earliest surviving record of salt production in what is now China is a text from roughly 800 BCE which reports that the much earlier (and perhaps mythical) Xia dynasty reduced sea water for salt. There are reliable reports of the use of <b>iron</b> <b>salt</b> pans in the 5th century BCE.

40|$|This thesis {{visits the}} history of iron {{catalysis}} and its recent advances in chemistry. In the last few years, iron as a catalyst has found several applications in synthetic organic chemistry. <b>Iron</b> <b>salts</b> can be described having as low toxicity, being cheap and readily available, and also environmentally friendly. However, <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> could be contaminated by various metal impurities. For example, copper which {{play a major role}} in cross-coupling reactions (C-N, C-O, C-S bond formation) was found in certain samples. Lowering copper catalytic amount to parts-per-million is enough to obtain good yields. Purity of <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> is an important issue. Thus, <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> have been tested by atom absorption spectroscopy and the amount of different metal contaminants was determined. This thesis describes the synthesis of various heterocycles such as benzofurans, benzoxazoles, tetrazoles, and indoles using <b>iron</b> <b>salts</b> as catalysts. Their syntheses differed and various types of reactions are handled. C-O cross-coupling reaction, “Click reaction” and C-H amination reactions are described. Benzofurans and benzoxazoles were synthesized by an intramolecular C-O cross-coupling reaction using FeCl 3. Halophenylbenzamide and 2 -(2 -halophenyl) - 1 -(aryl) ethanone were used as starting material for the reaction. Reactions have been performed using TMHD as a ligand and Cs 2 CO 3 as a base. Tetrazoles were obtained by “Click chemistry” using Fe(OAc) 2. The reaction between azides and arylcyanides provided good to excellent yields. Indoles were synthesized with an intramolecular C-H amination of an azidoacrylate using Fe(OTf) 2. The metal-catalyzed Hemetsberger-Knittel reaction offered several advantages. In all cases, iron has been proven to be efficient as a catalyst and its broad applicability for various reactions has been demonstrated...|$|R
