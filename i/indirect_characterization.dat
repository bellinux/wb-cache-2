40|$|AbstractThe {{emplacement}} of nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) for groundwater remediation {{is usually}} monitored by common measurements such as pH, total iron content, and oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) by potentiometry. However, {{the interpretation of}} such measurements can be misleading because of the complex interactions between the target materials (e. g., suspensions of highly reactive and variably aggregated nanoparticles) and aquifer materials (sediments and groundwater), and multiple complications related to sampling and detection methods. This paper reviews current practice for both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>characterizations</b> of nZVI during groundwater remediation and explores prospects for improving these methods and/or refining the interpretation of these measurements. To support our recommendations, results are presented based on laboratory batch and column studies of nZVI detection using chemical, electrochemical, and geophysical methods. Chemical redox probes {{appear to be a}} promising new method for specifically detecting nZVI, based on laboratory tests. The potentiometric and voltammetric detections of iron nanoparticles, using traditional stationary disc electrodes, rotating disc electrodes, and flow-through cell disc electrodes, provide insight for interpreting ORP measurements, which are affected by solution chemistry conditions and the interactions between iron nanoparticles and the electrode surface. The geophysical methods used for characterizing ZVI during groundwater remediation are reviewed and its application for nZVI detection is assessed with results of laboratory column experiments...|$|R

This process helps us to understand the causal and symbiotic relationship between the criminal subculture and the dominant society that existed in Spain of this era. The objective {{of this study was to}} merge the social theories of criminality, developed for the most part in this century, with what we know of historical social conditions to explain the causes of the general social disorganization from which there emerged the widespread criminality and marginality depicted within the pages of these stories. I have studied the character and sources of the cohesion that existed among members of the marginalized societies, theories of learned criminality, social causes of crime including ethnic stratification and alienation. In addition, I have explored the question of honor among thieves.

As previously reported about the distribution of Nd 3 + in various oxyfluoride glass ceramics, <b>indirect</b> <b>characterization</b> techniques, for example, fluorescence analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Judd-Ofelt theory calculation, and the like, were used. The properties of samples doped with Nd 3 + ions show small changes after thermal treatment.

Nowadays, direct characterization technique energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, conventional fixed point measurement) was used to study the distribution of Nd 3 + ions in glass ceramics. Since the crystal size is smaller than the probe beam, the analyzed volume in GC always includes both crystalline and glassy phases; the results of EDS {{do not seem to be}} entirely reliable.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} of single C 60 molecules with the (1 × 2) -Pt(110) surface {{has been studied}} by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations on slab models. Molecules are observed to be frozen at room temperature and {{are found to be}} almost exclusively in the same configuration. Extensive DFT calculations show that this configuration is the global energy minimum, suggesting that adsorbed molecules have enough rototranslational freedom to escape from the numerous local minima. The adsorption energy (3. 81 eV) is the strongest ever found for C 60, and it is roughly proportional to the number of the Pt and C atoms at contact distance. Analysis of DFT results shows that the surface−adsorbate interaction is covalent in nature. A minority fraction of C 60 molecules appear to be adsorbed on surface defects.

30|$|As {{a result}} from that, due to Nd 3 + ions {{aggregating}} {{into the glass}} matrix rather than incorporating into the β-PbF 2 crystalline phase during thermal treatment, Nd 3 + ion-doped oxyfluoride glass exhibits a weak difference in fluorescence and other optical properties before and after heat treatment. On one hand, the location of Nd 3 + ions is the oxide environment with a higher coupled phonon energy, which will boost nonradiative relaxation process, compared with fluoride nanocrystal phase; on the other hand, aggregation of Nd 3 + ions can also bring some much smaller effects on fluorescence and optical properties than that of GCs doped with Nd 3 + ions into the fluoride nanocrystal phase. This is in agreement with some previous research, such as what was discussed by Rapp et al. in [3]; the fluorescence lifetimes of Nd 3 + ions were much shorter than those in glasses, and the absorption and emission spectra of Nd 3 + ions were identical both in neodymium-doped glasses and GCs, which indicated that neodymium ions {{were excluded from the}} crystalline phase of GCs and were entirely accumulated in the glass matrix. However, the most noteworthy thing is that the segregation of Nd 3 + ions in the glass matrix also leads to the same results; in other words, most of the results obtained from <b>indirect</b> <b>characterization</b> techniques cannot distinguish between Nd 3 + ions entering into the crystalline phase and locating on the interface between the crystalline and glassy phase. Therefore, unlike those <b>indirect</b> <b>characterization</b> techniques used by most of previous research, a direct and quantitative investigation method was employed to present a clear result that almost none of the Nd 3 + ions can be incorporated into the crystalline phase but reside in the glass matrix.|$|E

However, most evidence implicating VTA DA neurons in these functions is based on <b>indirect</b> electrophysiological <b>characterization,</b> rather than cytochemical identification. These physiological criteria were first established in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), but their validity in the VTA is uncertain. In the current study we found that while 88 ± 2 % of SNc neurons labelled by the neuronal marker NeuN were co-labelled for the catecholamine enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a much smaller percentage (55 ± 2 %) of VTA neurons co-expressed TH. In addition, using in vitro whole-cell recordings we found that widely accepted physiological criteria for VTA DA neurons, including the hyperpolarization-activated inwardly rectifying non-specific cation current (Ih), spike duration, and inhibition by DA D 2 receptor agonists, do not reliably predict the DA content of VTA neurons. We could not distinguish DA neurons from other VTA neurons by size, shape, input resistance, Ih size, or spontaneous firing rate. Although the absence of an Ih reliably predicted that a VTA neuron was non-dopaminergic, and Ih(−) neurons differ from Ih(+) neurons in firing rate, interspike interval (ISI) standard deviation, and ISI skew, no physiological property examined here is both sensitive and selective for DA neurons in the VTA.

However, higher order solid effect transitions involving two, three, or four nuclei were also observed with surprising intensity, although these transitions {{did not lead to}} bulk nuclear polarization—suggesting that higher order transitions are important primarily in the transfer of polarization to nuclei nearby the electron. Similar results were obtained for the SA-BDPA radical where strong electron-nuclear couplings produced splittings in the spectrum of the indirectly observed solid effect conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse and contextualize in {{aesthetic}} theory medial phenomena such as intra-, inter- and transmediality, in Jimmy Liao’s picturebook Starry Starry Night. In order to analyse intra-, inter- and transmediality, I use Jørgen Bruhn’s mediality model based on the term heteromediality. In contrast to the term intermediality, heteromediality highlights that blending is a priority condition in all media, and that the blending aspects matter. Therefore, the mediality model focuses both on relations between several media and on relations within a single medium or a single artefact. The theoretical framework in the study is mainly based on intermedial theories and picturebook theories. However, in the analysis and in the aesthetic-theoretical contextualization I also use perspectives and concepts from aesthetic theories such as the term aesthetic and the term radical aesthetic. According to my findings, the medial phenomena in Starry Starry Night can have several functions and effects. Firstly, the medial elements can clarify, contradict, complement and expand the narrative.

The quantity of the nitrogenous biopolymers in the secondary effluent demonstrated a strong correlation with the extent of the irreversible fouling in ultrafiltration (UF), while that from the surface water did not. In membrane fouling cleaning tests, certain detergent demonstrated high efficiency in removing the irreversible fouling after UF of the secondary effluent, but presented no effect in eliminating fouling caused by the surface water foulants.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. Revelation has {{received}} much attention throughout the nearly two millennia since its acceptance into the Christian canon, {{and interest in}} it is escalating as the twenty-first century approaches. Recent scholarly work {{has served as a}} corrective to the excesses of popular thought about the Apocalypse, but much more needs to be done. The theocentricity of Revelation makes imperative to seek the mysterious One Who Sits on the Throne in the center of heaven. Narratology and in particular characterization forms the foundation of this historical-critical, inductive study. Its purpose is to discover the characterization of God through the interdividual relationships between God and the non-divine characters. Interdividuality emphasizes that characters are developed in essential relationships with others. God's character as depicted in Revelation is developed through interaction with all creation. Non-divine characters receive their identity from the One Who Sits on the Throne. Their response to their Creator shapes the hearer/readers' perception of God who is both revealed and shrouded with mystery through the apocalyptic visions recorded by a Christian prophet named John. The non-divine characters of Revelation are divided into four categories: People, Satanic Forces, Heavenly Beings, and "Women". The characters of each category are examined and their characterization established from both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>characterization</b> perspectives. The characterization of God resulting from their interrelationship is then noted. The People of Revelation can be divided into two categories: those who follow Satan and those who follow God. The decision of who is Lord is {{the focal point of the}} Apocalypse. Although the narrative does not downplay the difficulty of following God the rhetoric is far from neutral. The story constantly confronts the hearer/readers with the necessity to shun the deceptive allure of the Dragon's false world and embrace the more difficult path to the New Jerusalem. God's faithfulness, love, mercy, power and holiness are revealed through relationships with and provisions for both sinner and saint. God is Creator of all and sovereign King, understanding Father and faithful Husband, merciful Judge and worthy Lord...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to discuss}} {{characterization}} of Marianne and Elinor as portrayed in Jane Austen s Sense and Sensibility and Ang Lee s film adaptation of this novel. I {{concentrate on the}} use of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>characterization</b> in the novel and the film. Comparing and contrasting characterization as used by Austen and by Lee, I discuss the impact which the transformation from text to screen has on the presentation of the two main characters. Since a visual medium cannot portray the characters {{in the same way as}} a written work, it is important to recognize the unique characteristics of each medium. Discussing the novel, I questi{{on the use of}} characterization through differentiation, as I find the use of adjectives to be unstable in that they are based on contrasts rather than individual judgement. The differentiation through categorization extends to the debate on politics and aesthetics, and the contemporary reader would interpret Marianne s sensibility and Elinor s sense as representative of two different ideologies. The contrast is further enhanced through their respective men, who contribute to a change in their character qualities. I argue that the contrast between sense and sensibility as connected to the main characters is not that easily detected in the film adaptation. Due to the lack of a narrator, the viewer misses out of much of Austen s critique of her contemporary society and also the underlying ironic comments. Lee has chosen to alter some scenes, letting more of Elinor s feelings be shown to the viewers. This is further enhanced through Marianne s piano-playing, following the romantic scenes. I argue that the alteration of Elinor s personal qualites is also connected to the alteration of age, and hence the age difference between the two sisters. All in all, I argue that the transformation from Austen s novel to Lee s film has made an impact on the characterization of the main characters, sacrificing some of Austen s ironic voice to make room for sensibility and romance...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the premise that the Bible, in addition to being a work of historical and theological significance, is also a work of literary significance. As such, the aim of the dissertation is to study the biblical figure of David as a literary character. In particular, it focuses on various techniques of characterization used to present this character to the reader. The primary texts examined in this dissertation are I Sam. 16 - I Kings 2 : 10, and Psalms 3, 7, 18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63 and 142. In addition to these biblical texts, various biblical and literary critics are consulted, and their theories and arguments applied to this investigation of David as a literary character. In investigating David as a literary character, certain aspects of characterization theory are considered: direct and <b>indirect</b> techniques of <b>characterization,</b> and primary and secondary levels of characterization. Chapter One outlines these theoretical issues of characterization, which are discussed in greater detail in the chapters that follow. Chapter Two deals with the use of contrast as a characterization technique. Chapter Three examines character interaction. Chapter Four considers the function of motif in characterization. Chapter Five relates certain psalms and poems to the narrative texts, as they, too, perform a characterizing function. Chapter Six is a chapter of conclusion. It must be emphasized that the focus of this dissertation is primarily on the techniques and strategies used to present the character David, and less on the character himself. The emphasis is on the process, rather than on the product. The dissertation is in English. All biblical quotes are given in English translation, with English transliteration of Hebrew words when necessary. Bibliography: pages 187 - 194...|$|R
40|$|The authors’ {{research}} group has undertaken {{for about a}} lustrum a comprehensive research project, focusing on both experimental characterization and numerical predictive modelling of the self-healing capacity of a broad category of cementitious composites, ranging from normal strength concrete to high performance cementitious composites reinforced with different kinds of industrial (steel) and natural fibers. In this paper reference {{will be made to}} normal strength concrete: both autogenous healing capacity has been considered and self-healing engineered through the use of crystalline admixtures. A tailored methodology has been employed to characterize the healing capacity of the investigated concrete, based on comparative evaluation of the mechanical performance measured through 3 -point bending tests. Tests have been performed to pre-crack the specimens to target values of crack opening, and after scheduled conditioning times to selected exposure conditions, including water immersion and exposure to open air. The healing capacity has been quantified by means of the definition and calculation of suitable “healing indices”, based on the recovery of the mechanical properties, including load bearing capacity, stiffness, ductility, toughness etc. and correlated to the amount of crack closure also “estimated” through suitable <b>indirect</b> methodologies. Chemical <b>characterization</b> of the healing products by means of SEM has been performed to understand the different mechanisms governing the observed phenomena and also discriminate among the different amounts of recovery of the different mechanical properties. As a further step a predictive modelling approach, based on modified microplane model, has been formulated. This incorporates the self-healing effects, in particular, the delayed cement hydration, as well as the effects of cracking on the diffusivity and the opposite repairing effect of the self-healing on the micro-plane model constitutive laws. The whole experimental and numerical investigation represents a comprehensive and solid step towards the reliable and consistent incorporation of self-healing concepts and effects into a durability-based design framework for engineering applications made of or retrofitted with self-healing concrete and cementitious composites...|$|R
40|$|The authors’ {{research}} groups have undertaken for about 5 years, a collaborative comprehensive research project, focusing on both experimental characterization and numerical predictive modelling of the self-healing {{capacity of a}} broad category of cementitious composites, ranging from normal strength concrete to high performance cementitious composites reinforced with both steel and natural fibers. Both “autogenous” healing capacity as well as self-healing triggered by engineering techniques, {{including the use of}} pre-saturated natural fibers or tailored admixtures, have been investigated. Tailored methodologies, which are based on comparative permeability analysis of cracked concrete specimens and evaluation of the mechanical performance measured through 3 - or 4 - point bending tests, have been employed to characterize the healing capacity. Healing performance was investigated on concrete specimens, previously pre-cracked to target values of crack opening, after scheduled conditioning times through selected exposure conditions (ranging from water immersion, wet and dry cycles and exposure to humid and dry climates). Particularly, the healing capacity has been quantified by means of suitably defined “healing indices”, based on the recovery of the permeability and of the mechanical properties. These indices were correlated to the amount of crack closure, measured by means of optical microscopy and/or also “estimated” through suitable <b>indirect</b> methodology. Chemical <b>characterization</b> of the healing products has also been performed. As a further step, predictive modeling approaches based on either a coupled poro-plasticity fracture-based approach and on modified micro-plane model, have been formulated. The first proposal was based on a zero-thickness interface formulation extended {{to take into account the}} self-healing effects in the maximum strength criterion and softening rules under mode I, II and mixed types of fracture. The relevant novel aspect in this interface formulation was the inclusion of a self-healing porosity-based rule in the softening rules and the continuous damage mechanisms accounted for the description of the model. The microplane-based model incorporates the self-healing effects by considering a delayed cement hydration rule, as well as accounting for the effects of cracking on the (moisture) diffusivity and the opposite repairing effect of the self-healing on the microplane constitutive laws. The investigation represents a comprehensive and solid step towards the reliable and consistent incorporation of self-healing concepts and effects into a durability-based design framework for engineering applications or retrofitted solutions with self-healing cementitious composites...|$|R
