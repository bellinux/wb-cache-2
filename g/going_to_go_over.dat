Barba scored a try when he chased down a Jonathan Wright cross over kick which was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the dead ball line before Baraba reached out his arms and placed the ball down millimetres away from the deal ball line. In Round 26, with the Bulldogs just missing out of a top eight spot, Barba scored a mercurial 4 tries in the 36-22 win against the Canberra Raiders at ANZ Stadium in retiring Bulldogs captain and second rower Andrew Ryan last ever game. Barba finished the year with him playing in 24 matches and scoring 23 tries, being the season's equal top try scorer with South Sydney Rabbitohs winger Nathan Merritt. Barba played on the interchange bench in the Prime Minister's XIII squad to play against Papua New Guinea at the end of the year.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{features}} are also {{present on the}} field. A stop zone is present just past the field behind first and third base. If the ball touches this rectangular spot, it will stop dead. However, the stop zone is small, and the ball can often bounce right over it without stopping. It can present a problem for slower runners who were hoping the ball would bounce {{all the way to}} the fence. Near the fence there are jump zones, in which a player gets an extra boost in jump height to catch a ball that is otherwise <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the fence. In the Super NES version, the jump zone is only located in front of the home run zone to try to stop a ball that is going to be a home run. In other versions, the jump zones are placed all throughout the stadium's fences. In addition, every few innings, [...] "crackers" [...] are put on the field. Crackers are landmines that when are stepped on, sends the player sky high and leaves him shaking on the field for a few seconds, delaying the player's time to make a play. Crackers do not appear in the Super NES version.|$|E

60|$|Some {{thousands}} of voters {{stayed away from}} the polls. It was ingeniously explained that their confidence in British rule had been destroyed by the Carnarvon surrender; a shopkeeper would not offend his customers {{for the sake of a}} Union Jack that no longer waved triumphant in the breeze. They were like the Arab sheikhs at Berber, who, when they found that the Egyptian pashas were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> evacuate, <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Mahdi. The conventions appointed to select the candidates were denounced as the mere creatures of Mr. Parnell, the Grand Elector. As if anything could have shown a more politic appreciation of the circumstances. There are situations that require a dictator, not to impose an opinion, but to kindle an aspiration; not to shape a demand, but to be the effective organ of opinion and demand. Now in the Irish view was one of those situations. In the last parliament twenty-six seats were held by persons designated nominal home rulers; in the new parliament, not one. Every new nationalist member pledged himself to resign whenever the parliamentary party should call upon him. Such an instrument grasped in a hand of iron was indispensable, first to compel the British government to listen, and second, to satisfy any British government disposed to listen, that in dealing with Mr. Parnell they were dealing with nationalist Ireland, and with a statesman who had the power to make his engagements good. You need greater qualities, said Cardinal De Retz, to be a good party leader than to be emperor of the universe. Ireland is not that portion of the universe in which this is least true.|$|R

Then Judd Travers (Scott Wilson) {{shows up at the}} Preston home with dead squirrels as a present for Marty and his family for helping him after his truck accident in the second film. A fearful Shiloh runs into the kitchen since he is still scared of Judd. Marty's sister, Becky (Liberty Smith), embarrasses her mother, Louise (Ann Dowd), when she calls Judd the meanest man since Judd says he has eaten dead squirrels all his life. Soon, Marty hears from his two best friends, David Howard (Jordan Garrett) and Samantha Wallace (Taylor Momsen), that after a fist fight, a drunken Judd has been charged with murder. Marty brings Judd some squirrel stew and offers to help Judd, believing that he hasn't committed murder. Soon after, when Marty is helping Judd build a fence for his hunting dogs, Judd accidentally steps on one of his dog's paws. The dog starts attacking Judd, biting his good leg. Judd doesn't show any fear, grabbing the dog and swinging him at a fence. Afterwards, when Dara Lynn (Kyle Chavarria), another of Marty's sisters, falls into a lake, Marty jumps in to save her. Shiloh jumps in to help but gets caught in the current, which leads toward Miller Falls. Marty goes back into the lake to save Shiloh but gets caught in a branch. Seeing this, Judd jumps off a cliff into the lake to free Marty. Marty explains to Judd that Shiloh is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the waterfall unless he saves him. Judd saves Shiloh and begins a friendship with Marty and Shiloh. The film ends with Marty saying, [...] "If you open your heart, anything is possible." ...|$|E

40|$|In this lecture we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> {{some of the}} {{foundational}} theories of en-dogenous technological growth. These came around in earnest starting in the early nineties with Romer (1990) and Aghion and Howitt (1992), as well as Grossman and Helpman (1991), which provides an interesting synthesis of the two. A little later on Jones (1995) provides an insightful critique to this strand of literature, {{in addition to a}} bit of perspective. 1 Aggregate Framework How might we begin to think about technological growth in an economy? In the simplest representation, we can imagine there is an aggregate production for ideas and that this concept of ideas maps directly into what we’ve been discussing as total factor productivity (A). The rate of change of the stock ideas is then a function of the current stock of ideas and the amount of effort put into producing new ideas through, for example through research. We’ll think of this in terms of labor, but you could also imagine capital playing an important role. Thus we have A ̇ = G(A,R) for some function G. This representation is a bit abstract, so we’ll assume a fairly flexible functional form A ̇ = GAφRη 1 This captures the notion that as the state of knowledge advances, coming up with new and useful ideas becomes harder. Given this specification, the growth rate of ideas, which should have a strong bearing on the overall growth rate of the economy, is then gA...|$|E

Yet, the idea of mutual relationships, the best outcome for the client to function in his/her family and his/her society, a just, fair and supportive society in which to live are concepts as old as social work itself and still of importance today. Recovery, {{well-being and}} social justice are emerging issues for each generation of people with mental health concerns. The issues of those who suffer mental illness are about their own functioning, their relationships with loved ones and their community {{and their ability to}} gain some control over what may often be a fairly chaotic life. Workers who can ensure that the sufferers can have hope, meaning and purpose as they live their life are what they want. Not all emerging issues are new. In many ways, any discussion of emerging issues for social work practice is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> old ground. The issues that have been discussed in the past are still prevalent. For example, 'Mental health problems account for {{a large proportion of the}} disease burden among young people in all societies' (UNICEF 2011 : 27) and 'health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental disorders; as a consequence, the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is large all over the world' (WHO 2013 : 5). The incidence of mental health issues and an inadequate response have been, are, and will continue to be emerging issues for social work practice.
