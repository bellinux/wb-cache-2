2500|$|P. colobopterus colonies have {{multiple}} queens and demonstrate a unique dominance hierarchy. New queens are produced periodically {{as part of}} a strategy called cyclical oligogyny. The patterns of conflict and relatedness in this wasp can call be traced back to this system of cyclical oligogyny. Queen number varies, <b>fluctuating</b> <b>from</b> high to low {{over the course of a}} colony's lifecycle. When queens age and the number of queens has been reduced to only one or two wasps, new queens will be produced by the colony. [...] This increases the relatedness of the colony as a whole by increasing the relatedness between the queens. In some cases, too many females will attempt to be new queens and workers will then suppress some new queens. Since there are no morphological differences between queens and workers, any workers may vie with each other for the position of queen.|$|E
