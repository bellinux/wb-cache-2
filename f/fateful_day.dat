Her parents and the other tenants of her home were forced to stand for a roll call in which Pesendorfer, the Nazi authority in their house, told the tenants that many Russian convicts had escaped from the nearby concentration camp. He explained that it was their duty to Germany to find and kill each one of these convicts. Hilde, being a young girl, is told to stay at the house.

500|$|Hannibal had {{defeated}} {{the equivalent of}} eight consular armies (16 legions plus {{an equal number of}} allies). Within just three campaign seasons (20 months), Rome had lost one-fifth (150,000) of the entire population of male citizens over 17 years of age. Furthermore, the morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. After Cannae, the Hellenistic southern provinces of Arpi, Salapia, Herdonia, Uzentum, including the cities of Capua and Tarentum (two of the largest city-states in Italy) revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal. As Livy noted, [...] "How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome's allies; before that <b>fateful</b> <b>day,</b> their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver {{for the simple reason that}} they despaired of Roman power." [...] In the same year the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new King Hieronymus of Syracuse, the only independent left in Sicily.|$|E

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed King Hieronymus of Syracuse, and Tarentum also came over to him around that time. Hannibal now had the resources and personnel needed to launch a successful attack on the City of Rome. However, he was uncertain of the feasibility of such an attack and spent a great deal of time pondering it. While he hesitated, the Romans were able to regroup, and the opportunity was lost. The Romans looked back on Hannibal's indecision as what saved Rome from certain defeat. Hannibal sent a delegation to Rome to negotiate a peace and another one offering to release his Roman prisoners of war for ransom, but Rome rejected all offers.|$|E

5000|$|In 1931, at {{the request}} of the British Mandate, Chief Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook {{appointed}} Reb Aryeh Levin the official Jewish Prison Chaplain, a position he informally had filled since 1927. He accepted on the condition that he receive no pay. He would walk from his home in Nachlaot to visit the Jewish prisoners held in the Russian Compound on charges of arms possession or smuggling. Most of the prisoners were members of the Palmach, Haganah, Irgun or Lehi. Levin prayed with the prisoners and conveyed messages to their families. Room 29 in the Central Prison in Jerusalem (now the Museum of the Underground Prisoners), was used as a synagogue on Shabbat and holidays. The inmates were captivated by the rabbi's warmth and sincerity, and the honor and respect with which he treated them. Mattityahu Shmuelevitz, whose death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, wrote in a letter to a friend: “Yet there is one person in particular to whom I remain grateful first and foremost; a dear, precious Jew about whom you told me nothing; but it was he who stormed heaven and earth for me; and more important — it was he who brought me closer to my Maker in those <b>fateful</b> <b>days...</b> He left and we remained in the prison.

Nurse Hopkins knows Mary's true parents because of a letter from her sister Eliza some years earlier. When Hopkins encouraged Mary Gerrard to write a will, Mary named as beneficiary the woman whom she supposes to be her aunt, Mary Riley, the sister of Eliza Gerrard, in New Zealand. Mary Riley's married name is Mary Draper. Mary Draper of New Zealand it turns out is Nurse Hopkins in England, as two people from New Zealand who knew Mary Draper both confirm in court.

2500|$|When the [...] "Army of the North" [...] {{attacked}} {{the forces of}} the Seventh Coalition in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Kellermann, with Lhéritier's division was placed under the command of Marshal Michel Ney. On 16 June, Ney faced a massed Allied force at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Of Lhéritier's 11th cavalry division, only Guiton's cuirassier brigade was present and available for action. As Ney's situation became increasingly desperate, the Marshal ordered Kellermann to take his cuirassiers in a frontal charge against the enemy. The charge was very well handled and, despite the difficult terrain and the large numbers of the enemy, it did much to relieve the pressure on the French forces. At first, it broke Hugh Halkett's forces, then Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel's German infantry, eventually reaching the crucial Quatre Bras crossroads. However, this breakthrough could not be exploited, as no other units had been sent in immediate support of the heavy cavalry. The cuirassiers endured some murderous close-range musketry before finally turning and retreating at a trot, a manoeuvre during which Kellermann had his horse shot under him and barely escaped capture. Two days later, the entire III Corps was reunited under Kellermann's command and was available for action at the Battle of Waterloo. Lhéritier's division was committed towards 17:30, during the afternoon attacks, as Marshal Ney sent in his cavalry in mass against the Allied centre. A series of charges ensued, but such a cavalry attack, without proper infantry or artillery support was always set to fail on an uneven battlefield such as the one at Waterloo and against an infantry that {{had plenty of time to}} form protective squares. Despite the heroism and self-sacrifice of the French cavalry – Lhéritier's division alone lost six officers dead, three mortally wounded and forty wounded – the battle was lost. During this <b>fateful</b> <b>day,</b> Baron Lhéritier received a bullet wound to the right shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually in 1950, he was {{appointed}} {{assistant director of the}} Political Department in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and continued to work in the Foreign Service over the next eight years. In 1958 the union of Egypt and Syria was led by Gamal Abdel Nasser and the United Arab Republic was founded. Pachachi had been a vocal supporter of Nasser, particularly during the Suez War in 1956 although official Iraqi government policy at the time was aligned with the British against him. On his attraction to the Egyptian leader he wrote in his memoir [...] "My feelings about Egypt and Jamal Abdul Nasser had deep-rooted origins. In the first place I shared my father's belief that Egypt was the most important Arab country and that Iraq should at all times should have the best relations with her. My father, in and out of power, consistently called for the closest ties with Egypt. It cost him his political career in 1950. He remained very close to Abdul Nasser and supported him during the <b>fateful</b> <b>days</b> of the Suez War. Being a fervent Arab nationalist, I was naturally attracted by Nasser's call for Arab unity, and during the Suez crisis I supported him without reservation. I admired Abdul Nasser because he personified more than anyone, the idea or Arab unity and seemed the only leader capable of achieving it." [...] It was for this reason he was not trusted by Prime Minister Nuri as-Said and deemed to be a Nasserist. On 13 July 1958 he was dismissed and removed from the Iraqi Foreign Service due to his pro-Nasserite positions.|$|R

40|$|It {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} battles in American history and its legend still lives on today. The battle of Gettysburg has long captured the imagination of not only historians but the general public as well. Each year millions of people flock to the Gettysburg National Military Park to see where the battle took place. When one thinks of the Civil War, just about everybody will think of the battle of Gettysburg. Many people think that the death of the Confederacy resulted in those three <b>fateful</b> <b>days</b> in July. However, since Gettysburg is such a talked about and analyzed battle, many different opinions emerge from the battle. Historians constantly come out with new books on Gettysburg that contain new interpretations of the battle. Historians sometimes point to the same things that caused the outcome of the battle or sometimes they disagree with each other. Therefore, the basis of this paper is to look at all of these agreements and differences in historical opinion on Gettysburg. A good place to begin reviewing the historiography of Gettysburg is Douglas Freeman’s R. E. Lee: A Biography. Famous as Lee’s chief biographer, Freeman persists in wanting to make Lee a saint at the expense of Major General James Longstreet. This happens because he uses many early biased sources against Longstreet. Therefore, one has to be careful when reading the book. Glenn Tucker’s High Tide At Gettysburg: the Pennsylvania Campaign {{was one of the}} first books on Gettysburg that questioned the early biased sources and placed some blame on General Robert E. Lee. Carol Reardon’s Picketts’s Charge in Memory and History focuses mainly on Pickett’s charge. She carefully analyzes how it has been portrayed in history books. William Piston’s Lee’...|$|R
