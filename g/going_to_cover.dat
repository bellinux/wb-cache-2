Lewis co-wrote the song with Mike Elizondo, James Fauntleroy, Justin Timberlake and Robin Tadross. It was produced by The Y's and co-produced by Elizondo. Lewis and Timberlake carried out the vocal production.

It was reported that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> Dolly Parton's song [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a duet, however they worked together on new songs for Echo instead, and [...] "Don't Let Me Down" [...] was created. Lewis revealed that her cover of [...] "Run" [...] inspired Timberlake.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover,</b> we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{next season}} Kennedy's {{juvenile}} team {{made it to}} the finals. During the season, Kennedy had scored seven goals in one game and six in another and it was efforts such as those which were attracting the attention of professional hockey people. The first team to approach Kennedy was the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, although for Kennedy [...] "It was a boyhood dream to play for Toronto." [...] Dinty Moore, also of Port Colborne, brought Kennedy to the attention Montreal General Manager Tommy Gorman and Kennedy was put on their negotiation list. In the fall of 1942, Montreal contacted the sixteen-year-old about joining the Canadiens. Kennedy's mother was wary of a career in hockey for her son as he was also headed towards studying business at the University of Western Ontario. She agreed to let her son attend the training camp when Montreal scout Dinty Moore assured her Ted was going to receive a good education at Montreal's prestigious Lower Canada College and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the cost. Upon arriving in Montreal, foreshadowing future troubles, Kennedy discovered there was no one from the Canadiens to greet him at the train. The teenager was left to his own devices to check into a hotel and make his way around the new city. Then later, as he tried to combine hockey and school, he became concerned his studies were suffering and approached Canadien management to ask if they could find him accommodation closer to the school. He felt they were unresponsive and he soon became disillusioned with the experience in Montreal. After three weeks in Montreal he was feeling homesick and upon completing spring training with the Montreal Royals, he returned to Port Colborne in mid-November.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with SheWired.com, Michael K {{was asked to}} name {{the reason for the}} blog's success. He said, [...] "I don't know. I never promoted it. I never advertised. That was never my goal. I think it was that my friends would read it and they'd send it to their friends. I used to post personal pictures and stuff because I saw it as both a personal blog and a blog about just things that I like. So that's when I decided I wasn't going to make it personal. I was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> this and focus on that." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{subsequent}} {{negotiations over}} {{the latter part}} of 1999, Shaik and Thétard agreed to a bribe amount of R1 million (US$154,000), and at a meeting in March 2000, Thétard, Shaik, and Zuma finalised the exchange. At this point, Zuma was in desperate need for money as the bribe was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the continued construction of his Nkandla development, yet Thétard has not transferred any money to Shaik thus far. Shaik demanded an immediate response to this “extremely delicate matter" [...] from Thétard, but Thétard failed to respond and by 19 October, Shaik in his role as Zuma’s financial advisor, attempted to stop all construction on Nkandla, prompting Zuma to tell his contractors to ignore Shaik’s orders. Zuma wrote a cheque for R1 million to his contractors, the payment of which was stopped by Shaik.|$|E

50|$|Years after, Sunburst has officially collapsed, {{leaving a}} {{depressed}} Soliven. Soon after, as eager as Soliven could be, {{he and his}} fellow accolades put up the Philippines first ever full-color magazine, Manila Magazine, which he would be a part of from 1980-1984. This would serve as a connection to where Sunburst has left off. He had a monthly column in Manila Magazine entitled “In This Corner”, where he would write his tempered opinions on Marcos. He was also able to travel out of the country for the first time after his, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Singapore <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the inauguration of the new Changi Airport.|$|R

"I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> {{myself in}} the hay if you fellows {{are going to stay}} here any length of time," [...] cried Andy, and in a playful mood he and his twin made a dash for what looked to be a large {{quantity}} of hay at one side of the barn. Both burrowed down in this, and then Randy set up a cry of surprise.|$|E
50|$|The fourth line, Metrobus Cabildo, {{opened in}} June 2015 and connects Congreso de Tucumán (the {{terminus}} of Line D of the Buenos Aires Underground) with Vicente López in Greater Buenos Aires. This segment was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>covered</b> by Line D in its extension to {{the borders of}} the city proper, however the creation of this Metrobus means the line's extension will be unlikely.|$|R

5000|$|The preview track, [...] "The Eye", {{for which}} a video was {{released}} prior to the album, is a front-porch acoustic. The review from NPR Music said, [...] " [...] 'The Eye' is exactly what it proclaims itself to be: a quiet breath {{in the midst of}} the album's glorious storm. Rooted in Carlile's love of both classic country and California pop, the song is the kind many other artists are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>cover.</b> It will be hard to top the original, though; it so eloquently highlights the telepathic connection Carlile shares with her longtime bandmates. A favorite on recent tours, 'The Eye' is destined to become a centerpiece in Carlile's catalog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, very well," [...] said Albert. The {{street in}} which they were {{standing}} was desolate, and the young man was able to assume a look of decided hostility without encountering any other eyes than those of his rival. [...] "If you have anything to say to me, sir, I am quite prepared to listen to you--to listen to you, and to answer you. I have heard your name mentioned by Miss Snow." [...] And Albert Fitzallen stood his ground as though he were at once <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> himself with his pistol arm.|$|E

'Now {{the clerk}} was the parson's groom and {{gardener}} and jineral manager, {{and had just}} got back to {{his work in the}} garden when he, too, saw the hunting man pass, and presently saw lots more of 'em, noblemen and gentry, and then he saw the hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the whipper-in, and I don't know who besides. The clerk loved <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> as frantical as the pa'son, so much so that whenever he saw or heard the pack he could no more rule his feelings than if they were the winds of heaven. He might be bedding, or he might be sowing--all was forgot. So he throws down his spade and rushes in to the pa'son, who was by this time as frantical to go as he.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, that's what I {{am going}} to do, too,' said the bad little pumpkin vine, 'all but the pies; but I'm {{not going to stay}} here to do it. I'm going to that fence over there, where the morning-glories were last summer, and I'm going to show them what a pumpkin-glory is like. I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> myself with {{blossoms}}; and blossoms that won't shut up, either, when the sun comes out, but 'll stay open, as if they hadn't anything to be ashamed of, and that won't drop off the first day, either. I noticed those morning-glories all last summer, when I was nothing but one of the blossoms myself, and I just made up my mind that as soon as ever I got to be a vine, I would show them a thing or two. Maybe I can't be a morning-glory, but I can be a pumpkin-glory, and I guess that's glory enough.' ...|$|E
