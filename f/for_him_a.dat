On his birth he was baptized.|$|R

5|$|By April 1834 {{the opera}} had {{received}} over 100 performances in Paris. Nourrit sang {{the role of}} Robert until 1837, when he was replaced as premier tenor at the Opéra by Gilbert Duprez, whom, however, Meyerbeer did not like in the role; nor did he approve of an alternative, Lafont. However, he {{was impressed by the}} newcomer Mario (Cavaliere Giovanni Matteo di Candia), and wrote <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> new aria for Robert which was performed at his debut in the revival of the opera on 30 November 1838. Mario's debut was the launch of his very successful career. Others singing in the 1838 revival included Julie Dorus-Gras (Alice), Prosper Dérivis (Bertram) and François Wartel (Raimbaut). By Meyerbeer's death in 1864 the opera had been performed over 470 times in Paris alone.|$|E

Using the information about Alexei as leverage against Decker, Chuck delivers the antidote.|$|E
5|$|Houtteman {{remained}} a reliever during the 1956 Cleveland Indians season. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the Chicago White Sox {{were willing to}} trade outfielder Jim Rivera <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again {{becoming part of the}} White Sox along with George Strickland was also scrapped at the last second. Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances on the mound, earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.|$|E

He also traveled back to the South, spending time in South Carolina and in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son's birth as an inspirational source and creative muse <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album's liner notes, which were co-written by D'Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo, D'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was in transition.|$|E

5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would {{aid in the}} transport and export of cash crops. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.|$|E
5|$|These events trouble Mac Da Thó greatly, {{such that}} he goes three days without food, drink or sleep. However, his wife devises <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> plan – {{that he should}} give the dog to both parties and let them fight for it. Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside in private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their people should come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E

Though he recollected his immediate surroundings from his childhood explorations, he eventually passed into less familiar territory; he later told his supporters that he fell more than 200 times during his escape. Communicating with a network of activists via a cell phone, he reached a pre-determined rendezvous point where He Peirong, an English teacher and activist, was waiting <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> chain of human rights activists then escorted him to Beijing. Several of the activists reported to be involved were detained or disappeared in the days following the announcement of Chen's escape.|$|E
