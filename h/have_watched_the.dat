In Canada, the premiere saw 2.706 million viewers, the third highest viewership for the week on the network. In the United Kingdom, the episode debuted as the highest rated drama launch of the year, averaging 3.23 million viewers including the +1 channel and recordings viewed the same night, a share of 14.8 percent of people watching TV in the UK at the time. The premiere in Australia was watched by 1.3 million viewers, the top show of the night. In New Zealand, the episode premiered to 326,790 viewers, the fourth highest show of the night, and the most watched show on TV2. By the time the full season {{was picked up by}} ABC it ranked as the number one new series of the 2013–14 television season among adults 18–49.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Al-Manar, a {{media network}} {{affiliated}} with Hezbollah, aired a drama series, The Diaspora, which observers allege {{is based on}} historical antisemitic allegations.

25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone will step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E

25|$|It {{is highly}} likely that Eggestein even {{travelled}} to Mainz {{himself in the}} 1450s to learn the art of book printing from Gutenberg. When this was and how long the stay lasted cannot be definitely resolved, due to sketchy source materials. Ferdinand Geldner holds the view that Eggestein was already in Mainz in 1454 and that might be why he lost the office of Siegelbewahrer in Strasbourg in 1455. If this were the case, then he could <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> printing of the 42-line-per-page Gutenberg Bible firsthand. Geldner further suspects that Heinrich Eggestein actively participated in the typesetting and printing of the Türkenkalender, which was completed {{in the middle of}} December in 1454. He did not give up his Strasbourg citizen's rights until August 1457, however. If he had left Alsace so late, he would have admittedly arrived in Mainz after the break between Gutenberg and Johann Fust.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has {{designated}} its official entry, English-subtitled copies of all submitted films are {{shipped to the}} Academy, where they are screened by the Foreign Language Film Award Committee(s), whose members select by secret ballot the five official nominations. Final voting for the winner is restricted to active and life Academy members who have attended exhibitions of all five nominated films. Members who <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> Foreign Language Film entries only on videocassette or DVD are ineligible to vote. These procedures were slightly modified for the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, with the Academy deciding to institute a two-stage process in determining the nominees: {{for the first time}} in the history of the award, a nine-film shortlist was published one week before the official nominations announcement. In the meantime, a smaller thirty-member committee which included ten New York City-based Academy members was formed, and spent three days viewing the shortlisted films before choosing the five official nominees. Residents of the city hosting the country's second largest film industry were thus allowed to participate for the first time ever in the selection process for the Foreign Language Film Award nominees.|$|E
500|$|The tournament finale was {{the most}} watched {{television}} event in Canadian history at the time.

[...] The team that represented Canada is still considered one of the greatest national teams to ever represent the nation in a hockey tournament. For many players, winning the Canada Cup was the highlight of their careers. [...] Bobby Orr and Lanny McDonald both rated winning this tournament ahead of winning the Stanley Cup.|$|E

500|$|The Wrestling Observer Newsletter {{reported}} that about 200 ticket holders who had purchased tickets {{were not allowed}} in because Full Sail University had oversold the 400-seat theater.

[...] "Some had the Roku box problems that have plagued the network from the start", but most said their feed cut out at the Breeze-Woods match. WWE later revealed that the initial number of WWE Network subscribers by April 1 was 495,000, which would be the maximum number of people who could <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> show.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the event, WWE {{revealed}} that the initial number of WWE Network subscribers was 667,287, therefore that was {{the maximum number of}} people who could <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> event on the WWE Network. Bandwidth optimizing company Qwilt reported that Wrestlemania XXX led to WWE accounting for 6.5% of all online video traffic in North America on that day, ranking third below Netflix and YouTube but above Amazon, Hulu, and HBO. Wrestlemania XXX generated 20 times more traffic for the WWE Network than what the Network would have gained on a regular day at the time. On April 15, WWE announced [...] "nearly 400,000 domestic PPV buys" [...] for the event, while the previous year's WrestleMania (before the existence of the WWE Network) had earned 1,039,000 buys. In June 2014, WWE reported 690,000 total buys from both domestic and international sources.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} particularly {{criticized the}} scene where Noah gives Claire a printed book {{that is supposed to}} be a first edition copy of the [...] Iliad, a work written nearly 3,000 years ago in Greece. Amy Heidt, writing for Slate, noted that while a first English edition could have been a possible explanation, such works were from the 16th and 17th centuries, and describes the book Noah gives Claire as [...] "A pristine hardcover that looks like those Jane Austen Penguin Classics they sell at Urban Outfitters." [...] Following the film's release, the term [...] "The Iliad, first edition" [...] became the top search term on the online book marketplace AbeBooks. Richard Davis, a spokesman for the website, said: [...] "It appears people who <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> film are trying to identify the actual edition handed to Lopez, which has dark yellow and blue boards. I cannot match the book seen in the movie to anything currently for sale on AbeBooks." ...|$|E

In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans <b>had</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> series as children.

500|$|The 25 October 2009 concert {{from the}} Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, U2's {{penultimate}} {{show of the}} year, was simultaneously broadcast live on YouTube and filmed for a future video release. Directed by Tom Krueger, the shoot used 27high definition cameras, and it {{marked the first time}} since 1983's [...] that the band intentionally filmed over a single night—in contrast to recording multiple shows. It was the first time a concert was streamed live on YouTube, and nearly 10million people from 188countries were reported to <b>have</b> <b>watched.</b> <b>The</b> feed was initially set to be restricted to 16 countries but was later made available worldwide. The show's attendance reached 97,014 people, breaking the US record for single concert attendance for one headline act, a mark U2 previously held. In June 2010, the show was released to home video as U2360° at the Rose Bowl on DVD and Blu-ray, receiving positive reviews from critics.|$|E

Giant of Television Without Pity was pleased with the episode, and awarded it an [...] "A" [...] grade, the first for the series since [...] "Goodbye, Michael" [...] almost two seasons ago. Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote that the episode [...] "was full of emotional moments that seemed like love letters to the fans who <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> show since the pilot."

The earliest written record of magnification {{dates back to the}} 1st century AD, when Seneca the Younger, a tutor of Emperor Nero, wrote: [...] "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water".

2500|$|Roughly 9.1 {{million people}} were {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> Democratic convention {{on the night of}} the speech, ratings which were described as [...] "tepid" [...] by Variety, as it only amounted to [...] "about half the audience tuning into regularly scheduled summer programming the week before", and was less than the 10.3 million people who tuned into the second night of the 2000 DNC. [...] However, neither ABC, CBS, nor NBC provided any coverage of the convention that night (some Chicago affiliates did broadcast Obama's speech), leading to criticism from some columnists. [...] But with major networks not covering the evening's events, other stations received greater viewership, including 3 million viewers for PBS, followed by CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a {{film version}} of The Mikado that closely {{reflected}} their traditional staging, {{although there are some}} minor cuts. [...] It was filmed on enlarged stage sets rather than on location, much like the 1965 Laurence Olivier Othello, and was directed by the same director, Stuart Burge. [...] It stars John Reed, Kenneth Sandford, Valerie Masterson, Philip Potter, Donald Adams, Christene Palmer and Peggy Ann Jones and was conducted by Isidore Godfrey. The New York Times criticised the filming technique and the orchestra and noted, [...] "Knowing how fine this cast can be in its proper medium, one regrets the impression this Mikado will make on those not fortunate enough to <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> company in the flesh. [...] The cameras have captured everything about the company's acting except its magic." ...|$|E

The next airing was [...] "Wolff Brother's Cry Wolff" [...] which garnered a sum of 3.8 million viewers; the episode gave the channel its most favorable ratings in seven years.
