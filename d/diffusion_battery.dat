The inversion spreadsheet included particle entry losses, theoretical penetrations across screens, the detection efficiency of the CPC, and constraints so the spreadsheet solved to values within the pDB range. Size distribution parameters (NMD, GSD, and number concentration) measured with the pDB+CPC with inversion spreadsheet were within 25 % of those measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) for 5 of 12 polydisperse combustion aerosols. For three tests conducted with propylene torch exhaust, the pDB+CPC with inversion spreadsheet successfully identified that the NMD was smaller than the constraint value of 16 nm. The ratio of the nanoparticle portion of the aerosol compared to the reference (R nano) was calculated to determine the ability of pDB+CPC with inversion spreadsheet to measure the nanoparticle portion of the aerosols.

Both the mainstream and sidestream portions of the smoke aerosol are investigated. Unattached radon progeny are very mobile and, {{in the presence of}} aerosols, readily attach to the particle surfaces. In this study, an aerosol chamber is used to contain the radon gas, progeny and aerosol mixture while allowing the attachment process to occur.

40|$|This work strived to {{increase}} knowledge of assessing airborne nanoparticles {{in the workplace}} by characterizing nanoparticle concentrations in a workplace using direct-reading instruments, evaluating a DC 2000 CE diffusion charger, {{and the creation of}} a personal <b>diffusion</b> <b>battery</b> (pDB). Direct-reading instruments were used with aerosol mapping and task monitoring to evaluate airborne nanoparticle concentrations in an apparel company that produces waterproof jackets composed of polytetrafluoroethylene membrane laminated fabric. Jacket production required that sewn seams be sealed with waterproof tape applied with hot air (600 °C). Particle number concentrations were greater in the sewing and sealing areas than the office area while respirable mass was negligible throughout the facility. The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). The effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations was poor. These measurements support the idea that work places were hot processes are conducted may have substantially greater concentrations of airborne nanoparticles than background measurements even with control measures in place. Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate a commercially available diffusion charger, the DC 2000 CE, that measures nanoparticle surface area concentration. The surface area concentrations of unimodal and multimodal polydispersed aerosols measured by the DC 2000 CE were less than the surface area concentrations measured by the reference instruments. The differences in results were attributed to a difference of measuring active versus geometric surface area concentration and the design of the DC 2000 CE. The maximum measurable active surface area concentration (2, 500 mm 2 m- 3) was found to be greater than the manufacturer stated maximum (1000 mm 2 m- 3). Moving or vibrating a DC 2000 CE while taking measurements can cause the appearance of increased surface area concentration results.

To understand {{the efficacy of}} this material in battery design, we seek to understand the adsorption of lithium. In graphitic carbon, lithium motion is governed by the arrangement of carbon rings: while 6 -member rings block lithium diffusion through layers of graphene, higher valence rings permit it. Our approach turns to topological analysis of the distance function, constructing explicit triangulations to represent carbon rings, classifying them as blocking (blue) or non-blocking (pink) (middle left). We use our representation to quantify both the portions of the nanosphere that are accessible from the exterior (dark pink) (middle right), as well as studying the effects of defects on the diffusion distance needed to saturate the nanosphere (right). Abstract — Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are commonly used for simulating the synthesis and ion <b>diffusion</b> of <b>battery</b> materials. A good battery anode material is determined by its capacity to store ion or other diffusers. However, modeling of ion diffusion dynamics and transport properties at large length and long time scales would be impossible with current MD codes. To analyze the fundamental properties of these materials, therefore, we turn to geometric and topological analysis of their structure. In this paper, we apply a novel technique inspired by discrete Morse theory to the Delaunay triangulation of the simulated geometry of a thermally annealed carbon nanosphere. We utilize our computed structures to drive further geometric analysis to extract the interstitial diffusion structure as a single mesh. Our results provide {{a new approach to}} analyze the geometry of the simulated carbon nanosphere, and new insights into the role of carbon defect size and distribution in determining the charge capacity and charge dynamics of these carbon based battery materials.

40|$|An {{automated}} function {{control unit}} {{was developed to}} regularly check the ambient particle number concentration derived from a mobility particle size spectrometer {{as well as its}} zero-point behaviour. The function control allows unattended quality assurance experiments at remote air quality monitoring or research stations under field conditions. The automated function control also has the advantage of being able to get a faster system stability response than the recommended on-site comparisons with reference instruments. The method is based on a comparison of the total particle number concentration measured by a mobility particle size spectrometer and a condensation particle counter while removing diffusive particles smaller than 20 nm in diameter. In practice, the small particles are removed by a set of diffusion screens, as traditionally used in a <b>diffusion</b> <b>battery.</b> Another feature of the automated function control is to check the zero-point behaviour of the ambient aerosol passing through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The performance of the function control is illustrated {{with the aid of a}} 1 -year data set recorded at Annaberg-Buchholz, a station in the Saxon air quality monitoring network. During the period of concern, the total particle number concentration derived from the mobility particle size spectrometer slightly overestimated the particle number concentration recorded by the condensation particle counter by 2 % (grand average). Based on our first year of experience with the function control, we developed tolerance criteria that allow a performance evaluation of a tested mobility particle size spectrometer with respect to the total particle number concentration. We conclude that the automated function control enhances the quality and reliability of unattended long-term particle number size distribution measurements. This will have beneficial effects for intercomparison studies involving different measurement sites, and help provide a higher data accuracy for cohort health and climate research studies...|$|E
40|$|Up to a {{few years}} ago, muon spin rotation/relaxation (Î¼SR [muonSR]) {{was used as a}} {{complementary}} technique in the study of magnetic intermetallic materials. Application of Î¼SR [muonSR], however, covers a much wider range of scientific disciplines. A shift in scientific interest within the department away from metallic magnets, focused attention on possible alternative deployment of Î¼SR [muonSR] within other scientific domains in the department. Exploratory studies provided more insight into these applications and their possibilities to obtain unique and/or complementary information on properties of interest. Consequently, the compounds studied here were selected from three existing research projects. Firstly we have monitored the lithium <b>diffusion</b> in the <b>battery</b> cathode material Lix[Mn 1 -yLiy]O 4. Secondly, in order to obtain information on the dynamics of metallocenes encapsulated in zeolite supercages, both the dynamics of muonated ferrocene molecules and the encapsulated version have been studied. Finally, we made an attempt to find additional evidence for small magnetic moments on nano scale palladium clusters. The Î¼SR [muonSR] techniques used will be introduced, together with the corresponding objectives. The results are presented and discussed in thesis entitled "Diffusion, reorientation and small magnetic fields,studied by Î¼SR [muonSR]". Interfaculty Reactor Institut...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations are {{a powerful}} tool to study <b>diffusion</b> processes in <b>battery</b> electrolyte and electrode materials. From a single molecular dynamics simulation many properties relevant to diffusion can be obtained, including the diffusion path, attempt frequency, activation energies, and collective diffusion processes. These detailed diffusion properties provide {{a thorough understanding of}} diffusion in solid electrolytes, and provides direction for the design of improved solid electrolyte materials. Here a thorough analysis methodology is developed, and applied to DFT MD simulations of Li-ion diffusion in β-Li 3 PS 4. The methodology presented is generally applicable to crystalline materials and facilitates the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. The code used for the analysis is freely available at: [URL] The results on β-Li 3 PS 4 demonstrate that jumps between bc-planes limit the conductivity of this important class of solid electrolyte materials. The simulations indicate that by adding Li-interstitials or Li-vacancies the rate limiting jump process can be accelerated significantly, which induces three dimensional diffusion, resulting in an increased Li-ion diffusivity. Li-vacancies can be introduced through Br-doping, which is predicted to result in an order of magnitude larger Li-ion conductivity in β-Li 3 PS 4. Furthermore, the present simulations rationalise the improved Li-ion diffusivity upon O-doping through the creation of local Li-interstitials...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinico-pathological {{distinction}} of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) {{can be challenging}} at clinic presentation. In particular, cross-sectional neuroimaging signatures across the logopenic (lvPPA) and semantic (svPPA) variants are difficult to establish, with longitudinal profiles showing greater divergence. Objective: Assess longitudinal propagation of white matter degradation in lvPPA and svPPA to determine disease progression over time, and whether this reflects distinct underlying pathology. Method: A cohort of 27 patients with dementia (12 lvPPA; 15 svPPA) and 12 healthy controls were assessed at baseline and 1 -year follow-up on the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised and Sydney Language <b>Battery.</b> <b>Diffusion</b> weighted images were collected at both time-points and analyzed for longitudinal white matter change using DTI-TK and TBSS. Results: LvPPA patients showed a significant decline in naming and repetition, over 1 year, while svPPA patients declined in naming and comprehension. Longitudinal imaging revealed widespread bilateral degradation of white matter tracts in lvPPA over a 1 -year period with early involvement of the left posterior inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). SvPPA demonstrated focal left lateralized white matter degradation involving the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and anterior ILF, propagating to the right UF with disease progression. Conclusions: LvPPA and svPPA cohorts showed distinct longitudinal cognitive and white matter profiles. We propose differences in multi-centric and focal white matter dysfunction in lvPPA and svPPA, respectively, reflect underlying pathological differences. The clinical relevance of white matter degradation and mechanisms underlying disease propagation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Sodium batteries, {{as well as}} lithium batteries, {{were widely}} studied from the late 1970 s and {{throughout}} the 1980 s. [1] However, interest in sodium batteries rapidly vanished, owing to the superior properties of the lithium technology. But, the large <b>diffusion</b> of lithium <b>batteries</b> in the electronic consumer market contributed to a rapid rise {{in the price of}} lithium. Owing to the large availability of sodium and its low cost, ambient temperature Na-based batteries have the potential to meet large-scale grid-energy-storage requirements. [2]. Sodium has an ionic radius larger than lithium (1. 06 Å vs 0. 76 Å, respectively), preferring 6 -fold coordination in octahedral or prismatic sites. This results in the confinement of the Na-based cathode structures into two big classes, i. e. poly-anionic networks[3] and layered compounds. The synthesis of a new layered cathode material, Na 0. 5 [Ni 0. 23 Fe 0. 13 Mn 0. 63]O 2, and its characterization in terms of crystalline structure and electrochemical performance in a sodium cell, is reported. X-ray diffraction studies and high resolution SEM images reveal a welldefined P 2 -type layered structure, while the electrochemical tests evidence excellent characteristics in terms of high capacity, extending up to 200 mAh g- 1, and cycle life, up to 70 cycles. This performance, in addition to the low cost and environmental compatibility of its component, poses Na 0. 5 [Ni 0. 23 Fe 0. 13 Mn 0. 63]O 2 among the best promising materials {{for the next generation of}} sodium ion batteries...|$|R
