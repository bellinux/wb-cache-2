5|$|The video {{starts with}} Usher {{sitting on a}} sofa with a {{backdrop}} of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend <b>had</b> <b>have</b> in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E

2500|$|The Mi'kmaq of {{southern}} Newfoundland {{spent most of}} their time on the shores harvesting seafood; during the winter they would move inland to the woods to hunt. Over time, the Mi'kmaq and Innu divided their lands into traditional [...] "districts". Each district was independently governed and had a district chief and a council. The council members were band chiefs, elders and other worthy community leaders. In addition to the district councils, the Mi'kmaq tribes also <b>had</b> (<b>have)</b> a Grand Council or Santé Mawiómi, which according to oral tradition was formed before 1600.|$|E

"James while John <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> {{a better}} {{effect on the}} teacher" [...] is an English {{sentence}} used to demonstrate lexical ambiguity {{and the necessity of}} punctuation,which serves as a substitute for the intonation, stress, and pauses found in speech.In human information processing research, the sentence <b>has</b> been used to show how readers depend on punctuation to give sentences meaning, especially in the context of scanning across lines of text. The sentence is sometimes presented as a puzzle, where the solver must add the punctuation.|$|R
2500|$|Reflecting on his {{decision}} to retire years later, Richardson remarked [...] "I resigned and retired because I was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, I was burnt out {{and it was a}} struggle to continue playing cricket. Every day was stressful, everybody wanted a piece of you and I had no time for myself. I was training harder and trying hard on the field but I couldn't do what I wanted to do. I felt like I was selling myself and my fans short. They wanted me to continue, but if I <b>had</b> <b>have</b> I would have got ill so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the DealBook {{conference in}} New York City the next day, Stephenson {{denied that the}} Department had demanded the {{divestment}} of CNN at all (stating that he <b>had</b> <b>have</b> [...] "never {{been told that the}} price of getting the deal done was selling CNN"), and that the company aimed to [...] "get to a negotiated settlement". However, he stated that if they were unable to do so, AT was [...] "prepared to litigate". In a statement to CNBC, a Department of Justice official backed Stephenson, denying that there were any specific demands to divest CNN during the discussion, and considering the claims to be [...] "shocking" [...] and an attempt to politicize the situation. The official added that the Department had officially recommended either abandoning the deal entirely, or divesting DirecTV or Turner, but that it was open to other options for quelling antitrust concerns.|$|E
2500|$|On lap 17, battling over seventh {{place as}} they {{approached}} the last left-hander before the pits, Piquet's Brabham was nearly touching the back of Reutemann's Williams. Piquet got around Reutemann on the inside when Reutemann, fighting for the Championship, braked early. [...] On the next lap, Andretti also went by Reutemann. Piquet put himself in a position to score points when he took over sixth place from John Watson on lap 22. Reutemann continued to slip backwards with gearbox trouble, having lost fourth gear as early as lap two. Reutemann finished the race in eighth, a lap down, and the title went to Piquet. However, if that year's season opener, the 1981 South African Grand Prix, <b>had</b> <b>have</b> been a race with World Championship Points awarded, Reutemann would have been World Champion with 58 Points against Piquet's 56. He returned with Williams for 1982, finishing [...] second in the South Africa, the only Cosworth-engined runner able to take the fight to the much more powerful turbo-engined Renaults. The Falklands War, however, generated a tense political period between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and Reutemann chose to distance himself from the team and retire after the Brazilian race. In light of the further developments that took place in Reutemann's life, many felt that his decision to terminate his racing career was made with an eye to his future in politics. This is disputed by Williams's Chief Designer Patrick Head, who felt that the Falklands War was only an excuse and that Reutemann had simply retired because [...] "his heart wasn't in it anymore".|$|E

But, taken altogether, cats are libeled. Make a friend of one, and she will stick to you through thick and thin. All the cats that I have <b>had</b> <b>have</b> been most firm comrades.

It made me feel quite like a married man, except that she never asked where I had been and then didn't believe me when I told her.|$|E

And as to Aunt Jane, I really don't see that I am bound to gratify her passion for knowing everything. I am not accountable to her, but to my own mother. My people know all about Kalliope, and she is prejudiced. Why should I be unkind and neglectful of an old fellow-soldier's family, because she cannot or will not understand what they really are? It {{would not be the}} slightest use to tell her the real story. Mrs. White is fat, and Kalliope has a fringe, goes to St. Kenelm's, and won't be in the G.F.S., and that's enough to make her say she does not believe a word of it, or else to make it a fresh ground for poking and prying, in the way that drives one distracted!

6000|$|When the {{two girls}} had gone in to breakfast it was for Fleda to see at a glance {{that there had been}} a further passage, of some high color, between Owen and his mother; and she had turned pale in {{guessing}} to what extremity, at her expense, Mrs. Gereth had found occasion to proceed. Hadn't she, after her clumsy flight, been pressed upon Owen in still clearer terms? Mrs. Gereth would practically have said to him: [...] "If you'll take her, I'll move away without a sound. But if you take any one else, any one I'm not sure of, as I am of her--heaven help me, I'll fight to the death!" [...] Breakfast, this morning, at Poynton, had been a meal singularly silent, in spite of the vague little cries with which Mrs. Brigstock turned up the underside of plates and the knowing but alarming raps administered by her big knuckles to porcelain cups. Some one had to respond to her, and the duty assigned itself to Fleda, who, while pretending to meet her on the ground of explanation, wondered what Owen thought of a girl still indelicately anxious, after she had been grossly hurled at him, to prove by exhibitions of her fine taste that she was really what his mother pretended. This time, at any rate, their fate was sealed: Owen, as soon as he should get out of the house, would describe to Mona that lady's extraordinary conduct, and if anything more had been wanted to [...] "fetch" [...] Mona, as he would call it, the deficiency was now made up. Mrs. Gereth in fact took care of that--took care of it by the way, at the last, on the threshold, she said to the younger of her departing guests, with an irony of which the sting was wholly in the sense, not at all in the sound: [...] "We haven't had the talk we might have <b>had,</b> <b>have</b> we? You'll feel that I've neglected you, and you'll treasure it up against me. Don't, because really, you know, it has been quite an accident, and I've all sorts of information at your disposal. If you should come down again (only you won't, ever,--I feel that!) I should give you plenty of time to worry it out of me. Indeed there are some things I should quite insist on your learning; not permit you at all, in any settled way, not to learn. Yes indeed, you'd put me through, and I should put you, my dear! We should have each other to reckon with, and you would see me as I really am. I'm not a bit the vague, mooning, easy creature I dare say you think. However, if you won't come, you won't; n'en parlons plus. It is stupid here after what you're accustomed to. We can only, all round, do what we can, eh?
