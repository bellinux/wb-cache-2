5|$|Optical <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detection</b> is an {{essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detection</b> with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

40|$|When a {{coherent}} laser beam impinges on {{a random sample}} (e. g. a colloidal suspension), the scattered light exhibits characteristic speckles. If the temporal coherence of the light source is too short, then the speckles disappear, along {{with the possibility of}} performing homodyne or <b>heterodyne</b> scattering <b>detection</b> or photon correlation spectroscopy. Here we investigate the scattering of a so-called "skewed coherence beam", i. e., a short-coherence beam modified such that the field is coherent within slabs that are skewed with respect to the wave fronts. We show that such a beam generates speckles and can be used for <b>heterodyne</b> scattering <b>detection,</b> despite its short temporal coherence. When applied to quite turbid samples, the technique has the remarkable advantage of suppressing the multiple scattering contribution of the scattering signal. The phenomenon presented here represents a very effective method for measuring the coherence skewness of either a continuous wave or a pulsed beam. Another field of application concerns X-rays. The observation of speckles is usually limited to synchrotron radiation and FELs. Our experiment suggests that a short-coherence X-ray source can also be used, with no monochromator filtration, provided that the coherence is suitably skewed. Such a technique will also enable <b>heterodyne</b> scattering <b>detection</b> with standard short-coherence light sources. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{components}} of continuous squeezed fields are entangled.

Moreover, we study the specific spectral components that are filtered in homodyne or <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detections</b> and their entanglement properties. In particular, we establish the equivalence between two-mode squeezing variance and logarithmic negativity for the spectral {{components of}} continuous stationary fields, thereby demonstrating that the measurement of the homodyne or heterodyne spectrum is, in fact, a direct measurement of the logarithmic negativity between specific spectral modes. As an illustrative example, we apply these concepts to the analysis of entanglement in ponderomotive squeezing. Comment: 23 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Modulation {{methods such as}} {{homodyne}} and <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detections</b> {{are employed}} in A-SNOM in order to eliminate serious background effects from scattering fields. Usually, the frequency-modulated detection signal in apertureless scanning near-field optical microscopy (A-SNOM) is generally analyzed using a simple dipole-interaction model based only on the near-field interaction. However, the simulated A-SNOM spectra obtained using such models are in poor agreement with the experimental results since the effects of background signals are ignored. Accordingly, this study proposes a new phenomenological model for analyzing the A-SNOM detection signal in which the effects of both the dipole-interaction and the background fields are taken into account. It is shown that the simulated A-SNOM spectra for 6 H-SiC crystal and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) samples are in good agreement with the experimental results. The validated phenomenological model is used to identify the experimental A-SNOM parameter settings which minimize the effects of background signals and ensure that the detection signal approaches the pure near-field interaction signal. Finally, the phenomenological model is {{used to evaluate the}} effects of the residual stress and strain in a SiC substrate on the corresponding A-SNOM spectrum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Terahertz {{heterodyne}} receivers typically use {{double sideband}} (DSB) mixers. The precise {{knowledge of the}} receiver sideband ratio (SBR) is a fundamental requirement for the calibration of the data taken {{with this type of}} receivers. At the moment the spectroscopic techniques developed for submillimeter analysis, such as Martin Pupplet interferometry[1] and Gas cell technique[2] rely on a calibrated filter system and suffer from inaccuracies caused by standing waves. Here, we present sideband ratio measurements of a submillimeter receiver in the 600 - 720 GHz band (ALMA Band 9) using a Michelson interferometer as input filter. The main requirement for this method is that the resolution must be high enough to allow distinguishing between the two side bands of the DSB receiver. The advantages of this method are, first, the simplicity of the experimental setup, and, second, the possibility to identify and calibrate out standing waves in the signal and local oscillator paths. In our procedure we use, in fact, exactly the same receiver configuration for both direct and <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detections.</b> Although the results are still preliminary, we have found a good agreement in the SBR measured with both configurations.
