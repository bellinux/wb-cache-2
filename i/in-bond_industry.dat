40|$|Maquiladora in-bond {{manufacturing}} activities occupy positions of collective importance within many regional economies across Mexico. To date, empirical evidence regarding the predictability of maquiladora activities in Mexico {{has not been}} attempted. To partially fill that gap in the literature, two sets of <b>in-bond</b> <b>industry</b> econometric forecasts for metropolitan economies in Northern Mexico are analyzed. Empirical results indicate that accurate forecasts of metropolitan maquiladora variables may prove elusive. Regional Maquiladora Forecasting...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{this paper}} is to analize the environmental performance related with the industrial upgrading in the <b>in-bond</b> <b>industry.</b> The key questions are: a) what are the levels of environmental performance in maquiladoras? and b) Is the environmental performance according with the industrial upgrading? Our hypothesis suggests that the capacity and necessity of applying environmental activities is associated with the industrial upgrading. The construction of technoproductive levels and the environmental performance index identified the sociotechnical aspects compared with our key variables...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{evolution}} of female labor force in the border cities of Tijuana and Matamoros during the period between 1987 and 1996. During {{the initial stages of}} the maquiladoras (<b>in-bond</b> <b>industry),</b> female workers predominated, but recent changes in the production process have brought about an increase in male labor force, especially in Tijuana. From female labor several changes in cultural and social patterns derive: {{an increase in the number}} of divorced or separated women with one or two children, an increase in education level from basic to medium in both cities. Income levels are also worth mentioning. In Matamoros the minimum wage has increased up to three times compared to Tijuana. This is because In the former city worker-class participation has resulted in better forms of social, class and union organization, which have been reflected in modest improvements in working conditions, a reduction in job turnover and a higher job stability...|$|E

40|$|This paper surveys Vertical Specialization (VS) from {{different}} empirical approaches, including the various conceptualizations of VS, {{the problems with}} its quantification, and a case study. The empirical estimation of this paper refers to the Mexican manufacturing industry and the <b>in-bond</b> <b>industry</b> (also known as maquiladora). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare VS, through the application of the Vertical Intra-Industry Trade (VIIT) indexes, for maquiladora and non-maquiladora industries and to contrast the degree to which the maquiladora industry is integrated with the global value chain relative to the non-maquiladora activities for the 1994 - 2006 period. Furthermore, this paper quantifies VIIT for the post-maquiladora period (2007 - 2014) in order to discuss if there have been changes in the VIIT since the conclusion of the maquiladora program in 2006. In particular, this paper tests if the quality ladder hypothesis applies to Mexico for its bilateral trade with the United States and Canada. The empirical estimations show the remarkable differences between maquiladora and non-maquiladora VS and the impacts that changes in the NAFTA tariff schedule for the automotive industry have had on the bilateral trade pattern...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the electronics <b>in-bond</b> <b>industry</b> in the Mexican Northern Border. It is argued that the location or subcontracting by foreign firms of the assembly phase of electronics production in Mexico constitutes a new pattern of industrial location {{different from that of the}} heavy industrial concentrations in the three biggest cities, Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. As this new pattern consolidates and spreads into the interior of the country, the labour processes upgrade, requiring a more skilled labour force with the consequent changes in the structure of the labour force. This process is linked to the general process of internationalisation of capital which has had as a result the integration of more countries into world trade thus changing the structure of world production capacity and the subsequent geographical redistribution of worldwide production. In this way, firms have located production facilities in the Newly Industrialising Countries (NICs) and, nowadays, the New-NICs. However, in opposition to the somewhat one-sided views developed hitherto of the phenomena, the research undertaken on the electronics industry at world level and the empirical data gathered on in-bond electronic firms in the Mexican Northern Border identifies several factors as interacting in the emergence of new patterns of location in countries integrated into international trade: a) the role of technological innovation; b) increasing capital-intensiveness of industry versus labour intensity in certain phases of the production processes; c) intense competition at world scale; d) the characteristics of labour force in the host countries and e) the role of the nation-states - both home and host countries - which through economic and social policies influence the relocation offshore (in the former case) and establish the conditions for the successful performance of the labour processes relocated in the latter...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe Mexico-United States {{border region}} {{comprises}} {{one of the}} most dynamic and complex industrial areas in the world. The region is characterized by high population growth and increasing urbanization and industrialization, all of which is taking place in a context of rapid political and economic change (Rincón, 2000). The Mexico-located maquila <b>in-bond</b> <b>industry</b> is a key player in this development. In the 1993 - 98 period, the maquilas accounted for 41. 5 % of the average Mexican export value (Dussel, 2000), and in the 1994 - 2000 period its share of foreign direct investment grew from 6 % to 21. 4 %. However, while industrial development is desirable as a generator of material wealth (e. g. provision of employment and tax base), it also causes negative effects such as depletion of natural capital (e. g. consumption of environmental goods like water, and services such as the assimilation of emissions). In particular, the location choice and the rapid growth of the maquila industry constitute true challenges for the policy maker. This is accentuated by the fragility imposed by climatic conditions in the Border States and topographical disadvantages as illustrated by the Tijuana region that is vulnerable to erosion, floods and landslides (Ojeda, 2000). Furthermore, this choice of location emphasizes the transborder interdependence in the form of, for example, the many drainage basins which links Mexico and the United States (Johnstone, 1995). The aggregate environmental impact takes the form of augmented demand for space, water, and energy, increased traffic and congestion, hazardous waste generation and subsequent demand for waste management and disposal, atmospheric pollution, and risks for environmental accidents (EPA, 2000). Especially hazardous waste is perceived as one of Mexico's most alarming industry-environmental themes and PROFEPA (2000) states that {{this is especially true for}} maquilas. Apart from strong industry growth and the choice of location, the maquilas are distinguished by their production-processes, namely; a) a bias towards labor-intensive (and consequently relatively less sophisticated) processes, 2 b) location in the production-chain, (i. e. spatial, and sometimes ownership-specific separation from the parent company), and c) less extensive production chains. The purpose of this report is to explore the environmental performance of the maquiladoras in this vulnerable setting, taking into account the specific characteristics of this industry. The study will add to existing research in two ways. Firstly, it aims at bridging the gap between previous studies, by isolating and analyzing the key components that determine the maquila's environmental performance, and subsequently put them in their corresponding context. Specifically, it studies the maquiladora's environmental performance in terms of environmental production-related externalities (e. g. atmospheric emissions) as well as regional indirect social-economic externalities (e. g. demographic effects on water consumption). Furthermore, the framework is applied specifically to Mexico, and the United States comparisons are included only to the extent that they are perceived as essential in the Mexican context. 3 Secondly, aiming at gathering scattered information so as to provide a broad picture of the variables at hand approaches the challenge posed by the scarcity of data. Previous attempts in the literature to cast light on the environmental performance of the maquiladoras reveals the serious shortage of quantitative as well as qualitative data in the field. Chapter 2 provides definitions, limitations and sources applied in the study. Specifically, a classification of environmental indicators is introduced. Chapter 3 combines the findings of a literature survey with economic theory in order to introduce an analytical framework, which aims to specify the key drivers to the maquiladora industry's environmental performance. The empirically oriented chapter 4 presents indicators that aim to illustrate the drivers to environmental performance. Finally, chapter 5 presents some preliminary conclusions and policy implications...|$|E
