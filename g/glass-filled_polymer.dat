50|$|<b>Glass-filled</b> <b>polymer,</b> or glass-filled plastic, is a mouldable {{composite}} material. It comprises short glass-fibres in {{a matrix}} of a polymer material. It is used to manufacture {{a wide range of}} structural components by injection or compression moulding.|$|E
5000|$|The M98B also {{features}} a fluted medium-heavy 27 in barrel made of 4150 MIL-B-11595 steel. The barrel is rifled in a six groove, 1:10" [...] right hand twist pattern, and features a two-port muzzle brake threaded on and indexed by a jam nut. The bolt rides in a new [...] "bolt guide" [...] design, consisting of two tubular <b>glass-filled</b> <b>polymer</b> guides which have been infused with Teflon. These guides allow the bolt to travel better, as well as reducing the need for lubrication, and helping to seal the ejection and bolt handle ports from dirt. The bolt head is made of case-hardened 8620 steel, features nine lugs (three sets of three), and {{is attached to the}} bolt body with a crosspin. This separate bolt head design allows for simple caliber changes, as well as future pre-headspaced barrel and bolt-head sets.|$|E
50|$|The Ruger LCR is {{a compact}} {{revolver}} built by Ruger and announced in January 2009. The LCR acronym stands for 'Lightweight Compact Revolver'. It incorporates several novel {{features such as}} a polymer grip and trigger housing, monolithic receiver, and constant force trigger. At 13.5 oz, the LCR is nearly 50% lighter than the stainless steel SP101 and with only the barrel and fluted cylinder made of stainless steel. The frame is aluminum alloy and synthetic <b>glass-filled</b> <b>polymer</b> finished in matte black with Synergistic Hard Coat. The LCR operates in double-action only (DAO) as the hammer is concealed within the frame handle's fire control housing of the gun and cannot be cocked prior to firing. In {{order to create a}} crisp and light trigger pull that is non-stacking, it features a friction reducing cam, a feature seldom found on double-action revolvers (which by nature of their mechanism normally have a very heavy trigger pull).|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the native}} <b>polymer,</b> <b>glass-filled</b> {{materials}} have improved mechanical properties of rigidity, strength and may also have improved surface hardness.|$|R
5000|$|The LC9 has a 3.12 inch 0 cm barrel, and is [...] {{long and}} 4.5 inch 0 cm tall. The LC9 is 0.9 inch 0 cm wide, and weighs 17.1 oz {{with an empty}} magazine. It {{features}} a black <b>polymer</b> (<b>glass-filled</b> nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel. The gun ships with one magazine, including two interchangeable base pads—one that fits flush with the frame, and the other (fitted to the magazine from the factory) that provides a grip extension of about 0.5 inch 0 cm. The Ruger LC9 {{was chosen as the}} Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence's Handgun of the Year in 2011.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental investigation has been performed {{to determine the}} thermal behavior of two <b>glass-filled,</b> decomposing <b>polymer</b> composites. A one-dimensional, transient numerical model has been developed to predict the overall thermally-induced response of these materials, without including the idealized assumption of local-thermal equilibrium. For both materials, the expansion characteristics and volumetric heat transfer coefficients were experimentally determined for input into the numerical model. ^ The results of the numerical study with a prescribed surface heat flux of 279. 7 kW/m 2 indicate that local-thermal equilibrium {{does not exist in}} either H 41 N or MXBE- 350. In fact, solid to gas temperature differences of 500 ∘C exist locally for MXBE- 350. While for the tighter, more fibrous H 41 N differences as high as 200 ∘C are predicted locally for the times investigated. For H 41 N, pressures in excess of 10 atmospheres were predicted, and the existence of such high pressures has been verified experimentally. ^ An investigation into the effects of the idealized assumption of local-thermal equilibrium revealed significant errors associated with the assumption for both materials. Solid temperature differences between the actual and idealized cases were as high as 100 ∘C and 180 ∘C locally for H 41 N and MXBE- 350, respectively. As a result, measurable errors are evident in the mass loss and pressure profiles for the idealized case. The errors in the pressure and mass loss profiles are significant because spallation and/or cracking are highly dependent on stress concentration and material strength, which are linked to internal pressure and stage of decomposition, respectively. From the results of this study, it is evident that accurate numerical modeling can only be achieved when the idealized assumption of local-thermal equilibrium is not incorporated into the modeling scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTHACT: An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to estimate heat tnnsfer coefficients between product wlatiles and the solid matrix within thc tortuous pore netwrk of decomposing <b>glass-filled</b> <b>polymer</b> composites. TIW such composite materials, denoted as Haveg H 41 N and Fiberite hlXBE- 350, have b o x studied in this experimental in-vestigation. For both materials, volumetric heal transfer cocfficients were measured between argon gas and the pore netwrk of 0. 17 cm thick specimens precharred to 25 °C (virgin spec-imens), S O O O C, 600 °C and 800 °C, at several gas flow rates. For H 41 N, gas pressure drop values ranging from 3. 45 x 10 ' PJ to 1. 72 x 10 ' PJ, for each stage of dccomposition. were imposed to create flow through the po'c netnork. Gas pressure drop values for hlXBE- 350 ranged from 6. 89 x 10 ' Pa to 6. 89 x 10 ' PJ. In both cases the volumetric heat tnnsfer coefficients {{were found to be}} dependent on stage of decomposition and gas prcssurc drop across the specimen. i. e., gas flow nte.

5000|$|The {{development}} of the M16A2 rifle was originally requested by the United States Marine Corps {{as a result of}} the USMC's combat experience in Vietnam with the XM16E1 and M16A1. It was officially adopted by US Department of Defense as the [...] "US Rifle, 5.56mm, M16A2" [...] in 1982. The Marines were the first branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to adopt the M16A2 in the early/mid-1980s, with the United States Army following suit in the late 1980s. Modifications to the M16A2 were extensive. In addition to the new rifling, the barrel was made with a greater thickness in front of the front sight post, to resist bending in the field and to allow a longer period of sustained fire without overheating. The rest of the barrel was maintained at the original thickness to enable the M203 grenade launcher to be attached. A new adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters to take full advantage of the ballistic characteristics of the new SS109 rounds and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. The weapon's reliability allowed it to be widely used around the United States Marine Corps special operations divisions as well. The flash suppressor was again modified, this time to be closed on the bottom so it would not kick up dirt or snow when being fired from the prone position, and acting as a recoil compensator. The front grip was modified from the original triangular shape to a round one, which better fit smaller hands and could be fitted to older models of the M16. The new handguards were also symmetrical so that armories need not separate left and right spares. The handguard retention ring was tapered to make it easier to install and uninstall the handguards. A notch for the middle finger was added to the pistol grip, as well as more texture to enhance the grip. The buttstock was lengthened by 5/8 in. The new buttstock became ten times stronger than the original due to advances in polymer technology since the early 1960s. Original M16 stocks were made from fiberglass-impregnated resin; the newer stocks were engineered from DuPont Zytel <b>glass-filled</b> thermoset <b>polymers.</b> The new stock included a fully textured polymer buttplate for better grip on the shoulder, and retained a panel for accessing a small compartment inside the stock, often used for storing a basic cleaning kit. The heavier bullet reduces muzzle velocity from 3200 ft/s, to about 3050 ft/s. The A2 uses a faster twist rifling to allow the use of a trajectory-matched tracer round. It has a 1:7 twist rate. A spent case deflector was incorporated into the upper receiver immediately behind the ejection port to prevent cases from striking left-handed users.|$|R
