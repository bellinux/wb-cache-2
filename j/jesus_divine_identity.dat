5000|$|The term [...] "exoteric" [...] {{may also}} reflect {{the notion of}} a <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> that is outside of, and {{different}} from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered within the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.|$|R
40|$|Certain gods in Euripides’ Hippolytos and Herakles {{exhibit a}} high level of control over mortals. Each play has one primary god whose {{statements}} of will, identity, and offense control the actions of other characters. Each play features a distinct god/human dialectic, in which certain actions performed by mortals threaten or affirm <b>divine</b> <b>identity,</b> as defined by the primary god or her surrogates. Secondary gods react to the primary god’s will and in so doing help assert/re-assert the primary god’s identity, as does mortal suffering. I apply Austin’s concept of perlocution, an utterance’s action or effect, to define divine motivation and control. In both plays, the primary god’s statements of will and identity have perlocutionary force in the motivation of mortal actions. Mortal offenses toward the gods similarly motivate divine revenge. Through the perlocutive effect of divine will, mortal characters perform <b>divine</b> <b>identity,</b> through bodily suffering and death.

It is a declaration of the unknown name of <b>Jesus's</b> <b>divine</b> father, the possession of which enables the knower to penetrate the veil of ignorance that has separated all created beings from said father.

(playing on the sonic similarity of `ko' and `ka' in Telugu) He has titled his lectures as Yedukondalu-Yedukandalu. He has proved that Rama was never conscious of his <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> unto six kandas of the epic and he had emerged as `Narayana' in the seventh kanda only — this 'Narayana Tatva' he calls the `divine idea'.
