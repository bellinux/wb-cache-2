60|$|This {{final and}} {{independent}} judicature, {{because it is}} final and independent, ought to be very cautious {{with regard to the}} rejection of evidence. If <b>incompetent</b> <b>evidence</b> is received by them, there is nothing to hinder their judging upon it afterwards according to its value: it may have no weight in their judgment. But if, upon advice of others, they previously reject information necessary to their proper judgment, they have no intermediate means of setting themselves right, and they injure the cause of justice without any remedy. Against errors of juries there is remedy by a new trial. Against errors of judges there is remedy, in civil causes, by demurrer and bills of exceptions; against their final mistake there is remedy by writ of error, in courts of Common Law. In Chancery there is a remedy by appeal. If they wilfully err in the rejection of evidence, there was formerly the terror existing of punishment by impeachment of the Commons. But with regard to the Lords, there is no remedy for error, no punishment for a wilful wrong.|$|E

50|$|Gideon {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court {{on the grounds}} that he was not {{provided}} counsel and thus was denied him of his rights granted by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution and therefore, he was imprisoned on unconstitutional grounds. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the denial of Gideon's request for a lawyer was unconstitutional and that the Sixth Amendment grants the defendant the right to an attorney even if the defendant is unable to pay for one. The Courts ruled that states were required to provide lawyers {{on the grounds that}} having lawyers to defend defendants were a necessity. Justice Black, the writer of the Court's opinion, stated:Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel, he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon <b>incompetent</b> <b>evidence,</b> or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.Justice Black's opinion showed a similar argument that that of the Court's from Powell v. Alabama, the guiding hand of counsel can prevent an innocent man from being imprisoned falsely. From this point on, all defendants on trial for criminal charges were guaranteed the right to a lawyer, no matter what their financial situation looks like. The Court's decision in this case overturned the previous understanding of legal counsel set by the Court in Betts v. Brady. Gideon v. Wainwright would be the catalyst for the wave of change in criminal justice that the 1950s and 1960s would experience.|$|E

50|$|In the US, {{depending}} upon the regulations and standards adhered to per state and venue, court interpreters usually work alone when interpreting consecutively, or as a team, when interpreting simultaneously. In addition to practical mastery of the source and target languages, thorough knowledge of law and legal and court procedures is required of court interpreters. They are often required to have formal authorization from the state {{to work in the}} courts â€” and then are called certified court interpreters. In many jurisdictions, the interpretation is considered {{an essential part of the}} <b>evidence.</b> <b>Incompetent</b> interpretation, or simply failure to swear in the interpreter, can lead to a mistrial.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{concerning}} eyewitness testimony {{given by}} people with mental retardation in court was reviewed. Despite general perceptions that people with mental retardation make <b>incompetent</b> witnesses, available <b>evidence</b> suggests that they can provide accurate accounts of witnessed events. The accounts are usually less complete than those provided by the general population and are greatly influenced by the methods of questioning. The sparse available evidence suggests that cross-examination methods may lead to memory distortion. The use of closed, complex, and leading questions {{and the absence of}} aids to recall may have a particularly adverse effect on people with mental retardation. Resulting errors could lead to a false conviction or acquittal. Future policy and research in this much neglected area were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Specialized {{junctional}} binding of step 8 spermatids to Sertoli {{cells is}} an important spermiogenic event. In the hypophysec-tomized (Hypox) rat, the daily sperm production (DSP) is reduced and Sertoli cells become binding incompetent. Delayed replacement of testosterone (DT-Hypox) does not restore the normal DSP and Sertoli cells remain binding incompetent. In this study, DT-Hypox rats received FSH daily for 2 days to 3 wk concurrent with delayed testosterone replacement and were killed 8 wk after the initiation of hormone treatment. The DT-Hypox rat treated with FSH for 2 days to 2 wk had a significantly reduced DSP. Sertoli cells remained binding <b>incompetent</b> as <b>evidenced</b> by structurally abnormal ectoplasmic specializations and an ab-normal pattern of f-actin and vinculin immunostaining. The DT-Hypox rat treated with FSH for 3 wk had a normal DSP. Sertoli cells were binding-competent as evidenced by structurally intact ectoplasmic specializations and the normal pattern of f-actin and vinculin immunostaining. The {{results indicate that the}} "priming " effect of FSH necessary to restore normal spermiogenesis is associated with restoration of the junction-related Sertoli cell cytoskeleton (i. e., FSH induction of binding competency) expressed as intact ectoplasmic specializations and peripheral distribution of f-actin and vinculin...|$|R
5000|$|Some idea of {{the stature}} of Jessop as an {{engineer}} can be gained from events concerning the proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The original bill had been withdrawn from Parliament in 1825, as George Stephenson's survey was flawed, {{and his ability to}} present <b>evidence</b> <b>incompetent.</b> George and John Rennie then prepared a new plan, which resulted in an Act of Parliament being obtained in May 1826, after George Rennie and Jessop gave evidence. The two Rennies were asked to become engineers, but stated that while they were prepared to work with Telford or Jessop, they were not prepared to work with Stephenson. Their offer was refused, and Jessop became consulting engineer on 21 June, with Stephenson becoming principal engineer two weeks later. Despite the initial setback, Stephenson went on to complete the project in 1830, and his reputation as an engineer was established.|$|R
50|$|The Nite Owl slayings, however, {{bring him}} acceptance. Several patrons of an all night coffee shop are brutally shotgunned to death. Although in custody, the {{suspects}} escape. Exley finds them and guns them down {{despite the fact}} they were unarmed. As the years pass, Exley is given captaincy over Internal Affairs. He also makes other numerous cases with a conviction rate in the upper ninety percent. When the Nite Owl case is reopened due to the circumstantial evidence of two witnesses, Exley {{and the rest of}} the LAPD must solve the case all over again before the Attorney General's Office takes over the investigation and makes the LAPD look <b>incompetent.</b> As the <b>evidence</b> emerges and connections are established between the suspects in a web of complex conspiracies (stretching back decades), it becomes clear that his father himself did not properly clear his own famous case, The Loren Atherton case. With the aid of Bud White and Jack Vincennes, the trio ultimately solve the Nite Owl Case. Following a botched raid on a prison break via train, White is critically wounded. Exley visits him and finds evidence White built for his own case against a serial killer of prostitutes. When Exley finds the evidence, he learns the true meaning of absolute justice: anonymous, humble, no rank or glory. While conventional justice is not meted out, with Exley entrusting the second murderer of the Loren Atherton case to a known doctor, Dr. Terry Lux, and the ultimate mastermind behind the Nite Owl and other crimes, Dudley Smith cannot be convicted due to lack of evidence, Exley vows he will take down Dudley Smith if it's the last thing he ever does.|$|R
