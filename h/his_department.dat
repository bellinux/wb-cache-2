5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. <b>His</b> <b>department</b> was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with <b>his</b> <b>department</b> members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but as time went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and <b>his</b> <b>department</b> decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{of fraud}} and {{corruption}} were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis. A Commission officer Guido Strack reported alleged fraud and abuses in <b>his</b> <b>department</b> in years 2002–2004 to OLAF and was fired as result. In 2008 Paul van Buitenen (the former auditor known from Santer Commission scandal) accused the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) {{of a lack of}} independence and effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Baird {{was given}} {{additional}} responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8, 2001. <b>His</b> <b>department</b> increased funding for child services {{early in the}} year, amid {{a significant increase in}} provincial demand. In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40–45% cuts in provincial child-care programs. Baird initially {{declined to comment on the}} document's contents, but rejected its proposals in early 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Perryville, Buckner was {{reassigned to}} command the District of the Gulf, fortifying the {{defenses}} of Mobile, Alabama. He remained there until late April 1863, when {{he was ordered to}} take command of the Army of East Tennessee. He arrived in Knoxville on May 11, 1863, and assumed command the following day. Shortly thereafter, <b>his</b> <b>department</b> was converted into a district of the Department of Tennessee under Gen. Bragg and was designated the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Reagan {{commuted}} the 18-year {{sentence of}} former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, a Democrat from Baton Rouge, {{to the time}} served for violations of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts. On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with <b>his</b> <b>department</b> to make campaign contributions on his behalf. Reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving.|$|E

5|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the cynical}} {{director}} of the parks department and Leslie's boss. Due to his incredibly negative view of government, he regularly works to make <b>his</b> <b>department</b> as inefficient as possible. This leads him to butt heads with Leslie {{on a number of}} occasions, as her philosophy regarding government is the polar opposite. Despite that, both he and Leslie have a large amount of respect for one another. Ron has been married twice; both of his ex-wives are named Tammy. He despises and fears them greatly, as they are the only two women in the world that can control him.|$|E

5|$|Speer placed <b>his</b> <b>department</b> at the {{disposal}} of the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
25|$|State {{authorities}} were also blamed. The state labor commissioner, John C. Brooks, blamed <b>his</b> <b>department's</b> failure {{to inspect the}} plant on shortage of money and staff, and blamed {{the federal government for}} not enforcing stricter standards.|$|R

5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to <b>his</b> <b>Department</b> of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that <b>his</b> <b>Department</b> did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Civil Service Commission {{had limited}} success. Some cabinet members {{implemented}} a merit system that {{increased the number}} of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage. Delano, however, exempted <b>his</b> <b>department</b> from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to be involved in a bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should offer free public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations.|$|E

5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while <b>his</b> <b>department</b> had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Jingeling, the Keeper of the Keys to Santa's Workshop, {{was created}} in 1956 as a radio {{spokesman}} to promote the toys sold at Halle's Department Store in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Jingeling was immediately popular and became an annual fixture at Halle's where he prowled the seventh floor toy department entertaining shoppers. The costumed character was first played by Max Ellis, a Cleveland Play House actor, and then by Earl W. Keyes, a television producer and director, who remained with the role for many years. In addition to <b>his</b> <b>department</b> store duties, Mr. Jingeling appeared on a local children's television program telling stories, singing songs, and reminding viewers to visit Halle's.|$|E
5|$|Sifton's {{successor}} as Premier was Charles Stewart, the Minister of Public Works in his cabinet. Stewart, {{who supported}} conscription {{but did not}} actively campaign for it or the Unionists, kept Cross as Attorney-General, despite rumours that he would not. Cross's major challenge was enforcing prohibition, which was proving challenging. The Conservatives, and in particular George Douglas Stanley, were unreluctant to accuse Cross of mismanagement. In the meantime, a rift was opening between Cross and Stewart (whom the Conservatives accused, somewhat ironically, of being unduly influenced by his Attorney-General). Stewart found Cross neglectful of his duties, and after Cross refused to dismiss two detectives from <b>his</b> <b>department</b> whose work Stewart felt could be better done by the Alberta Provincial Police, Stewart requested his resignation. When twelve days passed without a reply from Cross, Stewart fired him August 26, 1918. His replacement as Attorney-General was Boyle, his nemesis of the Alberta and Great Waterways era.|$|E
50|$|In his {{afternoon}} speech, the Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, {{cited the}} case to illustrate how <b>his</b> <b>department's</b> policies were working. He also made reference {{to the case of}} Kevin James, the Toledo terror plot, and the 2006 Toronto terrorism case.|$|R

They ultimately voted for his nomination.|$|R
5|$|The Chancellor was {{effectively}} the first {{minister of the}} kingdom. <b>His</b> <b>department,</b> the chancery, {{was responsible for the}} Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session. The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E
5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between <b>his</b> <b>department</b> and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|CT was {{involved}} in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed's Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. The auditors released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken Graska and <b>his</b> <b>department</b> heads, leading to the former's resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position. Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT's transmissions to Ed's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed's Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.|$|E
