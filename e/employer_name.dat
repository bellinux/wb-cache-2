50|$|For example, suppose an attacker, Eve, {{manages to}} get a CA to issue to her a {{certificate}} that claims to represent Alice. That is, the certificate would publicly state that it represents Alice, and might include other information about Alice. Some of the information about Alice, such as her <b>employer</b> <b>name,</b> might be true, increasing the certificate's credibility. Eve, however, would have the all-important private key associated with the certificate. Eve could then use the certificate to send digitally signed email to Bob, tricking Bob into believing that the email was from Alice. Bob might even respond with encrypted email, believing that {{it could only be}} read by Alice, when Eve is actually able to decrypt it using the private key.|$|E

30|$|The {{existing}} system at CareerBuilder 2 uses an <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> normalization system [14, 15, 16] and an employer knowledge base (KB) to infer the employer industry of a job. The <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> normalization system normalizes employer names and links {{them to an}} employer entity in the KB. The employer KB contains an industry attribute for each employer entity. However, errors may occur during the computation of the job employer and {{in the construction of}} the employer KB with the industry attributes. For example, the industry of the employer “First Transit” should be Transportation, but is incorrectly labeled as “Office Administrative Services” in the KB. The KB is huge with about 20 M entities, and hence, it is not possible to manually detect the errors.|$|E

30|$|Errors due to {{incorrect}} name extraction These are {{the errors}} in the extraction process (parsing) of the Unnormalized <b>Name</b> of the <b>employer.</b> For example, “Truck Driver Cdl-a” is an Unnormalized Name given as input to the normalization system. But there is no valid <b>employer</b> <b>named</b> “Truck Driver Cdl-a”.|$|R
30|$|For each employer, we {{generate}} five {{types of}} features: the normalized titles {{of the jobs}} posted by this employer, the keywords in the employer description, the keywords in the <b>employer</b> <b>name,</b> the entropy calculated from the normalized titles, and the matching rate of staffing related keywords and phrases within the job descriptions.|$|E
30|$|In the {{recruitment}} domain, knowing the employer industry of jobs {{is important to}} get an insight about the demand in each industry. The existing system at CareerBuilder uses an <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> normalization system and an employer knowledge base (KB) to infer the employer industry of a job. However, errors may occur during the computation of the job employer and {{in the construction of}} the employer KB with the industry attributes. Since the KB is huge, it is not possible to manually detect the errors.|$|E
30|$|One {{source of}} model errors {{is that we}} assumed that the most {{frequent}} jobs posted by an employer are related to its industry; however, there are cases where the assumption does not hold true. For example, “Union Pacific” is a valid Unnormalized Name and is normalized to “Union Pacific Corporation,” which is a transportation company, and is labeled correctly in the KB. However, the model predicts it as a non-transportation employer. The {{reason for this is}} that the <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> does not contain any keywords in the vocabulary for transportation industry, and moreover, the most frequent jobs posted by this employer are non-technical jobs like “Dispatcher”, and “Track Laborer”, which are not directly related to transportation industry.|$|E

Shinichirō cooperates with her to hunt down the monsters that are running loose.|$|R
30|$|We {{observe that}} some of these errors can be {{corrected}} with the help of job posting data since the main jobs posted by an employer often relate to its industry. For example, truck driver jobs often correspond to employers that belong to transportation industry. When we look at the jobs posted by the employer named “First Transit,” the titles of the jobs posted include “Shuttle Driver,” “Bus Operator,” “Automotive Technician”. By looking at these job titles, we can see that they belong to the Transportation domain. Also, the word “Transit” in the <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> is a good indicator that the employer industry is Transportation. Employers named “Fresenius Medical Care,” “Community Health Systems, Inc.” contain keywords “medical”, “health” and belong to the Health Care industry.|$|E
30|$|In {{a similar}} way, for each {{industry}} i, we generate a vocabulary V_ni of keywords present in employer names. There {{are two types}} of employer names: Unnormalized Names and Normalized Names. Unnormalized Names are the raw names (mentions) of an employer extracted from the job postings. These names are then given as input to the normalization system and are mapped to entities in the employer KB. The name of this normalized entity is called the Normalized Name. By <b>employer</b> <b>name,</b> we refer to the set of all Unnormalized Names and the Normalized Name of an employer. For each industry, we define a significance score for the unigrams present in the employer names. Then to form the vocabulary of keywords for that industry, we select those unigrams that have their significance score and frequency greater than certain thresholds. The thresholds for V_ni are chosen in a similar way as for how we compute V_ti and V_di. Table  2 shows the size of V_ni and some example keywords in V_ni for a few industries.|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to know the industry of an employer to get an insight about the demand in each industry. CareerBuilder uses an employer KB and an <b>employer</b> <b>name</b> normalization system to normalize different mentions of an employer to an entity in the KB. However, errors can occur in the normalization system, and the KB too can have incorrect industry attributes. Thus, we might get a wrong employer industry this way. Also, since the KB is huge with about 20 M entities, {{it is not possible to}} manually detect the errors. Hence, we used machine learning models to infer the employer industry and automatically detect errors. We found that the job posting data, including job titles, employer names, and employer descriptions are useful indicators of the employer industry and hence used these as features for the models. We built multiclass classifiers for nine industry classes using two machine learning models: support vector machine (SVM) and random forest. Our experiments showed that random forest is more effective than SVM in identifying the errors in the existing industry classification system, which achieves precision 0.69, recall 0.78, and f-score 0.73. It especially better captures the interactions between different signals in more complex and mixed feature vectors, when normalization errors occur. We also observed that generally for industries that have higher error rates, our models perform better in detecting errors, according to a moderate correlation between the f-scores and the error rates for different industries. We demonstrated that job postings can be used to automatically detect errors in the existing system at CareerBuilder.|$|E

40|$|Presented at the NCRN Meeting Spring 2016 in Washington DC on May 9 - 10, 2016; see [URL] paper {{documents}} work using probabilistic {{record linkage}} {{to create a}} crosswalk between jobs reported in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the list of workplaces on Census Bureau’s Business Register. Matching job records provides an opportunity to join variables that occur uniquely in separate datasets, to validate responses, and to develop missing data imputation models. Identifying the respondent’s workplace (“establishment”) is valuable for HRS because it allows researchers to incorporate the effects of particular social, economic, and geospatial work environments in studies of respondent health and retirement behavior. The linkage makes use of name and address standardizing techniques tailored to business data that were recently developed in a collaboration between researchers at Census, Cornell, and the University of Michigan. The matching protocol makes no use of {{the identity of the}} HRS respondent and strictly protects the confidentiality of information about the respondent’s employer. The paper first describes the clerical review process used to create a set of human-reviewed candidate pairs, and use of that set to train matching models. It then describes and compares several linking strategies that make use of <b>employer</b> <b>name,</b> address, and phone number. Finally it discusses alternative ways of incorporating information on match uncertainty into estimates based on the linked data, and illustrates their use with a preliminary sample of matched HRS jobs.

30|$|Therefore, in {{this paper}} we propose to use the job postings to {{classify}} the industry of an employer, with the goal of automatically detecting the errors in the existing system.
