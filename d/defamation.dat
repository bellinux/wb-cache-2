5|$|The GLAAD Media Awards {{were formed}} in 1990 by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against <b>Defamation.</b> Michael {{received}} one nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against <b>Defamation</b> {{presented}} KQED {{with the}} first Pioneer Award, in recognition of its production of The Rejected {{as the beginning of}} a long history of LGBT-related programming.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Vorilhon sued Ottawa {{columnist}} Denis Gratton and Le Droit {{newspaper for}} $85,000 in <b>defamation</b> damages over a 23 January 2003 column; Raël lost and {{was ordered to}} pay court costs by Quebec Superior Court on 21 June 2006.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Danny Williams {{along with}} Alderon, {{filed a lawsuit}} against Sierra Club Canada along with {{environmental}} activist Bruno Marcocchio and political blogger Brad Cabana for <b>defamation</b> from comments both on live radio and on Cabana's blog.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, Schwimmer won a US$400,000 <b>defamation</b> {{lawsuit against}} Aaron Tonken, a former charity fundraiser. Tonken claimed Schwimmer had demanded Rolex watches {{in order to}} appear at his own charity event, a claim that Schwimmer had denied.|$|E
5|$|In its opinion, {{the balance}} between {{constitutional}} free speech and protection of reputation that has been struck by the current law of <b>defamation</b> in Singapore is appropriate in {{the circumstances of the}} present day.|$|E
5|$|The GLAAD Media Awards {{are awarded}} {{annually}} by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against <b>Defamation</b> in the United States. Ivy Queen received one award from one nomination.|$|E
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that <b>defamation,</b> the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a <b>defamation</b> case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in <b>defamation</b> cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a <b>defamation</b> suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for <b>defamation</b> by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent <b>defamation</b> action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>defamation</b> suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil <b>defamation</b> suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using <b>defamation</b> actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
5|$|Cruz had {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with Tom Cruise after they appeared together in Vanilla Sky. It ended in January 2004. In April 2003, she {{filed a lawsuit}} against the Australian magazine New Idea for <b>defamation</b> over an article about her relationship with Cruise.|$|E
5|$|France2 {{appealed to}} the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling that the court should not have asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of <b>defamation</b> in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E
5|$|Freedom {{of speech}} and expression, on which the State can impose {{reasonable}} restrictions {{in the interests of}} the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, <b>defamation</b> or incitement to an offence.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of <b>defamation</b> suits.|$|E
5|$|In January, 2012, the Church of Scientology {{brought a}} lawsuit against Debbie Cook for <b>defamation</b> after she sent an e-mail to 3,000 Church members criticizing its {{fund-raising}} methods. The lawsuit against her was quickly settled without payment by any side on April 23, 2012 after Cook was permitted to testify for three hours regarding her description of conditions at the Hole.|$|E

The students had also sought an injunction to prevent the DVD release of the film, which was denied.|$|E
5|$|A {{contravention}} of {{the regulations}} renders speakers and organizers of demonstrations liable to fines of up to $10,000, or incarceration of up to six months. The penalty for displaying anything violent, lewd or obscene at a demonstration is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or, on a subsequent conviction, $5,000.

5|$|A person named Shekhar {{approaches}} Shankar {{and through}} him, he informs Mallikharjun, the local Superintendent of police {{that he is}} the witness of the murder of environmentalist Prakash by Damodar. Damodar influences all the witnesses including Shekhar before Shankar could arrest him. He later comes to know that Raja Rao's son Bharath, the previous district collector committed suicide along with his wife, who was a friend of Prakash, because of <b>defamation</b> and personal attacks when Bharath tried to stop the power project.|$|E
5|$|ABC News denied BPI's claims, {{and called}} the lawsuit without merit. ABC News sought to have the case removed from South Dakota state court to federal court. In June 2013, a federal judge sent the lawsuit back to state court. On March 27, 2014, South Dakota state court Judge Cheryle Gering {{rejected}} ABC's motion to dismiss, and allowed the <b>defamation</b> suit to move forward. Diane Sawyer's motion for summary judgment was granted and she was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms {{about the}} ISA {{and the state}} of freedom of speech and {{assembly}} in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations. A 2007 report by Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada, Rule of Law in Singapore, alleged that <b>defamation</b> and bankruptcy law had been used to oppress the political opposition, and expressed concern about stringent limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s to the present, Apple {{has been}} {{plaintiff}} or defendant in civil {{actions in the}} United States and other countries. Some of these actions have determined significant case law for the information technology industry and many have {{captured the attention of}} the public and media. Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include antitrust claims, consumer actions, commercial unfair trade practice suits, <b>defamation</b> claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to {{claims that it}} had broadcast a staged scene, Enderlin and France2 filed three <b>defamation</b> suits in 2004 and 2005, seeking symbolic damages of €1. The most notable lawsuit was against Philippe Karsenty, who ran a media watchdog, Media-Ratings. He published {{an analysis of the}} footage on his website in November 2004, based on work from the French-Israeli Metula News Agency, that alleged the shooting scene had been faked, as had several scenes leading up to it where protesters were shown being injured. France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later.|$|E
5|$|Kuopio, {{where an}} 18-year-old {{vocational}} student was detained for uploading ominous material to IRC-Galleria. The student {{also created a}} fan group dedicated to the perpetrator on the site, albeit it was only {{intended to be a}} prank. The fan group included a link to the website of an artist also called Matti Saari, which led to him press charges on the student for <b>defamation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The European Center for Antiziganism Research, {{which works}} against {{negative}} attitudes toward Romani people, {{filed a complaint with}} German prosecutors on 18 October 2006, based on Borat's references to Gypsies in his film.

As a consequence, 20th Century Fox declared that it would remove all parts referring to Romani people from trailers shown on German television {{as well as on the}} film's website.|$|E
5|$|Under Article 79 of the Constitution, the {{president}} is immune from arrest, with exception to the treason/grave crimes clauses listed in Article 88 in the same document.

Information, either printed in the news or reported on television, that is considered <b>defamation</b> against {{the president is}} illegal under Article 5 of the Belarusian Law on Press.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Article 14(2)(a) is an {{addendum}} {{stating that}} the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament, or to provide against contempt of court, <b>defamation</b> or incitement to any offence. The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he felt she was too busy, {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived <b>defamation.</b> This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the scandal}} had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75–80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 past or present Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil and concern over Japan's prevailing corporate governance and transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported £10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for <b>defamation</b> and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce its cost base.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, <b>defamation</b> or incitement to any offence.|$|E
