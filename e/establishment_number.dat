50|$|The {{number of}} marines on board Royal Naval ships {{depended}} {{on the size of}} the ship and was generally kept at a ratio of one marine per ship gun, plus officers.

Manpower (recruitment and retention) problems saw regular infantry units from the British Army being used as shipboard replacements on numerous occasions. One result of the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas in Europe, and the blockading of the French Navy's ports, was that manpower constraints became less of an issue at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{neighborhood}} retail and service establishments, although they are often identified as positive attributes of successful neighborhoods and have been promoted through various community development programs. To date, research from urban and public policy fields has concentrated on {{the political economy of}} large-scale commercial development projects, particularly those promoted through public-private partnerships. Nonetheless, distressed neighborhood commercial districts present serious obstacles to the vitality of neighborhoods and the success of residential redevelopment. Consequently, neighborhood commercial spaces are often the focus of redevelopment programming.

The fundamental thesis of this research is that change in neighborhood retail and service establishments (number of establishments, employment size of <b>establishment,</b> <b>number</b> of employees, and payroll) is a function of market and non-market factors.

40|$|Most studies about avian {{breeding}} success {{shows that}} predation {{is the main}} factor of brood loss (MARTIN 1993, AGUILAR et al. 2000, PICMAN et al. 2002). The quality of the breeding habi-tat has been considered as another important factor in breed-ing success. Some breeding habitats provide better food re-sources (WITTENBERGER 1980), while others are safer against preda-tors (LENINGTON 1980) or better protected against variations from climatic extremes (PLESZCZYNSKA 1978). For several species of colonial birds, variables such as sites of colony <b>establishment,</b> <b>number</b> of active nests, and degree of nest grouping have been considered factors that influence di-rectly or indirectly the breeding success (TENAZA 1971, ROBINSON 1985, MASSONI & REBOREDA 2001).

According to HORN (1968), while one strategy can be efficient for some predators, this strat-egy can result in a greater vulnerability to other types of preda-tors. Therefore, colonial species that are attacked by several kinds of predators have to deal with a variety of selective pres-sures that favors different sites of colonies establishment and different spatial distributions of nests within colonies (ROBINSO...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} claims that Discount Retail Centers, such as WAL*MART, were {{dramatically}} eliminating small town businesses, annual {{changes in the}} number of retail and wholesale establishments in several small towns within the functional region of a mid-size rural Nebraska city were analyzed to assess their reaction to DRCs that opened in five different regional market centers at eight different times since 1962. <b>Establishment</b> <b>numbers</b> were expected to change in conformance to sales variations suggested in previous studies. DRC host cities were expected to inordinately gain establishments in the years immediately following the openings of their respective DRCs, while experiencing gains or losses in particular retail and wholesale sectors. Non-host towns were expected to inordinately lose establishments after DRCs opened within the region. ^ Annual <b>establishment</b> <b>numbers,</b> however, showed no consistency in the years following DRC openings in market centers of any size. Abnormal establishment changes did not always occur after DRC openings, and, in several instances, occurred at times not associated with a DRC opening. Moreover, the direction of change (positive or negative) in those instances where abnormal changes did occur were inconsistent over time. Patterns of establishment change over time were similar in larger towns, but became increasingly disparate as town size decreased. Sequences of establishment change varied significantly from place to place in no discernible spatial pattern, although towns located along major routes gained establishments after DRC openings slightly more often than towns located elsewhere. There was no reason found to conclude that DRC openings played a dominant role in forcing regional retailing changes {{in terms of the number}} of functions available from place to place within the regional distributional central-place hierarchy. ...|$|R

With a changing climate, there is the potential for this in-sect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suit-ability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both con-stant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15 – 38 °C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change pro-jections from SRES A 1 B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visu-alized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for <b>establishment,</b> <b>number</b> of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions.

40|$|URL] invasions are a {{pervasive}} and costly environmental problem 1, 2 {{that has been}} the focus of intense management and research activities over the past half century. Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion 3, 4, 5, is supported by both theory 6 and experimental studies 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales 3, 11, 15, 16. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies 17, 18, 19, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the <b>establishment</b> (<b>number</b> of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced.
