The experiment was carried out at the Paisa Sugar Mill, in Penedo-AL, Brazil, from February 2012 to February 2013.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Fungicide seed {{treatment}} {{is an important}} strategy for plant pathogen control in the dry bean crop.

Recent detections of neonicotinoids in groundwater have generated questions about the sources of these contaminants and the relative contribution from commodities in U. S. agriculture. Delivery of neonicotinoids to crops typically occurs as a seed or in-furrow treatment to manage early season insect herbivores. Applied in this way, these insecticides become systemically mobile in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and provide control of key pest species. An outcome of this project links these soil insecticide application strategies in crop plants with neonicotinoid contamination of water leaching from the application zone. In 2011 and 2012, our objectives were to document the temporal patterns of neonicotinoid leachate below <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> <b>furrow</b> following common insecticide delivery methods in potato. Leaching loss of thiamethoxam from potato was measured using pan lysimeters from three at-plant treatments and one foliar application treatment. Insecticide concentration in leachate was assessed for six consecutive months using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Findings from this study suggest leaching of neonicotinoids from potato may be greater following crop harvest in comparison to other times during the growing season. Furthermore, this study documented recycling of neonicotinoid insecticides from contaminated groundwater back onto the crop via high capacity irrigation wells. These results document interactions between cultivated potato, different neonicotinoid delivery methods, and the potential fo...|$|R

Em três experiências fato-riais, o calcário aplicado a lanço e o sulfato de amônio em cobertura não modificaram os "stands", ao passo que o superfosfato simples e o cloreto de potássio, empregados nos sulcos de plantio, provocaram substanciais e significativas reduções. Em três outras experiências, em blocos ao acaso, a aplicação de superfosfato simples + cloreto de potássio nos sulcos de plantio, completada com a de sulfato de amônio em cobertura, também causou substanciais reduções em relação aos "stands" dos tratamentos sem adubo, mas somente em duas das experiências essas reduções alcançaram significância estatística.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nitrogen (N) {{leaching}} {{below the}} crop-rooting zone represents {{not only a}} valuable loss of nutrients for <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> but also a potential pollution source of groundwater. The objective of this work was to quantify leaching losses of native N and that derived from fertilizer in an Oxisol that was cultivated with sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) during <b>the</b> crop <b>plant</b> cycle. <b>The</b> sugarcane was <b>planted</b> and fertilized with urea in <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> <b>furrow,</b> with 120 kg ha– 1 of N. In {{order to determine the}} fate of the fertilizer- N, four microplots with 15 N enriched fertilizer were installed. Input and output of N at the depth of 0. 9 m were quantified from the flux density of water and the N concentration in soil solution. During the evaluation period the rainfall was 141 mm less than the historical average (1, 315 mm), and the climate was drier than normal in January. The average concentration of mineral N in soil solution was 1. 8 mg L– 1. The abundance of 15 N was very high at the beginning (first week) of the assessment period and remained approximately constant (0. 453 atom % of 15 N) {{until the end of the}} period. The internal drainage was 91 mm of water and the N leaching loss was 1. 1 kg ha– 1 of N, with only 54 g ha– 1 derived from fertilizer. Therefore, under high demand of N by the crop in a system without burning before <b>planting,</b> <b>the</b> leaching of N was not considerable, mainly because the surplus of water between the months of December and March was lower than expected and als...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus {{fixation}} {{in tropical}} soils may decrease under no-till. In this case, P fertilizer could be surface-spread, which would improve farm operations by decreasing the time spend in reloading the planter with fertilizers. In the long term, less soluble P sources could be viable. In this experiment, {{the effect of}} surface-broadcast P fertilization with both soluble and reactive phosphates on soil P forms and availability to soybean was studied with or without fertilization with soluble P in <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> <b>furrow</b> in a long-term experiment in which soybean was grown in rotation with Ruzigrass (Brachiaria ruziziensis). No P or 80 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 {{in the form of}} triple superphosphate or Arad reactive rock phosphate was applied on the surface of a soil with variable P fertilization history. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 60 cm and soil P was fractionated. Soybean was grown with 0, 30, and 60 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 in the form of triple phosphate applied in the seed furrow. Both fertilizers applied increased available P in the uppermost soil layers and the moderately labile organic and inorganic forms of P in the soil profile, probably as result of root decay. Soybean responded to phosphates applied on the soil surface or in the seed furrow; however, application of soluble P in the seed furrow should not be discarded. In tropical soils with a history of P fertilization, soluble P sources may be substituted for natural reactive phosphates broadcast on <b>the</b> surface. <b>The</b> <b>planting</b> operation may be facilitated through reduction in the rate of P applied in <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> <b>furrow</b> in relation to the rates currently applied. A fixação de fósforo em solos tropicais pode ser diminuída sob plantio direto. Nesse caso, o fertilizante poderia ser aplicado na superfície do solo, o que melhoraria o rendimento operacional pela diminuição do reabastecimento da semeadora com fertilizantes. Em longo prazo, fontes de P menos solúveis poderiam ser viáveis. Nesse experimento, o efeito da aplicação de P em superfície, tanto o fosfato solúvel como reativo, sobre as formas de P no solo e a disponibilidade para a soja foram estudados em combinação com a aplicação de P solúvel nos sulcos de semeadura, em um experimento de longa duração, onde a soja foi cultivada em rotação com braquiária (Brachiaria ruziziensis). Fertilizantes fosfatados foram aplicados na superfície de um solo com histórico de aplicações de P, nas doses 0, 0 e 80, 0 kg ha- 1, na forma de superfosfato triplo ou fosfato Arad. Amostras de solo foram tomadas até 60 cm de profundidade, e o P do solo foi fracionado. A soja foi cultivada com 0, 30 e 60 kg ha- 1 de P 2 O 5 como superfosfato triplo aplicado no sulco da semente. Ambos os fertilizantes aplicados em superfície aumentaram o P disponível nas camadas superiores do solo e as formas moderadamente lábeis orgânica e inorgânica de P no perfil do solo, provavelmente como resultado do apodrecimento radicular. A soja respondeu aos fosfatos aplicados na superfície do solo ou no sulco de semeadura; no entanto, a aplicação de P solúvel no sulco não deve ser descartada. Em solos tropicais, com uma história de fertilização fosfatada, fontes de P solúveis podem ser substituídas por fosfatos naturais reativos aplicados à superfície do solo. A operação de semeadura pode ser agilizada pela redução da taxa de P aplicada ao sulco da sementeira, em relação às doses que são empregadas atualmente...|$|R
