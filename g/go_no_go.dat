40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} three subtypes of impulsivity (Reflection Impulsivity, Impulsive Choice, and Impulsive Action) and measures of uncontrolled eating (TFEQ-D) and restraint (TFEQ-R). Eighty women classified as scoring higher or lower on TFEQ-D and TFEQ-R completed the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT 20), Delay Discounting Task (DDT), a <b>Go</b> <b>No</b> <b>Go</b> task, Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and the Barrett Impulsivity Scale- 11 (BIS- 11). To test whether these relationships were affected by enforced controls over eating, {{half of the participants}} fasted the night before and ate breakfast in the laboratory before testing and half had no such control. Women scoring higher on the TFEQ-D were significantly more impulsive on the MFFT 20 and BIS- 11 overall but not on DDT, <b>Go</b> <b>No</b> <b>Go</b> or BART. Women scoring higher on TFEQ-R were significantly less impulsive on the <b>Go</b> <b>No</b> <b>Go</b> task but did not differ on other measures. The eating manipulation modulated responses on the BART and BIS- 11 non-planning scale depending on TFEQ-D classification. These results confirm recent data that high scores on TFEQ-D are related to impulsivity, but imply this relates more to Reflection Impulsivity rather than Impulsive Choice or Action. In contrast restrained eating was associated with better inhibitory control. Taken together, these results suggest that subtypes of impulsivity further differentiate uncontrolled eating and restraint, and suggest that a poor ability to reflect on decisions may underlie some aspects of overeating...|$|E

40|$|With {{regard to}} the fact that the {{tendency}} toward unsophisticated strategies is often related to difficulties with basic components of executive functions, the aim of this research was to determine the relation between planning abilities and inhibitory control in children with mild intellectual disability (MID). The sample included 56 children with idiopathic MID (IQ 50 - 69, M= 61. 13, SD= 7. 14), of both genders (26 / 46. 3 % of girls), between 9. 11 and 14. 03 years of age (M= 11. 61; SD= 1. 29). <b>Go</b> <b>no</b> <b>Go</b> Task and Day/Night Stroop Task were used for the assessment of inhibitory control (delayed response to the agreed signal, conflict provoking motor responses, and inhibition of arrogant verbal responses), while Tower of London Test (ToL) was used for the assessment of planning abilities. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), paired samples t-test, Pearson's correlation, and partial correlation coefficients were used in statistical analysis of the results. The results showed that the mistakes in Response delay set of Go-no-Go task were the only significant factor of primary Total move score variable (ToL). The influence of the ability to delay motor activity, assessed by Response delay set, on all ToL variables was statistically significant (p= 0. 003).

40|$|Bearing in {{mind that}} the {{adaptive}} behaviour is one of the defining parameters of intellectual disability, determining of the influence of inhibitory control on adaptive functioning in children with mild intellectual disability was defined as a basic aim of this research. The sample covered 95 children with mild intellectual disability (MID), of both genders, from 10 to 14 years of age. By analysis of the data of schools' pedagogical-psychological departments, data on age and intellectual abilities of participants were collected. Inhibitory control was estimated by <b>Go</b> <b>no</b> <b>Go</b> task, consisted of Conflict Response and Response Delay sets. Adaptive skills data were gained {{on the basis of a}} standardized interview with special education teachers, by applying of AAMR Scale of adaptive functioning. On the basis of factor analysis, Scale scores were grouped in five factors: Personal independence, Social Independence, Personal and Social Responsibility, Social Adaptability and Personal Adaptability. Significance of relations among the observed variables was established by Pearson's correlation coefficient, by partial correlation coefficient and multifactorial variance analysis. Based on the analysis of results a statistically significant relationship between errors in the execution of tasks that belong to the set of conflict motor responses and adaptive functioning (p≤ 0. 000) was established. The relationship between errors that belong to the set of the response delay, and adaptive functioning is not statistically significant (p= 0. 324). Inhibition of the interference response is a significant factor of practical (partial η 2 = 0. 227), conceptual (partial η 2 = 0. 341) and social (partial η 2 = 0. 131) adaptive skills, while the response delay is significantly associated with the conceptual skills (p= 0. 029) only.

40|$|A {{wealth of}} support has shown {{higher levels of}} state and trait impulsivity can be found among those {{individuals}} prone to developing problematic eating behaviors and obesity. Thus, upon commencing the investigations in this thesis, {{it was hypothesized that}} impulsivity is an individual difference implicated in overeating behaviour. Increasing information indicates that there are divisions within impulsivity subtypes. Prior to this thesis, studies in the field of eating behaviour had not distinguished between subtypes of impulsivity. This was problematic because it limited researchers ability to describe how impulsivity is specifically involved in the perpetuation of overeating behaviour. The purpose of this Thesis was to provide a methodical inquiry into the relationship between impulsivity, and its relation with overeating behaviour. This objective was achieved by separating three prioritites, first to determine if impulsivity was higher in women who self report overeating, second to define differences between impulsivity classifications and determine if there was a consistnent pattern between self reported overeating and a relation to a subtype of overeating behaviour, and third to designate a specific impulsivity subtype to individuals who self report overeating behaviour. Six Experimental Chapters explored these three priorities. Two exploratory correlational/regression analysis were used to refine our ability to operationalize measures of self reported overeating and impulsivity (Chapters 2 and 5). Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 were devoted to assess the impact that ingestion of palatable food, and the violation of cognitive boundaries of restraint, have on subsequent impulsivity. The two remaining investigations were structured to assess the impact that environmental factors have on impulsive behaviour. In Chapter 4, a Controlled versus Unrestricted eating environment were manipulated to determine whether overeaters benefit from a structured breakfast meal prior to completing a battery of impulsivity tasks. In Chapter 7, anticipation for a rewarding food item was manipulated in two conditions. In this final Chapter, the impact that anticipation for rewarding food in self reported overeaters was assessed. The battery of impulsivity tasks in this thesis include the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), The <b>Go</b> <b>No</b> <b>Go</b> task, the Matching Familiar Figures task (MFFT), and two versions of the Delay Discounting Task (DDT). Impulsivity was classified along a spectrum of Reward Reactivity versus Inhibition subtypes, based on Evenden´s (1999) classification of impulsive behaviour. Participants tendency to overeat was based on a dual classification of tendency to restrain eating (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire- Restraint) with tendency to overeat (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-Disinhibition subscale). The outcomes of the five experimental investigations in this thesis demonstrated a reliable pattern by which participants with high Disinhibition scores had significantly more impulsive responses on the MFFT task. These results indicated that inhibition impulsivity is the clearest individual difference to be found between healthy volunteers who self-report overeating. The role that Inhibition Impulsivity plays in the perpetuation of overeating behaviour is illustrated and discussed in each Experimental Chapter...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the activity of bilateral parietal and premotor areas during a Go/No Go paradigm involving praxis movements of the dominant hand. METHODS: A sentence was presented which instructed subjects on what movement to make (S 1; for example, "Show me {{how to use a}} hammer. "). After an 8 -s delay, "Go" or "No Go" (S 2) was presented. If Go, they were instructed to make the movement described in the S 1 instruction sentence as quickly as possible, and continuously until the "Rest" cue was presented 3 s later. If <b>No</b> <b>Go,</b> subjects were to simply relax until the next instruction sentence. Event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta band (18 - 22 Hz) were evaluated for three time bins: after S 1, after S 2, and from - 2. 5 to - 1. 5 s before the S 2 period. RESULTS: Bilateral premotor ERP was greater than bilateral parietal ERP after the S 2 <b>Go</b> compared with the <b>No</b> <b>Go.</b> Additionally, left premotor ERP was greater than that from the right premotor area. There was predominant left parietal ERD immediately after S 1 for both <b>Go</b> and <b>No</b> <b>Go,</b> which was sustained {{for the duration of the}} interval between S 1 and S 2. For both S 2 stimuli, predominant left parietal ERD was again seen when compared to that from the left premotor or right parietal area. However, the left parietal ERD was greater for <b>Go</b> than <b>No</b> <b>Go.</b> CONCLUSION: The results suggest a dominant role in the left parietal cortex for planning, executing, and suppressing praxis movements. The ERP and ERD show different patterns of activation and may reflect distinct neural movement-related activities. SIGNIFICANCE: The data can guide further studies to determine the neurophysiological changes occurring in apraxia patients and help explain the unique error profiles seen in patients with left parietal damage...|$|R
