[...] The company also expanded geographically opening branches in Canada (1900), Minneapolis (1903), Albany, New York (1912), and Chicago (1915).

It is a dainty matter, is it not, to see your Anabaptists, and Brownists, {{and the rest of}} you, gather to a sermon with as little {{ceremony}} as <b>hogs</b> to a <b>trough!</b> But here comes food, and now for a grace, if I can remember one." ...|$|R

5000|$|Although he smoked, Wrigley {{disapproved of}} smoking at socialist {{meetings}} since the [...] "vile odour of smoke of cheap tobacco" [...] discouraged women from attending. He wrote, [...] "Not long ago an Italian lady comrade {{was criticized for}} not attending the Italian Branch meetings, the critic being one who had attended these meetings and probably helped to fill the hall with clouds of tobacco smoke ... The average smoker is about as selfish as a <b>hog</b> in a <b>trough</b> of <b>hog</b> swill." [...] Wrigley approved of the Finnish locals, which were against smoking or drinking at their meetings since they wanted women and children to feel welcome to attend.|$|R
60|$|In {{the middle}} of these wild rants, Tomkins twice or thrice {{suddenly}} ran into religious topics, and spoke mysteriously, but with great animation, and a rich eloquence, on the happy and pre-eminent saints, who were saints, as he termed them, indeed--Men who had stormed the inner treasure-house of Heaven, and possessed themselves of its choicest jewels. All other sects he treated with the utmost contempt, as merely quarrelling, as he expressed it, like <b>hogs</b> over a <b>trough</b> about husks and acorns; under which derogatory terms, he included alike the usual rites and ceremonies of public devotion, the ordinances of the established churches of Christianity, and the observances, nay, the forbearances, enjoined by every class of Christians. Scarcely hearing, {{and not at all}} understanding him, Joceline, who seemed his most frequent confidant on such occasions, generally led him back into some strain of rude mirth, or old recollection of follies before the Civil Wars, without caring about or endeavouring to analyze the opinion of this saint of an evil fashion, but fully sensible of the protection which his presence afforded at Woodstock, and confident in the honest meaning of so freespoken a fellow, to whom ale and brandy, when better liquor was not to be come by, seemed to be principal objects of life, and who drank a health to the King, or any one else, whenever required, provided the cup in which he was to perform the libation were but a brimmer.|$|R
5000|$|However, Edmonson did not {{retire in}} 2016 but was held over by Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards {{and given a}} one-third pay hike of $43,000 {{annually}} along with his retention.Early in 2017, as a newly-elected U.S. senator, John Kennedy called for Edmonson's resignation as state police superintendent after disclosure that Edmonson took seventeen of his high-ranking personnel, with one guest each allowed, to San Diego to attend a conference and to observe Edmonson's receiving a lifetime achievement award from the International Chiefs of Police. The trip cost state taxpayers $70,000 and also included a stay for four troopers at the Grand Canyon and the gambling mecca, Las Vegas, Nevada. Kennedy said that he personally likes the superintendent, [...] "but he has demonstrated that he is intent on being the tallest <b>hog</b> at the <b>trough.</b> And this is all taxpayer money." [...] Kennedy said that he initially had doubts that anything would happen to Edmonson, whom he calls [...] "part of a club down there in Baton Rouge. You see him at every get-together. He {{does a lot of}} favors for a lot of legislators. He's one of the good ole' boys. But this is just disgusting. And if John Bel Edwards is serious about being a reform governor, he will ask for the superintendent's resignation."Statewide radio talk show host Moon Griffon joined Kennedy in calling for Edmonson's removal on grounds of abuse of taxpayers.|$|R
