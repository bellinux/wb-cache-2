5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, {{particularly if the}} drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the <b>immunogenicity</b> of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of <b>immunogenicity</b> is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.|$|E
5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize <b>immunogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Allergies, while a {{critical}} subject of immunology, also vary considerably among individuals {{and sometimes even}} among genetically similar individuals. The assessment of protein allergenic potential focuses on three main aspects: (i) immunogenicity; (ii) cross-reactivity; and (iii) clinical symptoms. <b>Immunogenicity</b> is due to responses of an IgE antibody-producing B cell and/or of a T cell to a particular allergen. Therefore, <b>immunogenicity</b> studies focus mainly on identifying recognition sites of B-cells and T-cells for allergens. The three-dimensional structural properties of allergens control their allergenicity.|$|E
25|$|To reduce murine {{antibody}} <b>immunogenicity</b> (attacks by {{the immune}} system against the antibody), murine molecules were engineered to remove immunogenic content and to increase immunologic efficiency. This was initially achieved by the production of chimeric (suffix -ximab) and humanized antibodies (suffix -zumab). Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Taking human gene sequences from the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces <b>immunogenicity,</b> and thus increases serum half-life.|$|E
25|$|The {{heavy and}} light chains of human IgG {{proteins}} {{are expressed in}} structural polymorphic (allotypic) forms. Human IgG allotype {{is one of the}} many factors that can contribute to <b>immunogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-viral methods present certain {{advantages}} over viral methods, such as large scale production and low host <b>immunogenicity.</b> However, non-viral methods initially produced {{lower levels of}} transfection and gene expression, and thus lower therapeutic efficacy. Later technology remedied this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2007, South Korean {{government}} approved Gardasil for use {{in girls}} and women aged 9 to 26 and boys aged 9 to 15. Approval {{for use in}} boys was based on safety and <b>immunogenicity</b> but not efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Because drotrecogin-alpha is a {{therapeutic}} protein, {{there exists a}} potential for <b>immunogenicity.</b> Antibodies against drotrecogin have been observed. There is insufficient data {{at this time to}} quantify the risk, but extreme caution should be exercised if a patient has previously received drotrecogin-alpha.|$|E
25|$|Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) {{involves}} the use of radioactively-conjugated murine antibodies against cellular antigens. Most research {{involves the}}ir application to lymphomas, as these are highly radio-sensitive malignancies. To limit radiation exposure, murine antibodies were chosen, as their high <b>immunogenicity</b> promotes rapid tumor clearance. Tositumomab is an example used for non-Hodgkins lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, whereas many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of microorganisms, including harmless toxin components. Many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce an adaptive response, and most bacterial vaccines require the addition of adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system to enhance <b>immunogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use of {{plasmids}} {{has been}} validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies, {{this approach has}} failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's <b>immunogenicity</b> while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.|$|E
25|$|Using this {{technology}} {{it is possible}} to know the model behind immune system. It has been used to model T-cell-mediated suppression, peripheral lymphocyte migration, T-cell memory, tolerance, thymic function, and antibody networks. Models are helpful to predicts dynamics of pathogen toxicity and T-cell memory in response to different stimuli. There are also several models which are helpful in understanding the nature of specificity in immune network and <b>immunogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ofatumumab is {{a second}} {{generation}} human IgG1 antibody that binds to CD20. It {{is used in the}} treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike rituximab, which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less <b>immunogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are high-risk HPV types, {{that are}} not {{affected}} by available vaccines. Ongoing research {{is focused on the}} development of HPV vaccines that will offer protection against a broader range of HPV types. One such method is a vaccine based on the minor capsid protein L2, which is highly conserved across HPV genotypes. Efforts for this have included boosting the <b>immunogenicity</b> of L2 by linking together short amino acid sequences of L2 from different oncogenic HPV types or by displaying L2 peptides on a more immunogenic carrier.|$|E
25|$|These {{variants}} {{are typically}} aggregates, deamidation products, glycosylation variants, oxidized amino acid side chains, {{as well as}} amino and carboxyl terminal amino acid additions. These seemingly minute structural changes can affect preclinical stability and process optimization as well as therapeutic product potency, bioavailability and <b>immunogenicity.</b> The generally accepted purification method of process streams for monoclonal antibodies includes capture of the product target with protein A, elution, acidification to inactivate potential mammalian viruses, followed by ion chromatography, first with anion beads and then with cation beads.|$|E
25|$|Blebs on {{apoptotic}} cells contain {{nearly all}} the autoantigens found in SLE, and phagocytes bind these apoptotic cells and phagocytose them. If this process is defective, these autoantigens can be released into the circulation allowing an immune response. Serum amyloid P component is a protein that is thought {{to aid in the}} clearance of chromatin produced by apoptotic cells and deficiencies in this protein have been shown (in mice) to cause spontaneous formation of ANA. Autoantigens present on the blebs of apoptotic cells are also prone to modification, which can increase their <b>immunogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} issue related to {{human gene therapy}} is safety, particularly for the gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA. The main concern is the high <b>immunogenicity</b> of certain viral vectors. Retroviral vectors integrate into the chromosomes of the cells they infect. There will be always a chance of integrating into a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene, leading to virulent transformation of the cell. In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events.|$|E
25|$|The {{tonsillar}} epithelia (palatine and lingual) {{share similar}} nonkeratinization characteristics with the cervix, where HPV infection plays the {{major role in}} cases of cervical cancer. Also E6 and E7 may make HPV+OPC more immunogenic than HPV-OPC, since anti-E6 and E7 antibodies may be detected in these patients. This in turn could restrict the malignant behaviour of HPV+OPC {{and the presence of}} antibodies has been associated with a better prognosis, while treatment may enhance the <b>immunogenicity</b> of the tumour, and hence improve response, although to what extent is not clear. Outcomes are also associated with improved adaptive immunity.|$|E
25|$|There {{are still}} serious, unsolved {{problems}} related to gene therapy. Difficulties include effective integration of the therapeutic genes into the genome of target cells, {{reducing the risk of}} an undesired immune response, potential toxicity, <b>immunogenicity,</b> inflammatory responses, and oncogenesis related to the viral vectors used in implanting genes and the sheer complexity of the genetic basis of angiogenesis. The most commonly occurring disorders in humans, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, are most likely caused by the combined effects of variations in many genes, and, thus, injecting a single gene may not be significantly beneficial in such diseases.|$|E
25|$|Although AAV2 is {{the most}} popular {{serotype}} in various AAV-based research, {{it has been shown that}} other serotypes can be more effective as gene delivery vectors. For instance AAV6 appears much better in infecting airway epithelial cells, AAV7 presents very high transduction rate of murine skeletal muscle cells (similarly to AAV1 and AAV5), AAV8 is superb in transducing hepatocytes and AAV1 and 5 were shown to be very efficient in gene delivery to vascular endothelial cells. In the brain, most AAV serotypes show neuronal tropism, while AAV5 also transduces astrocytes. AAV6, a hybrid of AAV1 and AAV2, also shows lower <b>immunogenicity</b> than AAV2.|$|E
25|$|Modifying ricin may {{sufficiently}} {{lessen the}} likelihood that the ricin component of these immunotoxins will cause the wrong cells to internalize it, while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells. However, bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, which is used in denileukin diftitox, an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, have proven to be more practical. A promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells, thus greatly increasing their <b>immunogenicity.</b> Use of ricin as an adjuvant has potential implications for developing mucosal vaccines.|$|E
25|$|The vaccine {{tested in}} the phase II {{clinical}} trial in India did not proceed further because it produced antibody titers of 50nbsp&ng/mL for at least 3 months duration in only 60% {{of women in the}} trial. Ongoing research in hCG birth control vaccines has focused on improving <b>immunogenicity.</b> A vaccine in which the beta subunit of hCG is fused to the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin has been effective in laboratory mice. It has been approved by the Indian National Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and is being produced for pre-clinical toxicology testing. If it is determined to be safe, it is planned for clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} an immunocontraceptive to be {{palatable}} for human use, {{it would need}} to meet or exceed the efficacy rates of currently popular forms of contraception. Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy is due to variability of <b>immunogenicity</b> from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the same exact vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers.|$|E
25|$|Therapeutic DNA vaccine VGX-3100, which {{consists}} of plasmids pGX3001 and pGX3002, has been granted a waiver by the European Medicines Agency for pediatric treatment of squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix caused by HPV types 16 and 18. According to an article published 16 Sep 2015 in The Lancet, which reviewed the safety, efficacy, and <b>immunogenicity</b> of VGX-3100 in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (phase 2b) targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, {{it is the first}} therapeutic vaccine to show efficacy against CIN 2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18. In June, 2017, VGX-3100 entered a phase 3 clinical trial called REVEAL-1 for the treatment of HPV-induced high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The estimated completion time for collecting primary clinical endpoint data is August, 2019.|$|E
25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential <b>immunogenicity</b> still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the <b>immunogenicity</b> of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells. When a similar procedure was performed on genetically equivalent ES cells however, Zhou et al. found teratomas, which indicated that the cells were tolerated by the immune system. In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results. Findings indicate {{that there was no}} significant difference in the immunogenic response produced by the IPS cells and the ES cells. Furthermore, Araki et al. reported little or no immunogenic response for both cell lines. Thus, Araki et al. was unable to come to the same conclusion as Zhou et al.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for <b>immunogenicity.</b> There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2cm. Furthermore, nerve regeneration with these conduits has yet to reach the level of functional recovery seen with nerve autografts.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of HCV therapy is permanent eradication of the virus. The secondary potential benefit of eradication is {{a reduction in}} the risk of liver failure and liver cancer. Currently, peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin is the only FDA approved treatment for HIV–HCV co-infected patients. Interferons bind to specific cell surface receptors of virus-infected cells, which induces a complex cascade of protein-protein interactions and a rapid activation of gene transcription. The antiviral effects of interferons are mediated through inhibition of viral penetration or uncoating, inhibiting viral replication or translation of viral proteins, and/or viral assembly and release. The difference between peginterferon and interferon is the addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer. The addition of PEG decreases plasma clearance considerably, protects the molecule from proteolytic degradation and reduces its <b>immunogenicity.</b> Peak concentrations are approximately 1.5-2 fold higher than trough concentrations and the half-life is 80 hours (compared to 5.1 hours for interferon alpha-2a). Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analogue, but its mechanism of action is not clearly established. Ribavirin inhibits the replication {{of a wide range of}} RNA and DNA viruses. Pharmacokinetics are similar in patients with HIV co-infection compared with HCV mono-infection.|$|E
25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatemer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAVs also present very low <b>immunogenicity,</b> seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined cytotoxic response. This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for human gene therapy.|$|E

2500|$|Antibodies {{are also}} {{referred}} to as murine, chimeric, humanized and human. Murine antibodies are from a different species [...] and carry a risk of immune reaction. Chimeric antibodies attempt to reduce murine antibodies' <b>immunogenicity</b> by replacing part of the antibody with the corresponding human counterpart, known as the constant region.

2500|$|Before {{a company}} can market a generic drug, it needs to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to {{demonstrate}} therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved [...] "reference-listed drug" [...] and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently. [...] For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires the bioequivalence of a generic drug to be between 80% and 125% of the innovator product.

The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a person’s body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug.
