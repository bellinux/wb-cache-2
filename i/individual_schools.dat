The second part allowed respondents to rate the importance of the questions in the first part;The data from the questionnaires were analyzed. Mass authorship of the document provided social validity, while the Cronbach coefficient alpha procedure was used to establish the reliability of the instrument. Additionally, confidence intervals were computed for each district and for the survey as a whole;The major findings include: (1) The parents felt all the questionnaire items were important for parents to rate. (2) The highest rated questions were four in the area of programs, policies, and procedures of the <b>individual</b> <b>school</b> building, and one in the area of teachers and professional staff.

(6) The instrument and the process proved to be quick, easy, and cost effective...|$|R

25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is school culture, as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how school culture can lead students to perceive themselves as having varying levels of sexual agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within <b>individual</b> <b>schools</b> can influence the ways students think about their own sexuality and sexual experiences.|$|E
