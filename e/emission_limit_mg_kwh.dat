IEC 61000 - 3 - 6 and IEEE Std. 519 have by now been accepted as two well known standards for interconnecting the MV and HV-EHV customers to utility systems and widely adopted as standards to many power utilities. It {{is worth noting that}} the harmonic current <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> of both standards have not been compared and justified with analytical proofs because there is still no explanation that discusses the origin of the <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> in IEEE Std. 519, or the complex feature of IEC 61000 - 3 - 6. Two new novel methods of allocating the harmonic current <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> for MV customers and HV-EHV customers have been proposed. Both methods have been developed in accordance with the principles of IEC 61000 - 3 - 6. Task II has compared and investgated the <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> of both IEC 61000 - 3 - 6 and IEEE Std. 519. The difference, inconsistency and inaccuracy have been proven with the perspective of practical evaluations based on their own principles. The investigations focus on the specific numerical proofs of the resulting voltage distortions and the current <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> in the MV and HV-EHV systems rather than on the philosophies. The proposed methods strongly support IEC 61000 - 3 - 6 and IEEE Std. 519, and add to their value; these methods could also help utilities allocate fairly and accurately harmonic <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> to their MV and HV-EHV customers.

40|$|Cap {{and trade}} systems are {{emerging}} as the front-running policy choice to address climate change concerns in many countries.

40|$|Type {{approval}} is granted in the European Union to light-duty vehicles if these comply with <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> during standardized <b>emissions</b> {{testing in the}} laboratory. Although applicable <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> have become more stringent in past years, light-duty vehicles remain {{an important source of}} urban nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions. The persisting air quality problems suggest that standard emissions testing in the laboratory may not accurately capture the on-road emissions of light-duty vehicles. To address this hypothesis, we present the first comprehensive on-road emissions test of light-duty vehicles based on state-of-the-art Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). We find that nitrogen oxides emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbon emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally stay below the respective <b>emission</b> <b>limits.</b> By contrast,However, Average nitrogen oxides emissions of diesel vehicles (0. 93 ± 0. 39 grams per kilometer [g/km]), including modern Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0. 62 ± 0. 19 g/km), exceed <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> by 320 ± 90 %. On-road carbon dioxide emissions surpass laboratory emission levels by 21 ± 9 % and exceed the fleet-average emission target for passenger cars by 32 ± 20 %. These findings suggest that the current emissions testing fails to accurately capture the on-road emissions of light-duty vehicles. Our research provides the empirical foundation for establishing a complementary emission test procedure for light-duty vehicles in Europe. This procedure that will be implemented together with more stringent Euro 6 <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> in 2014.

Empirical results basing on the Taiwan's data show that both compensation policies, i. e. income tax rate decrease and carbon tax revenues transfer, can reduce the costs of carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> and possibly offset welfare reductions due to implementation of a carbon tax. These results also show that, with respect to allocation and distributional effects, the carbon tax revenues transfer {{is better than the}} income tax rate decrease for the selection in compensation policy.

40|$|Emissions {{testing in}} the {{laboratory}} forms {{an essential part of}} the European type approval procedure for light-duty vehicles. The approach yields reproducible and comparable results and provides clear design criteria for vehicles that have to comply with applicable <b>emission</b> <b>limits.</b> Although <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> have become increasingly stringent in the past decade, road transport remains the most important source of urban air pollution with respect to nitrogen oxides (NOX) and carbon monoxide in Europe. Several studies have indicated that in particular on-road nitrogen oxide emissions of light-duty diesel vehicles might substantially exceed emission levels as identified in the laboratory. Here, we address this problem by using Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) to analyze the on-road emissions of 12 light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles on four test routes, representing rural, urban, uphill/downhill, and motorway driving. The results indicate that average NOX emissions of diesel vehicles (0. 93 ± 0. 39 g/km), including Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0. 62 ± 0. 19 g/km), substantially exceed the respective <b>emission</b> <b>limits.</b> The observed deviations range from a factor of 4 - 7 for NOX emission averages over entire test routes up to a factor of 14 for NOX emissions of individual averaging windows. By comparison, on-road NOX emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as CO (carbon monoxide) and THC (total hydrocarbon) emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally stay within Euro 3 - 5 <b>emission</b> <b>limits.</b> The tested light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles emit during on-road testing on average 189 ± 51 g CO 2 /km (grams carbon dioxide per kilometre) and 162 ± 29 g CO 2 /km, respectively, thereby exceeding the CO 2 emissions as specified during laboratory testing by on average 21 ± 9 %. The cold-start emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles span over a large value range; NOX emissions exceed Euro 3 - 5 <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> by a factor 2 - 14, CO emissions often exceed <b>emission</b> <b>limits,</b> and THC <b>emissions</b> are both below and above Euro 3 - 5 <b>emission</b> <b>limits,</b> respectively. The PEMS equipment is reliable and provides accurate emission measurements. PEMS are able to verify the proper operation of emission control technologies under a wide variety of normal operating conditions as well as test emissions from novel fuel/engine/after-treatment/powertrain technologies (e. g., parallel/serial (plug-in) hybrid vehicles. The PEMS procedure for light-duty vehicles is, however, relatively new and requires further refinement before being applied at large scale. The findings of this report indicate that the current laboratory emissions testing fails to capture the wide range of potential on-road emissions. A promising remedy for this problem may be attained by supplementing the laboratory test with complementary emission test procedures such as PEMS on-road testing. This report provides a first step into that direction, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive EU policy that assures compliance of light-duty vehicles with <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> under normal conditions of use.

Three key factors determine the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> value: (1) the environmental compartment under consideration, with its dimensions and the accounted for, (2) the desired level of environmental protection and (3) the scenario applying to the intended use of the construction material. <b>Emission</b> <b>limit</b> values have been derived here from modelled concentrations in soil, groundwater and surface water. The desired level of protection has been elaborated as a stand-still approach (based on quality target values and a risk-based approach (based on PNECs). Two exposure models were used for taking the effects of a time-dependent exposure of the soil to leached components into account, for vertical transport through the soil profile and for retardation of components in the soil profile. The PEARL model was used for binding described by equilibrium adsorption. The ORCHESTRA model was used for binding that also takes speciation into account. For surface water, a dilution factor was computed assuming a certain mixing zone, dependent on the size of the surface water. The consequences of the proposed alternative <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> values have been estimated on the basis of information in a database containing results of leaching tests for construction materials.

This raises the question of whether intensity-based <b>emissions</b> <b>limits,</b> distinct from the other features of the Bush initiative, offer a useful alternative to absolute <b>emissions</b> <b>limits.</b> This paper makes the case that they do, based on how emissions targets are framed.
