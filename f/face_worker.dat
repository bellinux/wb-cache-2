He was educated at a Durham County school, and left school to start work on his 14th birthday in Chopwell Colliery where he became a coal <b>face</b> <b>worker,</b> and also an officer of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for 15 years, serving as treasurer of his local NUM branch from 1943. He was also a member of Durham County Council from 1947 to 1956.|$|E
50|$|Rudolf Fischer {{was born}} in Dresden. He came from a working-class family. After {{he had taken the}} Abitur in 1921, he worked as a salesman. He would become {{unemployed}} and later was employed as a mail carrier. After World War II, Fischer suffered with health problems, which continued in the post-war era. He began writing narratives and experienced the demands of state jobs of East Germany. He worked as a <b>face</b> <b>worker</b> in the Zwickau coal mines as a source of studying. He received the 1956 Heinrich Mann Prize. He died in Dresden in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|His {{career began}} as a {{laboratory}} assistant at the Batchelors processed food company. [...] He became a <b>face</b> <b>worker</b> at the Thorpe Hesley colliery, and was inspired to paint by the contrast of {{the darkness of the}} mines and the lightness of the real world above the ground.In 1968 disenchantment with the pits led to numerous jobs - labourer, municipal park gardener and a washer upper for some years, nurturing a dream to be a full-time painter. For years he pushed a handcart, packed with paintings round all his local pubs selling what he could in almost folkloric-like tradition, becoming at times like the characters he went on to portray in later scenes.|$|E

40|$|In {{underground}} continuous mining operations, ventilation, water sprays and machine-mounted flooded-bed scrubbers are {{the primary}} means of controlling respirable dust exposures at the working face. Changes in mining arrangements - such as face ventilation configuration, orientation of crosscuts mined {{in relation to the}} section ventilation and equipment operator positioning - can have impacts on the ability of dust controls to reduce occupational respirable dust exposures. This study reports and analyzes dust concentrations measured by the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division for remote-controlled continuous mining machine operators as well as haulage operators at 10 U. S. underground mines. The results of these respirable dust surveys show that continuous miner exposures varied little with depth of cut but are significantly higher with exhaust ventilation. Haulage operators experienced elevated concentrations with blowing face ventilation. Elevated dust concentrations were observed for both continuous miner operators and haulage operators when working in crosscuts driven into or counter to the section airflow. Individual cuts are highlighted to demonstrate instances of minimal and excessive dust exposures attributable to particular mining configurations. These findings form the basis for recommendations for lowering <b>face</b> <b>worker</b> respirable dust exposures.

50|$|Compared to {{manual control}} of the mine equipment, the {{automated}} system yields improved production rates. In addition to productivity gains, automating longwall equipment leads to safety benefits. The coalface is a hazardous area because methane and carbon monoxide are present, while the area is hot and humid since water is sprayed over the face to minimize the likelihood of sparks occurring when the shearer picks strike rock. By automating manual processes, <b>face</b> <b>workers</b> can be removed from these hazardous areas.|$|R

In light of expectations that the future will bring further {{increases in}} income inequality, findings of this dissertation show that this will unambiguously will put pressure on governments to increase their redistributive efforts and on social insurance schemes to cover the increased career risks <b>facing</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The authors find {{evidence}} from Australian time-series data supporting two hypotheses about {{the determination of}} labor absence. First, labor absence modeled in a utility-maximizing framework that stresses the opportunity cost of labor absence receives considerable support from the data. Variables that change the slope and/or shift the budget constraint <b>facing</b> <b>workers</b> affect labor absence. Secondly, the authors find tentative evidence that coercive or difficult work environments, which apparently affect job satisfaction, adversely affect labor absence. In particular, it appears that labor absence is a leading indicator of a deteriorating industrial relations environment characterized by increased industrial disputation.

The number of {{participating}} overseers (Steiger) and officiants (Offiziante), <b>face</b> <b>workers</b> (Hauer) or smelters (Schmelzer) (and, in Freiberg, {{officials of the}} Mining Office and student miners) depended {{on the importance of}} the parade. The size of the detachments varied between 16 and 48 men, and they almost always marched in 4 ranks (rarely 3, 6 or 8). The number of flags carried, the number and type of mining and smelting tools carried on parade and the officers participating on horseback was variable. The size of the parade also affected the number of miners' bands involved.|$|R

Researchers in contract theory have analysed {{cases where the}} principal has full in-formation on agents’ true productivity, and cases where the principal has priors on productivity levels. I contribute to this discussion by introducing the novel assumption that workers’ naïveté depends on their actual productivity level. In particular, I focus on the use the employer makes of this information when designing contracts under asymmetric information. The results highlight a new trade-o the employer faces between exploiting strongly naïve workers and designing effcient contracts for the most widespread type of worker, according to her posteriors...|$|R

This required the erection of a wooden ceiling over the active workings so that packing material did not fall into it and onto the <b>face</b> <b>workers</b> there. If the expected supply of ore or its quality did not justify sinking the main shaft deeper, or if the workings were a long way from it, draw-shafts were sunk. These blind shafts saved having to pack the 'old man'. In the Hornstatt, 1 or 2 labourers (Knechte) worked a hand winch and lifted the ore to the next highest main gallery.|$|R
