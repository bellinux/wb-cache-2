500|$|Donaldson {{returned}} to Yorkshire {{and signed a}} one-year contract with another Championship club, Sheffield United, on 31 August 2017. The undisclosed fee was described by the Birmingham Mail as [...] "nominal". After scoring both of his team's goals in a 2–1 away win at Sunderland on his debut on 9 September, Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder commented: [...] "Not bad for 50 grand that, is it? Not bad from Aldi... We are delighted to get Clayton. He's a good kid. I {{know a lot about}} him. I've tried to sign him enough times, I should know about him. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to me eventually." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 1966–67 season, Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired. Initially, he {{had wanted}} his old player Frank Ramsey as coach, but Ramsey was too {{occupied}} running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice Bob Cousy declined, stating {{he did not want}} to coach his former teammates, and the third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell. However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> On April 16, 1966 Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics followed by a public announcement two days later. Russell thus became the first African American head coach in NBA history, and commented to journalists: [...] "I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it." [...] The Celtics' championship streak ended in his first full season as head coach at eight, however, as Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and overcame the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals. The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, [...] "Great". However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.|$|E

The reason is so that she will have more influence on others. If she is an ugly female, she won’t be very effective, will she?" ...|$|E

2500|$|A new president, Mourad Boudjellal, a born-and-bred Toulonnais {{who made}} his fortune in the comic strip business, promised to build a huge team. He said: [...] "I invented the Top 15, with a team that could be {{competitive}} in the Top 14”. He signed {{a high number of}} first-class players, some of them well above 30, like Jean-Jacques Crenca, Yann Delaigue, Gonzalo Quesada and Dan Luger. He created a lot of buzz around the team as he managed to sign former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga, who arrived in Toulon right {{after the end of the}} Air New Zealand Cup on October 26, 2006. The contract was rumoured to be around €300,000 (£200,000), which Boudjellal claimed to pay from his own pocket, for only 8 to 10 matches. In a 2010 interview, Boudjellal would say about his decision to pursue Umaga, [...] "It was incredible, because we were in the second division and I was speaking with the best player in the world. But <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> and came to play with Toulon." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it. On 27 October 2010, the album main release date was changed to 22 November 2010. On 25 October 2010, Feehily unveiled the final track listing on his official Twitter page as follows: On 1 November 2010, Mark confirmed the two cover songs on the album are, [...] "Chances" [...] by Athlete and [...] "The Reason" [...] by Hoobastank. In the November 2010 issue of Hello Magazine they told them about their competition with Take That and Walsh and Cowell's involvement in the album, [...] "You need competition to keep you on your toes".|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} site of {{the town}} was then located {{near the mouth of}} the Subangdaku River. It was then a satellite territory under the domain of Seilani, which comprises the areas from Sogod to the island of Panaon. Around 1544, due to unfavorable winds, a Spanish expedition headed by Ruy López de Villalobos arrived at the eastern town of Abuyog, Leyte where an aged inhabitant informed Garcia de Escalante Alvarado, the chronicler of the expedition, on the presence of trading posts found in the archipelago:"I asked him , whether there was a big town anywhere on the island of Abuyo [...] and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> {{on the other side of}} the island to the north-west [...] there was a big town called Sugut whither Chinese junks come every year and where there are resident Chinese who have a house for their merchandise. He said that what they buy there is gold and slaves..." [...] On September 6, 1571, Leyte was established as an encomienda with Tandaya as the command post of the Spanish colony in the island. An encomienda was not actually a piece of land, but a favor from the Spanish monarch under which the Spaniard, or the encomendero, receiving the favor was given the right to collect tributes or taxes from the inhabitants of an area assigned to him. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governador-General of the Philippines, assigned Juan de Trujillo as the first encomendero of Tandaya. Miguel de Loarca, one of the first Spanish conquistadores to arrive in the Philippines and conducted one of the earliest census in the country, affirmed that Sogod was already drafted to the encomienda system in 1582. However, the town was pronounced as Tugud or Tugut:"Island of Baybay. About three (3) leagues [...] farther east lies the island of Baybay, or Leyte, as it is also called. It is a large and well-provisioned island, although the people dress in medriñaque [...] Leyte is thickly settled; it may have a population of fourteen or fifteen thousand (14,000-15,000) Indians, ten thousand of whom pay tribute because that has been a people hard to conquer. There are twelve (12) encomenderos; but his Majesty owns none of the Indians. This island is about eighty (80) leagues in circumference, and fifteen (15) or sixteen (16) wide. Its principal settlements and rivers are Vaybay, Yodmuc, Leyte, Cavigava, Barugo, Maraguincay , Palos, Abuyo, Dulaque, Longos, Bito [...] , Cabalian, Calamocan [...] and Tugud. This island possesses neither mines nor gold-placers; the only cloth it produces is medriñaque, which, as I have said before, resembles calico, and is made from a kind of wild banana." ...|$|E

He told me, it was one old Benamuckee that lived beyond all: he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look of innocence said, All things said O! to him. I asked him, if the people who die in his country, went away any where? <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>Yes,</b> they all went to Benamuckee.
