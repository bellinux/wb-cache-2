[...] When NKVD agents broke into the Institute and stole Trotsky's papers, on 6 November 1936, a number of Trotskyists began to suspect that she, along with Mark Zborowski, were NKVD agents. After Lev Sedov died in a Paris hospital under mysterious circumstances in March 1938, his mistress accused Lilia of being an NKVD agent and causing his death. But Lilia was able to convince Trotsky that both she and Zborowski were the innocent victims of NKVD slanders.|$|E

40|$|College is a {{challenging}} yet rewarding time {{in life and}} if you stay motivated and {{keep your eyes on}} your long-term goals, you will be successful regardless of your career choice. I learned about who I was as a person throughout my college years, and I can offer some guidance on both the good choices and mistakes I made on my path to becoming a medical professional. I began undergrad at NSU in 2002, long before the days of the University Center and when the NSU mascot was still a Knight. I majored in Biology and graduated in 2006 with my Bachelor’s in Science. I was very involved during my undergrad days, including sorority life, student government, and being a student employee for Residential Life and Housing. I believe that extracurricular activities and the life skills you develop during your time in undergrad are just as essential as your textbook education. In my 3 rd year at NSU, I came to a point where I was undecided on my future profession. I researched many professions and was offered frequent advice from friends, family and professors. In the end, I decided on a profession that I could enjoy every single day and that would make my life rewarding. I truly love my job as an Audiologist. I diagnose and treat hearing loss and other hearing-related disabilities. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West Palm Beach VA Medical Center and I get to positively impact the lives of our veterans and their families on a daily basis.
