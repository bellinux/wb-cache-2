500|$|In [...] "Duets", Brittany and Santana {{are shown}} {{together}} in bed. A physical {{relationship between the}} two was first alluded to in the season one episode [...] "Sectionals". Rivera sought clarification on the nature of their relationship from [...] "Sectionals" [...] director Brad Falchuk, who informed her that the two characters had been intimate in the past. Series creator Ryan Murphy told Morris that as Glee is a primetime series, {{he did not want to}} show them making out. Interviewed by Brett Berk of Vanity Fair in May 2010, Morris stated that Brittany and Santana were simply best friends, and the show would not be taking them in a [...] "friends with benefits" [...] direction. However, at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour in August 2010, Murphy stated that the characters would in fact kiss on screen in an upcoming episode. Falchuk later explained that the Brittany/Santana storyline had begun [...] "almost as a goof at first", however [...] "then we realised this show is so inclusive, and then there were people we weren't representative of. This whole lesbian-bisexual female community. We're fortunate the network wasn't resistant of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> us try it out, then it became something much deeper." [...] In [...] "Duets", Brittany also had a brief relationship with Artie. Morris told Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post that she is a fan of McHale's, and had been pressing Murphy to give their characters a storyline together since the beginning of the season.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an economy}} {{with a central}} bank, the bank may {{therefore}} attempt {{to keep an eye}} on asset price appreciation and take measures to curb high levels of speculative activity in financial assets. [...] This is usually done by increasing the interest rate (that is, the cost of borrowing money). (Historically, this is not the only approach taken by central banks.

[...] In 1862 Kirby {{was the victim of}} arson, both the music hall in the gardens and his house in Sackville Street were burned down, resulting in high claims for compensation. [...] Plans for developing the land at the gardens for housing started around this time. Frederick Stokes, J.P., an Englishman, the main developer of Rathmines and Portobello at the time, and Chairman of the Rathmines Township Commissioners, who drained <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> it out in building lots, purchased the land.|$|E

2500|$|The Sorting Hat {{originally}} {{belonged to}} Godric Gryffindor, {{one of the}} four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised someone else would have to do it after they died, so Gryffindor took off his hat, enchanted <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> it choose. Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears [...] "patched and frayed and extremely dirty." [...] Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in Order of the Phoenix. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 23, CBS lost the bidding for the footage to Life magazine's $150,000 offer. CBS news {{correspondent}} Dan Rather {{was the first to}} report on the footage on national television after seeing it, although the inaccuracies in his description would contribute to many conspiracy theories about the assassination. In his 2001 book Tell Me A Story, CBS producer Don Hewitt said that he told Rather to go to Zapruder's home to [...] "sock him in the jaw", take the film, copy it, then return <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> the network's lawyers deal with the consequences. According to Hewitt, he realized his mistake after ending their telephone conversation and immediately called Rather back to countermand the order. In a 2015 interview on Opie with Jim Norton, Rather stated that the story was a myth.|$|E
2500|$|Rand {{argued that}} {{the primary focus of}} man's free will is in the choice: 'to think or not to think'. [...] "Thinking is not an {{automatic}} function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make." [...] According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must choose their values: one does not automatically hold one's own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person's actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. [...] "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back in Black was {{released}} on 25 July 1980, {{less than half a}} year after Scott's death. AC/DC were nervous about the future, with Angus saying they were a [...] "bit jittery" [...] during recording. However, the album proved to ease the band's worries, as it became their best selling, most popular and critically respected album. Not only did it go to no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, its success meant AC/DC were the first band since The Beatles to have four albums in the British Top 100 simultaneously, as Highway to Hell, If You Want Blood You've Got <b>It,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> There Be Rock all re-entered the charts right after Back in Black {{was released}}. In the US, the single [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long"/"Have a Drink on Me" [...] became AC/DC's first Top 40 hit in the country, peaking at no. 35. The title track, along with [...] "Hells Bells", [...] "Shoot to Thrill", [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long", and [...] "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution" [...] all became fan favorites and staples of the band's live performances. The other songs on Back in Black were largely ignored after the mid-1980s although [...] "What Do You Do for Money Honey" [...] was revived during the 2001 tour. The 2015 tour brought back [...] "Have a Drink on Me" [...] and [...] "Given the Dog a Bone".|$|E
