40|$|Abstract Purple {{bacterial}} aggregates {{found in}} tidal pools of Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh (Falmouth, Cape Cod, MA) were investigated {{in order to}} elucidate the ecological significance of cell aggregation. Purple sulfur bacteria were <b>the</b> dominant microorganisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> which also contained diatoms and {{a high number of}} small rod-shaped bacteria. Urea in concentrations of ≥ 1 M caused disintegration of <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> while proteolytic enzymes, surfactants or chaotropic agents did not exhibit this effect. This suggests that polysaccharides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> embedding slime matrix stabilize <b>the</b> <b>aggregate</b> structure. <b>In</b> addition cell surface hydrophobicity is involved <b>in</b> <b>aggregate</b> formation. <b>The</b> concentration of dissolved oxygen decreased rapidly below <b>the</b> surface of <b>aggregates</b> while sulfide was not detected. The apparent respiration rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> was high when the purple sulfur bacteria contained intracellular sulfur globules. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> presence of DCMU, respiration remained light-inhibited. Light inhibition disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of KCN. These results demonstrated that respiration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> is due mainly to purple sulfur bacteria. The concentration of bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) a <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> (0. 205 mg Bchl a cm− 3) was much higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool sediments but comparable to concentrations in microbial mats of adjacent sand flats. Purple aggregates may therefore originate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microbial mats rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pools themselves. Rapid sedimentation and high respiration rates of Chromatiaceae <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> would prevent <b>the</b> inhibition of Bchl synthesis if aggregates were lifted off the sediment and up into the oxic pool water by tidal currents. ...|$|R

25|$|One of Democritus' {{arguments}} {{in support of}} atomism was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam.

40|$|AbstractThe {{colonization}} of laboratory-made <b>aggregates</b> by <b>the</b> filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Beggiatoa leptomitiformis, was investigated {{over a period}} of 14 days during winter and spring. <b>The</b> <b>aggregates</b> were generated from natural water from the freshwater zone of the Elbe Estuary using a tilting tube roller.

40|$|Sediment traps were {{deployed}} in an oligotrophic, seasonally anoxic maritime Antarctic lake for 15 months. Immediately after {{the onset of}} <b>the</b> inflow <b>in</b> spring many iron oxyhydroxide <b>aggregates</b> were collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traps. Image analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to examine <b>the</b> <b>aggregates.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aggregates</b> consisted of primary particles that persisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates.</b> <b>The</b> mean diameter of <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> was constant with depth. <b>The</b> <b>aggregates</b> consisted predominantly of iron, phosphorus and oxygen but calcium was also an important constituent. Significant concentrations of manganese and sodium were also detected. The molar ratio Fe:P remained constant at 4 : 1 as did the ratio Fe:Ca at 52 : 1. The concentration of iron, phosphorus and calcium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> increased with depth, whilst the concentration of manganese decreased with depth in parallel with a gradient of increasing anoxia. The stable water column formed under ice cover and the temporal and spatial data provide evidence that the Fe:P and Fe:Ca ratios are constant and characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>aggregates,</b> whilst <b>the</b> overall composition of <b>the</b> <b>aggregates</b> is more dynamic and dependant on redox conditions and water chemistry. ...|$|R

During the five-decades-long dictatorship, the party was constantly suppressed by the political police, the PIDE, which forced its members to live in clandestine status under the threat of arrest, torture, and murder.

25|$|The {{slope of}} the curve at a point on it gives the {{trade-off}} between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, {{an example of a}} real opportunity cost. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. Along the PPF, scarcity implies that choosing more of one good <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aggregate</b> entails doing with less of the other good. Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.|$|E
