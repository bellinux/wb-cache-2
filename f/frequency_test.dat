40|$|AbstractMicrostructural {{features}} {{acting as}} stress raisers lead to localised and inhomogeneously distributed irreversible deformation {{in the very}} high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime although load amplitudes are well below the classical fatigue limit. Hence, changes in the microstructure due to thermally activated processes can result in an overall change of damage mechanism compared to the fatigue behaviour at room temperature. The influence of isothermal testing at elevated temperatures up to 800 °C during high <b>frequency</b> <b>testing</b> was studied {{with regard to the}} VHCF behaviour of the nickel-based superalloys Nimonic 75 and 80 A. This material combination allowed a distinction between the influence of the stability of the initial precipitation condition (precipitation-free, peak-aged, overaged) {{on the one hand and}} the formation of oxide layers on the other hand. High <b>frequency</b> <b>tests</b> were accompanied by extensive metallographic analysis by means of high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Early failure was primarily ascribed to the formation of microcracks in the emerging oxide layers. In this respect, the relevance of high <b>frequency</b> <b>testing</b> regarding the true fatigue behaviour, which in the case of thermally activated microstructural changes implies a likely time dependence of damage mechanisms, will be critically reviewed...|$|R

50|$|When {{performing}} FFT-based spectral measurements, traditionally {{a window}} function {{has been used}} to reduce the effects of discontinuities at the ends of the FFT buffer, but these result in spectral leakage. When generating a single <b>frequency</b> <b>test</b> signal for FFT analysis, it is possible to create the frequency such that it aligns perfectly within an FFT bin-centre frequency. These frequencies are multiples of the frequency resolution of the FFT, given by the sample rate divided by the number of sample points. This results in no spectral leakage and all the power from the signal is present in only one FFT bin. Viewed in the time domain, a sine wave will fit in the centre of an FFT bin if it has a complete number of cycles within the length of the sample buffer. Such signals can be analysed without an FFT window function provided the system is synchronous (i.e., the signal generation and analysis are using the same clock source.) It follows that a stimulus can be constructed of many sine waves (as many as there are FFT bins) and the signal can still be analysed without an FFT window function. This is called multitone analysis. The amplitude and phase of these sine components can be freely adjusted in order to construct a signal with a particular frequency response characteristic.|$|E
