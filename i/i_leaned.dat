25|$|A {{week before}} his 69th birthday, he was {{bedridden}} and infirm. His wasted and frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. Still, the ashtray was by his bedside {{next to a}} radio tuned to ABC Radio National. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> over to kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't get too close, it hurts'.|$|E
25|$|Around 600 however, {{tensions}} flared {{between the}} Armenian Apostolic Church {{and the church}} in Kartli, as the Armenian Church attempted to assert prominence in the Caucasus, in both hierarchical and doctrinal matters, whereas the Catholicos of Mtskheta, Kirion <b>I,</b> <b>leaned</b> towards the Byzantine, Chalcedonian side of the debate, as Kartli was once again seeking imperial support against the Sassanid Empire, who had abolished the Kingdom in 580. The Third Council of Dvin, in 607, sanctioned the rupture with the Armenian Church.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, the duo reunited {{again for}} three songs during Simon's two-night {{engagement}} at New York's Beacon Theatre. This led to meetings in 2008 and a reunion tour of Asia and Australia in June 2009. Their headlining {{set at the}} 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival {{was very difficult for}} Garfunkel, who was experiencing serious vocal problems. [...] "I was terrible, and crazy nervous. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd," [...] he told Rolling Stone several years later. Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord paresis, and the remaining tour dates were postponed indefinitely. His manager, John Scher, informed Simon's camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year, which did not happen, leading to poor relations between the two. Despite tensions, Simon continued to publicly wish his old friend Artie better health and gave him praises for his then angelic voice. Garfunkel regained his vocal strength {{over the course of the}} next four years, performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences.|$|E

2500|$|Recalling his {{involvement}} with Foyt, Hutcherson said that [...] "A.J. had bought a Camaro to run USAC stock cars and we were running at Texas World Speedway at College Station. He had gotten mad about what some reporters had written {{about him in the}} days before the race. Well he sat on the pole and was leading the race when he pulled in with just a couple laps to go. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> in the car and asked him what was wrong and he said, 'Overheating.' I looked at the gauges which were normal and said, 'Why'd you pull out?' He looked at me and said, 'I didn't want to talk to those reporters in Victory Circle.' We had the race won and he parked the damn car!" ...|$|E

A very fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the corner. A little knot of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing up at my window — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G. Phelps Stokes is a rich man — a man of property; he belongs to the capitalist class. The Municipal Ownership League is a rich man's creation. W.R. Hearst belongs in the millionaire class. This is his government. He doesn't {{want to change the}} government. The Socialist Party, the workers' party, and what we want is a government of, for, and by the people who work.' 'Hear, hear!' I called down, leaning far out of the window and clapping my hands.|$|E
