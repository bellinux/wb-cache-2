5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} <b>develop</b> <b>that</b> threatened {{the future of}} the new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E

Named to the team at 17 years old, he was one of three draft-eligible players on the club with John Tavares and Evander Kane. Head Coach Pat Quinn had coached Ellis previously at the World U18 Championships. He selected Ellis to the team as the eighth defencemen, instead of choosing a traditional 13th forward, because of his abilities on the power play. In the semifinal against Russia, Ellis was instrumental in tying the game with five seconds remaining in regulation. Twice, he preventing the puck from being cleared out of the offensive zone, which allowed a play to <b>develop</b> <b>that</b> resulted in Jordan Eberle's game-tying goal.

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 {{as the system}} continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning. The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm. Early on September 26, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to <b>develop.</b> <b>That</b> morning, a ragged eye developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds. The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm leveled off that afternoon as upper-level wind shear increased substantially due {{to the presence of}} a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough. The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters confirmed surface winds of 72mph (115km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening. Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category1 hurricane based on data from the reconnaissance flight late on September 26and the less organized structure of the storm at that time.|$|E

It also created a statewide, moderately progressive, Republican Party, which become a statewide majority, particularly after the 1905 end of the highly personal Addicks controversy.|$|E

Once these extensions were complete the SER closed its passenger terminus at Bricklayer's Arms and converted the site into a goods depot in 1852.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of FAP is {{understood}} to be a genetic mutationâ€”a flaw in the body's tumour suppressor genes that prevent development of tumours. The flaw allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually {{reach the end of}} their life; inevitably one or more will eventually progress and give rise to cancer (7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). The flawed genes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body's ability to protect against the risk of aged cells becoming cancerous. Even with the flawed gene, it may still take time before a cell actually does <b>develop</b> <b>that</b> is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, ZFS {{allocate}} writes across vdevs {{based on the}} free space in each vdev. This ensures that vdevs which have proportionately less data already, are given more writes when new data is to be stored. This helps to ensure that as the pool becomes more used, the situation does not <b>develop</b> <b>that</b> some vdevs become full, forcing writes to occur on {{a limited number of}} devices. It also means that when data is read (and reads are much more frequent than writes in most uses), different parts of the data can be read from as many disks as possible at the same time, giving much higher read performance. Therefore, as a general rule, pools and vdevs should be managed and new storage added, so that the situation does not arise that some vdevs in a pool are almost full and others almost empty, as this will make the pool less efficient.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the Ryton through Worksop is largely man-made. It {{originally}} flowed much nearer to Castle Hill, probably forming part of the defences, but was diverted in 1842 into a channel further north when the 4th Duke of Newcastle constructed Newcastle Street, in order to <b>develop</b> <b>that</b> part of the town. The river is then culverted as it passes under a shopping complex and the shops of Bridge Street. This section counts as a confined space, and was surveyed in 2007, in {{a joint venture between}} the Environment Agency, a team of divers, and Bassetlaw District Council. Some five tons of debris, half a ton of steel, and some stolen goods were removed from the culvert during the exercise. Beyond Watson Road bridge, sluices and extra channels point to the existence of the mill near the Priory. Priory Water Mill was in use from the medieval period until 1876, and a large lake called the Canch was formed in 1820, by constructing a dam across the leat which fed it. The Canch gradually became polluted, and was filled in when milling ceased in 1876. The buildings were utilised by William Bramer and Sons for their business of making chairs until they burnt down in 1912, and the site has more recently become the location of a sensory garden. Three channels continue under Priorswell Road through separate bridges, cross Bracebridge field, and join up again near the old High Hoe Road bridge.|$|E
