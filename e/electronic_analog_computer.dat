50|$|Microwave gun-laying system {{development}} {{had already started}} in Great Britain, and it was included with high priority at the Rad Lab due to its urgent need. The project, with Ivan Getting leading, started with the same 10-cm breadboard used in the AI project. Development of the GL system was challenging. A new, complex servomechanism was needed to direct a large parabolic reflector, and automatic tracking was required. On detection of a target, the receiver output {{would be used to}} put the servo control into a track-lock mode. The mount and reflector were developed with the Central Engineering Office of Chrysler.

50|$|Voltage {{control in}} analog music synthesizers {{is similar in}} {{principle}} to how voltage is used in <b>electronic</b> <b>analog</b> <b>computers,</b> in which voltage is a scaled analog of a quantity {{that is part of}} the computation. For instance, control voltages can be added or subtracted in a circuit almost identical to an adder in such a computer. Inside a synthesizer VCO, an analog exponential function provides the 1 volt per octave control of an oscillator that basically runs on a volts/kHz basis. Positive voltage polarity raises pitch, and negative lowers it. The result is that, for example, a standard keyboard can have its output scaled to that of a quarter-tone keyboard by changing its output to one-half volt per octave, with no other technical changes.|$|R
5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from <b>electronic</b> <b>analog</b> <b>computers</b> and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R
