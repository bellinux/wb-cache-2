40|$|Deep drawing {{characteristics}} of cold rolled sheets and aluminum sheets are discussed. First priority {{is dedicated to}} the change of strain-rate value during press forming. With rise of strain-rate the deep drawing characteristics could be changed. Mostly uniaxial tensile test results are discussed. Steel material has been also tested by using a newly designed type of biaxial cruciform specimens. The most important basis for comparative evaluation of cold formability is derived from tensile testing. One of the deformation-dependent parameters influencing forming limits is hardness with close relation to elongation, deformation of grains and compressive instability. There were examined changes in micro-hardness of steel during plastic deformation, which is characterized by the area of non-homogenous deformation. Measuring of micro-hardness was realized after uniaxial tensile testing carried out on <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Study of microstructure and texture development was also provided. <b>Steel</b> and aluminum <b>sheets</b> were measured at SEM (EDS) and <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were evaluated by X-ray diffraction methods.

40|$|The {{paper is}} based on results {{obtained}} from topography of surfaces of <b>sheets</b> rolled from <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> of the type KOHAL grade 697, non-alloy low-carbon structural steel EN 10263 - 2 : 2004 and aluminium. The presented results document correctness of {{the assumption that the}} rolling force Froll increases with the increasing reduction Δh {{and the quality of the}} rolled surface is improved at the simultaneous increasing of strength of rolled sheets and the decreasing of size of structural grains. The experiment was performed on the two-high rolling stand DUO 210 SVa, which enables only non-continuous technology in contrast to the rolling mill with continuous reduction on one sheet in several degrees on rolling trains, in consequence of which the obtained height parameters of the section are in close correlation with the predicted dependence. Contribution of the work consists in the creation of a mathematical model (algorithm) for predicting technological parameters of the two-high rolling stand DUO 210 SVa at change of the absolute reduction Δh, for example for a <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> of the type KOHAL grade 697 and non-alloy lowcarbon structural steel PN EN 10263 - 2 : 2004 and aluminium, and also in the development of a method of calculation applicable to any material being rolled in general, because the authors have found that various materials can be differentiated by a derived analytical criterion IKP. This criterion is a function of ratio between the modulus of elasticity of reference material and that of actually rolled material. The reference material is here <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> of the type KOHAL grade 697. Verification was carried out by measuring changes of final surface roughness profile and final strength of rolled sheets of the stated materials in relation to reductions and those were compared with theoretically predicted values. It is possible to identify and predict on the basis of this algorithm an instant state of surface topography in respect to variable technological conditions.

40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on characterization of CO 2 {{laser beam welding}} (LBW) of dual phase (DP) and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> based on experimental, numerical simulation and statistical modeling approaches. The experimental work aimed to investigate the welding induced-microstructures, hardness, tensile properties and formability limit of laser welding butt joints of DP/DP, TRIP/TRIP and DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> under different welding speeds. The effects of shielding gas types and flow rates on the weldability of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were also studied. The simulation of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> through welding induced-temperature field, thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortions using Sysweld 2010 software v 12. 0 was the second goal of this research. Also stretch formability (Erichsen test) was simulated in this step using Abaqus/CAE software v 6. 9 - 1. The aim of statistical modeling was to predict and optimize laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in industry through applying a three-factor-three-level Box-Behnken statistical design with full replication as a design of experiment (DoE) approach to design the experiments, develop mathematical models and optimize the welding operation. This was achieved by controlling selected welding parameters: laser power, welding speed and focus position. The experimental {{results showed that the}} CO 2 LBW is a successfully welding process for butt joining of DP and TRIP <b>steels</b> <b>sheets.</b> The LBW of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> is successfully numerically simulated using the finite element (FE) code SYSWELD when using a 3 D Gaussian distribution heat source model with a conical shape. There are good agreements between the experimental- and FE- results during simulation of stretch formability of DP/TRIP steel weldments when using von Mises yielding model as yielding criterion.
