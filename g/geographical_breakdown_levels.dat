40|$|This paper investigates a {{specific}} aspect of international production linkages that, following Hummels et al. (2001), is commonly designated as vertical specialization (VS) - {{the use of}} imported inputs to produce goods that are afterwards exported. We propose a relative measure of VS-based trade that combines information from Input-Output matrices and international trade data, producing results for a large sample of individual countries and geographical areas with a detailed product breakdown over the 1967 - 2005 period. This measure identifies a country’s trade flow as associated with VS activities when the share of exports of a good relatively to the world average is above a given threshold and it {{is accompanied by a}} relative share of imports of a related intermediate product that is also above the threshold. The quantification of VS-based trade for each country/product pair in each period is made in a relative and conservative manner, since it includes only the value of intermediate imports that surpasses what is implied by the chosen international threshold. The detailed results can be subsequently added up to get any product or <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> desired. We illustrate this measure by showing the evolution of VS activities at the world level over the last four decades using a product breakdown by technological intensity and a <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> by main areas. The results point to a substantial increase of VS in high-technology products over the last two decades. There is also empirical evidence on the sharp increase of VS activities in East Asia. ...|$|R

Standard lightning impulse of 1. 2 / 50 is used in this study, along with three difference electrode configurations (rod-rod electrode, rod-sphere electrode and sphere-sphere electrode) with variable gap lengths. In addition, the lightning impulse <b>breakdown</b> <b>level</b> considering utilization factors are studied for the establishment of insulation design criteria of high voltage power equipment. The utilization factors are represented as the ratio of minimum electric field (Emin) to maximum electric filed (Emax). COMSOL software is used to develop electrode model in order to analyses the electric field. It was found that higher gap lengths provide higher U 50 for a given electrode configuration, although the rise in U 50 is more clearly in sphere-sphere electrode configuration. Where, sphere-sphere electrode configuration require higher U 50 to breakdown it is 40 % than rod-sphere electrode configuration (30 %) and rod-rod electrode configuration (28 %), respectively. A difference in Emax values where the higher gap length provide lower Emax for sphere-sphere electrode configuration, while the higher gap length provide higher Emax for rod-rod and rod-sphere electrode configurations. Considering the effects of field utilization factor, which was based on difference electrode configurations, it was found that sphere-sphere electrode more uniformity at gap length 0. 5 cm (0. 9968) than rod-rod electrode at gap length 1 cm (0. 2057) and rod-sphere electrode at gap length 1 cm (0. 1546). Where the values of each field utilization factor (ɳ) is 1 in the uniform field and 0 <ɳ< 1 is in the non-uniform.

Also, strong linkages between real estate regions and financial assets are noted in the second period. The South is the only region to exhibit segmentation in both periods.

Reactions are different across types of consumers: while homeowners increase consumption when house prices increase, with a marginal propensity of about 0. 035, the rentersÂ’ response to the higher house cost tends to be that of increased savings.

This logic breaks down in a world where companies work and compete on a global basis and are recognized as such by investors in their pricing of securities.
