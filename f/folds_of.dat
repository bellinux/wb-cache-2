5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{role of the}} C-terminal loop L 137 -S 141 in {{the folding}} and <b>folding</b> {{stability}} <b>of</b> staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was investigated by deletion mutation. The C-terminal truncated SNase fragments, SNase 137, SNase 139, SNase 140, and SNase 141 containing residues 1 - 137, 1 - 139, 1 - 140, and 1 - 141, respectively, were adopted in this study. <b>Folding</b> states <b>of</b> these four SNase fragments were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. The solution structure of SNase 140 was determined and compared to those of SNase 141 and native SNase using the heteronuclear NMRmethod. The results showed that <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the four SNase fragments is correlated with the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> helix R 3. With the chain length extending from L 137 and I 139 to S 141, <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the fragments progressively approached to the tertiary <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> native SNase, and the folding stability was enhanced. These observations revealed that the C-terminal loop L 137 -S 141 has profound effect {{not only on the}} <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> helix R 3 but also on the stabilizing <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> both theR- and β-subdomains of SNase. Analysis indicates that stabilizing <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the SNase and SNase fragments depends to a large extent on the hydrophobic packing interactions in both the C-terminal local structural region surrounding W 140 including the loop L 137 -S 141 and the N-terminal local structural region of the “β-barrel ” hydrophobic core.

40|$|AbstractScrambled isomers (X-isomers) {{are fully}} oxidized, {{non-native}} isomers of disulfide proteins. They {{have been shown}} to represent important intermediates along the pathway <b>of</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> numerous disulfide proteins. A simple method to assess whether X-isomers present as folding intermediate is to conduct oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> fully reduced protein in the alkaline buffer alone without any supplementing thiol catalyst or redox agent. Cardiotoxin-III (CTX-III) contains 60 amino acids and four disulfide bonds. The mechanism <b>of</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III has been systematically characterized here by analysis of the acid trapped <b>folding</b> intermediates. <b>Folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III was shown to proceed sequentially through 1 -disulfide, 2 -disulfide, 3 -disulfide and 4 -disulfide (scrambled) isomers as folding intermediates to reach the native structure. When <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III was performed in the buffer alone, more than 97 % of the protein was trapped as 4 -disulfide X-isomers, unable to convert to the native structure due to the absence of thiol catalyst. In the presence of thiol catalyst (GSH) or redox agents (GSH/GSSG), the recovery of native CTX-III was 80 – 85 %. These results demonstrate that X-isomers play an essential and predominant role in the oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III...|$|R

5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while all {{construction}} was stayed, Reclamation conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the dam site, even though these delays caused {{the cost of the}} project to rise with every passing year. The studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn Dam site, with many <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> metamorphic rock formed by the contact of the foothill rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada. Reclamation predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey projected a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, Reclamation redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch gravity dam, to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.|$|E

Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son.

5|$|Two thick <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> skin {{encircle}} {{the body}} {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We review our joint experimental-theoretical {{effort on}} the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> photo-switchable �-helices.

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a semi-quantitative agreement with the complex response observed in the experiment, allowing one to discuss the process in unprecedented detail. It is found that the nonexponential response is to a large extent introduced by the photo-linker used to initiate <b>folding.</b> Hence, <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> these cross-linked peptides emulates formation of a helical segment {{in the context of a}} globular protein rather than <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> an isolated peptide...|$|R

5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
