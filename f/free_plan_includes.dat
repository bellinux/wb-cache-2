40|$|Bioinformatics {{is a broad}} {{discipline}} in which one common denominator {{is the need to}} produce and/or use software that can be applied to biological data in different contexts. To enable and ensure the replicability and traceability of scientific claims, it is essential that the scientific publication, the corresponding datasets, and the data analysis are made publicly available [1, 2]. All software used for the analysis should be either carefully documented (e. g., for commercial software) or, better yet, openly shared and directly accessible to others [3, 4]. The rise of openly available software and source code alongside concomitant collaborative development is facilitated by the existence of several code repository services such as SourceForge, Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub, among others. These resources are also essential for collaborative software projects because they enable the organization and sharing of programming tasks between different remote contributors. Here, we introduce the main features of GitHub, a popular web-based platform that offers a free and integrated environment for hosting the source code, documentation, and project-related web content for open-source projects. GitHub also offers paid plans for private repositories (see Box 1) for individuals and businesses as well as <b>free</b> <b>plans</b> <b>including</b> private repositories for research and educational use.

50|$|Wall.fm was {{launched}} as WackWall in February 2010. The second version of WackWall, which was later renamed to Wall.fm, was powered by OpenWack software that eventually evolved into Oxwall. Wall.fm exited beta in October 2010, and started introducing paid plans and changes to free accounts, such as displaying the vendor's ads across the <b>free</b> <b>plan</b> sites, and <b>including</b> a site monetization pack into Ultimate plan features. On May 15, 2011 Wall.fm updated their Terms of Use limiting {{the use of}} the service to persons over 18 years old, and introducing regulations for sites intended for use by children under 13 years old. On February 27, 2012 Wall.fm announced significant changes in their pricing policy and user account interface, making subscription plans more affordable although limited in disk space/bandwidth, and site account management more user-friendly. As of May 2011, over 3000 sites are built with Wall.fm service each month.|$|R

50|$|The Hope Clinic Lukuli was {{recognised}} by the Kampala City Council {{as being}} deserving of {{financial support for}} the July 2006 to June 2007 financial year. The public private support has been in three forms from the city. A lump sum contribution to our operational overheads and staff costs was made to the equivalent of one month's net salary for the medical team. A smaller amount was deposited by the city council to the Joint Medical Stores from whom we procure our drugs and medical consumables. The credit line amounts to only 10% of monthly drug costs but the clinic has applied it to the various items used for maternity ante-natal and deliveries. This helps maintain a low cost of US$15 to deliver a baby including the overnight stay in a private delivery room. The third support is the provision of <b>free</b> family <b>planning</b> items <b>including</b> oral and injectable contraceptives.|$|R

Two notable architects include Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe and Eduardo Catalano. Three of Van Der Rohe’s most notable buildings that portray the use of <b>free</b> <b>plan</b> are the Barcelona Pavilion [...] and the New National Gallery in Berlin [...] and the Crown Hall building at the Illinois Institute of Technology. [...] All three of these buildings show great expanses in floor plan due to the freedom from use of <b>free</b> <b>plan.</b> Notably, the Barcelona Pavilion expresses <b>free</b> <b>plan</b> by having glass walls and large expanses and openings in the outside façade of the building. It also has a completely open <b>free</b> floor <b>plan</b> in the interior with sections divided by walls lower than ceiling height to distinguish rooms and areas, {{something that can be}} done in any fashion through the use of <b>free</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R

50|$|Corbusier adopted what he {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} five architectural points in his architecture: pilotis, <b>free</b> <b>plan,</b> horizontal windows, a free façade and roof top gardens. The ideas all surface around the main point of <b>free</b> <b>plan</b> and the use of the Dom-ino system. The piloti system carries all the weight allowing for a <b>free</b> <b>plan</b> as well as a free façade. The free exterior façade allowed for vast openings and horizontal strips of windows creating aesthetic value. All of the five points work together, being based off the premises of the Dom-ino system, varied to a degree for aesthetic purposes.|$|R
50|$|Eduardo Catalano {{achieves}} {{the ultimate}} <b>free</b> <b>plan</b> in his Catalano residence in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1955 by using thin shield concrete {{to achieve a}} completely <b>free</b> floor <b>plan.</b> By using the concrete in his roof, he designs a hyperbolic parabolic roof that is self-supporting with only two points touching the ground. No other points of contact support the roof. In doing this he achieves a floor plan that is completely independent of its roof structure. The roof stands by itself, and creates its own structure. This achieves, by definition, a completely independent <b>free</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R

The optimal heuristic of a delete <b>free</b> <b>planning</b> problem is called h +. This thesis explores two new ways to compute h +.

40|$|Nowadays, {{thanks to}} the massive usage of the Cloud, {{different}} providers offer storage as a service solutions. Each of these solutions is characterized by different storage capacity and features. They are also offered according to various business models, typically, users can choose between <b>free</b> <b>plans</b> (with {{a limited amount of}} space) and paid <b>plans.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>plans</b> users, when the storage capacity lowers, tend to subscribe to new <b>free</b> <b>plans</b> from other providers, thus increasing the so called data fragmentation. This phenomenon heavily increases the file management complexity. This paper proposes a solution to the data fragmentation problem, by describing an innovative approach which allows to deploy a distributed file system on top of different SaaS storage accounts, offered by different providers. This approach, not only lowers the complexity of data management by providing a single transparent storage solution to the user, but it is also able to provide features like full-text search, file classification and categorization, data analytics (MapReduce) on top of these SaaS storage accounts. Furthermore, this approach proposes a new way to address data privacy and security issues, typically connected to SaaS storage accounts...|$|R
