It debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number ten on August 22, 2006, reached number one, and remained on the show for thirty-five days until it was replaced by the music video for [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2006).

That claim cannot be verified as Carreon died in 1992. [...] In addition, Letson claimed he was given information by way of Kerry's crewmen who accompanied him to the clinic, but neither Zaladonis nor Runyon accompanied Kerry, nor has any crewman {{who was on the}} nearby Swift Boat supported this claim.|$|E
