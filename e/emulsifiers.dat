40|$|In {{this work}} {{surfactant}} systems of cosmetically interest are examined by static and dynamic NMR-methods {{in order to}} get more insight in stabilization mechanisms of emulsions used for cosmetic products. Cosmetic oil in water emulsions with a stearyl phosphate <b>emulsifier</b> were examined by means of static and dynamic 31 P NMR techniques in order to characterize the molecular properties of the <b>emulsifier</b> in situ. The interfacially bound <b>emulsifier</b> can be detected by high resolution NMR spectroscopy, whereas the excess <b>emulsifier</b> exists as a solid lipid phase not detectable by this technique. The emulsions and the <b>emulsifier</b> raw material were examined by solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectroscopy to prove the existence of solid <b>emulsifier</b> phases in the emulsions. By applying dynamic 31 P NMR methods to the interfacially bound <b>emulsifier,</b> information about the molecular dynamics at the interface was obtained. The results of the T 1 and T 2 relaxation time measurements indicate a restricted motion of the molecules which is dependent on the oil droplet size in the emulsions. This was verified by NMR pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) self-diffusion measurements on emulsions with different droplet sizes. In conclusion it can be stated that only about 4 % of the <b>emulsifier</b> are bound at the interface while the excess forms solid lipid phases. The coverage of the interface seems to be independent of the <b>emulsifier</b> concentration. The molecular mobility of the <b>emulsifier</b> at the interface indicates the two dimensional environment of the molecules on the droplets surface. These results are checked by 13 C NMR spectroscopic examinations on emulsions with more complex <b>emulsifier</b> systems. Surfactant systems show in general several molecular populations with different dynamic behaviour detectable by NMR techniques. The exchange rate between the different molecular states determines if the states can be detected separately in the NMR spectrum or if the signals coalesce to one line...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the {{dispersed}} state of soy phosphatidylcholine on emulsification is investigated. The <b>emulsifier</b> is either dispersed in the aqueous phase (coarsely, as small vesicles, as large vesicles), or it is dispersed in the oil phase. Oil-in-water emulsions are prepared with the <b>emulsifier</b> present in the different dispersed states. High-pressure homogenization is used for the emulsification and the impact of pressure, number of passes through the homogenizer and <b>emulsifier</b> concentration is investigated by determination of droplet size and surface loads. Pre-emulsions made using a rotor-stator mixer have a smaller average droplet diameter when the <b>emulsifier</b> is dispersed in the oil phase than in the aqueous phase whereas the smallest droplets are obtained with small vesicles when high-pressure homogenization and repeated passages is used. Moreover, the droplet size can be significantly decreased by increasing the number of passages while an increased pressure has a smaller effect on droplet size. Hence, for a slow adsorbing <b>emulsifier,</b> repeated passages through the homogenizer may be more efficient since successive adsorption can occur. The surface loads, adsorption yields and emulsification efficiencies are observed to depend on the emulsification conditions and dispersed state of the <b>emulsifier.</b> The results from this study illustrates that the dispersion of the <b>emulsifier</b> may {{have a significant impact on}} emulsification and, hence, it may be important to consider the dispersed state of the <b>emulsifier</b> in order to achieve desired emulsion properties...|$|R

The PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles prepared without the addition of <b>emulsifier</b> {{can result in a}} relative lower EE, which was found to be 48.35 % for 10 % drug loading and 58.87 % for 2.5 % drug loading. For the high drug loading of 10 %, however, the EE of the docetaxel-loaded PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles can be improved by the addition of TPGS in the process as <b>emulsifier.</b> The drug EE increased significantly to near 100 % for 10 % drug loading when 0.03 % TPGS was added as <b>emulsifier</b> and to 85.85 % when 0.06 % TPGS was added. Thus, too little <b>emulsifier</b> would not be enough to cover the interface and too much <b>emulsifier</b> would cause nanoparticle aggregation [23]. It can be seen from Table 1 that 0.03 % TPGS used as an <b>emulsifier</b> did improve the EE of the PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles from 48.35 to 99.31 % for a high drug loading of 10 %.|$|R
25|$|Initially {{milk fat}} is {{secreted}} {{in the form}} of a fat globule surrounded by a membrane. Each fat globule is composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols and is surrounded by a membrane consisting of complex lipids such as phospholipids, along with proteins. These act as <b>emulsifiers</b> which keep the individual globules from coalescing and protect the contents of these globules from various enzymes in the fluid portion of the milk. Although 97–98% of lipids are triacylglycrols, small amounts of di- and monoacylglycerols, free cholesterol and cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, and phospholipids are also present. Unlike protein and carbohydrates, fat composition in milk varies widely in the composition due to genetic, lactational, and nutritional factor difference between different species.|$|E
25|$|Unhomogenized {{milk and}} cream contain {{butterfat}} in microscopic globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid <b>emulsifiers)</b> and proteins, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from {{the other parts of}} the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.|$|E
25|$|When {{surfactants}} {{are present}} above the {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC), they can act as <b>emulsifiers</b> that will allow a compound that is normally insoluble (in the solvent being used) to dissolve. This occurs because the insoluble species {{can be incorporated into}} the micelle core, which is itself solubilized in the bulk solvent by virtue of the head groups' favorable interactions with solvent species. The most common example of this phenomenon is detergents, which clean poorly soluble lipophilic material (such as oils and waxes) that cannot be removed by water alone. Detergents clean also by lowering the surface tension of water, making it easier to remove material from a surface. The emulsifying property of surfactants is also the basis for emulsion polymerization.|$|E

30|$|The {{combination}} {{of two or more}} nanoparticles can be employed to stabilize emulsion.

Using mixture <b>emulsifier</b> during homogenization process can reduce the size of the droplet produced. This is because one of the <b>emulsifier</b> may adsorb quickly and reduce the IFT. But may be less effective in stabilizing the droplet against coalescence. Whereas the other <b>emulsifier</b> may be less effective at reducing IFT but, maybe very effective in impeding droplet coalescence.|$|R

25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, <b>emulsifiers</b> are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E
