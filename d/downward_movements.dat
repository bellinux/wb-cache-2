60|$|In South America, {{everything}} {{has taken place}} on a grand scale, and all geological phenomena are still in active operation. We know how violent at the present day the earthquakes are, we have seen how great an area is now rising, and the plains of tertiary origin are of vast dimensions; an almost straight line {{can be drawn from}} Tierra del Fuego for 1,600 miles northward, and probably for a much greater distance, which shall intersect no formation older than the Patagonian deposits; so equable has been the upheaval of the beds, that throughout this long line, not a fault in the stratification or abrupt dislocation was anywhere observable. Looking to the basal, metamorphic, and plutonic rocks of the continent, the areas formed of them are likewise vast; and their planes of cleavage and foliation strike over surprisingly great spaces in uniform directions. The Cordillera, with its pinnacles here and there rising upwards of twenty thousand feet above the level of the sea, ranges in an unbroken line from Tierra del Fuego, apparently to the Arctic circle. This grand range has suffered both the most violent dislocations, and slow, though grand, upward and <b>downward</b> <b>movements</b> in mass; I know not whether the spectacle of its immense valleys, with mountain-masses of once liquified and intrusive rocks now bared and intersected, or whether the view of those plains, composed of shingle and sediment hence derived, which stretch to the borders of the Atlantic Ocean, is best adapted to excite our astonishment at the amount of wear and tear which these mountains have undergone.|$|E
6000|$|It is now {{generally}} {{admitted that}} we may safely reason on such facts as those, which supply a link in the defective geological record. The upward and <b>downward</b> <b>movements</b> which any country has undergone, and the succession of such movements, can be determined with much accuracy; but geology alone can tell us nothing of lands which have entirely disappeared beneath the ocean. Here physical geography {{and the distribution of}} animals and plants are of the greatest service. By ascertaining the depth of the seas separating one country from another, we can form some judgment of the changes which are taking place. If there are other evidences of subsidence, a shallow sea implies a former connexion of the adjacent lands; but if this evidence is wanting, or if there is reason to suspect a rising of the land, then the shallow sea {{may be the result of}} that rising, and may indicate that the two countries will be joined at some future time, but not that they have previously been so. The nature of the animals and plants inhabiting these countries will, however, almost always enable us to determine this question. Mr. Darwin has shown us how we may determine in almost every case, whether an island has ever been connected with a continent or larger land, by the presence or absence of terrestrial Mammalia and reptiles. What he terms [...] "oceanic islands" [...] possess neither of these groups of animals, though they may have a luxuriant vegetation, and a fair number of birds, insects, and landshells; and we therefore conclude that they have originated in mid-ocean, and have never been connected with the nearest masses of land. St. Helena, Madeira, and New Zealand are examples of oceanic islands. They possess all other classes of life, because these have means of dispersion over wide spaces of sea, which terrestrial mammals and birds have not, as is fully explained in Sir Charles Lyell's [...] "Principles of Geology," [...] and Mr. Darwin's [...] "Origin of Species." [...] On the other hand, an island may never have been actually connected with the adjacent continents or islands, and yet may possess representatives of all classes of animals, because many terrestrial mammals and some reptiles have the means of passing over short distances of sea. But in these cases the number of species that have thus migrated will be very small, and there will be great deficiencies even in birds and flying insects, which we should imagine could easily cross over. The island of Timor (as I have already shown in Chapter XIII) bears this relation to Australia; for while it contains several birds and insects of Australian forms, no Australian mammal or reptile is found in it, and a great number of the most abundant and characteristic forms of Australian birds and insects are entirely absent. Contrast this with the British Islands, in, which a large proportion of the plants, insects, reptiles, and Mammalia of the adjacent parts of the continent are fully represented, while there are no remarkable deficiencies of extensive groups, such as always occur when there is reason to believe there has been no such connexion. The case of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, and the Asiatic continent is equally clear; many large Mammalia, terrestrial birds, and reptiles being common to all, while a large number more are of closely allied forms. Now, geology has taught us that this representation by allied forms in the same locality implies lapse of time, and we therefore infer that in Great Britain, where almost every species is absolutely identical with those on the Continent, the separation has been very recent; while in Sumatra and Java, where a considerable number of the continental species are represented by allied forms, the separation was more remote.|$|E

30|$|For {{vertical}} changes, the mandible {{was found}} to move backward in both the tooth-borne and bone-anchored groups (SNB − 2.2 ° and − 1.3 °, respectively). This, together with the forward movement of the maxilla, contributed to the improvement in the Wits appraisal and ANB changes in both groups. However, the <b>downward</b> <b>movement</b> of the maxilla in the latter group was significantly less. The incorporation of two mini-implants helps in minimizing the <b>downward</b> <b>movement</b> of the maxilla and consequently the clockwise rotation of the mandible in the bone-anchored group (SNL–ML 0.7 ° for the bone-anchored group vs. SNL–ML 2.9 ° for the tooth-borne group, p[*]<[*]. 05). This is also in line with those reported by investigators using bone-anchored devices for maxillary protraction [19 – 21, 27 – 33]. In addition, there is more <b>downward</b> <b>movement</b> of the maxillary incisors in the bone-anchored group compared to the tooth-borne group that helps to maintain the overbite in the bone-anchored group.|$|R

40|$|During rapid aiming, {{movements}} are planned and executed to avoid “worse-case” outcomes that require {{time and energy}} to correct. As such, <b>downward</b> <b>movements</b> initially undershoot the target to avoid corrections against gravity. Illusory target context can also impact aiming bias. Here, we sought to determine how strategic biases mediate illusory biases. Participants aimed to Müller-Lyer figures in different directions (forward, backward, up, down). Downward biases emerged late in the movement and illusory biases emerged from peak velocity. The illusory effects were greater for <b>downward</b> <b>movements</b> at terminal endpoint. These results indicate that strategic biases interact with the limb-target control processes associated with illusory biases.

The monitoring indicated that a dome shaped zone of large <b>downward</b> <b>movement</b> extends up into the overburden strata to a height equal to about the panel width.
