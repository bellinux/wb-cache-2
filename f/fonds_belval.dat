5000|$|Despite the {{difficult}} economic context, the government maintained significant public investments. The European enlargement led the Luxembourgish State to invest {{heavily in the}} improvement and extension of the EU's infrastructure and services, based in Luxembourg. The government was also concerned with consolidating {{the country as a}} European seat. In June 2001 building work commenced on the Place de l’Europe in Luxembourg-Kirchberg. The project included two office towers, an extension of the conference centre as well as a concert hall. The conversion of industrial wastelands of ARBED in Belval constituted the second large construction project started under this government. This development project which aimed to improve the Southern region, manifested the government's decentralisation policy. In February 2001, the company Agora, including representatives of the State, ARBED, and the communes of Esch-sur-Alzette and Sanem, was created to develop the wastelands. The <b>Fonds</b> <b>Belval,</b> a state-owned company, was charged with realising the State's plans on the Belval-Ouest site and to showcase the blast furnaces. The industrial wastelands would host the [...] "Centre de musiques amplifiées" [...] (Rockhal) and a [...] "Cité des sciences, de la recherche et de l’innovation". In healthcare, the government would concentrate its efforts to stem the explosion of costs. A hospital plan provided for the reorganisation of healthcare, by putting more emphasis on outpatient treatment, and rationalising and modernising existing infrastructures.|$|E
