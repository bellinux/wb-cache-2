25|$|The Rodeløkka Line was {{completed}} by January 1900. However, there was not sufficient electricity available to power the tramway. Operations did not commence until March, when the power use for lighting was reduced. It also initially received a ten-minute headway, limited {{by the amount of}} available power. The route ran from Rodeløkka to Nybrua, when it connected to KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line and ran to the latter's main <b>downtown</b> <b>terminal</b> of Egertorget.

50|$|Lucien-L'Allier {{station is}} a {{commuter}} rail terminal in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is the terminal for the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM) Vaudreuil-Hudson, Saint-Jérôme, and Candiac lines. Lucien-L'Allier is in Fare Zone 1.

25|$|The {{commuter}} service was not {{exempt from the}} general decline of the Rock Island through the 1970s. Over time, deferred maintenance took its toll on both track and rolling stock. On the Rock Island, the Capone cars were entering their sixth decade of service and the nearly 30-year-old 2700s suffered from severe corrosion due to the steel used in their construction. LaSalle Street Station, the service's <b>downtown</b> <b>terminal,</b> suffered from neglect and urban decay with the slab roof of the train shed literally falling apart, requiring its removal. By this time, the Rock Island {{could not afford to}} replace the clearly worn-out equipment.|$|E

25|$|As of 2008 {{there is}} no Pier 49 as such; the site {{used to be the}} Washington Street Boat Landing, but is closed off and unused. This was roughly the site of both the pre-fire and post-fire Yesler's Wharf (see above) and of Piers 1 and 2, built by the Northern Pacific some time between 1901 (when the post-fire Yesler's Wharf was demolished) and 1904. The one {{prominent}} remaining feature of the crumbling wharf is the Harbor Entrance Pergola, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally it functioned as a landing point for boats bringing passengers from ships. Over the years since the boat landing was closed, various uses have been proposed, including a terminal for the King County Water Taxi route to West Seattle or a mooring point for the historic tugboat Arthur Foss. As of 2010, the site has become the <b>Downtown</b> <b>terminal</b> for the West Seattle water taxi. On September 26, 2010, a water taxi carrying 78 passengers failed to reverse its engines and slammed into the pier. 7 were injured.|$|E

Route 19 runs every 30 minutes during weekdays and hourly on Saturdays, providing 15 minute weekday service and 30-minute Saturday service between the <b>Downtown</b> <b>Terminal</b> and Mount View Lane. Routes 10 and 11 got a frequency increase to 30 minutes to provide 15-minute weekday service between the <b>Downtown</b> <b>Terminal</b> and Southgate Road, and to the PPCC Transfer Station, where the two routes terminate. Route 10 also regained Saturday service {{for the first time}} since the 2010 service cuts, which allowed 30-minute service between the <b>Downtown</b> <b>Terminal</b> and Southgate Road once again.|$|E
