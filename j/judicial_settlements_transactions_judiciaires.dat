50|$|The {{court system}} of Imperial Russia had {{remained}} intact since {{the reign of}} Catherine II. It included Estates-of-the-realm courts for different estates of the realm. Alexander II introduced a unified two-level system which consisted of General <b>judicial</b> <b>settlements</b> (Общие судебные установления) and Local <b>judicial</b> <b>settlements</b> (Местные судебные установления), where settlement (установление) stands for body or office. Courts were separated from the executive branch.|$|R

50|$|The American Society for the <b>Judicial</b> <b>Settlement</b> of International Disputes was {{organized}} in Baltimore 6 February 1910, at {{the residence of}} Theodore Marburg. The organization aimed for not only {{the creation of a}} permanent tribunal for the <b>judicial</b> <b>settlement</b> of international conflicts, but also wanted to create the sentiment that the international controversies should be resolved by a permanent international court. The Society was the forerunner of the League to Enforce Peace, which developed into the League of Nations concept and ultimately into the United Nations.|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{reactions}} of tort litigants to traditional and alternative litigation procedures. To explore this issue, we interviewed litigants in personal injury cases in three state courts whose cases had been resolved by trial, court-annexed arbitration, <b>judicial</b> <b>settlement</b> conferences, or bilateral settlement. The litigants viewed the trial and arbitration procedures as fairer than bilateral settlement, apparently because they believed that trials and arbitration hearings gave their case more respectful treatment. They were less satisfied with the outcome of <b>judicial</b> <b>settlement</b> conferences than with the outcome of bilateral <b>settlements,</b> because <b>judicial</b> <b>settlement</b> conference outcomes were more likely to fail below their expectations. In general, procedural justice judgments and outcome satisfaction were little related to objective outcome, cost, or delay; instead the evaluations appeared to be determined largely by perceptions of whether the procedure met litigants 2 ̆ 7 criteria for procedural fairness and expectations on outcomes and costs. Gender, income, and race did not have much effect on evaluations...|$|R

50|$|Life {{settlement}} {{investors are}} known as financing entities because they are providing the capital or financing for life <b>settlement</b> <b>transactions</b> (the purchase of a life insurance policy). Life settlement investors may use their own capital to purchase the policies or may raise the capital {{from a wide range}} of investors through a variety of structures. The life settlement provider is the entity that enters into the transaction with the policy-owner and pays the policy-owner when the life <b>settlement</b> <b>transaction</b> closes. In most cases, the life settlement provider has a written agreement with the life settlement investor to provide the life settlement provider with the funds needed to acquire the policy. In this scenario, the life settlement investor is effectively the ultimate funder of the secondary market transaction. However, in some life <b>settlement</b> <b>transactions,</b> the life <b>settlement</b> provider is also the investor; the provider uses its own capital to purchase the policy for its own portfolio.|$|R
