40|$|Marine-based {{sporting}} events are {{emerging as a}} significant contributor to the Australian economy. These events are generally conducted in {{the section of the}} marine environment categorised as the Bathing Reserve or the beach. To date, little research has been undertaken to consider the impact of marine-based {{sporting events}} on the beach. Considerable ambiguity and confusion exists in the current literature about the potential <b>impacts,</b> <b>indicators</b> and <b>measurement</b> methods relating to marine-based sporting events. Hence, the purpose of this research is to explore these issues to develop a practical, efficient and cost effective list of potential impacts, and the associated <b>indicators</b> and <b>measurement</b> methods that can be used by stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of marine-based sporting events and the natural environment. The exploratory research undertaken to achieve this goal comprised three stages. In Stage 1, the literature was reviewed to define terms and develop a Preliminary List of potential environmental impacts relating to marine-based sporting events. In Stage 2, the opinions of five Experts and five Practitioners were sought to further clarify and refine the Preliminary List from Stage 1 and to identify the relevant methods for measuring the environmental impacts. Finally, Stage 3 involved analysing the Refined List and researching the literature to identify potential indicators that corresponded to the environmental impacts and measurement methods identified in the Refined List. The result is a Generic List of potential environmental <b>impacts,</b> <b>indicators</b> and <b>measurement</b> methods relating to marine-based sporting events within the Bathing Reserve...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{is considered to}} be one of the main concerns in the construction industry. Environmental pollution has become a major challenge to construction projects due to the huge amount of pollution caused by construction projects. There are different types of environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), human health (HH) particulate, ozone depletion, and smog. Each of these environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> can be linked to different phases of the construction projects. The overall environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> can be divided into direct, indirect, and operational emissions. This paper presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM) -based methodology for the assessment of environmental impacts in road construction projects. The model takes into account the overall life cycle of the road construction project, which is divided into: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction phase, maintenance phase, operational phase, recycling phase, and deconstruction phase. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. The proposed model solves a major problem for road construction project teams who want to assess the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> associated with their project prior to the start of the execution of their projects...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE Computational Intelligence Society via [URL] <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> are widely accepted as possible measurements of academic journal quality. However, much debate has recently surrounded their use, and alternative journal impact evaluation techniques are desirable. Aggregation of multiple indicators offers a promising method to produce a more robust ranking result, avoiding the possible bias caused {{by the use of}} a single <b>impact</b> <b>indicator.</b> In this paper, fuzzy aggregation and fuzzy clustering, especially the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators are exploited to aggregate the quality scores of academic journals that are obtained from different <b>impact</b> <b>indicators.</b> Also, a novel method for linguistic term-based fuzzy cluster grouping is proposed to rank academic journals. The work allows for the construction of distinctive fuzzy clusters of academic journals {{on the basis of their}} performance with respect to different journal <b>impact</b> <b>indicators,</b> which may be subsequently combined via the use of the OWA operators. Journals are ranked in relation to their memberships in the resulting combined fuzzy clusters. In particular, the nearest-neighbour guided aggregation operators are adopted to characterise the reliability of the indicators, and the fuzzy clustering mechanism is utilised to enhance the interpretability of the underlying ranking procedure. The ranking results of academic journals from six subjects are systematically compared with the outlet ranking used by the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), demonstrating the significant potential of the proposed approach. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A cradle-to-grave {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) was done to identify the environmental impacts related to pentachlorophenol (penta) -treated wooden utility poles. Penta-treated utility poles commonly are used for electricity distribution and transmission, and telecommunications. In addition, this LCA has evaluated the opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts associated with penta-treated poles and has compared the penta-treated pole product to alternative products. A model of penta-treated utility pole life cycle stages was created and used to determine inputs and outputs during the pole production, treating, service life, and disposal stages. Pole production data are based on published sources. Primary wood preservative treatment data were obtained by surveying wood treatment facilities in the United States. Product service life and disposal inventory data are based on published data and professional judgment. Life cycle inventory inputs, outputs, and <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> for penta-treated utility poles were quantified per pole. In a similar manner, an inventory model was developed for the manufacture, service life, and disposal of the primary alternative products: steel and spun concrete utility poles. <b>Impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuel and water use, and emissions {{with the potential to}} cause acidification, smog, ecological toxicity, and eutrophication were quantified for each of the pole products. The GHG, fossil fuel use, acidification, water use, eutrophication, and ecological toxicity <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values for penta-treated poles are less than those for concrete poles.

40|$|Abstract Background Funders {{of medical}} {{research}} {{the world over}} are increasingly seeking, in research assessment, to complement traditional output measures of scientific publications with more outcome-based indicators of societal and economic impact. In the United Kingdom, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) developed proposals for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) to allocate public research funding to higher education institutions, inter alia, {{on the basis of}} the social and economic impact of their research. In 2010, it conducted a pilot exercise to test these proposals and refine <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> and criteria. Methods The <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> proposed in the 2010 REF impact pilot exercise are critically reviewed and appraised using insights from the relevant literature and empirical data collected for the University of Oxford’s REF pilot submission in clinical medicine. The empirical data were gathered from existing administrative sources and an online administrative survey carried out by the university’s Medical Sciences Division among 289 clinical medicine faculty members (48. 1 % response rate). Results The feasibility and scope of measuring research impact in clinical medicine in a given university are assessed. Twenty <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> from seven categories proposed by HEFCE are presented; their strengths and limitations are discussed using insights from the relevant biomedical and research policy literature. Conclusions While the 2010 pilot exercise has confirmed that the majority of the proposed indicators have some validity, there are significant challenges in operationalising and measuring these indicators reliably, as well as in comparing evidence of research impact across different cases in a standardised manner. It is suggested that the public funding agencies, medical research charities, universities, and the wider medical research community work together to develop more robust methodologies for capturing and describing impact, including more valid and reliable <b>impact</b> <b>indicators.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{quite some}} time the {{international}} scientific community has criticized the use of <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> based only on few journals registered at commercially subscribed databases such as the ISI Web of Knowledge (producer of Journal Citation Reports - JCR). Several studies focusing on different subject areas have demonstrated {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of assessing the impact of an article, or journal, from commercial and open-access databases, such as Google Scholar (Segen, 1997; Gisvold, 1999; DuBois and Reeb, 2000; Whitehouse, 2002; Baumgartner and Pieters, 2003; Cameron, 2005; Ha et al., 2006; Mingers and Harzing, 2007). Most of the studies found that there was a strong correlation between <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> measured by a commercial databases (restricted) and open-access in certain field areas (Science, Health, Biological and Applied Social), while areas usually with lesser coverage by commercial databases (Environment, Humanities, among others) end up having lower <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values based on these commercial databases. Moreover, the number of publications in these last areas has shown a significant expansion recently and, therefore, they end up receiving greater impact scores when evaluated by open-access databases. In these cases the correlation between <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> calculated by restricted versus open-access database is significantly lower. In this exercise, developed to obtain impact values of various Brazilian scientific journals in international open-access databases, not only it could be demonstrated the role that the journal Ambiente & Água withholds in the national scientific community (and even international if considered the information published in previous editorials), but also witnesses the degree of efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of the indicators used.

5000|$|Numerous {{efforts have}} {{attempted}} to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet shock data loggers and impact sensors help monitor impacts a player receives. One example is a device created by Schutt Sports during the Arena Football League's 2008 season known as the [...] "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a g-force which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will {{increase the risk of}} a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device. Riddell created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit. Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the [...] season, but it was ultimately not used. In 2013, Reebok developed the Head <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator,</b> which is a quarter-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard. Similarly to Reebok's <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator,</b> Battle Sport Science has released the <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator</b> 2.0. The <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator</b> 2.0 looks to increase long-term brain safety for all those who play football. On February 3, 2013, the NFL and General Electric partnered on a five-year, $50 million project to develop technology to predict brain injuries, show injury severity and the rate of recovery, and to create more protective material.|$|R

Guard rail posts are the supporting structures for highway guard rails. Transportation engineers, as well as public and regulatory interests, have increasing need to understand the environmental implications of guard rail post selection, in addition to factors such as costs and service performance. This study uses a life cycle inventory (LCI) to catalogue the input and output data from guard rail post manufacture, service life, and disposition, and a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to assess anthropogenic and net greenhouse gas (GHG), acidification, smog, ecotoxicity, and eutrophication potentially resulting from life cycle air emissions.

Using constrained random walks, mass points are routed from defined release pixels {{of one to}} many mass movements through a digital elevation model until a defined break criterion is reached. Compared to existing tools, the major innovative features of r. randomwalk are (i) multiple break criteria can be combined to compute an <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> score; (ii) the uncertainties of break criteria can be included by performing multiple parallel computations with randomized parameter sets, resulting in an <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> index in the range 0 – 1; (iii) built-in functions for validation and visualization of the results are provided; (iv) observed landslides can be back analysed to derive the density distribution of the observed angles of reach. This distribution can be employed to compute impact probabilities for each pixel. Further, <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> scores and probabilities can be combined with release indicator scores or probabilities, and with exposure indicator scores.
