5|$|It {{was a brief}} stint back in {{the playing}} squad, with Barton banned for six matches, with a further {{suspended}} six-match ban, for his assault on Dabo. After serving his ban, he played 75minutes in a reserve match and {{said he wanted to}} transform his image to become a role model, before he returned to action in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October. He was booed by Sunderland fans and had missiles thrown at him as he warmed up, as Newcastle lost 2–1. Without him, Newcastle had not recorded a league victory since the second match of the season, but Barton scored a penalty in his second match back to lift the club out of the relegation zone. The suspended six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. The remarks remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> racist. In Newcastle's 2–2 draw with Wigan on 15 November 2008, Barton was injured after a tackle from Lee Cattermole. It was later confirmed that Barton would be out for two months with a medial ligament injury. Returning to the first team at the end of January, he played only twice before again breaking his metatarsal, during a 2–1 defeat to his old club Manchester City.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Montreal for {{training}} {{camp for the}} 1925–26 season, Vézina was noticeably ill, though <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about it. By {{the time of the}} Canadiens' first game on [...] against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he had lost 35 pounds in a span of six weeks, and had a fever of 102 Fahrenheit. Regardless, he took to the ice, and completed the first period without allowing a goal. Vézina began vomiting blood in the intermission before returning {{for the start of the}} second period. He then collapsed in his goal area, and left the game, with former U.S. Olympic team goaltender Alphonse Lacroix taking his place.|$|E
500|$|Boydell was {{responsible}} for the [...] "splendor", and George Steevens, the general editor, {{was responsible}} for the [...] "correctness of text". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was [...] "at first an ardent advocate of the plan" [...] but [...] "soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint. Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition: ...|$|E

500|$|Orford Castle is {{associated}} with the legend of the Wild Man of Orford. According to the chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, a naked wild man, covered in hair, was caught in the nets of local fishermen around 1167. The man was brought back to the castle where he was held for six months, being questioned or tortured; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> and behaved in a feral fashion throughout. The wild man finally escaped from the castle. Later accounts described the captive as a merman, and the incident appears to have encouraged the growth in [...] "wild men" [...] carvings on local baptismal fonts - around twenty such fonts from the later medieval period exist in coastal areas of Suffolk and Norfolk, near Orford.|$|E
500|$|After {{the premiere}} the writer Léon Vallas opined that Stravinsky had written music 30 {{years ahead of}} its time, {{suitable}} {{to be heard in}} 1940. Coincidentally, it was in that year that Walt Disney released Fantasia, an animated feature film using music from The Rite and other classical compositions, conducted by Stokowski. The Rite segment of the film depicted the Earth's prehistory, with the creation of life, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs as the finale. Among those impressed by the film was Gunther Schuller, later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The Rite of Spring sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: [...] "I hope [...] appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto The Rite of Spring... through Fantasia, musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, or at least not until many years later". In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer Paul Hindemith observed that [...] "Igor appears to love it".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of the space program, astronauts and reporters would often socialize {{together}} in Cocoa Beach, and had a very different relationship than they do today. Barbree described his relationship with the astronauts as a friend and confidant, often going out to dinner with them, or socializing together when the astronauts were in town. In his book, Barbree writes that in 1961 Alan Shepard told him an [...] "off the record" [...] fact: He was going to be the first American astronaut in space. Barbree noted that if he were to report this, it would not only jeopardize the friendships, but possibly his career as well, so <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> Barbree also recounts a conversation with Gus Grissom about the astronaut’s concerns regarding Apollo not long before the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Barbree's association with the astronauts had some unexpected bonuses as well, Neil Armstrong carried a gold coin to the moon on Apollo 11 for Barbree, and Pete Conrad flew several flags and patches on Apollo 12, which Barbree later handed out to friends.|$|E

500|$|Radio DJ Kenny Everett {{first met}} Mercury in 1974 when he invited the singer onto his breakfast show on Capital London. As two of Britain's most flamboyant, {{outrageous}} and best-loved entertainers, they shared {{much in common}} and instantly became close friends. Everett would {{play a major role}} in Queen's early success when, in 1975, armed with an advance copy of the single [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", Mercury went to see Everett. While privately Everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> to Mercury and placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, enthused: [...] "forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries". While Capital Radio hadn't officially accepted the song, the anarchic Everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldn't play, before the song [...] "accidentally" [...] started playing, with Everett stating: [...] "Oops, my finger must've slipped." [...] Capital's switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released – on one occasion Everett aired the song 36 times in one day.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare gives Caesar's {{last words}} as [...] "Et tu, Brute? ("And you, Brutus?"). Plutarch and Suetonius [...] each report that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> with Plutarch {{adding that he}} pulled his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators, though Suetonius does record other reports that Caesar said in Greek [...] "καὶ σὺ, τέκνον;" [...] (Kai su, teknon?, [...] "And you, child?") The Latin words Et tu, Brute?, however, were not devised by Shakespeare for this play since they are {{attributed}} to Caesar in earlier Elizabethan works and had become conventional by 1599.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1905 Revolution, the Russian {{government}} {{demanded that}} all radical groups disarm. The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ("RSDLP") were split between more moderate Mensheviks who favored disarming, {{and the hard}} line Bolsheviks, who kept their weapons. State security forces then moved to confiscate Bolshevik arms and suppress the group. Kamo led {{the defense of the}} Bolshevik stronghold in Tiflis against the police and army, commanded by General Fyodor Gryazonov. On , state forces crushed the rebels in the Tiflis workers' district. Kamo was almost killed in the firefight, and was captured.

[...] Kamo soon escaped from prison a second time by [...] "exchanging identity papers with an ignorant peasant." [...] After his escape, Kamo went to the bomb factory of Leonid Krasin, a fellow Bolshevik revolutionary. On , he was present at Stalin's wedding reception to Ketevan Svanidze.|$|E
