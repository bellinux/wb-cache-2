50|$|One {{can also}} {{distinguish}} compressible resources from incompressible resources. Compressible resources, generally throughput ones such as CPU and network bandwidth, can be throttled benignly: the user will be slowed down proportionally to the throttling, but will otherwise proceed normally. Other resources, generally storage ones such as memory, cannot be throttled without either causing failure (if a process cannot allocate enough memory, it typically cannot run) or severe performance degradation, such as due to thrashing (if a working set {{does not fit}} into memory and requires frequent paging, progress will slow significantly). The distinction is not always sharp; as mentioned, a paging system can allow main memory (primary storage) to be compressed (by paging to hard drive (secondary storage)), and some systems allow discardable memory for caches, which is compressible without disastrous performance impact. Electrical power is to some degree compressible: without power (or without sufficient voltage) an electrical device cannot run, and will stop or crash, but some devices, notably mobile phones, can allow <b>degraded</b> <b>operation</b> at reduced power consumption, or can allow the device to be suspended but not terminated, with much lower power consumption.|$|E

The energy management strategy (EMS) is designed to enable <b>degraded</b> <b>operation</b> in case of failure {{of one of the}} energy sources. In the considered architecture, the vehicle is not operational without batteries because they impose the DC bus voltage, hence degraded operations are only considered for failures in the FCS or in the UCS.

40|$|The {{development}} of flight control systems to enhance aircraft safety {{during periods of}} vehicle impairment or <b>degraded</b> <b>operations</b> {{has been the focus}} of extensive work in recent years. Conditions adversely affecting aircraft flight operations and safety may result from a number of causes, including environmental disturbances, <b>degraded</b> flight <b>operations,</b> and aerodynamic upsets. To enhance the effectiveness of adaptive and envelope limiting controls systems, it is desirable to examine methods for identifying the occurrence of anomalous conditions and for assessing the impact of these conditions on the aircraft operational limits. This paper describes initial work performed toward this end, examining the use of fault detection methods applied to the aircraft for aerodynamic performance degradation identification and model-based methods for envelope prediction. Results are presented in which a model-based fault detection filter is applied to the identification of aircraft control surface and stall departure failures/upsets.

40|$|Plans for {{the future}} {{construction}} of the first fusion power plant are already in movement. But before constructing a demonstration power plant (DEMO) there is much work ahead. A crucial part of this work is to choose and test the material the reactor will be constructed with. For this purpose the International Fusion Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) is being developed. IFMIF recreates the same conditions a material would suffer inside of the fusion reactor. It performs this via a D-Li (Deuterium-Lithium) neutron flux with energy of 14 MeV. This flux is provided by an accelerator. One {{of the greatest challenges}} of the IFMIF project is that the test materials condition must be as similar as possible as in a real fusion reactor. For this reason IFMIF must be able to operate continuously to provide as much test data as possible. For this reason Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Inspectability (RAMI) analysis are required to provide the design team with enough data to reach the availability desired. The RAMI Team has created models of IFMIF in order to proper study it and improve its performance; these models have been analyzed using the professional software RiskSpectrum®. But some aspects became difficult to be modeled with RiskSpectrum® as the model grew and the complexity increased. When failure acceptance, beam degradation operation and first maintenance policies appeared, a simulation of the whole performance of the accelerator became needful. Availsim has been created in Stanford University in order to provide availability data for the design of the International Linear Collider (ILC). This software included the features needed by the RAMI team and needed to be adapted to perform with the IFMIF model. Availsim included <b>degraded</b> <b>operation</b> and allowed to repair more than one component at a time. It also allowed including manpower as a restriction to the repairs. But before its utilization by the RAMI team Availsim had to be adapted to accept and simulate the IFMIF model. New features have been added during the adaptation. Availsim is now able to perform multiple iterations during one simulation providing more reliable results. Originally Availsim only took into consideration the most common failure mode for a component. Thanks to the addition of functions multiple failure modes can be studied for each component. Availsim is now also able to decide whether to continue <b>degraded</b> <b>operation</b> or to stop operation to maximize the beam effectiveness. <b>Degraded</b> <b>operation</b> simulation and maintenance strategies allow the availability simulation to be closer to reality.

Considering that constant {{values of a}} Lyapunov function define contour curves that form closed regions around the equilibrium point, {{in this paper we}} present a first sampling mechanism that enforces job executions (sampling, control algorithm computation and actuation) each time the system trajectory reaches a given contour curve. By construction, the sequence of generated samples is stable in the discrete Lyapunov sense. However, {{in order to ensure that}} the system trajectory will tend to zero as time tends to infinity, it must be ensured that the sequence of samples is infinite.

In extreme scenarios, <b>degraded</b> <b>operations</b> due to partial or complete technological failures should never endanger system safety. Many past system evolutions, whether ground-based or airborne, {{have been based on}} trial-and-error, and system safety was addressed only after a specific event yielded dramatic or neardramatic consequences. Future system evolutions, however, must leverage available computation, prior knowledge and abstract reasoning to anticipate all possible system degradations and prove that such degradations are graceful and safe. This paper is concerned with the graceful degradation of high-density, structured arrival traffic against partial or complete surveillance failures. It is shown that for equal performance requirements, some traffic configurations might be easier to handle than others, thereby offering a quantitative perspective on these traffic configurations’ ability to “gracefully degrade”. To support our work, we also introduce a new conflict resolution algorithm, aimed at solving conflicts involving many aircraft when aircraft position information {{is in the process of}} degrading.

In recent years, MLS technology had been introduced to railway applications and greatly enhanced the spatial detail and efficiency when compared to traditional approaches. However, the advance of MLS technology is not completely applied to railway environment. Typical MLS systems rely on integrated navigation {{through the use of}} Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for geo-referencing, while operation under long-term GNSS outages or even GNSS-free environments, such as underground railway or long tunnels, remains a challenging issue due to the <b>degraded</b> <b>operation</b> of standalone inertial navigation. Commercial MLS systems usually employ high performance inertial measurement units (IMU) and various strategies to manage GNSS outages, but GNSS components are still necessary prior to and after experiencing the loss of GNSS signals. To tackle the problem of permanent GNSS outages, alternative methods are introduced to replace the GNSS and so allow the use of MLS systems in GNSS-free underground railway environments. Such approaches encourage the MLS systems to be developed into the Underground Railway Laser Scanning (URLS) systems, which may provide several alternative operational functions for the management of underground railway operation.

This paper describes tests that have been conducted and methods that have been developed for turbo-Brayton components and systems to assure reliable operation. The turbomachines used in these coolers employ self-acting gas bearings to support the miniature high-speed shafts, thus providing vibration-free operation. Because the bearings are self-acting, rubbing contact occurs during initial start-up and shutdown of the machines. Bearings and shafts are designed to endure multiple stop/start cycles without producing particles or surface features that would impair the proper operation of the machines. Test results are presented for a variety of turbomachines used in these systems. The tests document extended operating life and start/stop cycling behavior for machines over a range of time and temperature scales. Contaminants such as moisture and other residual gas impurities can be a source of <b>degraded</b> <b>operation</b> if they freeze out in sufficient quantities to block flow passages or if they mechanically affect the operation of the machines.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{critical}} loads {{may have a}} natural extension {{to the effect of}} orbital debris on space critical infrastructure. As the debris spatial density in an orbit increases, the target load with safety factor threshold would eventually be exceeded (Fig.  8). Satellite operators may begin to notice effects beyond this threshold with the risk of operational problems increasing. Beyond the critical load threshold in that orbit, the debilitating effects on space assets would become more pronounced. Increasingly frequent debris impacts would <b>degrade</b> <b>operations</b> or shorten mission life, catastrophic collisions could end missions, and an increased number of expensive collision avoidance maneuvers would need to be executed by operational spacecraft. Such maneuvers shorten mission life by depleting fuel reserves. Only the lowest orbits in LEO, below approximately 600  km, have a degree of resiliency and sustainability due to the cleansing effect of atmospheric drag and solar cycles. Resiliency of an orbit could potentially be defined as the availability of atmospheric and gravitational forces to cause debris to reenter the atmosphere in a reasonable amount of time (a few days to a few years). Unfortunately, the concept of resiliency is essentially nonexistent in higher orbits, making the accumulation of debris in these orbits problematic and reducing their sustainability.|$|R

Less-than-full power operation causes unburned fuel to accumulate on internal components, thereby <b>degrading</b> <b>operation</b> and eventually leading to failure.

Quality analysis identified more than 10 % of the current data as having consecutive values that are constant, or that saturate at an extreme value. Consequently, the electrical data were not analyzed further. The third objective was condition-change analysis to indicate operational stress under non-ideal operation and machine degradation in proportion to the operational stress. Application of ORNL's novel phase-space dissimilarity measures to the vibration power quantified the rising operational stress in direct proportion to the less-than-full-load power.
