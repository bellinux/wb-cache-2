25|$|As of 2012 the largest-capacity MMC <b>HVDC</b> <b>system</b> in {{operation}} {{is still the}} 400MW Trans Bay Cable scheme but many larger schemes are under construction, including an underground cable interconnection from France to Spain consisting of two 1000MW links in parallel at a voltage of ±320kV.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to line-commutated HVDC converters, voltage-source converters maintain a constant polarity of DC voltage and power reversal is achieved instead by reversing {{the direction of}} current. [...] This makes voltage-source converters much easier to connect into a Multi-terminal <b>HVDC</b> <b>system</b> or “DC Grid”.|$|E
50|$|Converter {{transformers}} for VSC <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> {{are usually}} simpler and more conventional in design {{than those for}} LCC <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> used {{electromechanical}} conversion (the Thury <b>system)</b> but all <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> built {{since the}} 1940s have used electronic (static) converters. Electronic converters for HVDC {{are divided into}} two main categories: ...|$|R
30|$|The VSC-based <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} {{utilized}} in power system {{for many years}} since the first test in 1997. For emerging applications involving the integration of large scale wind power plants, the multi-terminal VSC-based <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> win over the conventional LCC-based <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems.</b> This {{is due to the}} VSC-based HVDC has characteristics as independent control of active and reactive power, possibility to supply passive weak networks and black-start capability, no commutation failure, and reverse power transmission without reversing voltage polarity [1, 2, 3].|$|R
2500|$|Transmission lines {{built in}} Manitoba must {{withstand}} a wide temperature range, ice, and occasional high winds. [...] In 1997, a tornado blew down 19 transmission {{towers of the}} <b>HVDC</b> <b>system</b> north of Winnipeg, reducing transmission capacity from the North to {{a small fraction of}} system capacity. During the several days required for utility employees to repair this line, power was imported from the United States over the 500 kV interconnection. As a consequence, though some major industrial customers were requested to curtail energy use, disruption for most customers remained small.|$|E
2500|$|The {{firing angle}} α {{represents}} the time delay {{from the point}} at which the voltage across a valve becomes positive (at which point a diode would start to conduct) and the thyristors being turned on. From the foregoing equation, it is clear that as the firing angle increases, the mean DC output voltage decreases. [...] In fact, with a line-commutated converter, the firing angle represents the only fast way of controlling the converter. [...] Firing angle control is used to regulate the DC voltages of both ends of the <b>HVDC</b> <b>system</b> continuously in order to obtain the desired level of power transfer.|$|E
2500|$|Manitoba Hydro is the {{electric}} power {{and natural gas}} utility {{in the province of}} Manitoba, Canada. Founded in 1961, it is a provincial Crown Corporation, governed by the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board and the Manitoba Hydro Act. Today the company operates 15 interconnected generating stations. It has more than 527,000 electric power customers and more than 263,000 natural gas customers. Since most of {{the electric}}al energy is provided by hydroelectric power, the utility has low electricity rates. Stations in Northern Manitoba are connected by a <b>HVDC</b> <b>system,</b> the Nelson River Bipole, to customers in the south.

2500|$|HVDC {{converters}} {{can take}} several different forms. Early <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems,</b> built until the 1930s, were effectively rotary converters and used electromechanical conversion with motor-generator sets connected in {{series on the}} DC side and in parallel on the AC side. [...] However, all <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> built since the 1940s have used electronic (static) converters.|$|R

50|$|Most of the <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> in {{operation}} today {{are based on}} line-commutated converters.|$|R
2500|$|Almost all HVDC {{converters}} {{are inherently}} bi-directional; they can convert either from AC to DC (rectification) or from DC to AC (inversion). A complete <b>HVDC</b> <b>system</b> always includes {{at least one}} converter operating as a rectifier (converting AC to DC) {{and at least one}} operating as an inverter (converting DC to AC). Some HVDC systems take full advantage of this bi-directional property (for example, those designed for cross-border power trading, such as the Cross-Channel link between England and France). [...] Others, for example those designed to export power from a remote power station such as the Itaipu scheme in Brazil, may be optimised for power flow in only one preferred direction. [...] In such schemes, power flow in the non-preferred direction may have a reduced capacity or poorer efficiency.|$|E

However in recent years, {{as the use of}} HVDC transmission continues to develop situations have arisen where multiple HVDC links terminate in close proximity in a common AC system area. These emerging system configurations, generally known as multi-infeed <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems,</b> are particularly inherent in regional power systems predominantly interconnected by HVDC links. Already such configurations are apparent in the Scandinavian and North European power system interconnection.

50|$|Some <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} built with three level converters, but today most new VSC <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> are being built with some form of {{multi-level}} converter, most commonly the Modular Multi-Level Converter (MMC), in which each valve consists {{of a number of}} independent converter submodules, each containing its own storage capacitor. The IGBTs in each submodule either bypass the capacitor or connect it into the circuit, allowing the valve to synthesize a stepped voltage with very low levels of harmonic distortion.|$|R
40|$|High voltage {{direct current}} (<b>HVDC)</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been used}} as an {{effective}} solution to transmit power over long distances. Performance of <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> has significantly improved with the emergence of voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC). Increased controllability provides independent control of active and reactive power which facilitates controlling of voltage and frequency. This paper investigates the frequency control capability of VSC-HVDC to determine the improvement extent that VSC <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> provide for the frequency recovery and system inertia. Two frequency control strategies using dc voltage and active power outer loops are investigated. The analysis is carried out using a time domain simulator, where the tie line in the Kundur test system is replaced by VSC-HVDC. Simulation results have shown that frequency control capability of VSC-HVDC dramatically improves the frequency performance, especially in isolated power systems...|$|R

40|$|The DC-side line faults in {{high-voltage}} direct-current (<b>HVDC)</b> <b>systems</b> utilising voltage-source converters (VSCs) are a {{major concern}} for multi-terminal <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> in which complete isolation of the faulted system is not a viable option. A number of challenges are posed by both pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground faults including the presence of very fast and high amplitude discharge current from the DC-link capacitance, the lack of suitable DC current breaking devices, {{and the lack of}} highly discriminative fault detection techniques. Therefore, faults occurring along the interconnecting DC cables are likely to threaten system operation. In order to better understand the system under such faults, this paper analyses the behaviour of <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> energised by the conventional two-level VSC. This investigation provides a systematic evaluation of the nature of a DC fault in <b>HVDC</b> <b>systems</b> during a permanent pole- to-pole and pole-to-ground fault taking into consideration a number of inﬂuencing parameters including fault position, fault resistance and other operational conditions. To quantify these dependencies on DC voltage and current characteristics a systematic simulation study is undertaken in which the natural responses of the HVDC networks transients during DC side faults are examined. The outcome of this paper lies the necessary knowledge foundation for developing future DC protection methods...|$|R

Operation of the proposed system under two different earthing configurations of converter side AC transformer earthed with converter unearthed, and both converter and AC transformer unearthed, was analysed and simulated, with particular attention paid to the converter operation. It was observed that the development of potential earth loops within the system as a result of DC line-to-earth faults leads to substantial overcurrent and results in oscillations depending on the earthing configuration...|$|R
