50|$|Barnegat—with the French {{submarine}} chaser SC-171 in tow—departed the Delaware Capes on 22 December 1917, bound for Bermuda, {{as part of}} a small flotilla of armed tugs and yachts ordered to deliver six {{submarine chaser}}s built in American shipyards to the French government. Venetia (<b>Id.</b> <b>No.</b> 431), the flagship for the convoy, towed SC-67, Lydonia (<b>Id.</b> <b>No.</b> 700), SC-173; Montauk, SC-29, and Gypsum Queen (<b>Id.</b> <b>No.</b> 430), SC-170 and SC-172.|$|R
5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War <b>I</b> <b>no</b> acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.|$|E

25|$|Born in Dvinsk, Latvia, Siegel {{emigrated to}} the United States in 1905 with his parents, Mendel and Sarah (Einhorn) Siegel. The family settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where Siegel {{attended}} Baltimore City College and joined the speech and debate team now {{referred to as the}} Bancroft/Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies. He contributed to the senior publication, The Green Bag and graduated in 1919. In 1922, together with V.F. Calverton , he co-founded The Modern Quarterly, a magazine in which his earliest essays appeared, including “The Scientific Criticism” (Vol. <b>I,</b> <b>No.</b> 1, March 1923) and “The Equality of Man” (Vol. <b>I,</b> <b>No.</b> 3, December 1923).|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Pope Martin <b>I,</b> <b>no</b> pope during this period questioned {{the authority of the}} Byzantine monarch to confirm the election of the bishop of Rome before consecration could occur; however, theological conflicts were common between pope and emperor in the areas such as monotheletism and iconoclasm.|$|E

25|$|According to European Court of Human Rights judge Giovanni Bonello the {{suspension}} of prosecutions, the repatriation and release of Turkish detainees was amongst others {{a result of the}} lack of an appropriate legal framework with supranational jurisdiction, because following World War <b>I</b> <b>no</b> international norms for regulating war crimes existed, due to a legal vacuum in international law; therefore contrary to Turkish sources, no trials were ever held in Malta.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, in 1903 {{at the age}} of 24, {{her plans}} to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A. Kartini wrote that the plan had been {{abandoned}} because {{she was going to be}} married..."In short, <b>I</b> <b>no</b> longer desire to take advantage of this opportunity, because I am to be married..". This was despite the fact that for its part, the Dutch Education Department had finally given permission for R.A. Kartini and R.Ay. Rukmini to study in Batavia.|$|E

Two more LCS(M)(Mk I)s, No. 8 and No. 25, were damaged sufficiently in fire-fights off Blue Beach during the evacuation that most of their crews were casualties and their guns silenced.

25|$|The Australian Government assumed {{responsibility}} {{for national security}} and intelligence on Federation in 1901, and took over various state agencies and had to rationalise their functions. There was considerable overlap between the civil and military authorities. Similarly, there was also no Commonwealth agency responsible for enforcing federal laws. At the outbreak of World War <b>I,</b> <b>no</b> Australian government agency was dedicated to security, intelligence or law enforcement. The organisation of security intelligence in Australia took on more urgency with a perceived threat posed by agents provocateurs, fifth columnists and saboteurs within Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{practicality}} {{of building}} battleships came into question since during World War <b>I,</b> <b>no</b> decisive victory had {{resulted from a}} major clash between battleships, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese victory of Tsushima more than 17 years before. However, the war experience had clearly shown the problem of ensuring the safety of maritime commercial routes against commerce raiders, for which cruisers appeared better suited than battleships. Thus, by the late 1920s all the countries that had signed the Washington Treaty were building new heavy cruiser classes. For France, the priority was the safety of the waterborne connections between France and her African colonies/protectorates (via the Marseille-Algiers and Bordeaux-Casablanca-Dakar routes).|$|E
25|$|After Emperor Gojong died in January 1919, with {{rumors of}} poisoning, {{independence}} rallies against Japanese invaders took place nationwide on 1 March 1919 (the March 1st Movement). This movement was suppressed by force and about 7,000 persons {{were killed by}} Japanese soldiers and police. An estimated 2 million people took part in peaceful, pro-liberation rallies, although Japanese records claim participation of less than half million. This movement was partly inspired by United States President Woodrow Wilson's speech of 1919, declaring support for right of self-determination {{and an end to}} colonial rule after World War <b>I.</b> <b>No</b> comment was made by Wilson on Korean independence. A pro-Japan faction in the USA sought trade inroads into China through the Korean peninsula.|$|E
