5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't <b>get</b> <b>far.</b>|$|E
5|$|Renji {{also finds}} {{out that it is}} her dream to write a fantasy novel, but due to her {{condition}} has never been able to <b>get</b> <b>far.</b> Renji loves to read novels, and after discussing it with Chihiro, he collaborates with her to see if he can finally make her dream come true. Through the process of writing the novel, the two eventually become very close and they fall in love with each other. As the story progresses and more of the novel is written, Renji soon discovers that the novel is an allegory for Chihiro's life and how she sees the world around her due to the state of her limited memory.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not <b>get</b> <b>far</b> involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E

25|$|To the south, the Germans had {{somewhat}} more success. They swept over the vastly unprepared 106th Infantry Division, overrunning {{two of its}} regiments who surrendered virtually intact, and finally capturing the key road and rail network in St. Vith. But they didn't <b>get</b> <b>far</b> beyond the village, as the 7th Armored Division and the remaining regiment of the 106th Infantry Division—with elements of the 28th Infantry Division and the 9th Armored Division—held firm outside that town. They never captured the key town of Bastogne and were forced to bypass it, and, although they got within {{a few miles of}} the Meuse River, their advance was stopped by the 8th and 104th Infantry Division, and the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{detonation}} destroyed White's and McCain's aircraft, {{along with}} their remaining fuel and ordnance, blew a crater in the armored flight deck, and sprayed the deck and crew with bomb fragments and burning fuel.

Lieutenant Commander White had managed to escape his burning aircraft, but was unable to <b>get</b> <b>far</b> enough away in time; White was killed along with the firefighters in the first bomb explosion. In the tightly packed formation on the deck, the two nearest A-4s to White's and McCain's (both fully fueled and bomb-laden) were heavily damaged and began to burn, causing the fire to spread and more bombs to quickly cook off.|$|E

25|$|Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the {{opposition}} to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not <b>get</b> <b>far,</b> due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to join the proceedings in the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of for the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. When people were leaving after the vote Gallus, who had been let out of the senate house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented covered with blood to the crowd. People were upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and put the measure in favour of Caesar to the vote. It was passed.|$|E
25|$|His career skyrocketed when Kido {{magazine}} {{named him}} the Number One Young Player. His power and composure shone through his strong endgame. He barely lost {{out in the}} final of the 22nd Nihon Ki-In Championship to Eio Sakata after making a critical mistake that led to his resignation. This loss fueled him to take the 12th Asahi Pro Best Ten undefeated, which made him look incredibly powerful, as all the opponents were 9-dan. The victory made him the youngest title holder ever in Japan. He lost {{in the second round of}} the 30th Honinbo preliminary to Toshihiro Shimamura 9-dan. Even though he had a second chance to take the match against Masao Kato—due to a triple ko—he still lost. He was on a roll in the 1st Tengen league, until he was defeated by Shuzo Ohira. He didn't <b>get</b> <b>far</b> in the rest of the tournaments that year. His spirits were high after he was promoted to 7 dan in late October, only to be crushed a month later when his teacher, Kitani, died. His record was a formidable 39 wins and 16 losses for the year.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} {{conservation}} efforts being implemented to increase populations now {{is the use of}} hatcheries for protected egg incubation, the goal of which is to create a protected environment for the hatchlings where they can incubate and emerge from the sand without threat of predators and then be released out to sea safely. Unfortunately, this result has not been documented in practice. Often, when hatchlings emerge from the sand in the incubator, they remain enclosed inside and expend much of their preserved energy {{trying to find a way}} out. They also lose the extremely important dark, night hours used to <b>get</b> <b>far</b> away from shore. They are released out to sea, often in the early morning hours, when many predators are about, which limits their chance of survival. In addition, the hatchlings are also often too weak to gain a long distance from shore due to the energy lost in the incubator after hatching. These results have led many to believe that hatcheries are ineffective and should only be used as a last resort. No extensive research has shown the survival rate of the hatchlings after they are released to sea, but one study proclaimed a possible 50% loss after release.|$|E

500|$|Born {{attempted}} {{to present their}} results {{at a meeting of}} the Göttingen Mathematics Society a few weeks later. He did not <b>get</b> <b>far</b> before he was publicly challenged by Klein and Max Abraham, who rejected relativity, and forced to terminate the lecture. However, Hilbert and Runge were interested in Born's work, and after some discussion with Born they became convinced of the veracity of his results, and persuaded him to give the lecture again. This time he was not interrupted, and Voigt offered to sponsor Born's habilitation thesis. Born subsequently published his talk as an article on [...] "The Theory of Rigid Bodies in the Kinematics of the Relativity Principle" [...] , which introduced the concept of Born rigidity. On 23 October Born presented his habilitation lecture on the Thomson model of the atom.|$|E

Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame.
