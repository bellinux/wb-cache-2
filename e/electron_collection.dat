50|$|The {{operation}} of the HC in the <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> mode is called the plasma contacting (or ignited) operating mode. The “ignited mode” is so termed because it indicates that multi-ampere current levels {{can be achieved by}} using the voltage drop at the plasma contactor. This accelerates space plasma electrons which ionize neutral expellant flow from the contactor. If <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> currents are high and/or ambient electron densities are low, the sheath at which electron current collection is sustained simply expands or shrinks until the required current is collected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) {{has been}} {{fabricated}} using natural organic dye extracted from Ruthenium Dye and its I-V characterization and absorption properties have been analyzed. It is {{observed that the}} selected natural dye absorbed all visible light and supports electrons motion across the semiconductor interface. The dye acts as sensitizer because the titanium dioxide (TiO 2) cannot absorb the visible light itself as it absorbs higher energy ultraviolet light. Carbon coated electrode was used as counter electrode for <b>electrons</b> <b>collection.</b> Photovoltaic parameters like short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit Voltage (Voc), Fill Factor (FF) and overall efficiency for fabricated cell were 11. 52 mA/cm 2, 0. 70 V, 0. 61 and 4. 47 % under 110 mW/cm 2 illuminations respectively.

40|$|International audienceReal time image {{detection}} {{is still}} a challenge in research. Several methods have been used, but all can be divide in two approaches: the first is based on image field estimation {{in this case the}} quality of image is depending on the estimation method. The second is based on <b>electrons</b> <b>collection,</b> the particularity of this approach is that more the collection time is longer, better will be the quality of image. In both of these approaches, the global image should be obtained by assembling the mosaic local image or the visual index of the different point of the image. In this paper we introduce and Hybrid Fractal Fuzzy theory to track image in real time. The error is minimized using RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm, by computing the homograph “pixel” union of image. In practice for mobile image a loop can be realize to focus the image in real time, so, we can have and efficient view of the global image in real time, which confer to the propose approach his efficient flexibility...|$|R
50|$|The Cooperative High Altitude Rocket Gun Experiment (CHARGE) 2 was jointly {{developed}} by Japan and NASA, {{to observe the}} current collection along with other phenomena. The major objective was to measure the payload charging and return currents during periods of electron emission. Secondary objectives were related to plasma processes associated with direct current and pulsed firings of a low-power electron beam source. On 14 December 1985, the CHARGE mission was launched at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The results indicated {{that it is possible}} to enhance the <b>electron</b> current <b>collection</b> capability of positively charged vehicles by means of deliberate neutral gas releases into an undisturbed space plasma.In addition, it was observed that the release of neutral gas or argon gas into the undisturbed plasma region surrounding a positively biased platform has been found to cause enhancements to <b>electron</b> current <b>collection.</b> This was due to the fact that a fraction of the gas was ionized, which increased the local plasma density, and therefore the level of return current.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tether <b>electron</b> current <b>collection</b> in the Orbital Motion Limited {{regime is}} one of the {{limiting}} factors in power and thrust generation applications of electrodynamic tethers. Injection of radio frequency power along tethers is considered in order to enhance <b>electron</b> current <b>collection.</b> As a basic assessment tool, Particle-In-Cell modeling of the tether system is performed using a 1 -d cylindrical code. Comparison of test electron trajectories shows that the time periodic field distribution created by the RF excitation results in electrons being scattered off their usual OML trajectories, which under some conditions increases their probability of being collected by the tether. Analysis of simulation results reveals that large current enhancements can occur at resonance frequencies of the input reactance (where Xin = 0), but at the expense of high RF power. Current enhancement is best measured in terms of the relative current variation per unit of RF power dissipated for every 1 -meter section of the tether. Optimum enhancements of about 9 % per RF watt per meter were obtained by simulation at low frequencies (75 MHz).

50|$|The PMG {{was planned}} {{to test the}} ability of a Hollow Cathode Assembly (HCA) to provide a low-impedance bipolar {{electric}} current between a spacecraft and the ionosphere. In addition, other expectations were to show that the mission configuration could function as an orbit-boosting motor as well as a generator, by converting orbital energy into electricity. The tether was a 500 m length of insulated 18 gauge copper wire.The mission was launched on 26 June 1993, as the secondary payload on a Delta II rocket. The total experiment lasted approximately seven hours. In that time, the results demonstrated that current is fully reversible, and therefore was capable of generating power and orbit boosting modes. The hollow cathode was able to provide a low-power way of connecting the current to and from the ambient plasma. This means that the HC demonstrated its <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> and emission capabilities.|$|E
50|$|A time {{projection}} chamber {{consists of}} a gas-filled detection volume in an electric field with a position-sensitive <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> system. The original design (and the one most commonly used) is a cylindrical chamber with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) as endplates. Along its length, the chamber is divided into halves {{by means of a}} central high-voltage electrode disc, which establishes an electric field between the center and the end plates. Furthermore, a magnetic field is often applied {{along the length of the}} cylinder, parallel to the electric field, in order to minimize the diffusion of the electrons coming from the ionization of the gas. On passing through the detector gas, a particle will produce primary ionization along its track. The z coordinate (along the cylinder axis) is determined by measuring the drift time from the ionization event to the MWPC at the end. This is done using the usual technique of a drift chamber. The MWPC at the end is arranged with the anode wires in the azimuthal direction, &theta;, which provides information on the radial coordinate, r. To obtain the azimuthal direction, each cathode plane is divided into strips along the radial direction.|$|E

40|$|We present {{preliminary}} tests of hybrid pixel detectors {{consisting of the}} Medipix 2 readout chip bump-bonded to a 1 -mm thick CdTe pixel detector. This room temperature imaging system for single photon counting has been developed within the Medipix 2 European Collaboration for various imaging applications with X-rays and gamma rays, including dental radiography, mammography, synchrotron radiation, nuclear medicine, radiation monitoring in nuclear facilities. The Medipix 2 +CdTe hybrid detector features 256 x 256 square pixels, a pitch of 55 μm, a sensitive area of 14 x 14 mm 2. Here we analyzed {{the quality of the}} detector and bump-bonding and the response to nuclear radiation of the first CdTe hybrids. The CdTe pixel detectors, with Pt contacts, showed an ohmic response when negatively biased to less than 100 V (<b>electrons</b> <b>collection</b> mode). Tests were also performed in holes collection mode, where a non-resistive behaviour was observed above + 15 V. We performed a series of imaging tests with gamma radioactive sources and with an X-ray tube. In flood illumination, we observed for all detectors the presence of numerous, stable small-scale structures in the form of small circles, with the central pixels showing a reduced counting efficiency with respect to the periphery (in electrons counting regime) ...|$|R

Experimentally, MSPhC has fabricated via 6 " Si wafer scalable microfabrication techniques. A broadband sub-bandgap hot electron response with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 235 nm centered at 590 nm is observed. Photoresponse enhancement factor of 12. 28 at 639 nm compared to a flat chip is also measured.

50|$|Take, for example, the NASA Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS) {{mission as}} seen in above figure. At 300 km altitude, the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, in the north-south direction, is approximately 0.18-0.32 gauss up to ~40° inclination, and the orbital velocity {{with respect to the}} local plasma is about 7500 m/s. This results in a Vemf range of 35-250 V/km along the 5 km length of tether. This EMF dictates the potential difference across the bare tether which controls where electrons are collected and / or repelled. Here, the ProSEDS de-boost tether system is configured to enable <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> to the positively biased higher altitude section of the bare tether, and returned to the ionosphere at the lower altitude end. This flow of electrons through the length of the tether {{in the presence of the}} Earth's magnetic field creates a force that produces a drag thrust that helps de-orbit the system, as given by the above equation.The boost mode is similar to the de-orbit mode, except for the fact that a High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) is also inserted in series with the tether system between the tether and the higher positive potential end. The power supply voltage must be greater than the EMF and the polar opposite. This drives the current in the opposite direction, which in turn causes the higher altitude end to be negatively charged, while the lower altitude end is positively charged(Assuming a standard east to west orbit around Earth).|$|E
50|$|A {{microbial}} biosensor {{based on}} carbon nanotube (CNT) modified electrodes was developed. Pseudomonas putida DSM 50026 cells {{were used as}} the biological component and the measurement {{was based on the}} respiratory activity of the cells estimated from electrochemical measurements. The cells were immobilized on carbon nanotube (CNT) modified carbon paste electrodes (CPE) by means of a redox osmium polymer. The osmium polymer efficiently shuttled electrons between redox enzymes located in the cell wall of the cells and promoted a stable binding to the electrode surface. The effect of varying the amounts of CNT and osmium polymer, on the response to glucose was investigated to find the optimum composition of the sensor. The effects of pH and temperature were also examined. After the optimisation studies, the system was characterised by using glucose as a substrate. Moreover, the microbial biosensor was also prepared by using phenol adapted bacteria and then, calibrated to phenol. After that, it was applied for phenol detection in an artificial waste water sample. The study found that whole cell P. putida biosensors using Os-redox polymers could be good alternatives for the analysis of different substrates such as glucose as well as xenobiotics in the absence of oxygen with high sensitivity because of the fast <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> efficiency between the Os-redox polymer and the bacterial cells. The use of optimum amounts of CNTs and the Os redox mediator provided better sensor sensitivity by promoting the electron transfer within the structure of the biosensor. The main disadvantages were the high surface area of CNTs that increased the background current and the diffusion problem of electrons that occurred due to overlapping of the diffusion layers formed at closely spaced CNTs in the film. However, these problems could be overcome by optimising the CNT and polymer amounts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a simple}} form, the gaseous {{detection}} device (GDD) employs an electrode with a voltage {{up to several}} hundred volts to collect the secondary electrons in the ESEM. The principle of this SE detector is best described by considering two parallel plates at a distance d apart with a potential difference V generating a uniform electric field E = V/d, and {{is shown in the}} [...] of the GDD. Secondary electrons released from the specimen at the point of beam impingement are driven by the field force towards the anode electrode but the electrons also move radially due to thermal diffusion from collisions with the gas molecules. The variation of <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> fraction R within anode radius r vs. r/d, for fixed values of anode bias V, at constant product of (pressure·distance) p·d = 1 Pa·m, is given by the accompanying [...] of the GDD. All of the secondary electrons are detected if the parameters of this device are properly designed. This clearly shows that practically 100% efficiency is possible within a small radius of collector electrode with only moderate bias. At these levels of bias, no catastrophic discharge takes place. Instead, a controlled proportional multiplication of electrons is generated as the electrons collide with gas molecules releasing new electrons {{on their way to the}} anode. This principle of avalanche amplification operates similarly to proportional counters used to detect high energy radiation. The signal thus picked up by the anode is further amplified and processed to modulate a display screen and form an image as in SEM. Notably, in this design and the associated gaseous electron amplification, the product p·d is an independent parameter, so that there is a wide range of values of pressure and electrode geometry which can be described by the same characteristics. The consequence of this analysis is that the secondary electrons are possible to detect in a gaseous environment even at high pressures, depending on the engineering efficacy of any given instrument.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the above}} developments, devoted BSE {{detectors}} in the ESEM have {{played an important}} role, since the BSE remain a most useful detection mode yielding information not possible to obtain with SE. The conventional BSE detection means have been adapted {{to operate in the}} gaseous conditions of the ESEM. The BSE having a high energy are self-propelled to the corresponding detector without significant obstruction by the gas molecules. Already, annular or quadrant solid-state detectors have been employed for this purpose but their geometry is not easily adaptable to the requirements of ESEM for optimum operation. As a result, no much use has been reported of these detectors on genuine ESEM instruments at high pressure. The [...] "Robinson" [...] BSE detector is tuned for operation up to around 100 Pa at the usual working distance of conventional SEM for the suppression of specimen charging, whilst <b>electron</b> <b>collection</b> at the short working distance and high pressure conditions make it inadequate for the ESEM. However, plastic scintillating materials being easily adaptable have been used for BSE and made to measure according to the strictest requirements of the system. Such work culminated in the use of a pair of wedge-shaped detectors saddling a conical PLA1 and abutting to its rim, so that the dead detection space is reduced to a minimum, as shown in the accompanying figure of [...] The photon conduction is also optimized by the geometry of the light pipes, whilst the pair of symmetrical detectors allow the separation of topography (signal subtraction) and atomic number contrast (signal addition) of the specimen surface to be displayed with the best ever signal-to-noise-ratio. This scheme has further allowed the use of color by superimposing various signals in a meaningful way. These simple but special detectors became possible in the conditions of ESEM, since bare plastic does not charge by the BSE. However, a very fine wire mesh with appropriate spacing has been proposed as a GDD when gas is present and to conduct negative charge away from the plastic detectors when the gas is pumped out, towards a universal ESEM. Furthermore, since the associated electronics involve a photomultiplier with a wide frequency response, true TV scanning rates are readily available. This is an essential attribute to maintain with an ESEM that enables the examination of processes in situ in real time. In comparison, no such imaging has been reported with the electron avalanche mode of the GDD yet.|$|E

Optimization of mass and power efficiency results in a general requirement for high voltage solar arrays. The space plasma environment, though, can result in large currents being collected by exposed solar cells. The solution of a protective covering of transparent insulation is not a complete solution, inasmuch as defects in the insulation result in anomalously large currents being collected through the defects.
