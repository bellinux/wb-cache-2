5|$|In 1886, Charley Powers {{organized}} a baseball club in New Castle and persuaded Lowe's <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> {{allow him to}} play with the club occasionally. He played catcher and third base for New Castle in 1886 and led the team in batting and baserunning.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is {{a former}} officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He {{believes}} he was subject to unfair dismissal from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that {{to do so would}} breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed this reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

25|$|The {{mere fact}} that strikes or {{agreements}} not to work, entered into by laborers <b>to</b> compel <b>employers</b> <b>to</b> yield to their demands, may restrict the power of such <b>employers</b> <b>to</b> compete in the market with those not subject to such demands does not bring the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman Act.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, {{economic}} opportunities increased for the English peasantry. Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> employer, or became servants in richer households. These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created {{a wide range of}} opportunities for farmers and artisans. Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere. Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent. As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These sumptuary laws proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Flower and the Rose is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Frank Wilson, {{the son of an}} inventor who has constructed a new airplane model. After failing to secure financing, his father suggests that he marry Rose, the daughter of his wealthy <b>employer,</b> <b>to</b> get the money they need. Jack rejects this idea because he is engaged to another woman, but he soon learns she does not love him. He heads out West to seek a fortune and is quickly successful. He returns to the aviation field and meets Rose again, after a successful flight she confesses to loving him. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film may have included scenes from the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park. One reviewer claimed that a Wright brothers flyer was also shown in full flight. The film was released on November 25, 1910, but is now presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|A legal {{strategy}} {{also plays}} an important role in the comprehensive campaign. Part of the legal strategy may use labor laws to cause the <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> divert management resources to employee relations and away from the anti-union effort. This may involve the strategic filing of unfair labor practice charges or grievances, picketing, leafleting or bannering. Advantage is often taken of workplace health and safety laws, with unions filing health and safety or environmental complaints against the employer. Business and professional licensure, zoning procedures, building permitting and other laws and regulations may also be advantageously (and legitimately) used to hinder, harass and influence the <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> recognize the union, negotiate a contract, or achieve other goals.|$|E

40|$|An {{employer}} risks a defamation lawsuit when providing {{reference information}} about a current/former employee <b>to</b> a prospective <b>employer.</b> Despite legal defenses <b>to</b> defamation, many <b>employers</b> have adopted "no reference" policies restricting the information provided. Such policies hamper a prospective <b>employer's</b> ability <b>to</b> evaluate applicants and increase the risks of negligent hiring and referral. Recent state immunity laws provide protection from civil liability <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> who provide accurate, job-related {{information about a}} current/former employee. Immunity laws should encourage more prospective <b>employers</b> <b>to</b> seek information and other <b>employers</b> <b>to</b> give out more information...|$|R

25|$|Another {{element of}} the {{comprehensive}} campaign is writing, introducing and seeking the passage of local, county, state or federal legislation inimical to the employer's business interests. Such legislation may be aimed at the business interests of suppliers, vendors, customers, subsidiaries or co-owners as well. The goal of legislative activity may merely be to force the <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> divert resources to lobbying, election politics or other legislative activity, {{or it may be}} to enact legislation. Proposed legislation may be as broad as universal healthcare or comprehensive workplace safety laws or as narrow as requiring the <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> collect and publicly report information which is not otherwise available (and which the union may later analyze and use).|$|E
25|$|Non-citizen {{residence}} {{can become}} illegal {{in one of}} four ways: by unauthorized entry, by failure of the <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> pay worker documentation fees, by staying beyond the expiration date of a visa or other authorization, or by violating the terms of legal entry.|$|E

25|$|Since the 111th Congress, the {{legislation}} has included language {{to prevent any}} reading of the law as a modification of the federal definition of marriage established in the Defense of Marriage Act (1995). Since the 110th Congress, a related provision aimed at non-marital legal relations like civil unions and domestic partnerships prevents requiring an <b>employer</b> <b>to</b> treat unmarried and married couples similarly.|$|E
25|$|McVeigh {{introduced}} his sister to anti-government literature, {{but his father}} {{had little interest in}} these views.

He also quit the NRA, viewing its stance on gun rights as too weak.|$|E
