This thesis investigates the disclosure level of financial <b>instruments</b> <b>information</b> of companies which are listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Stock Exchange). The purpose of the thesis is, from an agency theory perspective, to explore the association between Committees Responsible for Risk Management (CRfRM) and the disclosure level of financial <b>instruments</b> <b>information.</b> The study mainly focuses on three committees responsible for risk management: Risk Management Committees (RMC), Internal Audit (IA), and Outsourced Internal Audit (OIA). In this study, we measure the disclosure level based on an index that developed based on FRS 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure. The results indicate that, on average, the disclosure level of financial <b>instruments</b> <b>information</b> in 2008 was low, as it has slightly decreased compared to 2003. The results also indicate that the effectiveness of CRfRM among companies in Malaysia can still be questioned. MSc in Accountin...|$|R

A questionnaire served as a data-gathering <b>instrument.</b> <b>Information</b> on three computer brands was manipulated based on the four cues. Results from structural equations analysis reveal a broader conceptualization of consumer-perceived quality in Bangladesh as reflected in the model.

All families were ascertained after initial consultation with a proband with BD (using the Family Interview for Genetic Studies; FIGS). Each pedigree member provided informed consent prior to inclusion in the study. All individuals were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) (Nurnberger et al. 1994), with interviews being undertaken by experienced medical practitioners, psychologists and psychiatric nurses trained in this <b>instrument.</b> <b>Information</b> obtained from the FIGS, DIGS and medical records was used to generate best-estimate Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) diagnoses for Bipolar I disorder (BD-I), Bipolar II Disorder (BD-II), Schizoaffective Disorder Manic Type (SZMA) or Recurrent Unipolar Major Depression (RUD). As we were interested in examining both sub-syndromal and syndromal mood disorder symptoms, we also included those participants who did not meet formal RDC criteria for a mood disorder but who may still be at greater risk of developing symptomatology due to increased familial risk.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the corporate governance determinants of financial instrument disclosure (FID) practices of Australian listed resource firms in their annual reports for the 2005 financial year. This is an important time period to explain FID patterns for Australian resource companies leading up to formal adoption of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Design/methodology/approach – The extent of FID was measured using a Financial Instrument Disclosure Index (FIDI) comprised of 120 items of both mandatory and discretionary financial <b>instrument</b> <b>information.</b> Hypothesis testing used empirical data from {{a representative sample of}} Australian listed resource firms. Research limitations/implications – The results of regression analysis demonstrate that corporate governance characteristics of firms are significant determinants of FID patterns. Univariate and multivariate results showed that FIDs were significantly and positively associated with strength of corporate governance structure and the control variables – leverage, firm size and industry. Originality/value – This paper contributes to an emerging paradigm that emphasises the link between firms' governance structures and their disclosure responses to financial instruments and in particular, financial derivatives.

An increase in the number of items borrowed needs to be managed. A lab instruments management system is developed and applied to manage the tools and instruments. The focus of the software is on managing information on borrowed instruments. The methods used come from the field of Java web application and include the methods object oriented programming, MySQL database, three-tier architecture and model-view-controller design pattern. The development of the management system is based on four features. Two features are maintenance of basic information of borrowers and instruments. The results showed that administrators can add, modify, delete, and query information of borrowers and instruments through web pages. The third feature is to borrow instruments, return instruments and to extend borrowing time. The last feature is to show statistics.
