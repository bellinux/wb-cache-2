40|$|We analyze one {{frequent}} {{clause in}} bonds, covenant defeasance. Covenant defeasance allows the issuer {{to remove the}} bond’s covenants by placing the remaining payments with a trustee in escrow to be paid out on schedule. We provide theoretical justification for this option and show empirically that it allows inclusion of more covenants in bond issues. We highlight characteristics that make issuers likely to add a <b>defeasance</b> <b>clause.</b> In line with the model’s prediction, the empirical analysis documents 13 - 24 basis points yield reduction for defeasible bonds- annual saving of about $ 1 m, or $ 11 m {{over the life of}} the average bond...|$|E
40|$|When Swedish {{authorities}} are to purchase or rent something, public procurement {{is used as}} a means to an end. Authorities as well as suppliers are subjects to the fact that Swedish law regarding public procurement regulates the form of procurement in one set of particular regulations (LOU) and the form of contracts in another set of general regulations (AvtL). Suppliers and purchasing authorities close a contract regarding the subject of procurement and the law of public procurement regulates when such a contract can be closed, simultaneously the law of contracts regulates when parties are held to contracts and when contracts are to be rescinded. I investigate in this essay what these two types of regulations can result in for the contracting parties. As it is today agreements that have been entered into wrongfully still are valid, even if a court of law nullifies the procurement and sentences the purchasing authority to make a new public procurement. This state of things is currently causing contractual difficulties for parties in such circumstances. My investigation leads me {{to the conclusion that the}} law of public procurement should regulate, by a <b>defeasance</b> <b>clause,</b> agreements and contracts that has been entered and closed in a wrongful way; hence making such agreements invalid...|$|E
5000|$|In {{judicial}} opinions, {{the use of}} defeasible is commonplace. There is however disagreement among legal logicians whether defeasible {{reasoning is}} central, e.g., in the consideration of open texture, precedent, , and rationales, or whether it applies only to explicit <b>defeasance</b> <b>clauses.</b> H.L.A. Hart in The Concept of Law gives two famous examples of defeasibility: [...] "No vehicles in the park" [...] (except during parades); and [...] "Offer, acceptance, and memorandum produce a contract" [...] (except when the contract is illegal, the parties are minors, inebriated, or incapacitated, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The {{etymology}} of defeasible usually {{refers to}} Middle English law of contracts, where {{a condition of}} <b>defeasance</b> is a <b>clause</b> that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate are often {{used in the same}} contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.|$|R
