5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a <b>hedge,</b> provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another <b>hedge</b> plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing <b>hedge.</b> Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of <b>hedging</b> costs in {{offshore}} <b>hedging</b> to minimize {{the risks associated with}} fluctuations in commodity export prices and exchange rates in international grain trade.

40|$|Abstract. Grass <b>hedges</b> and no-till {{cropping}} systems reduced soil losses on standard erosion plots in ultra narrow-row (20 cm) cotton during a four-year study (1999 - 2002). No-till cotton with grass <b>hedges,</b> no-till cotton without grass <b>hedges,</b> conventional-till cotton with grass <b>hedges,</b> and conventional-till cotton without grass <b>hedges</b> produced four-year average annual soil losses of 1. 8, 2. 9, 4. 0, and 30. 8 t/ha, respectively, and produced four-year average runoff amounts of 226, 364, 338, and 738 mm, respectively. The ratio of annual soil loss with grass <b>hedges</b> to without <b>hedges</b> averaged 0. 62 for no-till. The ratio of annual soil loss with grass <b>hedges</b> to without <b>hedges</b> was 0. 13 for conventional-till. Averaged over all plots (with and without grass <b>hedges),</b> no-till plots reduced soil loss from conventional-till plots by 86 %. No-till plots without grass <b>hedges</b> had 90 % less soil loss than conventional-till plots without grass <b>hedges.</b> Grass <b>hedges</b> effectively reduced soil loss on erosion plots with similar cropping practices {{as compared to}} plots without <b>hedges.</b> Other studies of contoured grass <b>hedges</b> on field-sized areas are being conducted to determine their applicability on larger areas with greater concentrations of runoff...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{substitution}} of financial and operational <b>hedging</b> choices. Modern risk management can enhance firm value when volatility is costly due to capital market imperfections. Both financial <b>hedging</b> with derivatives and operational <b>hedging</b> can reduce income volatility and, in turn, the potential costs of such volatility. I present a simple model of the tradeoffs between such <b>hedging</b> choices to motivate an empirical investigation into firm behavior. Using a large sample of bank holding companies, I document that acquisitions can provide operational <b>hedging</b> {{and that this is}} a substitute for financial <b>hedging.</b> Not only do the majority of acquisitions reduce volatility, the subsequent decrease in financial <b>hedging</b> corresponds to an acquisition’s contribution to operational <b>hedging.</b> Those acquisitions that provide the most operational <b>hedging</b> are followed by the largest declines in financial <b>hedging...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Hedging</b> is {{a method}} to {{safeguard}} or minimize loss from risk that constantly exists in the financial market. Nevertheless, <b>hedging</b> in conventional perspectives involves the usage of derivative instruments which are controversy in Islamic view. Thus, the noble purpose of <b>hedging</b> that is to manage risk has been misunderstood as only to gain profit. The concept of <b>hedging</b> needs a further discussion because of its various interpretations {{on the meaning of}} <b>hedging.</b> Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} discuss the general concept of <b>hedging</b> and subsequently the concept of <b>hedging</b> according to Islam.
