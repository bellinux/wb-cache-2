50|$|The work of Danishevsky and Joung {{provided}} {{the foundation for}} another total synthesis of PST, which was propounded by Li,M. in 2006. This method employed a more sophisticated approach, starting out with the pinitol 30 that its stereocenters {{are exactly the same}} as the ones in the C-ring of Pancratistatin. Protection of the diol functions of compound 30 gave compound 31. The free hydroxyl of this was subsequently substituted by an azide to give 32. After removal of the silyl function, a cyclic sulfate was installed to obtain product 33. The Staudinger reaction gave the free amine 34 from azide 33. The coupling reaction between 34 and 35 gave compound 36 with a moderate yield. Methocymethyl protection of both the amide and the <b>free</b> <b>phenol</b> gave compound 37. Treatment of this latter product with t-BuLi followed by addition of cerium chloride gave compound 38. Full deprotection of 38 by BBr3 and methanol afforded pancratistatin 3 in 12 steps from commercially available pinitol with an overall yield of 2.3% 20.|$|E

This experimental research was necessary because a standardized method was not available for these compounds in water. A special concept was developed whereby the <b>free</b> <b>phenols</b> were extracted from the water using SPE-columns, followed by on-column derivatisation of the <b>free</b> <b>phenols</b> with acetylchoride in hexane (5 % v/v) using sodiumhydroxide powder and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen stofsulfaat as fase-transfer-catalist, and desorption of the phenylacetates with hexane. Analysis of the phenylacetates was preformed with GC-FID of GC-MS. Advantages are the fast and easy to automate method with an unique combination of on-column extraction and derivatisation, which avoids the need of a solvent phase switch. The method validation showed the following characteristics: no concentration dependence was found over a concentration range of 25 ug/l to 25 mg/l with a limited breakthroug, only 12 % for phenol at a level of 25 mg/l. The longterm reproducibility for phenol, cresols and dimethylphenols was around 80 % {{with a standard deviation of}} 2 to 6 % for all matrices. The limit of determination was around 1 ug/l using GC-FID analysis. Analysis of dimethylphenols can be performed with this method as well, or they can be used as internal standards. The stability of the components is 7 days at 4 degrees C and can be increased by conservation at pH 2 of pH 12.

When rats were dosed in a manner analogous to that used in traditional bioassays, i. e., providing the two forms of vitamin E one daily in tocopherol-stripped corn oil for four successive days immediately prior to sacrifice, the net uptake of 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol from the <b>free</b> <b>phenol</b> form was only half that from the acetate. This result is consistent with the greater activity of the acetate that had been observed previously in bioassays. However, when the two forms of tocopherol were intubated into rats as a single dose mixed in with an aqueous bolus of standard laboratory diet, the amount of 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol taken up from the free form after 24 hr was very similar to that derived from the acetate. In five adult humans, competitive uptake studies of the two forms after a single dose taken with a meal showed that the amount of 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol from the <b>free</b> <b>phenol</b> form was equal to that from the acetate in plasma and red blood cells.

Furthermore, three caffeoylquinic acids (3 -CQA, 4 -CQA and 5 -CQA) were identified by comparison of their spectral data (ESI-MS) with those of known compounds and literature data. Five of these compounds were demonstrated to be substrates for orchard grass PPO. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Key word: borax {{phenol-formaldehyde resin}} heat {{resistance}} B-O bond Abstract. A modified phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin was synthesized under alkaline condition in varying proportion of borax up to 21 % (w/w). All the prepared resin {{were characterized by}} <b>free</b> <b>phenol</b> content, free formaldehyde content as well as hydroxymethyl content. It was proved by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) that B-O bond had been successfully introduced into the structure of PF resin. Thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and different scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the thermodynamic characteristics of the PF resin. The result showed that when the mass fraction of borax was 9 wt. % of PF resin, the heat resistance was {{the best and the}} curing temperature of the modified PF resin was higher than that of the unmodified PF resin...|$|E
40|$|To {{prepare a}} low-formaldehyde soy-based {{adhesive}} with good water resistance, phenol-formaldehyde modified with glutaraldehyde (PFG) with lower <b>free</b> <b>phenol</b> and free formaldehyde contents {{was used to}} cross-link the soy-based adhesive. The {{results showed that the}} mechanical properties and water resistance of plywood prepared with soy-based adhesive with PFG was better than that of plywood with the same amount of phenol-formaldehyde (PF). The reaction between phenol and glutaraldehyde was proved by 13 C-NMR. Under the optimized preparation conditions for plywood, that is to say, press temperature 160 °C, press time 4 min and resin loading 320 g·m− 2, type I plywood could be prepared with 9 % PFG as a cross-linker of soy-based adhesive. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) result confirmed the cross-linking reaction between soy-based adhesive and PFG or PF. The activation energy of soy-based adhesive with cross-linker PFG was higher than that with PF resin...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{economic}} potential of the sheanut tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), its domestication still has not been achieved due to the long juvenile period of seed propagated plants {{and the absence of}} a reliable vegetative propagation method. Three experiments were conducted by using a modified container layering technique to investigate the effects of season (rainy and dry season), light treatments (etiolation and natural light) and indole 3 -butyric acid (IBA) on root formation in juvenile and mature sheanut trees. The effect of light treatments on the internal conditions such as level of sugars (soluble, insoluble and total sugars) and total <b>free</b> <b>phenols</b> in layered sheanut shoots w as also considered. Rooting was generally lower in the mature trees (27. 9 %) compared to that in juvenile 4 year-old plants (40. 9 %). Etiolation increased the levels of total sugars and phenols in shoots of 4 - year-old plants and mature fruit bearing trees, but this increase did not significantly enhance rooting in both the juvenile and mature sheanut trees. The container layering technique holds promise as a method for the asexual propagation of sheanut planting material. Roots formed using this method looked healthy and were vertically orientated giving layered shoots a better chance at survival. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{bioactivity}} of the acetate of the all-racemic, 1 -thio analog of a-tocopherol (all-rac-]-thio- 3 ̆b 1 tocopheryl acetate) {{has been}} determined by measuring its ability to decrease plasma levels of pyruvate kinase in vitamin E deficient rats using the curative myopathy bioassay. The thio analog is only 0. 22 times as active as RRR- 3 ̆b 1 tocopheryl acetate and is therefore approximately 0. 33 times as active as all-rac- 3 ̆b 1 tocopheryl acetate, since the latter {{has been shown to}} be 1. 47 times less active than RRR- 3 ̆b 1 tocopheryl acetate in the same bioassay (H. Weiser, M. Vecchi and M. Schlachter, Internal. J. Vit. Nutr. Res. 55 149 - 158 (1985)). The 0. 33 : 1. 0 ratio is similar to the ratio of 0. 41 : 1. 0 measured for the in vitro antioxidant activities of the corresponding <b>free</b> <b>phenols.</b> This finding lends further support to our view that the vitamin E activity in the curative myopathy bioassay of close structural analogs of 3 ̆b 1 tocopherol is determined primarily by the in vitro antioxidant activity of the analog relative to 3 ̆b 1 tocopherol, consistent with the belief that vitamin E functions primarily as a general purpose, lipid-soluble antioxidant in mammals. 9 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|Jensen and Friedrich have {{outlined}} {{new methods}} for {{the preparation of}} acridine compounds. They {{have shown that the}} treatment of o-aminobensaldehyde with the halogen derivatives of nitrobenzene and with the corresponding derivatives of toluene would yield the corresponding diphenylamine derivatives. These diphenylamine derivatives split off water very easily to form acridine compounds. By this method they have prepared the 1 (9) -nitro and 3 (7) -nitroacridine, and the 1 (9) -methyl and 3 (7) -methylacridine. The general application of the reaction used in preparing these compounds has been examined, and it has been found that the reaction can be extended in two ways. Halogen derivatives of benzene compounds, other than those mentioned, can be used, or the aminobenzaldehyde can be replaced by o-amino phenylketones. The halogen derivatives of phenol were chosen first for the following reason. K. Motsumura has described the preparation of 1 (9) -hydroxyacridine by reduction of the corresponding acridine compound in boiling amyl alcohol with sodium. These results seemed open to question because it was believed that the dihydroacridine should be obtained, since acridine itself will give dihydroacridine under the conditions stated. As the products obtained from the phenol are identical with those of the Japanese chemist, no hydrogenation of the acridine ring occurred during the reduction. In this work the <b>free</b> <b>phenols</b> could not be used as the hydroxyl group itself reacted. For this reason the methyl and ethyl ethers were employed. Next the o-aminobenzaldehyde was replaced by o-aminiophenylketones. This reaction should lead to 5 -position acridine derivatives according to the following scheme...|$|R
