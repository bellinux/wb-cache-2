40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental investigation on ductile-mode micro-milling of monocrystalline silicon using polycrystalline diamond (PCD) end mills. Experimental {{results indicate that}} the <b>irregular</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of cutting force always induces machined surface failure, even in ductile mode. The internal mechanism has not been investigated so far. The multiscale discrete dislocation plasticity framework was used to predict the dislocation structure and strain evolution under the discontinuous cutting process. The results showed that a mass of dislocations can be generated and affected in silicon crystal. The dislocation density, multiplication rate, and microstructure strongly depend on the milling conditions. In particular, transient impulse load can provide a great potential for material strength by forming dislocations entanglement structure. The continuous irregular cutting process can induce persistent slip bands (PSBs) in substrate surface, which would result in stress concentration and inhomogeneous deformation within grains...|$|E

Finally, the heat transfer of 2 D and 3 D simulations are compared. The average Nusselt numbers {{were found to be}} in accordance with empirical correlations.

Mean gestational periods shows two peaks in October and February-March and a deep trough in winter and a much smaller one in June-September.

40|$|Executive {{function}} {{is thought to}} be the coordinated operation of multiple neural processes and allows to accomplish a current goal flexibly. The most important function of the prefrontal cortex is the executive function. Among a variety of executive functions in which the prefrontal cortex participates, decision-making {{is one of the most}} important. Although the prefrontal contribution to decision-making has been examined using a variety of behavioral tasks, recent studies using fMRI have shown that the prefrontal cortex participates in decision-making under free-choice conditions. Since decision-making under free-choice conditions represents the very first stage for any kind of decision-making process, it is important that we understand its neural mechanism. Although few studies have examined this issue while a monkey performed a free-choice task, those studies showed that, when the monkey made a decision to subsequently choose one particular option, prefrontal neurons showing selectivity to that option exhibited transient activation just before presentation of the imperative cue. Further studies have suggested that this transient increase is caused by the <b>irregular</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of spontaneous firing just before cue presentation, which enhances the response to the cue and biases the strength of the neuron's selectivity to the option. In addition, this biasing effect was observed only in neurons that exhibited sustained delay-period activity, indicating that this biasing effect not only influences the animal's decision for an upcoming choice, but also is linked to working memory mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex...|$|E

Serum Ca levels slightly rose in summer and slightly fell in winter. K content of the erythrocyte showed a two regular cycle fluctuation: it rose in winter and summer, and fell in spring and autumn. K content of the erythrocyte showed the greatest fluctuation, followed by serum K levels, serum Na levels, hematocrit values and serum Ca levels in the indicated order.

40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} effects of temperature, soil water content and photosynthesis on soil respiration in Populus and Ulmus pumila planting shelterbelts in China’s Junngar Basin. Methods Soil respiration was measured during the growing seasons in 2005 and 2006 using an automated CO 2 efflux system (LI- 8100). Air temperature (at 50 cm in height) and soil temperature (every 5 cm from 0 to 50 cm depth) were monitored at three points adjacent to the chamber using a digital thermometer (WMY- 01 C, Huachen Medical Instrument Inc., Shanghai, China) at each site. Gravimetric soil moisture at 0 – 5, 5 – 15, 15 – 30, and 30 – 50 cm depths at three points were measured using the oven-drying method at 105 °C for 48 h. Important findings Soil respiration displayed <b>irregular</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of daytime pattern and significant single-peaked curve of seasonal pattern in the two woodlands. Seasonally, soil respiration was characterized by a maximum in July or August and a minimum in October or May, following the change of soil temperature. The rate of soil respiration was significantly higher in Populus woodland than that in U. pumila woodland with mean rates of 3. 71 and 1. 82 μmol CO 2 ·m– 2 ·s– 1 in two growing seasons, respectively. Soil respiration was significantly correlated with temperature in exponential equation, but uncorrelated with soil water content in the two woodlands. Soil temperature at 50 and 30 cm depths could explain 78. 5 % and 64. 4 % of seasonal variations of soil respiration in Populus woodland and U. pumila woodland, respectively, which confirms the common explanation by temperature and soil water content. The difference in soil respiration between the woodlands was influenced by growth state of trees, photosynthesis and soil salinity. Our results suggested that there was significant seasonalvariation of soil respiration in oasis shelterbelts in the arid region and soil temperature was the main regulating factor...|$|E
40|$|In {{aircraft}} maintenance, {{the initial}} maintenance schedule of an aircraft is {{highly dependent on}} the maintenance planning document. This document, set up by manufacturers, regulators and operators, contains all the requirements for the initial maintenance schedule of a specific aircraft. It serves as a reference {{for the development of}} an optimised maintenance schedule by the operator. The initial workload distributions obtained by using the task data in this document, show a high and <b>irregular</b> <b>fluctuation</b> along the operational life of the aircraft. After the application of common task packaging methods, the operator can improve the initial maintenance schedule, but workload fluctuations often persist after these measures. This fluctuation is considered to be unfavourable because of several reasons; maintenance resources are used inefficiently, workforce scheduling operations on fleet level can become very complex and maintenance delays are more likely to occur as a consequence. In this research, a generic optimisation method is developed focused on the minimisation of the workload fluctuation resulting from the initial maintenance schedule of the aircraft. This method uses a single task reallocation process that systematically eliminates workload excesses by locally reducing task intervals. A software application was built for a fast, a more dynamic and a more customized reallocation process, using several variable inputs. This application has shown to be very effective in eliminating the workload fluctuation along the lifecycle of an aircraft. As an indication, from the data of the maintenance planning document of an A 330, the average fluctuation of the workload among the C-checks over a lifecycle of 15 years, was reduced by more than 79 %. Theoretically, this minimisation of the fluctuation could lead to a workforce size reduction of 41 % for the C-checks only. These figures are even higher for the A-checks of the aircraft over the same period. Together with the simplification of the workforce scheduling activities and a more efficient usage of maintenance resources with constant workloads, these advantages are thought to outweigh the negative effects associated with the task interval reductions in the reallocation process, especially when an entire fleet of aircrafts is considered. Through the implementation of process improvements and additional features, the efficiency and the generic capacity of this application can be further improved with the objective to rapidly generate optimal maintenance schedules that are adaptable to different operational scenarios or constraints...|$|E
