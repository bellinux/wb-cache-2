SSPS has been successfully used in Sweden over the past decade. During the test, the power station remains connected to the grid without the need to establish an actual island system. SSPS requires the tested power station to be synchronized to a strong grid. The principle of SSPS is to replace the normal frequency feedback of the governor with a simulated frequency. This thesis investigates the in uence of <b>grid</b> frequency <b>variation</b> on the test.

The proposed controller acts independently {{from the system}} parameters, {{does not require a}} phase-locked loop (PLL) and can achieve the desired real power regulation and unity power factor operation. Based on nonlinear input-to-state stability theory, it is analytically proven that the inverter current always remains below a given value, even during transients, independently from <b>grid</b> <b>variations</b> or faults (short circuit or voltage sag). The desired performance and stability of the closed-loop system are rigorously proven since the controller has a structure that does not require any switches, additional limiters or monitoring devices for its implementation.

40|$|Abstract. Adjustments are {{proposed}} of the Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) approach to turbulence. They preserve the DDES capabilities particularly for natural DES uses, and resolve the mismatch of the logarithmic layers discovered earlier {{for the basic}} DES technique when used for Wall-Modelled Large-Eddy Simulation (WMLES) of attached flows. The adjustments are defined both for the Spalart-Allmaras and the Menter SST models. The first one concerns {{the definition of the}} LES length scale in general for anisotropic grids near a wall, and makes use of the wall distance along with the grid spacing; it clearly benefits even the Smagorinsky model. The second one manages the blending of RANS and LES behaviour within a WMLES to advantage, greatly increasing the resolved turbulence activity near the wall, and finely adjusting the resolved logarithmic layer. This is seen in channel flow over a wide Reynolds-number range, and through some <b>grid</b> <b>variations.</b> Tests show that the new method, although somewhat more complex, returns the desired behaviour not only in channel-flow LES, but also in channel-flow RANS, in a backward-facing-step case with side-by-side LES and RANS regions, and over an airfoil in deep stall. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design and practical implementation of a robust digital current controller for a threephase voltage source grid-connected interleaved inverter. Each phase consists of 6 half-bridge channels connected in parallel. Due to the current ripple cancellation of the interleaving topology, only small output filter capacitors are required which provide high impedance to grid voltage harmonics and hence better current quality compared to traditional 2 -level LCL topology. The current in each inductor is controlled via a single feedback loop. A feedforward loop of the grid voltage is incorporated to compensate for the grid disturbance. To control the high resonance frequency of the filter, high sampling and switching frequencies are required. Alternatively, resistors in series with the filter capacitors are used to provide damping. This method becomes practically possible due to the low magnitude of the current of the capacitors and consequently low power dissipation in the damping resistors. The paper also studies in detail the effects of computational time delay and <b>grid</b> impedance <b>variation</b> on system stability. A phase lag compensator incorporated in the inductor current loop is designed to increase system immunity to <b>grid</b> impedance <b>variations.</b> Simulation and practical results are presented to validate the design...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{renewable}} {{and distributed}} generation (DG) systems have contributed towards an efficient and an economic way of transporting electricity to end-users as the generation sources are in general located nearer the loads. DG {{and renewable energy}} systems are modifying the old concept of distribution network by instigating a bi-directional power flow into the grid, facilitated {{through the use of}} power electronic grid-connected converters. A challenge associated with grid-connected converters arises when they are interacted with a grid that is not stiff, like weak micro grids. Small <b>grid</b> parameter <b>variations</b> in these systems can considerably affect the performance of the converter control and lead to higher values in current total harmonic distortion (THD) and loss of control and synchronization. Thus, the control of grid-connected power converters needs to be regularly updated with latest <b>variation</b> in <b>grid</b> parameters. Model Predictive Direct Power Control (MP-DPC) has been chosen as the control strategy for the work presented in this thesis due to its advantages over traditional control techniques such as multivariable control, no need of phase-locked loops (PLLs) for grid synchronization and avoidance of cascaded control loops. Two novel methods for estimating the <b>grid</b> impedance <b>variation,</b> and hence the grid voltage, are presented in this thesis along with a detailed literature review on control of grid-connected converters with special emphasis on impedance estimation techniques. The first proposed estimation method is based on the difference in grid voltage magnitudes at two consecutive sampling instants while the second method is based on a model-fitting algorithm similar to the concept of cost-function optimization in model predictive control. The proposed estimation methods in this thesis are integrated within the MP-DPC, therefore updating the MP-DPC in real-time with the latest <b>variation</b> in <b>grid</b> impedance. The proposed algorithms provide benefits such as: quick response to transient variations, operation under low values of short-circuit-ratio (SCR), robust MP-DPC control, good reference tracking to <b>grid</b> parameter <b>variations</b> and operation under unbalanced grid voltages. The thesis also presents the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed methods and areas where further improvement can be researched. The work presented has been tested on a three phase two-level grid-connected converter prototype, which is connected to a low voltage substation highly dominated by inductive component of grid impedance. It can be adapted and modified to be used for general grid impedance estimation, medium or high voltage applications, in case of multilevel grid-connected converter topologies or photo-voltaic (PV) grid-connected applications...|$|R

Both algebraic and elliptic grid generation systems are included. The method for grid generation by algebraic transformation {{is based on an}} interpolation algorithm and the elliptic grid generation is established by solving the partial differential equation (PDE). Non-uniform grid distributions are carried out using a hyperbolic tangent stretching function. For algebraic grid systems, interpolations in one direction (univariate) and two directions (bivariate) are considered. These interpolations are associated with linear or cubic Lagrangian/Hermite/Bezier polynomial functions. The algebraic grids can subsequently be smoothed using an elliptic solver. For elliptic grid systems, the PDE can be in the form of Laplace (zero forcing function) or Poisson.

Among the different form of variable speed fixed frequency topologies DFIG is most popular form due to its efficiency and ability to allow wide range of speed variation at reduced converter size. Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is basically a wound rotor induction generator which is used to fed power from both stator and rotor circuit. Stator feeds power directly to grid which is unidirectional. Rotor circuit is connected to a bidirectional ac/dc/ac converter having a common dc link bus. In rotor, power flow is bidirectional i. e. depending on the mode of operation the power flow is either from rotor side to grid or it may be from grid side to rotor. The rotor side converter also fed reactive power to DFIG so as it can run at a near unity power factor. The function of the grid voltage converter is to maintain the DC link voltage constant, which ultimately fed a constant amplitude ac voltage to rotor side for maintaining the flux constant. But when <b>grid</b> voltage <b>variation</b> occurs, the dc link voltage also varies, ultimately rotor input voltage varies. This causes abnormal input of reactive power to rotor circuit. So to maintain the reactive power demand of machine, it draw reactive power from grid, which may lead to a condition of voltage fluctuation at PCC. One solution to this problem may be compensation of <b>grid</b> voltage <b>variation</b> before <b>grid</b> converter circuit.

40|$|In the Nordic grid, a trend {{observed}} the recent {{years is the}} increase in <b>grid</b> frequency <b>variations,</b> which means the frequency is outside the normal range (49. 9 - 50. 1 Hz) more often. <b>Variations</b> in the <b>grid</b> frequency leads {{to changes in the}} speed of rotation of all the turbines connected to the grid, since the speed of rotation is closely related to the grid frequency for synchronous generators. When the speed of rotation changes, this implies that the net torque acting on the rotating masses are changed, and the material of the turbine runners must withstand these changes in torque. Frequency variations thus leads to torque oscillations in the turbine, which become dynamical loads that the runner must be able to withstand. Several new Francis runners have recently experienced cracks in the runner blades due to fatigue, obviously due to the runner design not taking into account the actual loads on the runner.
