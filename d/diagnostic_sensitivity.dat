In some areas, RDTs {{need to be able}} to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E

We prospectively evaluated a diagnostic algorithm for TBM in 205 HIV-negative patients with meningitis {{and a low}} CSF glucose. Patients were classified as having TBM or bacterial meningitis (BM) by two diagnostic methods: logistic regression method (LRM) and classifi-cation and regression tree (CART). We performed analyses of TBM versus BM and TBM versus non-TBM in all patients and in patients with microbiologically confirmed diagnoses. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> for TBM were 99 % (LRM) and 87 % (CART). For BM, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were 81. 5 % (LRM) and 86. 5 % (CART) in the primary analysis and 86. 5 % (LRM) and 74 % (CART) in the secondary analysis.

Here we describe the evaluation and verification of Seeplex Diarrhea-V ACE (Seeplex DV), a novel commercial multi-plex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay that detects 5 diarrheal pathogens, including adenovirus, rotavirus, norovirus genogroup I (GI) and GII, and astrovirus. We describe a retrospective study of 200 clinical specimens of which 177 were stool specimens previously tested for the presence of gastrointestinal viruses by electron microscopy (EM) and/or real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The remaining 23 specimens comprised other human pathogens of viral or bacterial origin. Discordant norovirus GI and GII results were resolved using a commercial kit; discordant adenovirus and rotavirus results were resolved using a home brew multiplex rRT-PCR assay. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and specificities were calculated before and after discordant analysis. After discordant analysis, estimated <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were 100 % for adenovirus, rotavirus, and norovirus GI and 97 % for norovirus GII.

The test is based on fluorescein-labelled PNA probes that target the rRNA of MTC or NTM species applied to smears of AFB+ cultures for microscopic examination. Parallel testing with the two probes serves as an internal control for each sample such that a valid test result is based on one positive and one negative reaction. TB PNA FISH was evaluated with 30 AFB+ cultures from Denmark and 42 AFB+ cultures from Thailand. The MTC-specific PNA probe showed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of 84 and 97 %, respectively, and a diagnostic specificity of 100 % in both studies, whereas the NTM-specific PNA probe showed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of 91 and 64 %, respectively, and a diagnostic specificity of 100 % in both studies. The low sensitivity of the NTM-specific PNA probe in the Thai study was due to a relatively high prevalence of Mycobacterium fortuitum, which is not identified by the probe. In total, 63 (87 %) of the cultures were correctly identified as MTC (n = 46) or NTM (n = 17), whereas the remaining 9 were negative with both probes and thus the results were inconclusive. None of the samples were incorrectly identified as MTC or NTM; thus, the predictive value of a valid test result obtained with TB PNA FISH was 100 %...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{genotype}} B (GTB) is a contagious mastitis pathogen in cattle, {{occurring in}} up to 87 % of individuals. Because treatment is generally insufficient, culling is often required, leading to large economic loss in the Swiss dairy industry. As the detection of this pathogen in bulk tank milk (BTM) would greatly facilitate its control, a novel real-time quantitative PCR-based assay for BTM has previously been developed and is now being evaluated for its diagnostic properties at the herd level. Herds were initially classified as to their Staph. aureus GTB status by a reference method. Using BTM and herd pools of single-quarter and 4 -quarter milk, the herds were then grouped by the novel assay, and the resulting classifications were compared. A total of 54 dairy herds were evaluated. Using the reference method, 21 herds {{were found to be}} GTB positive, whereas 33 were found to be negative. Considering the novel assay using both herd pools, all herds were grouped correctly, resulting in maximal <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> (100 %) and specificities (100 %). For BTM samples, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and specificities were 90 and 100 %, respectively. Two herds were false negative in BTM, because cows with clinical signs of mastitis were not milked into the tank. Besides its excellent diagnostic properties, the assay is characterized by its low detection level, high efficiency, and its suitability for automation.

The type of onset (acute versus subacute/chronic) along with associated {{symptoms such as}} the presence of pain, constitutional symptoms that encompass fever, malaise, weight loss or a cutaneous rash may help identify the cause of myelitis. In order to establish a diagnosis of myelitis, one has to localize the spinal cord level, and exclude cerebral and neuromuscular diseases. Also a detailed medical history, a careful neurologic examination, and imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed. In respect to the cause of the process, further work-up would help identify the cause and guide treatment. Full spine MRI is warranted, especially with acute onset myelitis, to evaluate for structural lesions that may require surgical intervention, or disseminated disease.

Lumbar puncture is important for the diagnosis of acute myelitis when a tumoral process, inflammatory or infectious cause are suspected, or the MRI is normal or non-specific.
