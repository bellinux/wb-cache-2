5000|$|Producing PVC decking is a {{relatively}} difficult process called co-extrusion. The <b>deck</b> <b>board</b> core is coated and bound with an outer plastic shell, but the materials can be temperamental and hard to work with. Commercial production is challenging, not only for this reason, but also because about one eighth of the <b>deck</b> <b>boards</b> produced are considered unsellable and therefore scrapped. The fragile nature of this production process requires careful ingredient mixing and precise execution.|$|R

This fact sheet brie y describes each type of decking material and discusses some of the pros and cons of each. Some of the important factors in choosing <b>decking</b> <b>boards</b> for your project include price, availability, construction exibility, mainte-There are three main types of boards that can be used to make decks: preservative-treated wood, naturally durable wood and wood/ plastic composite (WPC) lumber. Untreated, non-durable wood such as pine is not recommended for building decks. In some parts of the country untreated wood can last for a few years; but in the warm, humid climate of Tennes-see, untreated wood will quickly rot and won’t last long enough to justify any cost savings...|$|R

40|$|Commingled {{recycled}} plastic lumber (RPL) decking {{was exposed to}} the environment for eleven years. The weathering effect is examined by performing mechanical property tests on the full size <b>deck</b> <b>boards</b> {{before and after the}} exposure. Flexural tests on the weathered <b>deck</b> <b>boards</b> were conducted with the exposed side and the unexposed side tested in tension. The flexural proper-ties after weathering are compared to the original flexural properties. These data show the effect of weathering on recycled high-density polyethylene based RPL. A life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is also presented to compare the cost of a wood deck versus an all RPL deck. The pur-chase, maintenance, and disposal costs are included...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} {{conducted for the}} lateral torsional buckling of wooden beam-deck assemblies consisting of twin beams braced by tongue-and-groove decking at the top. Two models are developed, each {{with a series of}} analytical and numerical solutions formulated. The first model targets twin-beam-deck assemblies where <b>deck</b> <b>boards</b> and other components are detailed to provide full continuous lateral restraint while the second model is built for situations where the beams are allowed to sway laterally and the relative lateral movement between the beams is partially restrained by the <b>deck</b> <b>boards.</b> In the first model, focus is on wind uplift while in the second model, both gravity and uplift loading scenarios are investigated. In the first model, an energy method is adopted and the principle of stationary potential energy is evoked to formulate closed-form solutions, energy-based solutions and a finite element solution. The validity of the present solutions is verified against a finite element based ABAQUS model. Similarly, a family of solutions is developed under the sway model and verified against the ABAQUS. Parametric studies are conducted for both models {{to examine the effects of}} various variables on the buckling capacity. A comparative investigation on the behavioral difference between the two models under ABAQUS is also presented. Overall, the restraining effects of <b>deck</b> <b>boards</b> bracing either on the beam compression or tension side is observed to have a significant influence on the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the twin-beam-deck assemblies...|$|R

50|$|A pallet , {{sometimes}} inaccurately {{called a}} skid (a skid has no bottom <b>deck</b> <b>boards),</b> is a flat transport structure that supports goods {{in a stable}} fashion while being lifted by a forklift, pallet jack, front loader, work saver, or other jacking device, or a crane. A pallet is the structural foundation of a unit load which allows handling and storage efficiencies. Goods or shipping containers are often placed on a pallet secured with strapping, stretch wrap or shrink wrap and shipped. Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the wooden box and the wooden barrel, as it works well with modern packaging like corrugated boxes and Intermodal containers commonly used for bulk shipping.|$|R
