2500|$|On hearing {{screams in}} a room, I went up {{a sort of}} tunnel passage and saw an Arab {{in the act of}} cutting off a child's head with a sword. He had already hit him and was having another cut, but on seeing me he tried to aim the stroke at me, but missed; he was {{practically}} on the muzzle of my rifle. <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> low in the groin. Behind him was a Jewish woman smothered in blood with a man I recognized as a police constable named Issa Sheriff from Jaffa. He was standing over the woman with a dagger in his hand. He saw me and bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out-shouting in Arabic, [...] "Your Honor, I am a policeman." ... I got into the room and shot him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What of that? <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> {{just the}} same. There {{was no need}} for you to jump down there that way. It was brutal and cowardly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could never}} find it," [...] he continued. [...] "He had {{secreted}} it about his person. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him,</b> but nevertheless I {{was unable to}} obtain it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Done! {{why there}} was no one to do anything, unless <b>I</b> had <b>shot</b> <b>him,</b> or marooned him. No law runs in these parts. Thompson was the best partner I ever had; he was with me in that lark with the tabooed pig." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a fool I was," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself, [...] "to have come without my pistol. <b>I</b> would have <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> as he sits, and so wiped out Drogheda." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Black Will of Lynchmere," [...] {{said the}} bowman. [...] "Many a match have <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> with <b>him,</b> and <b>I</b> know well {{that no other}} man on the Surrey marches could have sped such a shaft. I trust that you are houseled and shriven, Will, for I have known you so long that I would not have your damnation upon my soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... â€œYou killed Harry Dunbar, he whispers. [...] . The fellow {{glares at}} him and shows his teeth: Of course I did! I had been in that cabin {{for an hour and}} a half like a rat in a trap. [...] . Shut up and left to drown in that wreck. Let flesh and blood judge. Of course <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him!</b> I thought it was you, you murdering scoundrel, come back to settle me. He opens the door flying and tumbles right down upon me; I had a {{revolver}} in my hand, and <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> I was crazy. Men have gone crazy for less.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here he is!' bawled Giles, {{calling in}} a state of great excitement, up the staircase; 'here's one of the thieves, ma'am! Here's a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him,</b> miss; and Brittles held the light.' ...|$|E
60|$|Over my table, as I write, {{is a big}} {{snowy owl}} whose yellow eyes seem to be always {{watching}} me, whatever I do. Perhaps he is still wondering at the curious way in which <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5000|$|She later {{admitted}} that she waited around Murphy's apartment in the Nob Hill area for four days. She eventually spotted Murphy leaving the Pacific-Union Club on January 20. While Murphy was getting into his car, Bellamy fired three <b>shots</b> at <b>him.</b> She later said, [...] "I wasn't within speaking distance Murphy, but he saw me and shouted something I didn't understand. Maybe it was 'don't.' Then <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> at <b>him.</b> He ducked and ran." [...] She fired three times, hitting Murphy's car twice while the third shot missed. Witnesses wrestled the gun out of her hand.|$|R
6000|$|But if {{you will}} believe me, he merely looked surprised, that is all! he didn't grasp the {{situation}} at all, didn't know he had walked into a trap, didn't discover {{that he was in}} a trap. <b>I</b> could have <b>shot</b> <b>him,</b> from sheer vexation. With cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was waiting. Jonathan never acts {{until the}} right moment, and then--well, you saw him. The little villain {{deserved}} killing. <b>I</b> could have <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> with pleasure. Do you know, Sheppard, Jonathan's aversion to shedding blood is a singular thing. He'd never kill {{the worst kind}} of a white man until driven to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He never {{fired at}} all, Miss Kingston; {{he will never}} fire again. <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> as he said 'two,' and no doubt {{the shock of the}} sudden shot caused you to faint dead away. You fell the same instant that he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{went out}} to scout round the house, leaving me at the gate," [...] Harold said. [...] "Two men, I think Indians, came up; one was getting over the gate when <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> I think he is lying outside--the other has disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dane. [...] "Rideau was drowned {{while trying}} to avoid me. The man with the cross on his {{forehead}} is also dead. He twice attempted my comrade's life, and <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> one night when he was crawling toward my tent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wanted to," [...] said Benham {{and became}} {{thoughtful}} for a time. [...] "I think I {{ought to have}} made some sort of quarrel. But then as I am an Englishman he might have hesitated. He would have funked a strange beast like me. And <b>I</b> couldn't have <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> if he had hesitated. And if he hadn't--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{films with}} Navin Nishchol were very {{successful}} like Victoria No. 203 and Paise Ki Gudiya. In an interview she quoted that she regretted missing chance {{of working with}} Rajesh Khanna. She quoted [...] "I was supposed {{to work with him}} in Choti Bahu(1971) but I could not because I was ill. <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> with <b>him</b> for two days and found that he was very charming, humble and a shy person". She did earn three additional Filmfare nominations as Best Actress for Shagird (1967), Diwana (1968), and Sagina (1974).|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't you lend me {{your own}} cool head and clear brain," [...] {{retorted}} the other, [...] "and then {{we might have}} done something of the sort? But surely the <b>shot</b> <b>I</b> gave <b>him</b> must tell in the long-run." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was on that," [...] said Professor Challenger, {{pointing}} to this tree, [...] "that the pterodactyl was perched. I climbed half-way up the rock before <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> I am {{inclined to think}} that a good mountaineer like myself could ascend the rock to the top, though he would, of course, be no nearer to the plateau when he had done so." ...|$|E

He was {{out at the}} war, And got some scent of the intimacy That was under way between her and me; And he stole back home, and appeared like a ghost One night, {{at the very time}} almost That I reached her house. Well, <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> dead, And secretly buried him. Nothing was said.|$|E
6000|$|... "That kid {{introduced}} us, {{with some}} footnotes and explanations that made things plainer {{than a week}} of rhetoric. He danced around, and punched us in the back, and tried to climb John Tom's leg. 'This is John Tom, mamma,' says he. 'He's a Indian. He sells medicine in a red wagon. <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him,</b> but he wasn't wild. The other one's Jeff. He's a fakir, too. Come on and see the camp where we live, won't you, mamma?' ...|$|E
6000|$|I saw, {{felt all}} this in one {{flashing}} instant. And as swiftly my spirit changed. What I might have done I never knew, but most likely <b>I</b> would have <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> through the brain. Only a sudden action of the stag paralyzed all my force. He lowered his head. He saw me. And dying, with lungs and heart and bowels shot to shreds, he edged his stiff front feet toward me, he dragged his afterquarters, he slid, he flopped, he skittered convulsively at me. No fear in the black, distended, wild eyes! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{feel sorry}} for it. I don't {{believe it was a}} bad thing to do--any more than burning a toy like I did once when I was a baby. I nearly killed myself with a razor. Who hasn't?--anyhow gone as far as {{thinking}} of it? Most of my time I've been half dreaming. I married like a dream almost. I've never really planned my life or set out to live. I happened; things happened to me. It's so with everyone. Jim couldn't help himself. <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> at <b>him</b> and tried to kill him. I dropped the gun and he got it. He very nearly had me. I wasn't a second too soon--ducking.... Awkward--that night was.... M'mm.... But I don't blame him--come to that. Only I don't see what it's all up to....|$|R
6000|$|I 'most {{jumped out}} of my skin for joy. I {{reckoned}} Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off; but if you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might lose it if he didn't speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn't know what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and <b>I</b> could a <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> for it: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean no offence," [...] said Smith, endeavouring {{to speak}} {{a little less}} gruffly. [...] "The fact is, gents, I'm out o' sorts, 'cos I lost a grizzly bar in the hills {{an hour or two}} agone. <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> dead, as I thought, and went up and drove my knife into his side, but it struck a rib and broke the pint, as ye see; and a'most afore I could get up a tree, he wos close up behind me. He went away after a while, and so I got clear off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{jumped into}} one of the hollows {{at the foot of a}} cotton tree. The whole four fired at us and then, as they {{supposed}} that we were unarmed, made a rush. I shot two of them as they came on. One of the others aimed a blow at me, with the butt end of his gun. Fortunately the weapon caught one of the creepers, and flew out of his hand. My revolver had in some way stuck, but it all came right just at the moment, and <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> The fourth man bolted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Out of my way!" [...] {{he cried}} furiously. [...] "Come with me, Wolf! We must follow him. I must have my papers back, or kill him! I have been dreaming. He {{told me that}} he was C. I gave him all he asked for! We must have them back. Merciful heavens! if he publishes them, we are ruined ... where did he come from?... They {{told me that he}} was dead.... Has he crawled back out of hell? <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> once! He has never {{forgotten}} it! This is his vengeance! Oh, God!" ...|$|E
60|$|Only hate, only terrible, wild, unquenchable {{spirit to}} {{live long enough}} to kill me! I saw it, He meant to kill me. How magnificent, how horrible this wild courage! My eyes seemed riveted upon him, as he came closer, closer. He gasped. Blood {{sputtered}} from his throat. But more terrible than agony, than imminent death was the spirit of this wild beast to slay its enemy. Inch by inch he skidded closer to me, with a convulsive quivering awful to see. No veil of the past, no scale of civilization between beast and man then! Enemies as old as the earth! <b>I</b> had <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> to eat, and he would kill me before he died. For me the moment was monstrous. No hunter was I then, but a man stricken by the spirit and mystery of life, by the agony and terror of death, by the awful strange sense that this stag would kill me.|$|R
60|$|I cocked both barrels and {{levelled}} the shot-gun at him. Had he moved, {{attempted to}} drop down the companion-way, I know <b>I</b> would have <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> But he stood motionless and staring as before. And as I faced him, with levelled gun shaking in my hands, I {{had time to}} note the worn and haggard appearance of his face. It was as if some strong anxiety had wasted it. The cheeks were sunken, {{and there was a}} wearied, puckered expression on the brow. And {{it seemed to me that}} his eyes were strange, not only the expression, but the physical seeming, as though the optic nerves and supporting muscles had suffered strain and slightly twisted the eyeballs.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} we had gained the clump of bushes close behind which the duck lay; and Peterkin, going down on all fours, crept forward to get a <b>shot.</b> <b>I</b> {{followed}} <b>him</b> in the same manner, and when he stopped to take a deliberate aim, I crept up alongside. The duck had heard our approach, and was swimming about in a somewhat agitated manner among the tall reeds, so that my companion made one or two unsuccessful attempts to take aim.|$|R
60|$|I {{placed a}} foot upon the lowest ledge and clambered upward, {{reaching}} down and pulling Lys to my side. Already I felt safer. Soon {{we would be}} out of danger of the beasts again closing in upon us. The man above us raised his stone hatchet above his head and leaped lightly down to meet us. His position above me gave him a great advantage, or at least so he probably thought, for he came with every show of confidence. I hated to do it, but there seemed no other way, and so <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> down as I had shot down Tsa.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} it. He {{told me that he}} was working it out a year and a half ago, and how he was working it out night after night when the boat had gone away, and he could get out near the {{quicksand}} safely. Then he said that we would get away together. But I was afraid that he would leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out, and so <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> Besides, it is not advisable that the men who once get in here should escape. Only I, and I am a Brahmin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him,</b> {{and put him}} out of his misery. I patted him fust, and said, 'Good-by;' then I {{laid his}} head easy on the grass, give a last look into his lovin' eyes, and sent a bullet through his head. He hardly stirred, I aimed so true, and when I seen him quite still, with no more moanin' and pain, I was glad, and yet wal, I don't know as I need by ashamed on't I jest put my arms raound his neck and boo-hooed like a great baby. Sho! I didn't know I was sech a fool;" [...] and Silas drew his sleeve across his eyes, as much touched by Daisy's sob, as by the memory of {{faithful}} Major.|$|E
60|$|Growing more alarmed every minute, {{he began}} to retrace his steps. Then it was he {{encountered}} the two Swine-men I had seen dancing {{on the night of}} my arrival; blood-stained they were about the mouth, and intensely excited. They came crashing through the ferns, and stopped with fierce faces when they saw him. He cracked his whip in some trepidation, and forthwith they rushed at him. Never before had a Beast Man dared to do that. One he shot through the head; M'ling flung himself upon the other, and the two rolled grappling. M'ling got his brute under and with his teeth in its throat, and Montgomery shot that too as it struggled in M'ling's grip. He had some difficulty in inducing M'ling to come on with him. Thence they had hurried back to me. On the way, M'ling had suddenly rushed into a thicket and driven out an under-sized Ocelot-man, also blood-stained, and lame through a wound in the foot. This brute had run a little way and then turned savagely at bay, and Montgomery--with a certain wantonness, <b>I</b> thought--had <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On {{reflection}} {{the general}} scheme became clear. The Spitfire {{was to be}} a sort of datum pacemaker - 'Mr Average Contemporary Fighter' - and its job would be to come in last, the real excitement of the proceedings being by how much it would be beaten by the Fw 190 and the Typhoon, and which of these two bright stars would beat the other and by how much. Outside on the tarmac at Worthy Down stood the inoffensive-looking but highly potent DP485 ...All went according to plan until, when we were about halfway between Odiham and Farnborough and going flat out, I was beginning to overhaul the Fw 190 and the Typhoon. Suddenly I saw sparks and black smoke coming from the Fw 190's exhaust ... and <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> past <b>him</b> and never saw him again. I was also easily leaving the Typhoon behind and the eventual finishing order was, first the Spitfire, second the Typhoon, third the Fw 190. This was precisely the opposite result to that expected, or indeed intended. It certainly put the cat among the pigeons and among the VIPs.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Strong Elk, whose {{hospitality}} {{we enjoy}} to-night, {{was chief of}} the Blackfeet. I {{was on my way}} to visit him, when, one evening, I came upon the camp of the pale-faces. I knew that sometimes they were not friendly to the red-man, so I waited till dark, and then crept forward and listened. Their chief was loud-voiced and boastful. He boasted of how many Indians he had killed. <b>I</b> could have <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> where <b>I</b> lay and then escaped easily, but I spared him, for I wished to listen. They talked much of the Strong Elk. I understood very little. The language of the pale-face is difficult to understand, but I came to know that in two hours, when the moon should sink, they would attack him.|$|R
