40|$|The new Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), to be {{commissioned}} at CERN in early 2005, {{will be a}} very important element of the LHC lead ions injection chain and will require a new beam control and cavity servoing system. Current plans call for a new all-digital beam control system based on the same technology deployed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) for the to control the AGS Booster beam. That beam control system, now under development, relies on VME modules and <b>daughter</b> <b>boards</b> based on Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The DSP provides high throughput processing capabilities and ease of connection with the software layer immediately above, while the <b>daughter</b> <b>boards</b> implement master clock, digital receiver and modulator capabilities. The resulting system is very flexible because is configurable via software and offers multi-processing capabilities and high bandwidth data paths, features that make it very attractive for a beam control implementation. For application to the LEIR beam control system development, a prototype version of the VME modules and <b>daughter</b> <b>boards</b> has been tested in the PS Booster during the summer 2003. A low-intensity proton beam was injected in PS Booster Ring 4 and a simplified beam control and feedback loop was implemented.

50|$|An {{aftermarket}} add-on board, the FDCX4 Double Density Upgrade Board for the 4FDC, {{was designed}} and marketed by JVB Electronics. The FDCX4 was a <b>daughter</b> <b>board</b> assembly that replaced the WD1771 single density disk controller chip on the 4FDC with a FD1791 (early production) or Fujitsu MB8876A (later production) double-density controller chip. The FDCX4, in addition to using an analog phase-locked-loop data separator in all modes, also used write-precompensation. These features allowed the FDCX4 equipped 4FDC to reliably use the Persci 277 drives, {{as well as other}} drives, in double-density mode.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{electronics}} used a motherboard with plug-in daughter cards. The microprocessor, memory, serial interface card, and various optional functions were each on separate cards. This permitted easy field maintenance, upgrades, and reconfiguration. For example, more memory (providing larger scrollback capability) {{could be easily}} added, the serial interface could be changed from RS-232 to current loop, etc. The optional tape drives of the 2645 model were interfaced via another plug-in card.The plug-in card capability strongly resembled the later Apple II expansion architecture. In fact Apple I is derived from a plug-in <b>daughter</b> <b>board</b> inside the 2645 terminal sponsored by Hewlett Packard.|$|E

The MV/60000HA {{was intended to}} be a High Availability system, with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure. Yet, there were failures among the system's many <b>daughter</b> <b>boards,</b> back-plane, and mid-plane. DG technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the DG factory in Mexico where they were made and refurbished.|$|R

The IBM genlock connector {{was moved to the}} top of the card, and stereo display signals were also brought out to the VGA passthrough connector. The card occupied 1 32-bit MCA slot and an adjacent 16/32 bit slot. One or two <b>daughter</b> <b>boards</b> provided framebuffer and z-buffer memory.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Spain briefly {{introduced}} an import tax on computers without ñ letter key and containing 64KB {{or less of}} RAM. To circumvent this, Amstrad's Spanish distributor Indescomp (later to become Amstrad Spain) created and distributed the CPC472, {{a modified version of}} the CPC464. Its main difference is a small additional <b>daughter</b> <b>board</b> containing a CPC664 ROM chip, and an 8 KB memory chip which is not electrically connected to the machine, and consequently rendered unusable. Its sole purpose was supposedly to increase the machine's total memory specs to 72 KB in order to circumvent the import tax. Only a month after the CPC472 had been released, Amstrad added the ñ key for the 464 so this tariff was not applied to 64k computers anymore and production of the CPC472 was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|The motherboard, also {{referred}} to as system board or main board, is the primary circuit board within a personal computer, and other major system components plug directly into it or via a cable. A motherboard contains a microprocessor, the CPU supporting circuitry (mostly integrated circuits) that provide the interface between memory and input/output peripheral circuits, main memory, and facilities for initial setup of the computer immediately after power-on (often called boot firmware or, in IBM PC compatible computers, a BIOS or UEFI). In many portable and embedded personal computers, the motherboard houses nearly all of the PC's core components. Often a motherboard will also contain one or more peripheral buses and physical connectors for expansion purposes. Sometimes a secondary <b>daughter</b> <b>board</b> is connected to the motherboard to provide further expandability or to satisfy space constraints.|$|E

Some of its features include TI Burr-Brown 124 dB SNR DACs, two swappable op-amps, a 600ohm 80 mW TI TPA6120 headphone amplifier, and 192 kHz stereo pass through. The Sound Blaster ZxR comes with a <b>daughter</b> <b>board</b> which provides optical S/PDIF input and output, and two RCA inputs that feature a TI Burr-Brown 123 dB SNR analog-to-digital converter (ADC); {{it has its own}} Sound Core3D processor and takes up a second expansion slot in the computer if installed. The ZxR can record up to 24-bit/96 kHz. The ACM and two boards (main and daughter) have a black color scheme with no LED lighting.|$|E

50|$|The {{design was}} also simple to modify {{for the sake}} of system {{expansion}} and enhancement. Many different modifications to increase the system clock speed were possible, including some that required nothing more than jumpers (e.g. the 3.5 MHz speed upgrade obtained by jumpering the clock divider, with no software modifications or changes to the ICs on the board.) There was also a minor industry in user-installable system upgrades such as real time clocks, 4 MHz upgrades, double density floppy upgrades, character enhancements for the display (reverse video, blinking, etc.), and the addition of hard disk interfaces such as SASI and SCSI. Most of these upgrades were accomplished through the use of daughter boards that plugged into existing IC sockets on the board, with the original IC either replaced by a more capable IC or placed into a socket on the <b>daughter</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Voodoo2 (or Voodoo2) {{was a set}} {{of three}} {{specialized}} 3D graphics chips on a single chipset setup, made by 3dfx. It was released in February 1998 {{as a replacement for}} the original Voodoo Graphics chipset. The card ran at a chipset clock rate of 90 MHz and used 100 MHz EDO DRAM, and was available for the PCI interface. The Voodoo2 came in two models, one with 8 MB RAM and one with 12 MB RAM. The 8 MB card had 2 MB of memory per texture mapping unit (TMU) vs. 4 MB on the 12 MB model. The 4 MB framebuffer on both cards supported a maximum screen resolution of 800 × 600, while the increased texture memory on the 12 MB card allowed more detailed textures. Some boards with 8 MB could be upgraded to 12 MB with an additional <b>daughter</b> <b>board.</b> Each of the three chips present on the card had its own 64-bit RAM interface, giving the card a [...] "total" [...] bus width of 192 bits. The Voodoo2 had an increased chip-count compared to the original two-chip Voodoo card. Competing products such as the ATI Rage Pro, NVIDIA RIVA 128, and Rendition Verite 2x00 were single-chip products, each with integrated 2D GUI/VGA accelerators. As with the original Voodoo, the Voodoo2 was a dedicated 3D accelerator, and had to be used in conjunction with a conventional 2D graphics card. It required the same external pass-through cabling familiar to owners of the Voodoo.|$|E
