5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E

Basically they are a form of group interviews where data is produced through participants’ discussion led by a moderator, on the topic determined by the researcher. There is not only one way of doing <b>focus</b> <b>groups.</b> Their features, size, composition, purpose as well as areas where they are practiced vary. <b>Focus</b> <b>groups</b> are used as a self-contained method; as a supplementary method for qualitative and quantitative methods; and finally they are used in multimethod studies. Like other research methods <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> also have strengths and weaknesses, which makes <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> more or less appropriate as a data gathering method for a particular study. The strategic questions posed to the <b>focus</b> <b>groups,</b> in my own work - the project about Bosnian youngsters’ political socialization - cover aspects of their social context, contacts with media and political groups, as well as their own plans for the future.

40|$|<b>Focus</b> <b>groups</b> {{have become}} an {{important}} method in qualitative psychological research and are also used widely in evaluation studies. However, {{there has been a}} surprising lack of attention in the literature in terms of exploring the entire process of conducting <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> with young people on potentially psychologically sensitive issues such as sexual health. This article draws on our experiences of using <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> during a specific piece of qualitative research that involved three discrete but inter-related evaluations of sexual health services for young people in the South of England. We focus particularly on the process of using <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> as an important and useful empirical method to generate primary qualitative data. In doing so, we consider a number of both practical and ethical considerations when planning, facilitating, and following up <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> with young people that aim to investigate psychologically sensitive issues, in this case, sexual health. As a result, we propose a heuristic framework for conducting <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> 'from start to finish' including preparing <b>focus</b> <b>groups,</b> facilitating <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and following up participants, that offers a contribution to the advancement of qualitative inquiry in psychology. Key recommendations are elicited both for the teaching of qualitative psychological research methods and for the training of qualitative researchers interested in psychological phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} the nature and the {{potential}} use of avatar-based <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> (AFGs) (i. e. <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> conducted in three-dimensional [3 D] virtual worlds [VWs]) as compared to face-to-face and online <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> (OFGs), motivated by the ability of VWs to stimulate the realism of physical places. Over the past decade, {{there has been a}} rapid increase in using 3 D VWs as a research tool. Design/methodology/approach – Using a two-phase reflective approach, data were collected first by using traditional face-to-face <b>focus</b> <b>groups,</b> followed by AFGs. In Phase 2, an online, semi-structured survey provided comparison data and experiences in AFGs, two-dimensional OFGs and traditional face-to-face <b>focus</b> <b>groups.</b> Findings – The findings identify {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} AFGs for marketing research. There is no evident difference in data quality between the results of AFGs and face-to-face <b>focus</b> <b>groups.</b> AFG compensates for some of the serious limitations associated with OFGs. Practical implications – The paper reflects on three issues, data quality, conduct of AFGs (including the moderator reflection) and participant experience, that together inform one’s understanding of the characteristics, advantages and limitations of AFG. Originality/value – This is the first paper to compare between AFGs, traditional face-to-face <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and OFGs.

40|$|Purpose. To compare two {{different}} approaches to performing <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and individual interviews, an open approach, and an approach based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Methods. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis attended <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> (n = 49) and individual interviews (n = 21). Time, number of concepts, ICF categories identified, and sample size for reaching saturation of data were compared. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, and independent t tests were performed. Results. With an overall time of 183 h, <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> were more time consuming than individual interviews (t = 9. 782; P < 0. 001). In the open approach, 188 categories in the <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and 102 categories in the interviews were identified compared to the 231 and 110 respective categories identified in the ICF-based approach. Saturation of data was reached after performing five <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and nine individual interviews in the open approach and five <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and 12 individual interviews in the ICF-based approach.

When a <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> responded lukewarm to Frankie but warmer to Paulina, Phelps gave the greenlight to axe Frankie. When word got out about Frankie's exit, another massive rampage of fan protests arose. Phelps quickly asked then-head writer Margaret DePriest to re-write Frankie's exit so that the character would at least still live. DePriest, eager to satisfy her wish to see Frankie's husband, Cass, return to his former rogue ways, vehemently refused. Frankie was murdered in what many people felt were overly brutal and gruesome scenes.|$|E

Although <b>focus</b> groups—small <b>group</b> discussions led by a moderator—have been used in fields such as marketing research and sociology for many years, only in {{the past decade or so}} have politicians begun frequently employing this qualitative methodology. According to accounts in the popular media, <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> are commonplace in campaigns, but this research indicates that is not the case. Instead, <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> are relied upon a great deal in presidential elections, but much less so in U. S. senate races, and hardly at all in campaigns for the U. S.

Moreover, the decision to use <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> depends largely on the size of the campaign, the degree of competition, and the personal preferences of politicians and advisors. These conclusions were reached after conducting interviews with federal politicians, their staffs, consultants, political operatives, and observers of federal politics. Additionally, books and articles chronicling various campaigns were also drawn upon. In essence, <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> are simply a systematic way to obtain constituent input, not vastly different from discussions politicians routinely have with voters. Moreover, while <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> can provide information helpful to determining how to communicate with voters, it is not essential for success even at the presidential level.
