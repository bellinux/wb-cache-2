25|$|The <b>euphonium</b> {{is part of}} {{the family}} of brass instruments. It is {{sometimes}} confused with the baritone horn. The <b>euphonium</b> and the baritone differ in that the bore size of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the <b>euphonium,</b> and the baritone is primarily cylindrical bore, whereas the <b>euphonium</b> is predominantly conical bore. The two instruments are easily interchangeable to the player, with some modification of breath and embouchure, since the two have identical range and essentially identical fingering. The cylindrical baritone offers a brighter sound and the conical <b>euphonium</b> offers a mellower sound.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of vocal transcriptions for <b>euphonium,</b> there remains much vocal work that is rarely, if ever, performed on <b>euphonium,</b> including Spanish, French, and German opera arias. The possibility of performing choral music in a <b>euphonium</b> ensemble is also intriguing, but not often seen.|$|E
25|$|Arthur W. Lehman, (1917–2009), American <b>euphonium</b> soloist {{known as}} 'Art', Recording Artist, United States Marine Band, noted <b>euphonium</b> author of {{works such as}} The Art of <b>Euphonium.</b> Lehman was a student of Harold Brasch and Simone Mantia and {{advanced}} {{the concept of a}} rich resonant sound with no vibrato pioneered by Mantia.|$|E

25|$|The <b>euphonium,</b> {{like the}} tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a valved brass {{instrument}} like the <b>euphonium,</b> {{this means that}} when no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. It is generally orchestrated as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone, written at concert pitch in the bass clef with higher passages in the tenor clef. Treble clef <b>euphonium</b> parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much concert band music: in the British-style brass band tradition, <b>euphonium</b> music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the <b>euphonium</b> may be written in the bass clef as a B transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.|$|E
25|$|German Ferdinand Sommer, if one {{discounts}} {{the claims}} of Moritz and Sax each of whose horns also approached a <b>euphonium</b> in nature, {{in addition to being}} credited with inventing the <b>euphonium</b> as the Sommerhorn in 1843, as a soloist on the horn, qualifies as the first <b>euphonium</b> player to significantly advance and alter the understanding of the instrument. Below are a select few of the players most famous and influential in their respective countries, and whose contributions to the <b>euphonium</b> world are undeniable, in terms of recordings, commissions, pedagogy, and increased recognition of the instrument.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the long-standing practice of extensive <b>euphonium</b> use in wind bands and orchestras, there was, until approximately forty years ago, literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the <b>euphonium,</b> and euphoniumists were forced to borrow the literature of other instruments. Fortunately, given the instrument's multifaceted capabilities discussed above, solos for many different instruments are easily adaptable to performance on the <b>euphonium.</b>|$|E

25|$|The five-valve <b>euphonium</b> (noncompensating) is an {{extremely}} rare variation of the <b>euphonium</b> manufactured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Britain's Besson musical instrument company and Highams of Manchester Musical Instrument Company.

25|$|Another form of {{the marching}} <b>euphonium</b> is the {{convertible}} <b>euphonium.</b> Recently widely produced, the horn resembles a convertible tuba, being able to change from a concert upright to a marching forward bell on either {{the left or right}} shoulder.
