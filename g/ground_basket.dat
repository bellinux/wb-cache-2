50|$|Most pilots try {{to perform}} as smooth a landing as possible. This becomes {{difficult}} {{if the air}} at ground level is moving at more than 5 mph or so.

(It is best not to be on the downwind side of a landing balloon to avoid being pinned between it and a hard place.)

50|$|A {{large crowd}} had {{gathered}} {{to witness the}} event, but it was immediately obvious that Cocking was in trouble. He had neglected to include {{the weight of the}} parachute itself in his calculations and as a result the descent was far too quick. Though rapid, the descent continued evenly for a few seconds, but then the entire apparatus turned inside out and plunged downwards with increasing speed. The parachute broke up before it hit the ground and at about 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 m) off the <b>ground</b> the <b>basket</b> detached from the remains of the canopy. Cocking was killed instantly in the crash; his body was found in a field in Lee. The blame for the failure of the parachute was initially laid at Cayley's door, but tests later revealed that although Cayley had neglected to mention the additional weight of the parachute in his paper, the cause of the crash had been a combination of the parachute's weight and its flimsy construction, in particular the weak stitching connecting the fabric to the hoops. Cocking's parachute weighed 250 lb (113 kg) many times more than modern parachutes. However, tests carried out by John Wise, an American balloonist, showed that Cocking's design would have been successful if only it had been larger and better constructed. In comparing the designs of Garnerin's and Cocking's parachutes he found that the latter always descended in a much steadier and more even manner. The oscillation problem inherent in the Garnerin parachute was later solved by the introduction of a vent {{in the top of the}} canopy.|$|R
5000|$|The first entrepreneur, Louis Hinard, {{a native}} of Beauvais who had already {{established}} workshops in Paris, produced unambitious floral and foliate tapestries called verdures and landscape tapestries, which are known through chance notations in royal accounts. He was arrested for his debts in 1684, and the workshops were refounded more successfully under Philippe Behagle, a merchant tapestry-manufacturer from Oudenarde, who had also worked in the traditional tapestry-weaving city of Tournai. Behagle's first successes were a suite of Conquests of the King which complemented a contemporaneous Gobelins suite showing episodes in the Life of the King, without directly competing with them. A suite of Acts of the Apostles, following copies of Raphael's cartoons, are in the cathedral of Beauvais. The so-called Teniers tapestries, {{in the manner of}} village scenes painted by David Teniers the Younger, began to be woven under Behagle and continued popular, with up-dated borders, into the eighteenth century, when the earliest series of archives begin.The great series of Grotesques (illustration, left) initiated in the 1690s became a mainstay of Beauvais production, woven through the Régence.

40|$|Trap gear such as {{set nets}} and pots are usually {{operated}} to fix {{on the sea}} bottom for several weeks. In order to be clear function changes in trap gear frameworks of this thesis were consisted of the following three steps by fishing gear constructions. 1) The netting twines consisted of the fundamental part of a fishing gear may be changed the breaking strength and elongation. 2) The nettings consisted of the minimum unit of function of capture. 3) Pot fishing gears are considered to the simplest model of an actual fishing gear. On the other hand, {{it is important for}} establishing and carrying out of environment-friendly to improve the fishing technology. In fact, trap gear are well-known as never-overfishing gear. It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of netting twines after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene netting twines having thickness of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test netting twines were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing <b>ground</b> for cuttlefish <b>basket</b> traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|R
