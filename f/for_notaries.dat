40|$|The 1999 Dutch Notary Act has {{initiated}} an ambitious deregulation {{process in the}} market <b>for</b> <b>notary</b> services in the Netherlands. We evaluate {{the impact of this}} liberalisation policy on (i) the level of competition in the profession and (ii) the quality of services. We compare the level of competition before and after the liberalisation using two different indicators, namely a relative-profit indicator and a variation of the Bresnahan-Reiss indicator. Using the relative profit indicator, we find that the level of competition has increased after 1999. We find, however, {{no significant difference between the}} level of competition in 1996 and in 2002. This is particularly clear when we measure competition taking the local market as the relevant market <b>for</b> <b>notary</b> services. The results on the national market are more mixed and there is some evidence that competition in 2002 is higher than in 1996. Using the Bresnahan-Reiss indicator, we find that entry does affect conduct in the notary market, but again that the level of competition in the local market <b>for</b> <b>notary</b> services in 2003 does not significantly differ from the 1995 level. We also examine whether competition affects the quality of notary services. We use both subjective and objective measures <b>for</b> quality of <b>notary</b> services. We find that subjective quality - the perceived level of service by clients - is, if anything, negatively affected by competition. Using objective quality, i. e. quality that is not observable to clients, we find that in 2003 competition leads to a deterioration of quality, as the quality of monopoly notaries outperforms the quality of oligopoly notaries. This was not the case in 1995. Confronting our empirical findings with qualitative insights, we present options for policy. ...|$|R

5000|$|Pennsylvania notaries {{are governed}} by Title 57 of the Pennsylvania Statutes, known as the Notary Public Law. Act 151 of 2002 amended Title 57, {{bringing}} about the most significant changes to the Notary Public Law in 50 years. In effect since July 1, 2003, these changes include required education <b>for</b> <b>notaries,</b> specific signer identification procedures, eligibility of nonresidents to hold notarial commission, embossing seal no longer required on notarized documents, and authorization for electronic notarization.

50|$|The new law {{makes it}} easier <b>for</b> <b>notary's</b> clerks {{to set up a}} {{practice}} and gives notaries more freedom in determining their fees for services. The Act has provided for the establishment of an external committee of experts; if notary's clerks submit a sound business plan to the committee, they have a greater chance to be approved to set up their own practice. Greater freedom in the fees a notary can charge implies that the Royal Society of Notaries no longer fixes fees or prescribes rates. Since July 2003 notaries have been free to establish their own fees. Maximum rate caps fixed by authorities now apply only to family law services in certain circumstances.|$|R

5000|$|In {{practice}} the need <b>for</b> <b>notaries</b> in purely English legal matters is very small; for example {{they are not}} involved in normal property transactions. Since a great many solicitors also perform the function of commissioners for oaths and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by notaries relates to international matters in some way. They witness or authenticate documents to be used abroad. Many English notaries have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification. The work of notaries and solicitors in England is separate although most notaries are solicitors. The Notaries Society gives the number of notaries in England and Wales as [...] "about 1,000," [...] all but seventy of whom are solicitors.|$|E
