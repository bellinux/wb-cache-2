6000|$|The {{choppers}} heard not, {{the camp}} shanties echoed not, [...] The quick-ear'd teamsters and chain and <b>jack-screw</b> men heard not, [...] As the wood-spirits came from their haunts {{of a thousand}} years to [...] join the refrain, [...] But in my soul I plainly heard.|$|E
60|$|All {{this sort}} of thing worried me very much. My mind was eminently {{disposed}} toward peace and tranquillity, but who could be peaceful and tranquil with a prospective <b>jack-screw</b> under the very base of his comfort and happiness? In fact, my house had never been such a happy home as it was at that time. The fact of its unwarranted position upon other people's grounds had ceased to trouble me.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} our arrival the crew formed {{themselves}} into two gangs and obtained employment at screwing cotton by the day... With {{the aid of}} a set of <b>jack-screws</b> and a ditty, we would stow away huge bales of cotton, singing all the while. The song enlivened the gang and seemed to make the work much easier.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{used to be}} your house," [...] she continued, [...] "can be <b>jack-screwed</b> up {{a little}} bit and a good {{foundation}} put under it. I have inquired about that. Of course {{it would not have been}} proper to let you know that I was satisfied with the state of things, but I was satisfied, and there is no use of denying it. As soon as I got over my first scare after that house came down the hill, and had seen how everything might be arranged to suit all parties, I said to myself, `What the Lord has joined together, let not man put asunder,' and so, according to my belief, the strongest kind of <b>jack-screws</b> could not put these two houses asunder, any more than they could put you and Kitty asunder, now that you have agreed to take each other for each other's own." ...|$|R

You mean that a pilot ought to know where he is steering, which is perfectly sound doctrine. My own experience tells me, that if you press a sturgeon's nose with your foot, it will spring up as soon as it is loosened. Now the <b>jack-screw</b> will heave a great strain, no doubt; but the moment it is let up, down comes all that rests on it, again. This Mr. Dodge, I suppose you know, has been a passenger with me once or twice?" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{came to my}} raft, I {{brought my}} effects on shore, which work spent that day entirely; and fearing that some cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I slept, I made a kind of hut or {{barricade}} with the chests and boards I had brought onshore. That night I slept very comfortably; {{and the next morning}} my thoughts were employed to make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away what necessaries I could find, before another storm should break her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and prepared a second raft far more nice then the first, upon which I brought away the carpenter's stores, two or three bags full of nails, a great <b>jack-screw,</b> a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took away several things that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, two barels of musket-bullets, another fowling-piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large bagful of small shot. Besides these, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a spare fore topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and thus completing my second cargo, I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild beast might destroy what I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me or the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of biscuit, which she instantly ate, and departed.|$|E
5000|$|The robbers {{got into}} the safe through a hole cut in the wall by a <b>jack-screw.</b> [...] They stole 12,531,000, all in 500-, and 100-złoty notes. The loot was {{staggering}} for these times, as back then, the biggest lottery jackpots were up to 1 million złotys.|$|E

Never heard of an emergency-stop either, did ye? Don't know what ye carry <b>jack-screws</b> for? You're too innocent {{to be left alone}} with your own tender. Oh, you--you flatcar!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the coming}} son George, with his <b>jack-screws,</b> did trouble me very much, and that {{afternoon}} I deliberately went into Mrs. Carson's house {{to look for}} Kitty. I knew her mother was not at home, for I had seen her go out. When Kitty appeared I asked her {{to come out on}} her back porch. [...] "Have you thought of any new plan of moving it?" [...] she said, with a smile, as we sat down.|$|R
40|$|A single-fold, {{automatically}} deployable and retractable, square-shaped truss {{concept that}} {{is a candidate for}} the strongback of NASA's Space Station was developed. Compact stowage within a square-shaped housing is achieved by using folded longerons and telescoping diagonal members. Deployment or retraction is accomplished, bay by bay, in a controlled manner with root strength maintained at all times. Control is accomplished by motor-driven <b>jack-screws</b> operated by a controller. Power, data, and fluid utility lines can be integrated onto trays that unfold with the truss. To verify performance a kinematically representative ground test article version is used...|$|R
50|$|Berkuts used a {{retractable}} main (rear) {{landing gear}} system designed by Shirl Dickey for his E-Racer homebuilt. Originally Berkut used gear parts produced by Dickey, {{but over time}} they were repeatedly re-engineered and strengthened. Later kits had gear components produced entirely in-house. Like the earlier Vari-Eze and Long EZ, the Berkut parks with its nose gear retracted to prevent the plane from tipping over backwards when parked without a pilot in the front seat. Some early Berkuts utilized hydraulic nose-gear extension systems, but most have used an electro-mechanical <b>jack-screw.</b> With the electric system the pilot can climb into the cockpit with the nose down, then extend the nose gear, raising the airplane with him inside.|$|E

Work gangs consisted of four men, who timed their exertions in turning the <b>jack-screw</b> to songs called chants.Singing, or chanting as it is called, is an invariable accompaniment to working in cotton, and many of the screw-gangs have an endless collection of songs, rough and uncouth, both in words and melody, but answering well the purposes of making all pull together, and enlivening the heavy toil. The foreman is the chanty-man, who sings the song, the gang only joining in the chorus, which comes in {{at the end of every}} line, and at the end of which again comes the pull at the screw handles...The chants, as may be supposed, have more of rhyme than reason in them. The tunes are generally plaintive and monotonous, as are most of the capstan tunes of sailors, but resounding over the still waters of the Bay, they had a fine effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{torsional}} stiffness of a vehicle's chassis significantly affects its handling characteristics {{and is therefore}} an important parameter to measure. In this work a new twist fixture apparatus designed to measure the {{torsional stiffness}} of a Winston Cup series race car chassis is described. The twist fixture is relatively light weight, adjustable, and easily transportable by one person for quick set-up on different chassis. Measured values of torsional stiffness are reported for several different chassis. The fixture applies vertical displacements (using linear, <b>jack-screw</b> actuators) at the front spring perches of the chassis while holding the rear perches fixed. Conventional race car scales located under the front assembly measure the resulting reaction forces due to the displacements. Dial indicators are placed at selected locations along the chassis to measure deflections. Using the dial indicator readings, the measured reaction forces and the chassis geometry, the torsional stiffne [...] ...|$|E

[...] "He said that he should not wonder if <b>jack-screws</b> could be made large enough to lift your house entirely over mine and set it out in the road, where it could be carried away without interfering with anything, except, of course, vehicles which might be coming along. But he has another plan--that is, to lift my house up and carry it out into the field {{on the other side of}} the road, and then your house might be carried along right over the cellar until it got to the road. In that way, he says, the bushes and trees would not have to be interfered with." ...|$|R
6000|$|But [...] .007 {{was very}} sober. He {{had never seen}} a wreck before, and it frightened him. The crew still laughed, but they worked at the same time; and 007 forgot horror in amazement at the way they handled the Mogul freight. They dug round him with spades; they put ties in front of his wheels, and <b>jack-screws</b> under him; they embraced him with the derrick-chain and tickled him with crowbars; while [...] .007 was hitched on to wrecked cars and backed away till the knot broke or the cars rolled clear of the track. By dawn thirty or forty men were at work, {{replacing}} and ramming down the ties, gauging the rails and spiking them. By daylight all cars who could move had gone on in charge of another loco; the track was freed for traffic; and 007 had hauled the old Mogul over a small pavement of ties, inch by inch, till his flanges bit the rail once more, and he settled down with a clank. But his spirit was broken, and his nerve was gone.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Because the {{standards}} of facial beauty are changed, indications for maxillary expansion procedures are increasing. Also symmetry is {{an important element of}} facial harmony, because it is related to the expression of a correct genetic asset of each individual. Moreover a wide smile without black lateral corridors, small amount of gingival exposure of upper dental arch is accepted as young nice appearance. Also a bi-protrusive cephalometric pattern with a good skin tension is important to obtain a young and nice appearance. Distraction techniques are the main procedures for facial skeleton expansion gaining bone volume stable over time and similar to the native patient bone for histological features. Also histiodistraction is achieved by distractions techniques gaining soft tissue amount when needed. Aim The purpose of this work is to report about some orthognathic cases showing maxillary or mandible insufficiency respectively treated by a new palatal distraction device and a mandible distractor to correct facial deformities in relation with the new concept of facial beauty. Methods and patients Four case with maxillary constriction were treated by LFI-DO bone-rigid (Cortese), a new procedure to perform a Le Fort I osteotomy with down fracture, three-dimensional maxillary repositioning and distraction osteogenesis by a rigid bone borne device in one surgical step. Palatal distractor had an intrinsic rigidity by a <b>jack-screw</b> and 8 anchor points on the horizontal plane: 4 on the hard palate in the paramedian area at the septum foot and 4 other points on the teeth. In the reported case with madibular isufficiency, mandibular distraction was performed by an intraoral three-dimensional distractor device. Results By the LFI-DO bone-rigid technique bodily maxillary expansion is achieved with good comfort for patients, easy removal of the device and without any bone defect of the palate anchorage site Other advantages are no need of a second surgery for maxillary repositioning, improvement in orthodontic treatment by bone anchorage, possibility of further expansion in case of lower molars buccal torque. Mandibular distraction with intraoral three-dimensional distractor allowed large mandibular advancement (15 mm.) preserving condylar safety and obtaining a nice lower border contour for impressive enhancement of facial beauty...|$|E
