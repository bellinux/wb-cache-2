25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{is widely}} used in centrifugation in a technique known as isopycnic centrifugation. Centripetal and diffusive forces establish a <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> that allow separation of mixtures {{on the basis of}} their molecular density. This technique allows separation of DNA of different densities (e.g. DNA fragments with differing A-T or G-C content). This application requires a solution with high density and yet relatively low viscosity, and CsCl suits it because of its high solubility in water, high density owing to the large mass of Cs, as well as low viscosity and high stability of CsCl solutions.|$|E
500|$|Biscayne Bay is {{a shallow}} lagoon with little {{vertical}} density or salinity gradient {{due to its}} lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal <b>density</b> <b>gradient,</b> with fresh water entering from the drainage canals {{on the west side}} and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is {{at the southern end of}} the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. [...] The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.|$|E
2500|$|Oocysts {{with two}} sporocysts or {{individual}} sporocysts in human feces are diagnostic of intestinal infection. These first appear [...] 14 to 18 days after ingesting beef (S. hominis), and 11 to 13 days after ingesting pork (S. suihominis). Flotation based on high-density solutions incorporating sodium chloride, cesium chloride, zinc sulfate, sucrose, Percoll, Ficoll-Hypaque or other such <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> media is preferred to formalin-ethyl acetate or other sedimentation methods. Sporocysts of S. hominis average 9.3 by 14.7 micrometres {{and those of}} S. suihominis average 10.5 by 13.5 micrometres. Because of the overlap in size, size alone is not reliable as a diagnostic criterion of the species. Confirmatory staining with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) can be performed as the walls stain positively. PCR amplification of the rRNA may also be used.|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} pace of {{urbanization}} {{the structure of}} cities in developing countries is subjected to the very strong pressures of rapidly increasing population, rising incomes, and shifting factor prices. The standard procedure to document shifts {{in the structure of}} cities has been the use of <b>density</b> <b>gradients.</b> There is a quasi-universal tendency towards decentralization and the flattening of population-density gradients in all cities of the world. The shifting of <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> is of great empirical importance to policymakers and we need to know more on how various economic and demographic forces operate to yield decentralization. Using a unique set of structural estimates for the housing and residential-land markets in Korea, this paper shows how an estimable structural model can be used to explore the specific economic forces affecting the shape of <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> of Korean cities. Crucial estimates of the elasticity of substitution for housing in various Korean cities are presented. The indirect estimates of the shifts in the <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> derived from the structural model are compared with the trends yielded by directly estimated <b>density</b> <b>gradients.</b> The implications of the analysis for our understanding of <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> are drawn. ...|$|R
2500|$|Sucrose {{gradient}} centrifugation [...] {{a linear}} concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica based <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> media, like Percoll) is generated in a tube {{such that the}} highest concentration is {{on the bottom and}} lowest on top. Percoll is a trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material. [...] During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move). [...] The problem with this is that the useful separation range of within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window. [...] Spinning a sample twice as long doesn't mean the particle of interest will go twice as far, in fact, it will go significantly further. [...] However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity. [...] A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time {{they have been in the}} centrifugal field. [...] Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as [...] "rate zonal" [...] centrifugations. [...] After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then fractionated and collected.|$|E

40|$|We study {{miscible}} Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) fingering {{instability in}} two-dimensional homogeneous porous media, {{in which the}} fluid density varies non-monotonically {{as a function of}} the solute concentration such that the maximum density lies in the interior of the domain, thus creating a stable and an unstable <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> that evolve in time. With the help of linear stability analysis (LSA) as well as nonlinear simulations the effects of <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> on the stability of RT fingers are investigated. As diffusion relaxes the concentration <b>gradient,</b> a non-monotonic <b>density</b> profile emerges in time. Our simple mathematical treatment addresses the importance of <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> on the stability of miscible Rayleigh-Taylor fingering. In this process we identify that RT fingering instabilities are better understood combining Rayleigh number (Ra) with the <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> [...] hence defining a new dimensionless group, gradient Rayleigh number (Ra$_g$).

40|$|The {{transport}} of NaCl and ethanol through the microbial cellulose membrane {{was used as}} a generator of layers with <b>density</b> <b>gradients,</b> parallel to gravity vector. Changes in NaCl concentrations connected with <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> in these layers were monitored by means of Ag vertical bar AgCl electrodes dipped directly into aqueous NaCl solutions with or without ethanol. The parameters used in this article and characterizing diffusive or diffusive convective processes in layers are the ratio of NaCl concentrations at electrode surfaces (C-i*/C-e*) calculated for voltage which was measured 6 h after rebuilding of layers with <b>density</b> <b>gradients,</b> and time of appearance of hydrodynamic instabilities in the membrane system.
