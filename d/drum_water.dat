50|$|The D-type boiler has a water drum, steam drum, and {{generating}} tubes. Water {{flows into}} the steam drum, flows down the downcomers and into the water <b>drum.</b> <b>Water</b> is then sent from the water drum through the generating tubes, where the fire is located around causing water molecules to boil off into steam. Steam rises up more generating tubes and finally back into the steam drum where the dry pipe is located then into the plant. This configuration shaped the package boiler into a D-shape, hence the name D-type package boiler. These boilers are mostly used for plants that allow greater clearances.|$|E
50|$|The water {{necessary}} to produce steam was treated and circulated {{in a closed}} circuit, entering the boiler through the economiser located at the top, and from here {{passed on to the}} steam drum located on top of the boiler, which functioned as a water and steam reservoir, serving as a connection between the two circuits. From the steam <b>drum,</b> <b>water</b> came down the “Bailey walls”, in other words, the walls located {{on the inside of the}} boiler’s furnace, designed to hold the heat inside and built in cast iron with numerous vertical tubes along which the water circulated while it vaporised. This mixture of steam and water rose once again to the steam drum and the steam was directed to the superheater, a set of tubes also located inside the furnace, which allowed the wet steam to transform into dry steam, thus obtaining great pressure (38 kg/cm² and 450ºC at the moment of high pressure), thereby gathering the necessary conditions to travel to the turbines in the machinery room.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a mathematical process {{model for the}} dynamic analysis of a vertical reheat boiler {{and the application of}} this model to the optimal design of a <b>drum</b> <b>water</b> level controller. A numerical finite difference technique is used to formulate this model. The control system contains two loops, a feedfoward loop using the steam flow and drum pressure signals as the input and a feedback loop using the deviation of the measured <b>drum</b> <b>water</b> level from its set point as an input. The feedback loop is an incremental PID controller with an adjustable proportional gain. The feedfoward loop is designed to directly actuate the control devices before the "swell" and "shrinkage" in the boiler water level occur. The feedforward controller output signal is summed along with the output of the PID controller to establish the set point for the control actuator. This scheme is effective because steam flow changes are immediately fed forward to change the final feedwater set point for the control actuator. In this way, feedwater flow tracks steam flow and any disturbances in the feedwater system will be arrested quickly. It is shown that an incremental PID controller plus adapt feedfoward compensator can be successfully employed for the control of water level in such a plant...|$|E

The experimental results and field data were obtained to validate the present nonlinear dynamic model. The calculations of the heat flux and the allowable steam quality were used to determine the maximum boiler swing rates at different conditions of riser tube of friction factor and heat flux.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet out the steam requirement, to {{safeguard}} the boiler water tubes and to safe guard the turbine blades the boiler <b>drum</b> <b>water</b> level control {{plays an important role}} in thermal power station. The main objective of the boiler–turbine system control is to meet the load demand of electric power while maintaining the pressure and water level in the drum within tolerances This paper demonstrates the increase in efficiency and energy savings by using the three element mode method of drum level control and compares it to the the traditional DP mode. Traditionally in most power stations, the DP mode of operation is used because it is believed it provides more robust control of the throttle valve, however throttling losses do occur. This is primarily because it is a linear system of control. The linear system of control causes more losses and hence greater power consumption. Three element mode reduces these throttling losses by measuring the steam level, steam rate flow as well as the water level simultaneously, thereby resulting in a lesser loss of pressure and hence lesser demand. Pressure drop across the throttle valve can be optimized more efficiently using this method of control and the observations and results regarding this have been discussed. The results found were very encouraging and the method can be applied widely to all sub critical boiler systems across the power industry. KEYWORDS- boiler, three element, FRS, control valve.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{nonlinear}} controllers involves first selecting the input and then determining the nonlinear functions for the controllers. Since systems described by smooth nonlinear functions can {{be approximated by}} linear models in the neighbourhood of the selected operating points, the input of the nonlinear controller at these operating points can be chosen to be identical {{to those of the}} local linear controllers. Following this approach, it is proposed that the input of the nonlinear controller are similarly chosen, and that the local linear controllers are designed based on the integrating and k-incremental suboptimal control laws for their ability to remove offsets. Neurofuzzy networks are used to implement the nonlinear controllers for their ability to approximate nonlinear functions with arbitrary accuracy, and to be trained from experimental data. These nonlinear controllers are referred to as neurofuzzy controllers for convenience. As the integrating and k-incremental control laws have also been applied to implement self-tuning controllers, the proposed neurofuzzy controllers can also be interpreted as self-tuning nonlinear controllers. The training target for the neurofuzzy controllers is derived, and online training of the neurofuzzy controllers using a simplified recursive least squares (SRLS) method is presented. It is shown that using the SRLS method, computing time to train the neurofuzzy controllers can be drastically reduced and the ability to track varying dynamics improved. The performance of the neurofuzzy controllers and their ability to remove offsets are demonstrated by two simulation examples involving a linear and a nonlinear system, and a case study involving the control of the <b>drum</b> <b>water</b> level in the boiler of a power generation system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
