Such a preferred orientation for dust screens is unlikely.

50|$|The {{official}} {{playing field}} in Canadian football {{is larger than}} the American, and similar to American fields prior to 1912. The Canadian field of play is 110 by 65 yd, rather than 100 by 53+1/3 yd as in American football. The end zones in Canadian football are 10 yards deeper than American football end zones as the CFL uses 20 yd end zones. Prior to 1986, however, the end zones were 25 yards, with Vancouver's BC Place the first to use the 20-yard-long end zone in 1983. However, beginning in 2016, the new home of the CFL's Toronto Argonauts, BMO Field, utilizes an 18-yard end zone. Occasionally, however, the Canadian field will have its end zone truncated at the corners so that the field fits in the infield of a running track. The only example in the CFL is the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes. The goalposts for kicking are placed at the goal line in Canadian football and the end line in the American game. In Canadian rules, the distance between the sideline and hash marks is 24 yd; in American amateur rules, at the high school level, the distance is 17 yd, virtually sectioning the field into three <b>equal</b> <b>columns.</b> The hash marks are closer together at the American college level, where they are 20 yd from the sideline, and in the NFL, where they are 23 yd from the sideline and the distance between them is the same as that between the goalposts.|$|E

30|$|D, which {{corresponds}} to an optimal alignment, represents the final score. It {{is important to}} note that the number of shifting positions employed to determine an appropriate alignment between pair of iris-codes may vary depending on the application scenario. The proposed set-based representation is alignment-free to a certain extent, since <b>equal</b> <b>columns</b> within certain blocks are mapped to identical feature values. Hence, self-propagating errors caused by an inappropriate alignment of iris-codes are eliminated (radial neighbourhoods persist). The rotation-compensating property of the proposed system comes at the cost of location information of iris-code columns. In case iris-codes are strongly misaligned, columns will end up in different blocks yielding different feature sets. However, as will be shown in experiments, in case of iris images captured under favourable conditions, the proposed representation maintains distinctiveness if w and h are chosen appropriately.|$|E

Using these properties, we derive asymptotically tight upper bounds on the DEP of any CDC obtained by lifting a rank metric code using either a bounded subspace distance or a bounded modified subspace distance decoder...|$|R
