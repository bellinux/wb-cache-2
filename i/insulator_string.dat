This method depicts the distribution of discharge pulses using discharge strength vectors, and identifies faulty insulators {{with the help of}} the sum of discharge strength vectors and the imbalance of apparent discharge strengths in different regions.

Although {{reluctant to do}} so, his friend (played by Jayne Tottman) persuades him to retrieve it. He breaks through the perimeter security, climbing up onto a high voltage transformer to retrieve the Frisbee. As he reaches out to the Frisbee, he is electrocuted and killed by a 66,000 volt current arcing from the <b>insulator</b> <b>string,</b> much to his friend's horror.

50|$|Arcing horns {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with grading rings, which are ring shaped conductors surrounding the high potential end of an <b>insulator</b> <b>string</b> on some high voltage transmission lines, attached to the line. The purpose of grading rings is not to provide a spark gap but to even out the potential gradient across the string. The electric field across a string of insulators is not distributed evenly along the string but is concentrated at the ends, so with an over voltage the end insulator units will break down first. By distributing the electric field more evenly, grading rings increase the breakdown voltage of the string. However, sometimes grading rings have a secondary usage as arcing terminals, combined with arcing horns on the ground side of the insulator.|$|E
