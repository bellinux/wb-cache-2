John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue. Sara Nathan of The Sun reported that the story had been planned since the previous year, and would begin with Whitney worrying about Tony's release from prison and the effect it would have on her family.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} {{on a bed}} of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E

5|$|The {{nuthatch}}es are {{a family}} of similar-looking birds with short tails and wings, compact bodies and longish pointed bills. They have grey or bluish upperparts, a black eyestripe and strong feet. All are in the single genus Sitta. Within the genus, the Eurasian nuthatch forms a superspecies with the chestnut-vented, Indian, chestnut-bellied and Kashmir nuthatches and <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> been considered conspecific with all of these.|$|E
5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> {{been a major}} {{contributor}} to the pollution of the River Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to the river meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> been a {{major part}} of the economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E

Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, as it <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E
5|$|Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 {{regular season}} record, the NFC North championship, {{and the second}} seed in the NFC playoffs. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to {{continue}} playing football for another season. In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field. The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants. Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver {{in the second quarter}} was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18. Favre stated after the game that he would make a decision more quickly than he <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> regarding whether he would return for another season.|$|E
