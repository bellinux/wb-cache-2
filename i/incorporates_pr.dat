40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether the CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores have clinical utility for prediction of adverse vascular function and vascular dysfunction-mediated incident cardiovascular (CV) events among high-risk patients without atrial fibrillation (AF), and the additional value of <b>incorporating</b> <b>PR</b> prolongation to the scores. Methods: We analyzed 579 high-risk CV outpatients without clinical AF in a prospective cohort for new-onset ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), {{congestive heart failure}} (CHF), and CV death. Brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (NMD), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were determined. Results: Baseline CHADS 2 score was associated with lower FMD (Pearson r=- 0. 16, P< 0. 001) and NMD (r=- 0. 17, P< 0. 001), higher carotid IMT (r= 0. 30, P< 0. 001) and PWV (r= 0. 35, P< 0. 001; similar for CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score: All P< 0. 05). After follow-up of 63 ± 11 months, 82 patients (14. 2 %) developed combined CV endpoint. ROC curve analysis showed that both CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores were predictors for ischemic stroke (C-Statistic: CHADS 2 0. 70, P= 0. 004; CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 0. 68, P= 0. 010), MI (CHADS 2 0. 63, P= 0. 030; CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 0. 70, P= 0. 001), and CV death (CHADS 2 0. 63, P= 0. 022; CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 0. 65, P= 0. 011). Higher CHADS 2 score was associated with reduced event-free survival from combined CV endpoints (log-rank= 16. 7, P< 0. 001) with differences potentiated if stratified by CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (log-rank= 29. 2, P< 0. 001). <b>Incorporating</b> <b>PR</b> prolongation, the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc-PR score achieved the highest C-Statistic for CV death prediction (0. 70, P< 0. 001) superior to the CHADS 2 score (chi-square: 12. 1, P= 0. 0005). Conclusions: The CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc predict vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular events in high-risk CV patients without clinical AF, with further improved performance <b>incorporating</b> <b>PR</b> prolongation. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{reconfiguration}} (PR) is an FPGA {{feature that}} allows the modification of certain parts of an FPGA {{while the rest of}} the system continues to operate without disruption. This distinctive characteristic of FPGAs has many potential benefits but also challenges. The lack of good CAD tools and the deep hardware knowledge requirement result in a hard-to-use feature. In this paper, the new partition-based Xilinx PR flow is used to <b>incorporate</b> <b>PR</b> within our MPI-based message-passing framework to allow hardware designers to create template bitstreams, which are predesigned, prerouted, generic bitstreams that can be reused for multiple applications. As an example of the generality of this approach, four different applications that use the same template bitstream are run consecutively, with a PR operation performed at the beginning of each application to instantiate the desired application engine. We demonstrate a simplified, reusable, high-level, and portable PR interface for X 86 -FPGA hybrid machines. PR issues such as local resets of reconfigurable modules and context saving and restoring are addressed in this paper followed by some examples and preliminary PR overhead measurements...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{reconfiguration}} (PR) reveals {{many opportunities}} for integration into FPGA design for potential system optimizations such as reduced area, increased performance, and increased functionality. Even though recent advances in Xilinx’s Virtex- 4 and Virtex- 5 FPGA devices and design tools significantly improve the practicality of <b>incorporating</b> <b>PR,</b> unfortunately, system designers largely lack sufficient guidance to design these systems. Efficient system design exploration and extensive manual floorplanning is required to fully enhance the capabilities of a system and/or optimize metrics such as power consumption, device quantity and size, designer productivity, and design re-use. To fully leverage PR, system designers must acquire a strong knowledge of the PR design flow {{as well as the}} low-level architectural details of their target device. In this paper, we propose design methodologies to assist designers in efficient PR system design and define frameworks to enable rapid system prototyping, enabling designers to harness the capabilities of PR without having to deal with many of the intricate details. Furthermore, we identify new opportunities for optimization, which are only made possible with the tile-based layout of the Virtex- 4 and Virtex- 5 FPGAs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Laminar mixed {{convection}} in {{the entrance}} region of horizontal and inclined semicircular ducts has been investigated. The governing momentum and energy equations were solved numerically using a marching technique with finite control volume approach following the SIMPLER algorithm. Results were obtained for thermal boundary condition of uniform heat input axially and uniform wall temperature circumferentially, <b>incorporating</b> <b>Pr</b> = 7, Re = 500, inclination angles (α = 0 ° and 20 °), and {{a wide range of}} Grashof numbers. These results include velocity and temperature distributions at different axial locations as well as axial distribution of local Nusselt number and local wall friction factor. It was found that Nusselt number is close to the forced convection values near the entrance region, then decreases to minimum value as the distance from the entrance increases, and then rises due to the effect of free convection before reaching a constant value (fully developed). As Grashof number increases Nusselt number and wall friction factor increase in both developing and fully developed regions for horizontal and inclined ducts. A comparison with the experimental data in the thermal entrance region was also conducted and the comparison was satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|The {{cholera toxin}} A 1 (CTA 1) -DD/QuilA-containing, immune-stimulating complex (ISCOM) vector is a rationally {{designed}} mucosal adjuvant that greatly potentiates humoral and cellular immune responses. It {{was developed to}} incorporate the distinctive properties of either adjuvant alone in a combination that exerted additive enhancing effects on mucosal immune responses. In this study we demonstrate that CTA 1 -DD and an unrelated Ag can be incorporated together into the ISCOM, resulting in greatly augmented immunogenicity of the Ag. To demonstrate its relevance for protection against infectious diseases, we tested the vector <b>incorporating</b> <b>PR</b> 8 Ag from the influenza virus. After intranasal immunization {{we found that the}} immunogenicity of the PR 8 proteins were significantly augmented by a mechanism that was enzyme dependent, because the presence of the enzymatically inactive CTA 1 R 7 K-DD mutant largely failed to enhance the response over that seen with ISCOMs alone. The combined vector was a highly effective enhancer of a broad range of immune responses, including specific serum Abs and balanced Th 1 and Th 2 CD 4 (+) T cell priming as well as a strong mucosal IgA response. Unlike unmodified ISCOMs, Ag incorporated into the combined vector could be presented by B cells in vitro and in vivo as well as by dendritic cells; it also accumulated in B cell follicles of draining lymph nodes when given s. c. and stimulated much enhanced germinal center reactions. Strikingly, the enhanced adjuvant activity of the combined vector was absent in B cell-deficient mice, supporting the idea that B cells are important for the adjuvant effects of the combined CTA 1 -DD/ISCOM vector...|$|R
40|$|Model Pt/Ce 0. 9 Pr 0. 1 O 2 and Pt/CeO 2 NOx storage–reduction {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} via nitrate calcination, co-precipitation and carbon-templating routes. Raman spectroscopic data obtained on the catalysts {{indicated that the}} introduction of praseodymium into the ceria lattice increased the concentration of defect sites (vacancies), arising from the higher reducibility of the Pr 4 + cation compared to Ce 4 +. For the Pr-promoted samples, H 2 -TPR profiles contained high temperature bulk reduction peaks which were less pronounced compared with their ceria analogs, indicating {{that the presence of}} praseodymium enhances oxygen mobility due to the creation of lattice defects. Under lean-rich cycling conditions, the cycle-averaged NOx conversion of the Pt/Ce 0. 9 Pr 0. 1 O 2 samples was in each case substantially higher than that of the Pt/CeO 2 analog, amounting to a difference of 10 – 15 % in the absolute NOx conversion in some cases. According to DRIFTS data, a double role can be assigned to Pr doping; on the one hand, Pr accelerates the oxidation of adsorbed NOx species during the lean periods. On the other hand, Pr doping destabilizes the adsorbed NOx species during the rich periods, and the kinetics of nitrate decomposition are faster on Pt/Ce 0. 9 Pr 0. 1 O 2, leading to improved catalyst regeneration. These results suggest that ceria-based mixed oxides <b>incorporating</b> <b>Pr</b> are promising materials for NOx storage–reduction catalysts intended for low temperature operation.

The main goal is to achieve the optical doping of Alx Ga 1 - x N with the rare earth Pr. Structural properties, damage accumulation and Pr lattice site location were studied combining Rutherford backscattering/channeling spectrometry and high resolution X-ray diffraction.

We have shown recently that several analogs of myristate in which a methylene group {{is replaced by a}} single oxygen or sulfur atom are substrates for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 97; NMT) despite their reduced hydrophobicity. Some inhibit HIV- 1 replication in acutely infected CD 4 +H 9 cells without accompanying cellular toxicity. To examine the mechanism of their antiviral effects, we performed labeling studies with two analogs, 12 -methoxydodecanoate (13 -oxamyristate; 13 -OxaMyr) and 5 -octyloxypentanoate (6 -oxamyristate; 6 -OxaMyr), the former being much more effective than the latter in blocking virus production. [3 H]Myristate and [3 H] 13 -OxaMyr were <b>incorporated</b> into <b>Pr</b> 55 gag with comparable efficiency when it was coexpressed with S. cerevisiae NMT in Escherichia coli. [3 H] 6 -OxaMyr was not incorporated, even though its substrate properties in vitro were similar to those of 13 -OxaMyr and myristate. [3 H] 13 -OxaMyr, but not [3 H] 6 -OxaMyr, was also efficiently incorporated into HIV- 1 Pr 55 gag and nef (negative factor) in chronically infected H 9 cells. Analog incorporation produced a redistribution of Pr 55 gag from membrane to cytosolic fractions and markedly decreased its proteolytic processing by viral protease. 13 -OxaMyr and 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) act synergistically to reduce virus production in acutely infected H 9 cells. Unlike AZT, the analog is able to inhibit virus production (up to 70 %) in chronically infected H 9 cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect lasts 6 - 8 days. These results suggest that (i) its mechanism of action is distinct from that of AZT and involves a late step in virus assembly; (ii) the analog may allow reduction in the dose of AZT required to affect viral replication; and (iii) combinations of analog and HIV- 1 protease inhibitors may have synergistic effects on the processing of Pr 55 gag...|$|R
