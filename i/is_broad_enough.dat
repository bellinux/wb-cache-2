The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." ...|$|E

Apple's portfolio of intellectual property <b>is</b> <b>broad</b> <b>enough,</b> for trademarks alone, to encompass several pages of the company's web site and, in April 2012, it listed 176 general business trademarks, 79 service marks, 7 trademarks related to NeXT products and services, and 2 trademarks related to FileMaker. Apple claims copyright interests in multiple products and processes and owns and licenses patents of various types as well and, while it states it generally does not license its patent portfolio, it does work with third parties having an interest in product interoperability. Steve Jobs alone was a named inventor on over 300 design and utility patents. Between January 2008 and May 2010, Apple Inc. filed more than 350 cases with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office (USPTO) alone, most in opposition to or taking exception to others' use of the terms [...] "apple", [...] "pod", and [...] "safari"; those cases include sellers of apples (the fruit), as well as many others' less unassuming use of the term [...] "apple".|$|E

[...] These influences have manifested themselves in major decisions relating to everything from abortion rights to the [...] "right to die" [...] controversies. Cases dealing with a state ban on the dissemination of birth control information expanded on Brandeis by including an individual's [...] "body," [...] not just her [...] "personality," [...] {{as part of her}} right to privacy. In another case, Justice Harlan credited Brandeis when he wrote, [...] "The entire fabric of the Constitution ... guarantees that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected."

When on July 14, 2005 the state Administrative Office of the Courts declined to intervene (indicating [...] "that either the legislature or a court ruling would have to decide this question") the ACLU took the issue to court. In July 2005 they argued in court that [...] "the term 'Holy Scriptures' appearing in the statute refers not only to the Christian Bible, but also to other religious texts including, but not limited to, the Quran, the Old Testament, and the Bhagavad-Gita". The ACLU argued that since in 1985 [...] "the term 'Gospels' was eliminated from the section [...] and the term 'Holy Evangelists of Almighty God' was changed to 'Holy Scriptures', the message sent by the Legislature was clear: no longer would the Christian Bible be the only religious text which could be used in a swearing ceremony. Stated differently, the term 'Holy Scriptures' <b>is</b> <b>broad</b> <b>enough</b> to include the Quran." [...] The state attorney general's office argued in court papers that the ACLU lacked the right to sue because there is no controversy between them and the state of North Carolina.
