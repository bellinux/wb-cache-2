5|$|The speech clearly impresses {{both the}} judges and Leslie, and Pawnee is {{ultimately}} {{selected for the}} tournament. Leslie reluctantly accepts Ben's invitation to a celebratory dinner that night, where Ben brings up his feelings for Leslie. She slips away to call Ann for advice, and she urges Leslie to act on her feelings. Just as Leslie decides to do so, she is surprised to find Chris has arrived at the dinner to congratulate the two personally. He insists they sleep {{at his home in}} Indianapolis, ruining their night. The next day, Leslie and Ben run into each other alone and Ben reveals Chris <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day. Ben then immediately kisses her, leaving Leslie simultaneously delighted and nervous about their future.|$|E

25|$|The team took a {{step back}} in 2005 with a 6–10 record. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, {{starting}} 4–2 but losing three in a row, before McNabb finally succumbs to injury and <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil, but Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under Coach Reid, with a 10–6 record and a win in the wild card round, but they had an 8–8 2007 season. In 2008, the team won their 500th game, and they also drafted DeSean Jackson, a receiving threat when paired with McNabb.|$|E

500|$|As Vermeer {{secretly}} {{works on}} the eponymous painting, Catharina cannot help but notice something is amiss and her growing jealousy of Griet becomes apparent. As Griet deals with her growing fascination with Vermeer and his talent, she has to fend off Van Ruijven's attempt to rape her. Later, when Catharina <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day, her mother hands Griet [...] her daughter's pearl earrings, and asks Vermeer [...] to finish the painting. [...] At the final painting session Vermeer pierces Griet's left earlobe so she can wear one of the earrings for the portrait. [...] Griet then runs to Pieter to be consoled. [...] They caress and make love in a barn, where Pieter proposes marriage, but unexpectedly leaves, whereas she then returns the earrings to Catharina's mother.|$|E

60|$|That was {{the highest}} point I ever reached in {{practical}} cricket. But, as the historian says of Mr Winkle, a man may be an excellent sportsman in theory, even if he fail in practice. That's me. Reader (if any), have you ever played cricket in the passage outside your study with a walking-stick and a ball of paper? That's the game, my boy, for testing your skill of wrist and eye. A century v. the M.C.C. is well enough in its way, but give me the man who can watch 'em in a narrow passage, lit only by a flickering gas-jet--one for every hit, four if it reaches the end, and six if it goes downstairs full-pitch, any pace bowling allowed. To make double figures in such a match is to taste life. Only you had better do your tasting when the House-master <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> evening.|$|E
