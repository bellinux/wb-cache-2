40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} project, conducted at the chair of media informatics at the University Regensburg. This project examines the possible adaptation and implementation of an Interactive Ceiling: an interactive computer system with horizontal, large-scaled, ceiling mounted displays. Built upon an initial prototype and previous studies, this thesis focuses on the evaluation of potential input devices. As a substantial part of the Ceiling Interaction project the author examines and evaluates existing input devices regarding their possible use on the ceiling. This thesis outlines the <b>initial</b> <b>Ceiling</b> Interaction project (chapter 1) and depicts the current state of input techniques used for controlling large and remote displays (chapter 1). A selection of feasible input devices and their comparability is described in chapter 2. The main part of this thesis consists of a comprehensive user study, conducted to evaluate selected devices. The design and results of this experiment are described in chapter 3. The thesis closes with a summary of the gathered data and some potential input recommendations for Ceiling Interaction...|$|E
40|$|Report of the 26 th {{meeting of}} TAC held June 23 - 31, 1981 at IITA in Ibadan, Nigeria, Ralph Cummings presiding. TAC {{approved}} {{a statement on}} {{its role in the}} CGIAR, to be considered in the Second System Review. (Text attached as Annex IV.) It was agreed that the CG and TAC secretariats should consult about ways to ensure that the CGIAR did not receive different advice in integrative reports on scientific and technical issues from that given by TAC. TAC reduced center budget proposals for 1982 by $ 10 million below the <b>initial</b> <b>ceiling</b> based on funding expectations. The Quinquennial Review of ILRAD was endorsed for transmittal to the CGIAR. Arrangements for reviews of ILCA, IRRI and CIMMYT were discussed. Long term planning by centers and by the CGIAR was the topic of a joint discussion with center directors. TAC reviewed a consultants paper on plant breeders rights and provided information and guidance for its completion. TAC and the center directors commented on a report by two consultants on plant nutrition in the CGIAR, to be revised and discussed at TAC 27. The center directors told TAC of their concern about {{the creation of a new}} center for water management, to be the subject of an ad hoc meeting in July 1981 in Washington. After discussing with the center directors a paper by TAC member J. M [...] Hirst on crop protection, TAC decided that a stripe analysis was not required. Instead a summary of pest management activities at IARCs should be completed, and presented to the CGIAR along with Professor Hirst's revised paper. TAC asked its Secretariat to explore the willingness of relevant institutions to cooperate in research on upland rice with a coordinator located at IRRI. It also supported the idea of meetings of economists from other centers with IFPRI, and provision by IFPRI of appropriate macro-economic analyses to other centers...|$|E

When it was restored, it had a zinc roof, which was supposedly placed after its <b>initial</b> construction. The <b>ceiling</b> was made of cardboard, with relief and no colors. Due to the bad condition of the ceiling and roof, {{it was decided to}} put a tile roof on the house.|$|R

If you gaze up at the <b>initials</b> on the <b>ceiling</b> and at the paintings and the painted insignia around the walls, you are reminded that Canada {{is not a new}} country. ... Militarily speaking, we have been at it for a long time. This hall is a conceptualisation of our participation in the First World War. All of that grandeur and tragedy is pulled together here in a remarkable way. I'm not sure that we could reproduce a hall of this sort to describe our military experiences of the last half century." ...|$|R

Same room as 82. 362 Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czechoslovakia) in 1900, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Changes in {{self-concept}} are {{an important}} potential outcome for many interventions for people with long-term conditions. This study sought to identify and evaluate outcome questionnaires suitable for quantifying changes in self-concept in people with long-term conditions, {{in the context of}} treatment with acupuncture and Chinese medicine. Methods A literature search was followed by an evaluation of three questionnaires: The Wellbeing Questionnaire W-BQ 12, the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI), and the Arizona Integrative Outcome Scale (AIOS). A convenience sample of 23 people completed the questionnaires on two occasions and were interviewed about their experience and their questionnaire responses. All acupuncturists were interviewed. Results Changes in self-concept were common and emerged over time. The three questionnaires had different strengths and weaknesses in relation to measuring changes in self-concept. The generic AIOS had face validity and was sensitive to changes in self-concept over time, but it lacked specificity. The PEI was sensitive and specific in measuring these changes but had lower acceptability. The sensitivity of the W-BQ 12 was affected by <b>initial</b> high scores (<b>ceiling</b> effect) and a shorter timescale but was acceptable and is suitable for repeated administration. The PEI and W-BQ 12 questionnaires worked well in combination. Conclusion Changes in self-concept are important outcomes of complex interventions for people with long-term illness and their measurement requires carefully evaluated tools and long-term follow-up. The literature review and the analysis of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the questionnaires is a resource for other researchers. The W-BQ 12 and the PEI both proved useful for this population and a larger quantitative study is planned. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Geriatric {{rehabilitation}} reimbursement increasingly requires documented deficits {{on standardized}} measures. Tandem stance performance can characterize balance, but protocols are not standardized. Objective The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the impact of: (1) initial support to stabilize in position and (2) maximum hold time on tandem stance tests of balance in older adults. Design A cross-sectional secondary analysis of observational cohort data was conducted. METHODS: One hundred seventeen community-dwelling older adults (71 % female, 12 % black) were assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on the need for initial support to perform tandem stance: (1) unable even with support, (2) able only with support, and (3) able without support. The able without support group was further stratified on hold time in seconds: (1) < 10 (low), (2) 10 to 29, (medium), and (3) 30 (high). Groups were compared on primary outcomes (gait speed, Timed "Up & Go" Test performance, and balance confidence) using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Twelve participants were unable to perform tandem stance, 14 performed tandem stance only with support, and 91 performed tandem stance without support. Compared with the able without support group, the able with support group had statistically or clinically worse performance and balance confidence. No significant differences were found between the able with support group and the unable even with support group on these same measures. Extending the hold time to 30 seconds in a protocol without <b>initial</b> support eliminated <b>ceiling</b> effects for 16 % of the study sample. Limitations Small comparison groups, use of a secondary analysis, and lack of generalizability of results were limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Requiring initial support to stabilize in tandem stance appears to reflect meaningful deficits in balance-related mobility measures, so failing to consider support may inflate balance estimates and confound hold time comparisons. Additionally, 10 -second maximum hold times limit discrimination of balance in adults with a higher level of function. For community-dwelling older adults, we recommend timing for at least 30 seconds and documenting initial support for consideration when interpreting performance...|$|R
