5|$|Although {{the trench}} warfare on the Western Front was {{dominated}} by the artillery and infantry, the cavalry still suffered 5,674 <b>dead</b> and 14,630 other casualties. For comparison, one infantry regiment—the Northumberland Fusiliers—had 16,000 casualties. Unlike the huge losses in the infantry regiments, only ten cavalry regiments suffered over 200 <b>dead.</b> The 3rd Dragoon Guards, with 333 <b>dead,</b> had the most killed, while the 7th Hussars had eighty <b>dead,</b> one less than the 21st Lancers, which had remained in India throughout the war. The <b>dead</b> included one major general, eleven brigadier generals, but only twenty-eight of the 1,161 lieutenant colonels killed during the war were from the cavalry, several of those after having assumed command of an infantry battalion.|$|E

50|$|The {{institution}} {{began as}} a Germanic custom for intestate inheritance (which was the norm) under which all of a deceased's personalty was divided into thirds—the widow's part, bairns' part, and <b>dead's</b> part—the last of which, consisting of clothes, weapons, farm animals and implements, was usually buried with the deceased. With the adoption of Christian funerary practices, it became common to gift away the <b>dead's</b> part, and after {{the revival of the}} will, and consequently of testation, the <b>dead's</b> part came to be freely disposable.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of Red <b>Dead</b> Redemption began in 2005. Rockstar Games published Red <b>Dead</b> Redemption on May 18, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. One of their studios, Rockstar San Diego, oversaw the work, {{sharing it with}} other studios around the world. The development team considered the game a spiritual successor to Red <b>Dead</b> Revolver. Red <b>Dead</b> Redemption was delayed numerous times through its four-year development, often attributed to technological problems. The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints from staff members. Red <b>Dead</b> Redemption was officially announced in 2009; it was heavily promoted and widely anticipated.|$|E

5|$|A Book of the <b>Dead</b> papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the <b>Dead</b> scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the <b>Dead</b> was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
