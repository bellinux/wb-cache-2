5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

Between atmosphere and land emerged the divine person (Purusha) with one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand arms, and one thousand feet, who created death. The Brahman then created seven sons filled with truth, called Prajapatis.

5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
5|$|The habitations {{and main}} farming areas are largely {{confined}} to the Wharfe valley, {{and the rest of}} the parish is mainly rough moorland pasture.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and imago (adult). In the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, {{a small number of}} species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> her abdomen.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
50|$|Mature adults <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the bean, biting a neat {{circular}} {{exit from}} the pod as soon as 25 days after hatching. The adult beetles live up to two weeks after <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> the pupa.|$|R
50|$|A retreated general takes a basic 35 {{real-time}} {{seconds to}} return to the battlefield (this amount of time is lessened by 1/3 if the general possesses the Revival ability), and another 10 seconds {{to return to}} the battlefield by <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> his or her own castle.

Monstructor escapes his prison and seeks revenge against Omega. He finds Omega along with Prime, and after battling him, Prime leaves Monstructor to be tended by Jetfire. Elsewhere, Blaster's body is recovered from space. After more assassination attempts he discovers the traitor is an unwilling Beachcomber, controlled by Soundwave and Bombshell's cerebro shell. Angry, he vows to hunt down Soundwave.|$|E

When Dales is told that Skur hanged himself while in custody, he feels guilty and returns to Skur's house to apologize to his wife. While there, he sees Skur alive and tries to recapture him. In the following struggle, an appendage <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> Skur's mouth. Skur is forced to flee when a neighbor interrupts the fight. Dales' partner and Roy Cohn warn Dales to change his report about the attack. He does so, but feels guilty about it.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} stock return {{performance}} of 131 firms <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> Chapter 11. Using differing estimates of expected returns, we consistently {{find evidence of}} large, positive excess returns in 200 days of returns following emergence. We also examine the reaction of our sample firms' equity returns to their earnings announcements after emergence from Chapter 11. The positive and significant reactions suggest that our results are driven by the market's expectational errors, not mismeasurement of risk. The results provide an interesting contrast, but not a contradiction, to previous work that has documented poor operating performance for firms <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> Chapter 11. 1 The Equity Performance of Firms <b>Emerging</b> <b>from</b> Bankruptcy With large corporate bankruptcies being commonplace during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, {{there has been a}} notable {{increase in the number of}} firms <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> bankruptcy (Altman (1993)).

5|$|In the DVD commentary, Matt Groening {{notes that}} {{beginning}} any television series is difficult, {{but he found}} particular difficulty starting one {{that took place in}} the future because of the amount of setup required. As a trade off, they included a lot of Easter eggs in the episode that would pay off in later episodes. He and Cohen point these out throughout the episode. The scene where Fry <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> a cryonic tube and has his first view of New New York was the first 3D scene worked on by the animation team. It was considered to be a defining point for whether the technique would work or not.|$|E

One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son.

Before he can kill Nate, a loose torpedo charge previously accidentally triggered by Nate causes the U-boat to explode, distracting the gang long enough for Drake to escape. He runs into Elena, who agrees to help him find the statue, and together they use Sully's plane to travel to the old colony.|$|E
