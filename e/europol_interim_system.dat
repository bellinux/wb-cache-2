40|$|A new {{approach}} has been taken to develop and build the Low-Level RF Control System for the SNS Front End and Linear Accelerators, as reported in a separate paper in this conference[1]. An interim version, based on the proven LBNL MEBT design, was constructed to support short-term goals and early commissioning of the Front End RFQ and DTL accelerators, while the final system[2] is under development. Additional units of the <b>interim</b> <b>system</b> are in use at JLab and LANL for concept testing, code develop-ment, and commissioning of SNS SRF cryomodules.

Frequently, interim software solutions must be developed while new hardware is under design or production. These <b>interim</b> <b>systems</b> are characterized by an immediate need with a limited budget.

By recognizing {{the importance of these}} factors, <b>interim</b> <b>system</b> developers will be able to produce working systems with a minimum of setbacks. introduction Software should be perfect. Networks should be capable of handling multiples of the maximum expected traffic levels. Hardware should never fail. But “should ” will not release a system before an operational deadline, and it invariably costs more than your budget can afford. The solution is to instead create a system which meets immediate customer demands, yet leaves an open path for future modifications. The grouncl data systems Jet Propulsion Laboratory range from state-of-the-art to nearly obsolete. These older systems have no funding for hardware upgrades (replacement hardware is expected within 5 years), yet they still support spacecraft on a daily basis. This paper focuses on methods by which the operational capabilities for these systems can be significantly extended at a minimum cost. These methods consist of three main stages: initial approach and design, working within and around budgetary limitations, and resource-scavenging. While these methods may seem obvious, the impact of not following these steps is usually only understood in retrospect. Therefore, this paper will set forth guidelines in each of these areas and examine their usefulness with three operational <b>interim</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1977 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe present {{baseline}} Space Shuttle {{navigation system}} {{is comprised of}} several separate subsystems: TDRSS doppler ranging, TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation), MSBLS (Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System), and ground tracking. With {{the advent of the}} DOD development of the GPS, {{it may be possible to}} replace several of these subsystems with an on-board GPS navigation system. However, the Shuttle signal dynamics and environmental considerations impose unique and severe requirements for a GPS navigation system. Consequently, a preliminary study has been conducted to define requirements and configure candidate GPS systems for the Shuttle navigation function. Three configurations have been considered: an early test/demonstration system, which could be flown on early OFTs (Orbital Flight Tests), an <b>interim</b> <b>system</b> having greater capability but still not having full operational capability, and, finally, a fully operational system. A description of the test/demonstration and <b>interim</b> <b>systems</b> and the results of performance analyses are given.
