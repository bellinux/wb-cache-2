30|$|At {{least three}} {{distinct}} approaches {{have been proposed}} to deal with sentiment analysis of sentences.

Another common way to detect sentence polarity considers three distinct classes (positive, negative and neutral) in a single task, an approach used by VADER, SO-CAL, USent and others.

40|$|Part 2 {{presents}} a new method {{to resolve the}} phase-ambiguity for Offset QPSK modulation systems. When an Offset Quaternary Phase-Shift-Keyed (OQPSK) communications link is utilized, the phase ambiguity of the reference carrier must be resolved. At the transmitter, two different unique words are separately modulated onto the quadrature carriers. At the receiver, the recovered carrier may have one of four possible phases, 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees, referenced to the nominally correct phase. The IF portion of the channel may cause a phase-sense reversal, i. e., a reversal {{in the direction of}} phase rotation for a specified bit pattern. Hence, eight possible phase relationships (the so-called eight ambiguous phase conditions) between input and output of the demodulator must be resolved. Using the In-phase (I) /Quadrature (Q) channel reversal correcting property of an OQPSK Costas loop with integrated symbol synchronization, four ambiguous phase conditions are eliminated. Thus, only four possible ambiguous phase conditions remain. The errors caused by the remaining ambiguous phase conditions can be corrected by monitoring and <b>detecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>polarity</b> of the two unique words. The correction of the unique word polarities results in the complete phase-ambiguity resolution for the OQPSK system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sentiment {{analysis}} has become upcoming topic in recent years, and sentiment dictionaries {{are essential for}} research in this field. Consumers regularly face the trade-off in purchase decisions so nowadays if one wants to buy a consumer product one prefer user reviews and discussion in public forums on web about the product. Many consumers use reviews posted by other consumers before making their purchase decisions. People {{have a tendency to}} express their opinion on various entities. As a result opinion mining has gained importance. Sentiment Analysis deals with evaluating whether this expressed opinion about the entity has a positive or a negative orientation. Consumers need to decide what subset of available information to use. Graphical analysis is a better option for this decision as they provide a quick indication of a review.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of semiconductor laser diodes and related devices {{is a significant}} issue for their deployment in many applications, creating demand for device diagnostics applicable to packaged devices. Measurements of the transparency current density (J{sub 0 }) in laser diodes and traveling-wave semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) can provide such a diagnostic. It is essential, however, to measure J{sub 0 } on packaged devices, {{so that they can}} be characterized after aging or degradation. This precludes techniques requiring data from multiple devices (e. g., an ensemble with different lengths). J{sub 0 } is conventionally measured using a junction-voltage technique, in which an input optical signal induces a change in carrier density in the active region due to stimulated absorption or emission. The result is a voltage drop across the diode. At material transparency, the stimulated absorption is exactly balanced by the stimulated emission and the voltage drop goes to zero. Since <b>the</b> <b>polarity</b> of <b>the</b> voltage drop changes sign at current densities above J{sub 0 }, the optical input beam is typically modulated and lock-in amplification is employed to sensitively <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> <b>polarity</b> sign flip. Here we show that this technique is not reliable for certain types of laser structures, because the deduced J{sub 0 } is strongly dependent on device packaging [...] that is, the measured J{sub 0 } varies with the manner in which light is coupled into the diode waveguide. For packaged SOAs, we propose and demonstrate an alternative all-optical technique to overcome this problem. One important advantage of the optical method over the junction voltage method is that the actual device optically-guided mode is directly sampled. In the case of packaged semiconductor lasers, our all-optical method can complement the junction-voltage method to resolve device versus packaging degradation...|$|R

We pro-pose in this paper a fall-back strategy to do sentiment analysis for Hindi documents, a problem on which, {{to the best of our}} knowl-edge, no work has been done until now. (A) First of all, we study three approaches to perform SA in Hindi. We have devel-oped a sentiment annotated corpora in the Hindi movie review domain. The first of our approaches involves training a classifier on this annotated Hindi corpus and using it to classify a new Hindi document. (B) In the second approach, we translate the given document into English and use a classifier trained on standard English movie reviews to classify the document. (C) In the third approach, we develop a lexical resource called Hindi-SentiWordNet (H-SWN) and implement a majority score based strategy to classify the given document. A comparison of performance of these ap-proaches implies that we can adopt a fall-back strategy for doing sentiment analysis for a new language, viz., (1) Train a senti-ment classifier on in-language labeled cor-pus and use this classifier to classify a new document. (2) If in-language training data is not available, apply rough machine trans-lation to translate the new document into a resource-rich language like English and <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> <b>polarity</b> of <b>the</b> translated docu-ment using a classifier for English, assum-ing polarity is not lost in translation.
