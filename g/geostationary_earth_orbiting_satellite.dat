The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the quality of BeiDou pseudorange and carrier phase observation, and to compare the performance of GPS, BeiDou and the combined system in terms of availability, integrity and positioning accuracy with practical data in Hong Kong. The experiment results showed that the noise and multipath of GEOs (<b>geostationary</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellites)</b> pseudorange measurement fluctuates within 1. 5 m, while the variations of IGSOs (<b>geostationary</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> inclined geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> <b>satellites)</b> and MEOs (medium <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellites)</b> are more obvious.

Particularly for <b>geostationary</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellites,</b> sky-view coverage can be achieved over the entire elevation and azimuth angle ranges with the available onboard tracking data, which is more favorable to modeling code biases. Apart from the BeiDou-satellite-induced biases, the onboard BeiDou code multipath effects also indicate pronounced near-field systematic biases that depend only on signal frequency and the line-of-sight directions. To correct these biases, we developed a proposed code correction model by estimating the BeiDou-satellite-induced biases as linear piece-wise functions in different satellite groups and the near-field systematic biases in a grid approach. To validate the code bias model, we carried out orbit determination using single-frequency BeiDou data with and without code bias corrections applied. Orbit precision statistics indicate that those code biases can seriously degrade single-frequency orbit determination.

40|$|Although Earth Station in Motion (ESIM) {{services}} {{are widely used}} {{and there is a}} huge market demand around the world, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) does not have unified conclusion for the use of ESIM yet. ESIM are Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) due to its mobile-based attributes, while multiple administrations want to use ESIM in Fixed Satellite Service (FSS). However, Radio Regulations (RR) have strict distinction between MSS and FSS. In this case, ITU has been very controversial because this kind of application will violate the RR Article and the conflict will bring risks to the global deployment. Thus, this paper illustrates the development of rules, regulations, standards concerning ESIM and the radio spectrum usage of ESIM in different regions around the world. Firstly, the basic rules, standard and definition of ITUâs Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) is introduced. Secondly, the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) agenda item on radio spectrum allocation for ESIM, e. g. in C/Ku/Ka band, is introduced and multi-view on the radio spectrum allocation is elaborated, especially on 19. 7 - 20. 2 GHz & 29. 5 - 30. 0 GHz. Then, some ITU-R Recommendations and Reports are analyzed on the specific technique to enable these ESIM to communicate with <b>Geostationary</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Satellite</b> (GSO) space stations in the FSS without causing interference at levels in excess of that caused by conventional FSS earth stations. Meanwhile, the opposite opinion on not allocating EISM service in FSS frequency band is also elaborated.

In conclusion, using radio spectrum resource in an equitable, rational and efficient manner is the basic guideline of ITU.
