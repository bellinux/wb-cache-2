50|$|The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Mechanische Stellwerke e. V. (“working {{community}} for mechanical signal boxes”) {{was founded on}} 21 February 2010 in Limburg to prevent the demolition of the historical and protective signal box Bo. The working community has set itself the goal of rehabilitating the signal box and, in the longer term, preserving it as a monument of the railway history in the Lahn valley for posterity. The signal box {{is located at the}} northern exit of Balduinstein station just before the Lahn bridge. The signal box was inaugurated in 1913 and went out of service on 1 September 2003. During the active period, the signal box was constantly occupied by a signalman. A mechanical <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> of the Bruchsal J type was installed in 1929. Later, a system operated by push buttons was used to operate the electrically-actuated Dr S2 interlocking from Siemens. Since the decommissioning of the signal box Bo during the 2015 modernisation, the dispatcher in the entrance building (Bf) has controlled all points and signals at the station.|$|E
40|$|OVERVIEW: A {{signaling}} system provides {{a form of}} control information that supports safe and stable railway transportation. Signaling systems include <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> (which control point machines and signals), ATP (automatic train protection) systems, etc. These systems require continual improvement to meet evolving needs of the future. Hitachi, Ltd. has developed various new {{signaling system}}s. The digital ATP system realizes high density operation for rolling stock and provides maximum riding comfort with continuous-curve brake control. Our proposed electronic <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> series has dual verification architecture, in which an <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> and electronic terminal are mounted on the same rack, to save on space and improve maintainability. The Shinkansen ATP and interlocking system is an integrated system which consists of interlocking devices and ATP logic devices. The system saves space {{in the area where}} the equipment is installed and reduces costs. The development of these new signaling systems will contribute to the improvement of railway services in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Driving {{under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol poses a significant threat to community health and safety. One approach to thwart drinking and driving involves using an <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> to test for alcohol consump-tion prior to driving. These devices measure blood alcohol concentration by breath and require drivers to pass a test before starting the vehicle and at a later re-testing during the drive. Relatively little work has been done to investigate the level of distraction potentially caused by these devices during re-testing. The current study compared the level of distraction of using an <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> to single task driving and sending and receiving text messages while driving. Both the <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> and texting resulted in small increases in lane deviation compared to single task baseline; however, participants looked away from the road significantly more often in the texting condition than the interlock condi-tion. In terms of crashes and subjective reports of workload, the <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> was higher than base-line but significantly lower than texting...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of hollow core concrete bricks made {{of sand and}} stone ash mixture as alternative substitute materials has been previously studied, considering their weight, load capacity, construction time, and cost. To obtain an optimal notch model as the <b>interlocking</b> <b>device,</b> this further study is conducted. The previous notch model is {{in the shape of}} a 2 -cm trapezoid and is varied here to consider a 2 -cm rectangular notch model and 3 - and 3. 5 -cm trapezoid notch models.

The wall specimen refers to the previous studies, which investigated specimens with sizes of 90 × 45 cm 2 under out-of-plane loading and 60 × 60 cm 2 under in-plane loading.

50|$|A typical trapped-key <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> {{consists}} of a lock cylinder which operates a sliding bolt through a cam. The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the <b>interlocked</b> <b>device</b> has been made safe; the <b>interlocked</b> <b>device</b> cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.|$|R
