2500|$|The {{party leaders}} {{rejected}} {{the idea that they}} are ruled by ideology alone. Former party leader Michael McDowell has said that he sees liberalism as not being on the left-right spectrum as it is a mix of the ideals of both. Mary Harney, on becoming health minister said [...] "I don't get my politics from any ideology, I get it <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> and common sense". [...] Yet Harney was a controversial minister who attempted to extend private influence in the health service and McDowell's campaign in the general election included particularly strong attacks on Irish left-wing parties.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 September 2016, BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight aired a {{programme}} {{in which}} a British spy (known only as [...] "Martin") who had infiltrated the IRA claimed that Murphy and other leading South Armagh Republicans had demanded the killing of Donaldson {{and that it would}} have been sanctioned by Gerry Adams. The agent claimed [...] "I know <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> in the IRA that murders have to be approved by the leadership," [...] When he was asked specifically who he was referring to, he went on: [...] "Gerry Adams, he gives the final say." [...] 'Martin' also dismissed claims the Real IRA was responsible for Donaldson's killing, he said they made the claim [...] "for the kudos, a forlorn hope that someone might take them more seriously these days".|$|E
2500|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{many cases}} go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company {{policy is the}} first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, [...] "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," [...] thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing [...] " [...] woman's purity," [...] the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with [...] "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, [...] "I do not have exact statistics but <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." [...] The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan [...] "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and {{there is no guarantee that}} the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement." ...|$|E

60|$|A large {{majority}} of the wounds are in the arms and legs. But there is every kind of wound {{in every part of}} the body. I should say of the sick, <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> in the hospitals, that the prevailing maladies are typhoid fever and the camp fevers generally, diarrhoea, catarrhal affections and bronchitis, rheumatism and pneumonia. These forms of sickness lead, all the rest follow. There are twice as many sick as there are wounded. The deaths range from six to ten per cent of those under treatment.|$|E

60|$|I {{tried to}} force my way in. There was space only for two, and that space was already occupied. Also, they had me at a disadvantage, and, what of the {{scratching}} and hair-pulling I received, I was glad to retreat. I slept that night, and for many nights, in the connecting passage of the double-cave. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> it seemed reasonably safe. As the two Folk had dodged old Saber-Tooth, and as I had dodged Red-Eye, so {{it seemed to me}} that I could dodge the hunting animals by going back and forth between the two caves.|$|E
60|$|It will be said, perhaps, {{that the}} reason why plants and animals cannot {{increase}} indefinitely in size is, that they would fall by their own weight. I answer, {{how do we know}} this but from experience?--from experience of the degree of strength with which these bodies are formed. I know that a carnation, long before it reached the size of a cabbage, would not be supported by its stalk, but I only know this <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> of the weakness and want of tenacity in the materials of a carnation stalk. There are many substances in nature of the same size that would support as large a head as a cabbage.|$|E

"I fear it is," [...] {{returned}} Leif sadly, [...] "but now I {{will give}} thee {{a job to}} perform that is necessary. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> of such matters I feel well assured that the savages intend an assault during the night, when they doubtless expect that their numbers will more easily cope with and overcome us; but in my judgment {{it is likely that}} they understand nothing of this fort-work, therefore I shall give them a surprise, instead of receiving one at their hands. Go thou, then, with six of the most active among the men, and slip as quietly as may be into the forest; gather there as many pine cones as shall fill your shields to overflowing, and bring them hither, along with a quantity of birch bark. If ye are attacked fight your way back, and we will cover your retreat from the ramparts." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now {{suppose we}} {{laid out the}} wheat {{on a table in}} a regular series, such as you may see in many {{exhibitions}} of manufactures; beginning with the wheat plant at one end, and ending with the loaf at the other; and called in to look at them a savage who knew nothing of agriculture and nothing of cookery--called in, as an extreme case, the man in the moon, who certainly can know nothing of either; for as there is neither air nor water round the moon, there can be nothing to grow there, and therefore nothing to cook--and suppose we asked him to study the series from end to end. Do you not think that the man in the moon, if he were half as shrewd as Crofton Croker makes him in his conversation with Daniel O'Rourke, would answer after due meditation, [...] "How the wheat plant got changed into the loaf I cannot see <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> in the moon: but that it has been changed, and that the two are the same thing I do see, for I see all the different stages of the change."

6000|$|... "It {{requires}} nothing," [...] replied my friend, [...] "but common sense, and {{a strong}} determination to do it. Parents who make a definite object of the religious instruction of their children, if they have common sense, can very soon see what is {{necessary in order to}} interest them; and, if they find themselves wanting in the requisite information, they can, in these days, very readily acquire it. The sources of religious knowledge are so numerous, and so popular in their form, that all can avail themselves of them. The only difficulty, after all, is, that the keeping of the Sabbath and the imparting of religious instruction are not made enough of a home object. Parents pass off the responsibility on to the Sunday school teacher, and suppose, of course, if they send their children to Sunday school, they do the best they can for them. Now, I am satisfied, <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> as a Sabbath school teacher, that the best religious instruction imparted abroad still stands in need of the coöperation of a systematic plan of religious discipline and instruction at home; for, after all, God gives a power to the efforts of a parent that can never be transferred to other hands." ...|$|E

I was in Rhodes, {{and there was a}} learned man there named Andronicus, who was engaged in editing the works of Aristotle. All the manuscripts and books which that great philosopher left behind him had been given to a friend, or trustee, and had passed from this person into the possession of others, so that for about a hundred years the world knew nothing of them. Then they came into the hands of Andronicus, who undertook to edit them and get them into proper shape for publication. I went to Andronicus, {{and as soon as he}} found I was a person qualified for such work, he engaged me as his assistant editor. I held this position for several years, and two or three of the books of Aristotle I transcribed entirely with my own hand, properly shaping sentences and paragraphs, and very often making the necessary divisions. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> with Andronicus, I am sure that none of the works of Aristotle were given to the world exactly as he wrote them, for we often found his manuscript copies very rough and disjointed so far as literary construction is concerned, but I will also say that we never interfered with his philosophical theories or his scientific statements and deductions." ...|$|E
