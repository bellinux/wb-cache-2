Blau gas was most famous, however, as the buoyancy compensating fuel for the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. It had several advantages over liquid fuels such as gasoline. Because it weighed approximately the same as air, burning it and replacing its volume with air did not lighten the airship, eliminating the need to adjust buoyancy or ballast in-flight.|$|R

40|$|In the future, the {{capacities}} of renewable SNG (synthetic natural gas) will expand significantly. Pilot plants are underway to use surplus renewable power, mainly from wind, for electrolysis {{and the production}} of hydrogen, which is methanated and fed into the existing gas pipeline grid. Pilot projects aim at the energetic use of SNG for households and transport in particular for <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> <b>cars.</b> Another option could be the use of SNG as feedstock in chemical industry. The early stage of development {{raises the question of whether}} SNG should be better used for mobility or the production of chemicals. This study compares the global warming potential (GWP) of the production of fossil natural gas (NG) and carbon-dioxide (CO 2) -based SNG and its use for car transport versus chemical use in the form of synthesis gas. Since the potential of wind energy for SNG production is mainly located in northern Germany, the consequences by a growing distance between production in the North and transport to the South of Germany are also examined. The results indicate that CO 2 -based SNG produced with wind power would lead to lower GWP when substituting NG for both uses in either transport or chemical production. Differences of the savings potential occur in short-distance pipeline transport. The critical factor is the energy required for compression along the process chain...|$|R
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural <b>gas</b> (CNG) to <b>fuel</b> <b>cars</b> has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day.

40|$|The {{title of}} the thesis is “Critical Discourse Analysis on the Jakarta Post Headline Article “Lawmaker Divided Over Govt Plant To Limit Subsidized Fuels”. The data was found from Headline article of the Jakarta Post on Tuesday, January 17 2012. The aim of this {{research}} is to find out the ideology of Jakarta Post headline article. This research is qualitative descriptive because it is intended to describe systematically the fact and characteristic of given population or area of interest factually and accurately. Qualitative descriptive is a descriptive that describes the subject into word or picture form rather than in a number form. The data was taken from Jakarta Post website in www. thejakartapost. com. The data is analyzed by Huckin’s method: analyzing the article with word level, analyzing the article with sentence level, and analyzing with the whole of the text. The article tried to explain that the government reallocated the subsidized budget from the premium fuel to the utilization of <b>gas</b> based <b>fuel</b> in transportation. From the conclusion, the government wanted to replace the premium <b>fuel</b> with the <b>gas</b> based <b>fuel.</b> The increasing of fuel price in the world make the government has no other choice to solve the crisis of energy in the world. The benefit of the use of the <b>gas</b> based <b>fuel</b> will help to increase the nation economic growth.

40|$|AbstractLiquid Gas for Vehicles (LGV) is an {{alternative}} fuel for land transportation sector besides gasoline. Until now, fuel conversion program from gasoline to <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> has not been fully implemented in Indonesia, as the availability of <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution infrastructure is far behind the gasoline distribution infrastructure.

The engine was modified to be operated with mixtures of diesel and natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuels</b> in dual-fuel mode. Then, diesel fuel was injected into the cylinder while natural gas was injected into intake manifold with both injectors controlled with the electronic control unit. Energy content of the sprayed <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> was varied in the amounts of 0 % (only diesel fuel), 15 %, 40 %, and 75 % of total fuel’s energy content.
