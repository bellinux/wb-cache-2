5|$|Edwin {{was the son}} of Ælle king of Deira {{and seems}} to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> (<b>at</b> least) two siblings. His sister Acha was married to Æthelfrith, king of {{neighbouring}} Bernicia. An otherwise unknown sibling fathered Hereric, who in turn fathered Abbess Hilda of Whitby and Hereswith, wife to Æthelric, the brother of king Anna of East Anglia.|$|E

5|$|Estimates for {{the cavalry}} are {{usually in the}} 1,000–3,000 range. The Persian cavalry was usually {{provided}} by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry. The fleet must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> least some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships {{would be required to}} carry 1,000 cavalry.|$|E

In most cases, the most-watched MLB game on any network during a season is a game between the Yankees and the Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{coaches have}} won the award in the same season that they have also won a National Coach of the Year award; of those, only Krzyzewski and Smith have {{achieved}} the feat three times. Four coaches have won during the same season that they have coached a team that won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship: Frank McGuire, Norm Sloan, Dean Smith, and Gary Williams. North Carolina has the most ACC Coach of the Year awards with 12, while its in-state rival, Duke, is second with 10. Frank McGuire is the only head coach to win the award at two different schools (North Carolina and South Carolina). Each of the original 1953ACC members <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> least one of their coaches win the award. Among schools that joined the ACC before 2013, Boston College {{is the only one}} that has never had a winning coach. Thirty-one different coaches from twelve schools have received the award.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Rodríguez was {{selected}} as the American League MVP. He set a new American League record for home runs in a single season among catchers with 35. Rodríguez was also the first catcher to have more than 30home runs, 100 runs batted in, and 100 runs scored in the history of Major League Baseball. In addition, he holds the distinction of being the first catcher {{in the history of the}} league to amass more than 20home runs and 20stolen bases. From May 8, 1999 to June 1, 1999, Rodríguez had a career high 20 game hitting streak. He had 25 stolen bases, which was fifth most among catchers in the history of the league. He led the league in times grounded into a double play, with 31. Rodríguez was only the ninth catcher in the history of Major League Baseball to win the Most Valuable Player award, and he was the first to win it since Thurman Munson in 1976. He was named on all of the ballots, getting seven first place votes and six second place votes. Rodríguez was the sixth Puerto Rican to win the award, and the fourth player from the Texas Rangers to win it. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time in a row and {{was selected}} Most Valuable Player by Baseball Digest. He was again named to all-star teams by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America. While he was hitting home runs, he wasn't taking many walks. He is one of only six players active in 2009 who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> least 30 home runs in a season in which they had more homers than walks (34 HR, 24 BB in 1999). The others are Alfonso Soriano (39–23 in 2002, 36–33 in 2005, 33–31 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35–24 in 2000), Ryan Braun (34–29 in 2007), Joe Crede (30–28 in 2006), and José Guillén (31–24 in 2003).|$|E
