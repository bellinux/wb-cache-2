In order to achieve it, this paper develops parametric approaches to MPC but differs from more conventional approaches in that it predefines the complexity of the solution rather than the allowable suboptimality. The paper proposes a novel parameterisation of the parametric regions which allows efficiency of definition, <b>effective</b> <b>spanning</b> of the feasible region and also highly efficient search algorithms. Despite the suboptimality, the algorithm retains guaranteed stability, in the nominal case. A laboratory test was carried out to demonstrate the code on real hardware and the effectiveness of the solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} feature of many communities of interoperability based on a common protocol stacks is a spanning layer. a term coined by David Clark :"Certain protocols are designed with the specific purpose of bridging differences at the lower layers, so that common agreements are not required there. Instead, the layer provides the definitions that permit translation to occur between a range of services or technologies used below. Thus, in somewhat abstract terms, at and above such a layer common standards contribute to interoperation, while below the layer translation is used.

The impact of modelling uncertainties, such as the impact of secondary seismic members, impact of <b>effective</b> <b>span</b> of slabs {{and the impact of}} taking into account cracked reinforced concrete elements is examined. Five models of the building were developed and analyzed. The first model, with reinforced concrete cores, columns and slabs, is most realistic. In the second mode, the slabs were replaced with beams to illustrate the impact of the <b>effective</b> <b>span</b> of slab. Third model includes core and columns without beams. We anticipate that the impact of the columns is small and they can be considered as a secondary seismic members. That was checked by a fourth model. However, it is convenient to take them into account in the seismic model, which simplifies to obtain deformations in the columns which are needed for dimensioning of these elements, while their impact on the primary seismic members is insignificant. By the fifth model, we examine the impact of cracked reinforced concrete elements. The results of the seismic analysis were evaluated with global seismic requirements, such as period of vibration and forms of oscillation, story displacements, story shears and with loads. We {{came to the conclusion that}} the choice of structural model of a building with strong concrete core and plates on the columns is important. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Models with consideration of secondary seismic elements make it possible to better capture the behaviour of the structure and simplify the dimensioning of secondary elements.
