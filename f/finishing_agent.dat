The Camphora {{was obtained from the}} open market in Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria and crushed in small particles (billionths parts or 10 - 9 parts of it). The Camphora was used to make formulations with water of various concentrations of 14. 3 g/ 0. 5 dm 3, 28. 6 g/ 0. 5 dm 3 and 42. 9 g/ 0. 5 dm 3. These various concentrations were used to culture the two fabric samples- 100 % cotton and 100 % polyester. At concentration below 42. 9 g/ 0. 5 dm 3 both fabrics indicated growth of bacteria while at concentration of 42. 9 g/ 0. 5 dm 3 no growth of bacteria was indicated.
