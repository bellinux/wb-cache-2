Fox said: [...] "It wouldn't surprise me if <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a game as successful again. That's fine with me though." ...|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, King {{says that}} in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic {{candidate}} John F. Kennedy: [...] "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> one." [...] King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying [...] "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2012 it was {{reported}} that Aston had left Time Team. He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about." [...] In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology Aston said: [...] "The time had come to leave. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> any money out of it, but a lot of my soul went into it. I feel really, really angry about it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman {{received}} his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' Highway Dragnet. Corman soon independently produced his first movie, Monster from the Ocean Floor, on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule. Among the six films {{he worked on}} in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, Apache Woman, and Day the World Ended, half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package. Corman {{would go on to}} direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the [...] "King of the Bs", Corman has said that [...] "to my way of thinking, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a 'B' movie in my life", as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as [...] "low-budget exploitation films". In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De Niro, among many others.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, McBride sold the Browns for $600,000 ($ in today's dollars), {{more than twice the}} largest sum ever paid for a {{professional}} football team. The old stockholders were McBride and his son Edward, along with minority owners including taxi business associate Dan Sherby, Brown and four others. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Cleveland Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney who had founded the Cleveland Rams, Saul Silberman, owner of the horse race track later known as Thistledown Racecourse, and Ralph DeChairo, an associate of Silberman. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football. McBride said he had simply [...] "had his fling" [...] with football and wanted to concentrate on other business activities. [...] "Well, I came out clean after all," [...] he said. [...] "Considering what happened to some of the other fellows who started the old All-America Conference with me, this isn't so bad. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> anything, but I didn't lose anything either, except maybe a few thousand dollars." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Wozniak (who {{consulted}} with Sorkin {{before he had}} written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015 {{that he does not}} [...] "talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1947, Hayworth was {{featured}} in a Life cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed [...] "The Love Goddess".

In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, [...] "Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced.

[...] In 2006, she also addressed the rumors that she is an open lesbian by saying, [...] "I never made any kind of statement about my personal life on any level. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> any proclamations.

2500|$|I {{found him}} petulant... I don't {{remember}} hearing him laugh, or ever seeing him laugh. Everything that concerned him was very serious...

[...] he'd be looking out there some place. Finally, I said,"Alan, I'm he-ere!!"... I think he was very conscious of his looks. Alan would not look beyond {{a certain point in}} the camera because he didn't think he looked good... Jimmy Cagney was not tall but somehow Jimmy was at terms with himself, always. I don't think Alan Ladd ever came to terms with himself.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to America in 1841, Pratt found the church {{membership}} in contention over several issues. Rumors and gossip were rife in Nauvoo, Illinois, and Pratt found the religious principle of plural marriage difficult to accept. He rebelled against Joseph Smith when a report by disaffected Mormon John C. Bennett accused Smith of proposing marriage to Pratt's wife, Sarah Pratt, which Smith categorically denied. Additionally, a story was circulating that Sarah Pratt had been involved with Bennett himself. Pratt was torn between believing his wife or Smith, and wrote, [...] "My sorrows are greater than I can bear!" [...] A public meeting was held where a resolution supporting Smith's character was proposed; Pratt stated that {{he was unable to}} support the resolution, to which Smith replied, [...] "Have you personally a knowledge of any immoral act in me toward the female sex, or in any other way?", to which Pratt answered no. After days of Smith and {{the other members of the}} Twelve remonstrating with Pratt, they decided that he would not yield, and thus Pratt was excommunicated on August 20, 1842. Bennett claimed that Pratt and his wife were planning to leave Nauvoo and help him [...] "expose Mormonism"; Pratt would later publish a statement in the Nauvoo Expositor to deny this claim. Pratt reconciled with Smith a few months after their falling out and requested re-baptism. Pratt was reinstated in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on January 20, 1843. Smith and Pratt directly discussed Pratt's wife, with Smith stating to him, [...] "She lied about me: <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> the offer which she said I did." ...|$|E
