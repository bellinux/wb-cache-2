25|$|Sargon I or Šarru-kīn I (c. 1861 BC – c. 1822 BC), son and {{successor}} of Ikunum, reigned as {{king of the}} Old Assyrian Empire. Sargon <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been named}} after Sargon of Akkad. The name “Sargon” means “the king is legitimate” in Akkadian. Sargon I {{is known for his}} work refortifying Assur. Very little is known about this king.|$|E
25|$|The Ares I rocket was {{specifically}} being designed {{to launch the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. Orion {{was intended as a}} crew capsule, similar in design to the Apollo program capsule, to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, the Moon, and eventually Mars. Ares <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> also delivered some (limited) resources to orbit, including supplies for the International Space Station or subsequent delivery to the planned lunar base.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E

25|$|I {{was well}} placed at table between {{one of the}} Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His {{complexion}} was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...|$|E

500|$|In 1954, a {{year before}} his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an {{interviewer}} who were the greatest thinkers that he had known.

[...] "But for that there plate glass wot a blow hout <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>'ave!</b> Beggin' <b>might</b> be tried with advantage. It's agin the law, no doubt, but it ain't a sin. Yes, I'll try beggin'." ...|$|R
500|$|In retirement, Nash {{was asked}} why he never won a Brownlow Medal (the award for the Best and Fairest player in the VFL). He replied, [...] "I was never the best and fairest but I reckon <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the worst and dirtiest. I played it hard and tough." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{controversy}} broke, Lennon reluctantly apologised for the comment, saying [...] "if I had said television was {{more popular than}} Jesus, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> got away with it". He stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. The events contributed to the Beatles' {{lack of interest in}} public live performances, and the US tour was the last they undertook, after which they became a studio-only band.|$|E

500|$|When Denham is {{considering}} who {{to play the}} part before meeting Ann, he suggests [...] "Fay", but his assistant Preston replies, [...] "She's doing a picture with RKO." [...] Music from the 1933 film is heard, and Denham mutters, [...] "Cooper, huh? <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> known." [...] Fay Wray starred in the 1933 film, which was directed by Merian C. Cooper and released by RKO. At {{the time she was}} performing in another Cooper/Schoedsack production, The Most Dangerous Game with Robert Armstrong.|$|E
500|$|His parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} seven. Growing up, Levine spent weekdays {{with his mother and}} weekends with his father. He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|Tina's {{cover of}} [...] "My Funny Valentine" [...] stirred mixed {{emotions}} in Gonzalez. She criticized the ending: [...] "When she started sobbing, it got weird. Then weirder. Then downright uncomfortable." [...] However, {{she liked the}} earlier part of the performance, and wrote, [...] "It was übersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts. If she would have continued the song with a mild lump in her throat, I think <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> gotten choked up with her." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of Motley's runs were trap plays up the middle, {{but he had}} {{the speed}} to run outside. [...] "There's no telling how much yardage <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> made if I ran as much as some backs do now," [...] he once said. Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players {{regarded}} Motley as the better player, in part because of his strength as a blocker. [...] "There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley," [...] Graham said at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. [...] "Motley was the greatest all-around fullback." ...|$|E
500|$|Ornstein's {{follow-up}} performance {{provoked a}} near-riot: [...] "At my second concert, devoted {{to my own}} compositions, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> played anything. I couldn't hear the piano myself. The crowd whistled and howled and even threw handy missiles on the stage." [...] The reaction, however, {{was by no means}} universally negative—the Musical Standard called him [...] "one of the most remarkable composers of the day... that germ of realism and humanity which is indicative of genius." [...] By the next year, he was the talk of the American music scene for his performances of cutting-edge works by Schoenberg, Scriabin, Bartók, Debussy, Kodály, Ravel, and Stravinsky (many of them U.S. premieres), as well as his own, even more radical compositions.|$|E
500|$|About {{people you}} knew? [...] "Yes, about people <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> known." [...] About things that {{happened}}? [...] "Yes, {{about things that}} happened or could have happened." [...] But they did not? [...] "No, {{not all of them}} did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end." [...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are—although they never occurred." ...|$|E
