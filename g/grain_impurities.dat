This paper proposes a technical solution for the implementation of this process and derives a mathematical model thereof. The authors analyze the modeled process of <b>grain</b> <b>impurities</b> allocation from the fraction of light waste sediment {{in the area of the}} suction port flow fan. The results of modeling are verified by comparison to experimental data. It is found out that the results of theoretical studies fit the ± 10 % tolerance of the experimental data difference. The agreement between the theoretic generated and the experimental results on the hypothesis on the samples belonging to the same general population based on the sign test is considered acceptable. The resultant mathematical model adequately describes the process of fractionation of light waste in the sedimentary area of the suction chamber in diametrical fan window...|$|E

Till now steel plant waste water was clarified in scale pits and settling tanks and partially using filtration techniques. Finest grain iron oxide particles {{with a mean}} diameter of 1 - 5 #mu# occur in waste water and reduce the efficiency of classical clarification processes. We regard magnetic separation as an altenative method {{for the removal of}} finest <b>grain</b> <b>impurities.</b> The investigations include the development, the manufacture and the test of an experimental equipment for magnetic filtration of steel plant waste water. A computing programme for the design of permanent magnetic circuits was developed. The tests in a steel plant have demonstrated, that the magnetic filtration with the electromagnetic filter and also with a permanent magnetic filter is successful for clarifiction of waste water from VOD-plants. The impurities can be separated as a mud with concentrations of Fe-oxides of 100 g/l. Great magnetic filters with electromagnetic circuits are more economical as such with permanent magnetic circuits.

For almost all samples both inter- and transgranular fracture are observed, the proportion of each type varies. Due to the difference in their <b>impurity</b> content and <b>grain</b> boundary area, a large variation in the <b>grain</b> boundary <b>impurities</b> can be expected. By analysing the fracture surfaces the effect of <b>grain</b> boundary <b>impurities,</b> especially phosphorous and oxygen, on the fracture resistance of the boundaries was determined. The results indicate that for the analysed tungsten materials <b>grain</b> boundary <b>impurities</b> do not have a significant influence on the fracture resistance of the boundaries.

40|$|The {{rapid rate}} gravity filter is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} surface water supplies. It consists of a structure to house the unit, the filter media, an under- rain system, a surface washer, and a waste disposal system. The filter area should be divided into at least two separate units to allow operational flexibility. Some form of pre-treatment of the raw water, such as sedimentation, is usually needed. In the filtering process, water flows onto the top of the filter media and is driven through it by gravity. In passing through the small spaces between the filter's <b>grains,</b> <b>impurities</b> are removed. The water continues its way through the support gravel, enters the under-drainage system, and then flows to the reservoir. It is the filter media, composed of sand or anthracite, which actually removes the particles from the water. The filter media is routinely cleaned by means of a backwashing process...|$|R

Recent experiments have shown that some larger grain size liners with low impurity contents exhibit better ductility than smaller grain size liners with higher impurity concentrations. Within the range of grain sizes and bulk impurity contents in this study, the analysis suggests that the quadruple nodes and triple lines are saturated with impurities. Over this same range of <b>impurities</b> and <b>grain</b> sizes, only partial filling of a monolayer of impurities exists at the grain boundaries.

Albedo and flux extinction coefficient of soot contaminated snowcovers were studied using a two stream approximation of the radiative transfer equation. The effect of soot was calculated by two methods: independent scattering by ice <b>grains</b> and <b>impurities</b> and average refractive index for ice grains. Both methods predict a qualitatively similar effect of soot; the albedo is decreased and the extinction coefficient is increased compared to that for pure snow in the visible region; the infrared properties are largely unaffected.

From the atomic yield stress on the atomic surface a², given by the model of Orowan, the macroscopic yield stress is then obtained through a Scale Law of Measure (SLM) which depends only on the lattice spacing and a constant L. This relation shows that the efficient atomic dimension is a fractal dimension. The precision obtained by the SLM is of an atomic order compared to the error (102 to 104 MPa) obtained by classical theories. The SLM gives also new theoretical relations for the elastic limit of strain, the toughness and the fracture strength.

40|$|The {{exceptional}} {{properties of}} nanocrystalline materials {{lend themselves to}} a wide range of structural and functional applications. There is recent evidence to suggest that <b>grain</b> boundary <b>impurities</b> may have a dramatic effect on the stability, strength and ductility of nanocrystalline metals and alloys. In this study, transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography were used to characterize specimens deposited at different base pressures, thus providing a direct comparison of impurity content with microstructural stability and mechanical behaviour. Atom probe measurements provide clear experimental evidence of grain boundary segregation of oxygen in samples deposited at higher base pressures. It is proposed that these oxygen atoms pin the boundaries, preventing stress-assisted grain growth and resulting in increased strength and loss in ductility. This study provides the first direct experimental evidence that boundary impurities play a critical role in determining the microstructural stability and deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline metals. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) during {{plastic deformation}} is analyzed for a pure single crystal neglecting {{the effects of}} <b>grain</b> boundaries, <b>impurities,</b> and second‐phase particles. Acceleration of a moving dislocation {{is considered to be}} the principal AE source. There are two major mechanisms of dislocation motion related to acceleration, initial, and continuous oscillatory motion. Initial motion induced by the creation of mobile dislocations is modeled as a step function of velocity. Continuous oscillatory motion produced by interactions with neighboring dislocations is modeled as a harmonic function. These mechanisms vary with strain and strain rate due to dislocation multiplication. AE can thus be described in terms of strain and strain rate. Annihilation at a free surface is also regarded as an AE source in addition to the initial and oscillatory motions. The kinetic and strain energies stored around a moving dislocation are dissipated during annihilation, and can be related to AE. The frequency spectrum of AE is also determined. A shift of the spectrum to higher frequencies with increasing strain is explained by an increase in the interaction force between dislocations...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic spall {{failure of}} ductile metals {{is a complex}} multiscale, multirate process. On the {{macroscale}} the process involves a period of shock compression followed by dynamic tension {{set up by the}} stress wave interactions. During the shock compression, the material undergoes shock-dependent microscopic processes that may include dislocation multiplication, nucleation, trapping, pile-up, annihilation, recovery, cell evolution, as well as vacancy generation and clustering. In addition to shock hardening the material, this new shock-induced defect structure seeds the material with potential void nucleation sites that may be activated during the proceeding period of dynamic tensile loading. In addition to these shock-induced void nucleation sites, the material also possesses pre-existing nucleation sites, e. g., triple junctions, grain boundaries, and second-phase particles. Upon nucleation, these voids undergo dynamic growth to coalescence, constrained by inertia and viscoplastic resistance to deformation.

We study thermal conductivity by these in-plane magnetic excitations using two distinct techniques, Boltzmann formalism within the relaxation-time approximation and memory-function approach. Within these approaches, a close consideration is given to the scattering of magnons by both acoustic and optical branches of phonons.
