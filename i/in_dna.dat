5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands. Ligases are {{particularly}} important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> repair and genetic recombination.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic mechanisms, where {{evolution}} {{can occur}} {{in the absence of}} change <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence, through various mechanisms including chemical modifications to the DNA bases.|$|E
50|$|Mutations <b>in</b> {{mitochondrial}} <b>DNA</b> (mtDNA) {{and over}} 30 genes <b>in</b> nuclear <b>DNA</b> (gene SURF1 and some COX assembly factors) have {{been implicated in}} Leigh disease.|$|R
50|$|In prokaryotes, nonviral {{extrachromosomal}} DNA {{is primarily}} found in plasmids whereas <b>in</b> eukaryotes extrachromosomal <b>DNA</b> is primarily found <b>in</b> organelles. Mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> is a {{main source of}} this extrachromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> eukaryotes. Extrachromosomal <b>DNA</b> is often used in research of replication because {{it is easy to}} identify and isolate.|$|R
50|$|The {{chloroplast}} genome {{most commonly}} includes around 100 genes which code {{for a variety}} of things, mostly to do with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis. As in prokaryotes, genes <b>in</b> chloroplast <b>DNA</b> are organized into operons. Interestingly, introns are common <b>in</b> chloroplast <b>DNA</b> molecules, while they are rare <b>in</b> prokaryotic <b>DNA</b> molecules (plant mitochondrial DNAs commonly have introns, but not human mtDNA).|$|R
5|$|GWA studies {{investigate}} the entire genome, {{in contrast to}} methods that specifically test {{a small number of}} pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.|$|E
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} <b>in</b> <b>DNA.</b> The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative damage <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> {{can cause}} cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the processing of adducts formed by covalent binding of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) to <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> confluent cultures of African green monkey cells. Repair synthesis elicited by AFB 1 adducts was deficient <b>in</b> alpha <b>DNA</b> sequences compared to that <b>in</b> bulk <b>DNA,</b> although the initial levels of modification were the same for these DNAs. The removal of the primary initial adduct, AFB 1 -N 7 -Guanine, was deficient <b>in</b> alpha <b>DNA</b> and the kinetics of its loss resembled those previously reported for removal from total <b>DNA</b> <b>in</b> xeroderma pigmentosum cells of complementation group A. Spontaneous loss of the AFB 1 moiety or the concomitant loss of the guanine to yield an apurinic site account for these results. The formation of the more chemically stable secondary product, AFB 1 -triamino-Pyrimidine, occurred more rapidly and {{to a greater extent}} <b>in</b> alpha <b>DNA</b> than <b>in</b> bulk <b>DNA,</b> probably because of slower removal of the primary product. The excision repair patch size for AFB 1 adducts <b>in</b> alpha <b>DNA</b> was only 10 nucleotides compared to 20 nucleotides for repair of AFB 1 adducts <b>in</b> bulk <b>DNA.</b> Irradiation of cells with low doses of UV prior to or immediately after treatment with AFB 1 increased the rate and extent of removal of AFB 1 adducts from alpha DNA to the levels found <b>in</b> the bulk <b>DNA,</b> indicating that the formation of pyrimidine dimers or their repair may alter the chromatin structure of alpha DNA sufficiently to facilitate its repair...|$|R
40|$|Significantly more 5 -methylcytosine {{residues}} {{were found}} <b>in</b> the <b>DNA</b> from the dormant sclerotia of Phymatotrichum omnivorum than <b>in</b> the <b>DNA</b> from the metabolically active mycelia of the fungus, {{as shown by}} high-pressure liquid chromatography of acid-hydrolyzed DNA digests and by restriction of the DNA with the isoschizomers MspI and HpaII.

50|$|However, it is {{possible}} for organelle genes from the same lineage to recombine. Intramolecular and intermolecular recombination can cause inversions and repeats <b>in</b> chloroplast <b>DNA,</b> and can produce subgenomic circles <b>in</b> mitochondrial <b>DNA.</b>|$|R
5|$|Recombination allows {{chromosomes}} {{to exchange}} genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, {{which increases the}} efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.|$|E

50|$|Sohal et al. {{observed}} that caloric restriction decreased 8-OHdG damages <b>in</b> the <b>DNA</b> of mice heart, skeletal muscle, brain, liver and kidney. The levels of 8-OHdG <b>in</b> the <b>DNA</b> of these organs in 15 month old mice {{were reduced to}} an average of 81% of that <b>in</b> the <b>DNA</b> of mice fed an unrestricted diet. Kaneko et al. {{observed that}}, in rats, dietary restriction retarded the onset of age-related increases in 8-OHdG <b>in</b> nuclear <b>DNA</b> of brain, heart, liver and kidney. The level of 8-OHdG in these organs of the calorie restricted rats at 30 months averaged 65% of the level in rats fed an unrestricted diet.|$|R

5|$|The {{complementary}} base to adenine <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> is thymine, {{whereas in}} RNA, it is uracil, {{which is an}} unmethylated form of thymine.|$|E
5|$|These {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} and their reaction products, such as the hydroxyl radical, are very harmful to cells, as they oxidize proteins and cause mutations <b>in</b> <b>DNA.</b> This cellular damage might contribute to disease and is proposed as one cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|Uracil is {{not usually}} found <b>in</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{occurring}} only as a breakdown product of cytosine. However, in several bacteriophages, Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and Yersinia bacteriophage piR1-37, thymine {{has been replaced by}} uracil. Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil.|$|E
40|$|In mammals, {{several studies}} have {{suggested}} that levels of methylation are higher <b>in</b> repetitive <b>DNA</b> than <b>in</b> nonrepetitive <b>DNA,</b> possibly reflecting a genome-wide defense mechanism against deleterious effects associated with transposable elements (TEs). To analyze the determinants of methylation patterns <b>in</b> primate repetitive <b>DNA,</b> we took advantage {{of the fact that the}} methylation rate in the germ line is reflected by the transition rate at CpG sites. We assessed the variability of CpG substitution rates <b>in</b> nonrepetitive <b>DNA</b> and <b>in</b> various TE and retropseudogene families. We show that, unlike other substitution rates, the rate of transition at CpG sites is significantly (37 %) higher <b>in</b> repetitive <b>DNA</b> than <b>in</b> nonrepetitive <b>DNA.</b> Moreover, this rate of CpG transition varies according to the number of repeats, their length, and their level of divergence from the ancestral sequence (up to 2. 7 times higher in long, lowly divergent TEs compared with unique sequences). This observation strongly suggests the existence of a homology-dependent methylation (HDM) mechanism in mammalian genomes. We propose that HDM is a direct consequence of interfering RNA-induced transcriptional gene silencing...|$|R

25|$|If {{it becomes}} {{necessary}} {{to differentiate between}} mutations <b>in</b> genomic <b>DNA,</b> mitochondrial DNA, and RNA, a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, {{then it would be}} written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred <b>in</b> genomic <b>DNA,</b> m.100G>C if the mutation occurred <b>in</b> mitochondrial <b>DNA,</b> or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.|$|R
5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} to analyze the differences <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common A.gallica.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences <b>in</b> <b>DNA,</b> gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found <b>in</b> <b>DNA</b> upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E
