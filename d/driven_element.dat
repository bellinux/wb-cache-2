2500|$|The above {{described}} antennas {{with multiple}} driven elements require a complex feed system of signal splitting, phasing, distribution to the elements, and impedance matching. [...] A {{different sort of}} end-fire array {{which is much more}} often used is based on the use of so-called parasitic elements. In the popular high-gain Yagi antenna, only one of the dipoles is actually connected electrically, but the others receive and reradiate power supplied by the <b>driven</b> <b>element.</b> This time, the phasing is accomplished by careful choice of the lengths as well as positions of the parasitic elements, in order to concentrate gain in one direction and largely cancel radiation in the opposite direction (as well as all other directions). Although the realized gain is less than a driven array with the same number of elements, the simplicity of the electrical connections makes the Yagi more practical for consumer applications.|$|E

The <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> is typically a λ/2 dipole or folded dipole {{and is the only}} member of the structure that is directly excited (electrically connected to the feedline). All the other elements are considered parasitic. That is, they reradiate power which they receive from the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (they also interact with each other).|$|E

5000|$|Parasitic arrays - These are endfire arrays which {{consist of}} {{multiple}} antenna {{elements in a}} line of which only one, the <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> is connected to the transmitter or receiver, while the other elements, called parasitic elements, are not. The parasitic elements function as resonators, absorbing radio waves from the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> and reradiating them with a different phase, to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna, increasing the power radiated in the desired direction. Since these have only one <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> they are often called [...] "antennas" [...] instead of [...] "arrays".|$|E
50|$|However these {{elements}} are not driven as such but receive their {{energy from the}} field created by the <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> so we will find almost the opposite to be true. For now, consider that the parasitic element is also of length λ/2. Again looking at the parasitic element as a dipole which has been shorted at the feedpoint, {{we can see that}} if the parasitic element were to respond to the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> with an open-circuit feedpoint voltage in phase with that applied to the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (which we'll assume for now) then the reflected wave from the short circuit would induce a current 180° out of phase with the current in the <b>driven</b> <b>element.</b> This would tend to cancel the radiation of the <b>driven</b> <b>element.</b> However, due to the reactance caused by the length difference, the phase lag of the current in the reflector, added to this 180° lag, results in a phase advance, and vice versa for the director. Thus the directivity of the array indeed is in the direction towards the director.|$|E
50|$|The <b>driven</b> <b>elements</b> are fed by {{a network}} of {{transmission}} lines, which divide the power from the RF source equally between the elements. This often has the circuit geometry of a tree structure.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{multielement antenna}} array (such as a Yagi-Uda antenna), the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> or active element is the {{element in the}} antenna (typically a metal rod) which is {{electrically}} connected to the receiver or transmitter. In a transmitting antenna it is driven or excited by the RF current from the transmitter, and {{is the source of}} the radio waves. In a receiving antenna it collects the incoming radio waves for reception, and converts them to tiny oscillating electric currents, which are applied to the receiver. Multielement antennas like the Yagi typically consist of a <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> connected to the receiver or transmitter through a feed line, and a number of other elements which are not driven, called parasitic elements. The <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> is often a dipole. The parasitic elements act as resonators and couple electromagnetically with the <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> and serve to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna, directing the radio waves in one direction, increasing the gain of the antenna.|$|E

50|$|The single <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> can be {{replaced}} by a Yagi array. UHF Yagi television antennas very often use a corner reflector.

50|$|In simple antennas {{the feed}} usually {{consists}} of the feed antenna (<b>driven</b> <b>element),</b> {{the part of the}} antenna which actually converts the radio frequency currents to radio waves or vice versa, and the feed line (transmission line), which connects the feed antenna with the receiver or transmitter. For example, in a rooftop Yagi television antenna, the feed consists of a dipole <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> which converts the radio waves to an electric current, and a coaxial cable or twin lead transmission line which conducts the received signal from the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> into the house to the television receiver. The rest of the antenna consists of rods called parasitic elements, which strengthen reception from a given direction.|$|E

5000|$|The spacing (S) of the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> {{in front}} of the point where the reflectors meet is {{approximately}} 0.5λ but is not very critical; for 90° antennas the gain doesn't vary more than 1.5 dB for S between 0.25λ and 0.75λ. [...] The radiation resistance of the dipole increases with this spacing, so the spacing can be adjusted to match the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> to the feed line. [...] Bowtie driven elements are often used for wide bandwidth applications like television antennas.|$|E
50|$|One {{must take}} into account an {{additional}} phase delay due to the finite distance between the elements which further delays the phase of the currents in both the directors and reflector(s). The case of a Yagi - Uda array using just a <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> and a director is illustrated in the accompanying diagram taking all of these effects into account. The wave generated by the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (green) propagates in both the forward and reverse directions (as well as other directions, not shown). The director receives that wave slightly delayed in time (amounting to a phase delay of about 35° which will be important for the reverse direction calculations later), and generating a current that would be out of phase with the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (thus an additional 180° phase shift), but which is further advanced in phase (by about 70°) due to the director's shorter length. In the forward direction the net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about 110° (180° - 70°) retarded with respect to that from the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (green), in this particular design. These waves combine to produce the net forward wave (bottom, right) with an amplitude slightly larger than the individual waves.|$|E
