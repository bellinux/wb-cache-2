Between 1931 and 1949 Mitchell-Innes played 132 {{first-class}} matches, appearing 69 times for Somerset, and 43 times for Oxford University. In these matches he scored 6,944 runs, including 13 centuries and a top score of 207. He was well-regarded <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> his batting, but his cricket career was limited by both hay fever and his overseas work commitments.|$|E
500|$|Hunter Davies {{recalled}} that while {{working with the}} Beatles on their authorised biography in 1968, [...] "when the subject of Pete Best came up they seemed to cut off, {{as if he had}} never touched their lives. They showed little reaction … I suppose it reminded them not just that they had been rather sneaky in the handling of Pete Best's sacking, never telling him to his face, but that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God, or Brian Epstein, circumstances might have been different and they could have ended up [...]" [...] During the height of Beatlemania Best attempted to commit suicide, but his mother, Mona, and his brother, Rory, talked him out of it.|$|E

His story is related in the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ("Ecclesiastical History of the English People") by Bede who wrote, [...] "here was in the Monastery of this Abbess a certain brother particularly remarkable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>of</b> God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of scripture, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven." ...|$|E

500|$|John Anderson, of Variety, said [...] "to simply call it {{harrowing}} or unsparing doesn’t quite cut it," [...] having {{felt that}} the film is [...] "courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope." [...] Anderson cited Carey's performance as [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as [...] "disarming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives." [...] Gleiberman described the film as being a movie [...] "that makes you think, 'There but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed {{nothing less than the}} birth of a soul" [...] and {{felt that the}} [...] "final scene of revelation" [...] between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong {{enough to be able to}} leave viewers [...] "tearful, shaken, [...] dazed with pity and terror." [...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E
500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and {{produced}} with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay, while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The electropop song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line [...] "It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M" [...] on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass. As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, [...] "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being [...] "meant {{to be heard in}} a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." [...] After the chorus she chants the line [...] "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" [...] a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song [...] "There But <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>of</b> God Go I" [...] by Machine. The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a cappella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Born This Way" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F3 to C5. [...] "Born This Way" [...] follows a chord progression of F5–F–E–B–F in the chorus.|$|E

Ostinatos, like previous movements, are the backdrop Talbot uses to set his melodies, like a psalm-tone in Gregorian chant. The harmonies are more consonant, and even the texts reflect a hopeful and aspiring love: Beate, qui habitant in domo tua, Domine; In saecula saeculorum laudabant te (Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee 84:4).

2500|$|Richard Hofstadter (6 August 1916 – 24 October 1970) was an American {{historian}} and public intellectual of the mid-20th century. Hofstadter was the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History at Columbia University. Rejecting his earlier approach to {{history from the}} far left, in the 1950s he embraced consensus history, becoming the [...] "iconic historian of postwar liberal consensus", largely because of his emphasis on ideas and political culture rather than the day-to-day doings of politicians. His influence is ongoing, as modern critics profess admiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> his writing, {{and the depth of}} his insight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began as}} soon as the report was presented to that House of Commons. It is reported that Thatcher read the main conclusions of the report to cries of [...] "whitewash" [...] and ironic cheers from the opposition. In the parliamentary debate that followed its publication, the former Prime Minister James Callaghan said that [...] "for 338 paragraphs he painted a splendid picture, delineated the light and the shade, and the glowing colours in it, and when Franks got to paragraph 339 he got fed up with the canvas he was painting, and chucked a bucket of whitewash over it". David Owen, Foreign Secretary in the previous Labour government, was kinder in his interpretation. He said in Parliament that [...] "I do not agree with substantial parts of the Franks report, but anyone who pretends that the issue in 1982 was easy simply has not lived through such experience", and [...] "when I read the Franks report, I think 'There but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God go I'".|$|E
2500|$|Bede's {{story of}} Cædmon, the cowherd {{who became the}} 'Father of English Poetry' {{represents}} the real heart of {{the conversion of the}} Anglo-Saxons from paganism to Christianity. Bede wrote, [...] "here was in the Monastery of this Abbess (Streonæshalch – now known as Whitby Abbey) a certain brother particularly remarkable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>of</b> God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of scripture, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven." [...] The story of Cædmon illustrates the blending of Christian and Germanic, Latin and oral tradition, monasteries and double monasteries, pre-existing customs and new learning, popular and elite, that characterizes the Conversion period of Anglo-Saxon history and culture. Cædmon does not destroy or ignore traditional Anglo-Saxon poetry. Instead, he converts it into something that helps the Church. Anglo-Saxon England finds ways to synthesize the religion of the Church with the existing [...] "northern" [...] customs and practices. Thus the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons was not just their switching from one practice to another, but making something new out of their old inheritance and their new belief and learning.|$|E
