5|$|A thunderstorm, also <b>known</b> as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm {{characterized by the}} presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, <b>known</b> as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud <b>known</b> as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, <b>known</b> as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, <b>known</b> as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
