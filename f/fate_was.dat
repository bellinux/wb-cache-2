5|$|Hess's flight, {{but not his}} {{destination}} or <b>fate,</b> <b>was</b> first {{announced by}} Munich Radio in Germany {{on the evening of}} 12 May. On 13 May Hitler sent Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to give the news in person to Mussolini, and the British press was permitted to release full information about events that same day. On 14 May Ilse Hess finally learned that her husband had survived the trip when news of his <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> broadcast on German radio.|$|E
5|$|Humphreys's <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> sealed {{when the}} Confederate en echelon attack {{continued}} and his front and right flank {{began to be}} assaulted by the Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson on Cemetery Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Captives {{taken by}} American Indians during the American Revolution might be ransomed by the British in Detroit, adopted into the tribe, enslaved, or simply killed. However, after the Gnadenhütten massacre, the Ohio Indians had {{resolved}} to kill all American prisoners who fell into their hands. The number of Americans executed after the Sandusky expedition is unknown, since their <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> usually recorded only {{if one of}} the prisoners survived to tell.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the hand}} of <b>fate</b> <b>is</b> symbolized by the eclipse, giving some {{implications}} that Hester's <b>fate</b> <b>is</b> inescapable and will live with the label she has in her blood.|$|R

5000|$|The oldest {{version of}} Sleeping Beauty {{that has been}} {{preserved}} is Sun, Moon, and Talia from Giambattista Basile's Pentamerone. [...] This version does not feature any fairy godmothers; Talia's <b>fate</b> <b>is</b> prophesied, but Talia's <b>fate</b> <b>is</b> not caused by witchcraft.|$|R
5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} {{also showed that}} {{restarting}} the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, {{it was impossible to}} prevent the ship from sinking — her <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain.|$|E
5|$|The ship, {{now under}} British command with German crewmembers on board, was {{overhauled}} in Wilhelmshaven in June 1945, while her <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> determined. She was initially allocated to Great Britain {{at the end}} of 1945 and sailed to Rosyth in mid-January. In the meantime, France had protested and she was given Theodor Riedel and three other destroyers. The ships were formally handed over at Cherbourg on 4 February 1946 and renamed Kléber, after General Jean Baptiste Kléber.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served during World War I. Moltke {{participated in}} several major battles {{with the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet, {{including}} the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea, and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea. At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 to prevent their seizure by the Allies.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War in 1918, eleven battleships of the , , and es and {{all five}} battlecruisers, along with a number of light cruisers and destroyers, were interned in Scapa Flow, while their <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} in the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles. The Nassau and s were left in Germany. Following the scuttling of the German fleet in June 1919, all four ships were allotted to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the scuttled ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan, Britain received Westfalen and Posen, and Rheinland was sold directly to the breakers at Dordrecht. Between 1920 and 1924, Westfalen was scrapped at Birkenhead and the remaining ships were scrapped at Dordrecht.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, new {{evidence}} concerning {{the murder of}} Luke Doggett came to light. Doggett sought Follmer's assistance because he had worked against organized crime in New York City before coming to Washington. Reyes, however, recalled seeing Follmer accept a bribe from a mobster. Although he tried to play the event off as him paying an informant (at which he nearly succeeded), the truth was as Reyes suspected: Follmer was crooked. Once the truth of Luke's <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> revealed, Follmer killed the mobster who had nevertheless threatened blackmail concerning Follmer's bribe acceptance. Follmer's future at the FBI was left unresolved, although he most likely faced criminal charges for his actions.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Ladies of the Thistle {{may also}} be {{admitted}} to the Order of the Garter. Formerly, many, but not all, Knights elevated to the senior Order would resign from the Order of the Thistle. The first to resign from the Order of the Thistle was John, Duke of Argyll in 1710; the last to take such an action was Thomas, Earl of Zetland in 1872. Knights and Ladies of the Thistle {{may also be}} deprived of their knighthoods. The only individual to have suffered such a <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who lost both the knighthood and the earldom after participating in the Jacobite rising of 1715.|$|E

5|$|Mercyful Fate {{were a part}} of {{the first}} wave of black metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped {{establish}} the style upon which future black metal artists would later build. Unlike the other first wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful <b>Fate</b> <b>was</b> a pioneer in developing black metal, although their musical style was not as much an influence as that of other first wave bands.|$|E
5|$|News of the Donner Party's <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> spread eastward by Samuel Brannan, {{an elder}} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and journalist, who {{ran into the}} salvage party as they {{came down from the}} pass with Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily {{influenced}} by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news of the tragedy was buried in small paragraphs despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic exaggerated detail. In some print accounts, the members of the Donner Party were depicted as heroes, and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Germany, the {{question}} became {{what to do with}} the ships of the High Seas Fleet. Because no neutral nation wanted to host the rebellious sailors of the mutinous armada, the Allies eventually decided to have the force interned at Scapa Flow, with the guns of the Grand Fleet's ships nearby in case of any attempt at a break-out. On 15 November, Beatty met with Hipper's representative, Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer, to arrange the surrender of the German ships. Meurer agreed to surrender to Beatty in the Firth of Forth. From there, the German vessels would proceed to Scapa Flow, until their ultimate <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> decided by the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E

5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (89.6%), while minorities include Serbs (4.5%) and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each) recognised by the Constitution of Croatia. The demographic history of Croatia {{is marked by}} significant migrations, including: the Croats' arrival in the area; {{the growth of the}} Hungarian and German speaking population after the personal union of Croatia and Hungary; joining of the Habsburg Empire; migrations set off by the Ottoman conquests; and the growth of the Italian-speaking population in Istria and Dalmatia during the Venetian rule there. After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced out or fled during the last part of and after World War II, and a similar <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> suffered by the Italian population. The late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by urbanisation. The most recent significant migrations came {{as a result of the}} Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced.|$|E

5|$|In Western European {{medieval and}} Renaissance {{versions}} of the legend, Troilus is the youngest of Priam's five legitimate sons by Hecuba. Despite his youth {{he is one of}} the main Trojan war leaders. He dies in battle at Achilles' hands. In a popular addition to the story, originating in the 12th century, Troilus falls in love with Cressida, whose father has defected to the Greeks. Cressida pledges her love to Troilus but she soon switches her affections to the Greek hero Diomedes when sent to her father in a hostage exchange. Chaucer and Shakespeare are among the authors who wrote works telling the story of Troilus and Cressida. Within the medieval tradition, Troilus was regarded as a paragon of the faithful courtly lover and also of the virtuous pagan knight. Once the custom of courtly love had faded, his <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> regarded less sympathetically.|$|E
5|$|In late May {{and early}} June 1942, during World War II, {{submarines}} {{belonging to the}} Imperial Japanese Navy {{made a series of}} attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. On the night of 31 May – 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki-class midget submarines, each with a two-member crew, entered Sydney Harbour, avoided the partially constructed Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net, and attempted to sink Allied warships. Two of the midget submarines were detected and attacked before they could successfully engage any Allied vessels, and the crews scuttled their boats and killed themselves. These submarines were later recovered by the Allies. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser , but instead sank the converted ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors. This midget submarine's <b>fate</b> <b>was</b> unknown until 2006, when amateur scuba divers discovered the wreck off Sydney's northern beaches.|$|E
