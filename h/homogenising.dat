500|$|The use of sandbox {{applications}} like Garry's Mod {{have allowed}} for Combine non-player characters {{to be used}} in a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. The combine are also referenced in the Portal (series). In one webcomic, Concerned, the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon Frohman, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles. In another example, the machinima series Combine Nation follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to police procedural documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with adhesive bandages and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing flashbangs, which often backfire on him. Another web series, called The Combine, parodies the TV show The Office. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a webfilter so they can watch videos online instead of working. Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the live-action video The Combine Interview, which parodies an interview with Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The video, described by ActionTrip as [...] "eerie, to say the least" [...] and by both Joystiq and Kotaku as [...] "creepy", instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme. PC Gamer UK noted that [...] "the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology's purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the <b>homogenising</b> intergalactic murderous alien collective".|$|E

The use of homogenisation in cheesemaking is limited due to the deleterious impact on cheese quality. The objective {{was to investigate the}} effects of a pre-processing routine (homogenisation of raw milk, incubation and pasteurisation) on the resultant cheese. Pilot- and laboratory-scale Cheddar cheeses were produced where raw bovine milk was <b>homogenised</b> at various pressures (0, 5 and 10  MPa in the pilot-scale and 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25  MPa in the laboratory-scale trial), incubated at 37  °C for 1  h and batch-pasteurised at 63  °C for 30  min. A control milk was not <b>homogenised.</b> Acid degree value increased with increasing homogenisation pressure. Moisture and salt contents were higher in cheeses made with milk <b>homogenised</b> at 5 and 10  MPa, as was pH. The cheese made from milk <b>homogenised</b> at 10  MPa contained the highest level of FFA initially and throughout ripening. Breakdown of αs 1 -casein was more extensive in cheese made from non-homogenised milks and breakdown of β-casein was more extensive in <b>homogenised</b> milk cheeses.

40|$|Adobe masonry {{is largely}} used as {{construction}} material worldwide and the mechanical modelling of adobe structures {{is a key}} issue. This work deals with 2 -D micromechanical analysis of two component adobe masonry (i. e. composite system composed of adobe bricks and mortar joints), focusing {{on the influence of}} different bond configurations and loading schemes. Homogenization is applied by defining a periodic unit cell for each of the investigated bond schemes and by deriving global failure curves, based on failure criteria of both mortar and bricks. Experimental tests showed bi-modularity (i. e. different Young modulus in compression and tension) for both mortar and bricks, so this feature of elastic behaviour was taken into account in micromodelling. The results are twofold: for each bond scheme, critical curves in the principal stress plane are derived for the <b>homogenised</b> unit cell, and the relationships between the <b>homogenised</b> elastic moduli and the loading angle is obtained. Micromechanical analysis provided a major difference between <b>homogenised</b> elastic behaviour in tension and in compression.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is a study of homogenisation problems in electromagnetics and elasticity with potential applications {{to the development of}} metamaterials. In Chapter 1, I study the leading order frequency approximations of the quasi-static Maxwell equations on the torus. A higher-order asymptotic regime is used to derive a higher-order <b>homogenised</b> equation for the solution of an elliptic second-order partial differential equation. The equivalent variational approach to this problem is studied which leads to an equivalent higher-order <b>homogenised</b> equation. Finally, the derivation of higher-order constitutive laws relating the fields to their inductions is presented. In Chapter 2, I study the governing equations of linearised elasticity where the periodic composite material of interest is made up of a "critically" scaled "stiff" rod framework with the voids in between filled in with a "soft" material which is in high-contrast with the stiff material. Using results from two-scale convergence theory, a well posed <b>homogenised</b> model is presented with features reminiscent of both high-contrast and thin structure <b>homogenised</b> models with the additional feature of a linking relation of Wentzell type. The spectrum of the limiting operator is investigated and the establishment of the convergence of spectra from the initial problem is derived. In the final chapter, I investigate brie y three additional homogenisation problems. In the first problem, I study a periodic dielectric composite and show that there exists a critical scaling between the material parameter of the soft inclusion and the period of the composite. In the second problem, I use of two-scale convergence theory to derive a <b>homogenised</b> model for Maxwell's equations on thin rod structures and in the final problem I study Maxwell's equations in R^ 3 under a chiral transformation of the coordinates and derive a <b>homogenised</b> model in this special geometry...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of populism is its invocation of a common, external threat or enemy. The <b>homogenising,</b> unifying effect of this invocation is what produces the mythical - but more importantly reactionary and invariably exclusionary - notion of [...] "the people" [...] that is so central to the populist gesture. Swyngedouw shows that in climate politics [...] "the people" [...] becomes a united [...] "humanity" [...] facing a common predicament, regardless of the differentiated responsibility for and capacity to respond to anthropogenic climate change. Following other scholars who have analysed the alarmist tone of climate discourse, Swyngedouw also underlines that the millenarian, apocalyptic imaginaries called forth by the latter create an external threat, while also giving way to an elite-led, almost crusade-like action (the latter being a further classic feature of populism).

In a 'homogenised' model however, the length scale of each cell is assumed infinitely small while the population of cells are assumed infinitely large, so that the microscopic spatial dynamics of individual cells are unaccounted for. We wish to show in our study, our hypothesis that the <b>homogenised</b> modelling approach for a particular system can be used to replicate observations of the discrete modelling approach for the same system.

40|$|<b>Homogenised</b> {{constitutive}} {{laws are}} largely {{used to predict}} the behaviour of composite structures. Assessing the validity of such <b>homogenised</b> models {{can be done by}} making use of the concept of ``modelling error''. First, a microscopic ``faithful'' -and potentially intractable- model of the structure is defined. Then, one tries to quantify the effect of the homogenisation procedure on a result that would be obtained by directly using the ``faithful'' model. Such an approach requires (a) the ``faithful'' model to be more representative of the physical phenomena of interest than the <b>homogenised</b> model and (b) a reliable approximation of the result obtained using the "faithful" and intractable model to be available at cheap costs. We focus here on point (b), and more precisely on the extension of the techniques developed in [3][2] to estimate the error due to the homogenisation of linear, spatially random composite materials. Particularly, we will approximate the unknown probability density function by bounding its first moment. In this paper, we will present this idea in more detail, displaying the numerical efficiencies and computational costs related to the error estimation. The fact that the probability density function is uniform is exploited to greatly reduce the computational cost.
