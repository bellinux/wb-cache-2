5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|After <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{half months}} of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He {{was surprised to find}} seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

5|$|Her {{husband was}} removed from office by the Texas Secession Convention for refusing to swear loyalty to the Confederacy. Margaret became a war-time mother, whose eldest son joined the Confederate Army and was taken {{prisoner}} at the Battle of Shiloh. Her husband died {{before the end of}} the war. In her few remaining years, she became the keeper of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer. When she died of yellow fever <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years later, Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in Huntsville for fear of contamination, and was instead interred next to her mother on private property.|$|E
5|$|Identified as {{a future}} Test prospect, he was {{selected}} in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team {{at the start of}} the 1958–59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, 1994, Chris Lord, an {{individual}} {{associated with the}} Volksfront and American Front, fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple, damaging the interior. The attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of Eugene's Jewish community, including a lesbian. Community organizations, including a local gay rights group, responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during Passover services. Lord and an associate were caught and convicted, and Lord was sentenced to <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Playing a {{physical}} style again {{took its toll}} on Roberts' upper body, and he required surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, he missed the first <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory {{started on}} June 21, 2004 at Pinewood Studios in England. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman found filming somewhat difficult {{because they were}} simultaneously working on Corpse Bride. The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989). The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras. The Chocolate Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half hours a day, filming for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years.|$|E
