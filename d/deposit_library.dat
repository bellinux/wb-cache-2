25|$|The {{university}} library {{was founded by}} King James VI in 1612, with the donation of 350 works from the royal collection, {{at the urging of}} George Gledstanes, the then chancellor of St Andrews, although the libraries of the colleges of St Leonard's College, St Salvator's College and St Mary's College had existed prior to this. From 1710 to 1837 the library functioned as a legal <b>deposit</b> <b>library,</b> and as a result has an extensive collection of 18th century literature.|$|E
25|$|Cambridge {{is formed}} {{from a variety}} of {{institutions}} which include 31 constituent colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools. Cambridge University Press, a department of the university, is the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum, as well as a botanic garden.

As a legal <b>deposit</b> <b>library,</b> the National Library is entitled to request a copy of every work published in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This has allowed the Library to collect modern Welsh, Irish and Gaelic language books for its Celtic collection. The acquisition of material through legal deposit has been supplemented by purchases, international exchanges, donations and bequests.|$|E

50|$|The 2003 Act also {{inserted}} various {{exceptions to}} copyright and database {{right into the}} Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 to prevent the use of non-print publications by <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries</b> infringing copyright and/or database rights. However, the 2003 Act enabled regulations to be made restricting the exceptions to copyright for non-print publications so that deposited works may not be copied more freely than an equivalent work available at an ordinary library. Various exemptions from liability against breach of contract; infringement of copyright, database right or publication right; criminal liability or damages for defamation were also enacted by the 2003 Act to protect <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries</b> using works and publishers sending works to <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries</b> from actions for breach of those liabilities that could otherwise occur.|$|R

In addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library possesses more than 100,000 books. Furthermore, every college has a library as well, partially {{for the purposes of}} undergraduate teaching, and the older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library has more than 200,000 books printed before 1800, while Corpus Christi College's Parker Library possesses one of the greatest collections of medieval manuscripts in the world, with over 600 manuscripts.|$|E

40|$|Legal deposit is an {{obligation}} to deposit publications with specified depositories. The purpose of legal deposit is to preserve and provide long-term access to the national intellectual heritage.

The aim {{of this research was}} to: explore the potential issues related to the extension of UK legal deposit to digital publications and identify the implications for existing legal deposit arrangements. The research was based on Soft Systems Methodology. Data was gathered through two rounds of interviews with stakeholder groups, including legal <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries,</b> publishers, government and technical experts. Preservation is accepted as the main purpose of legal deposit, but there is some tension and lack of trust between publishers and legal <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries</b> on access to legal deposit collections. The new UK legal deposit law is enabling only; implementation will require further regulations that will be subject to detailed consultation and negotiation. While there has been a voluntary scheme in place for some time in the UK, the research found a lack of readiness amongst the UK legal <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries.</b> They still had to develop cooperative arrangements between themselves and publishers; policies, procedures, especially for online publications; and did not have all the necessary technical infrastructure in place. The deposit of digital publications is an extra role for legal <b>deposit</b> <b>libraries</b> and {{it is not clear that}} they will receive extra funding, as is the case in some other countries. There is currently no full-scale fully functional digital legal deposit system in the world.
