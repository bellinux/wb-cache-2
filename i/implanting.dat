40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{clinical}} performance of two dental <b>implant</b> types possessing a different macro-design in the in vivo pig model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium AadvaTM <b>implants</b> (GC, Tokyo, Japan) were compared with OsseoSpeedTM <b>implants</b> (Astra, Mölndal, Sweden), with the Aadva <b>implant</b> displaying significant larger inter-thread dimensions than the OsseoSpeed <b>implant.</b> <b>Implants</b> were installed in the parietal bone of 12 domestic pigs and left for healing for either 1 or 3 months. <b>Implant</b> osseointegration was evaluated by quantitative histology (bone volume relative to the tissue volume [BV/TV]; bone-to-implant contact [BIC]) for distinct <b>implant</b> regions (collar, body, total <b>implant</b> length) with specific <b>implant</b> thread features. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric test with α[*]=[*] 0. 05 was performed. RESULTS: An inferior amount of bone enveloping the Aadva <b>implant</b> compared with the OsseoSpeed <b>implant</b> was observed, in particular at the <b>implant</b> body part with its considerable inter-thread gaps (p[*]<[*]. 05). Concomitantly, the Aadva macro-design negatively affected the amount of bone in direct contact with the <b>implant</b> for this specific <b>implant</b> part (p[*]<[*]. 05), and resulted in an overall impaired <b>implant</b> osseointegration at the initial healing stage (total <b>implant</b> length; 1 -month healing; p[*]<[*]. 05). CONCLUSION: Although the Aadva <b>implant</b> displayed a clinically acceptable level of osseointegration, the findings demonstrate that <b>implant</b> macro-design features can impact the dynamics of <b>implant</b> osseointegration. Consideration of specific <b>implant</b> macro-design features should be made relative to the biological and mechanical microenvironment. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Unbinilium has not {{yet been}} synthesized, despite {{multiple}} attempts from German and Russian teams. One 2011 attempt from the German team had a suggestive but not conclusive result suggesting the possible production of 299Ubn, but there were several inconsistencies with the theoretically expected decay energies and half-lives of 299Ubn and its daughters and the <b>implanting</b> compound nucleus and evaporation residue could not be identified with certainty. Planned attempts from Russian, Japanese, and French teams are scheduled for 2017–2020. Experimental evidence from these attempts show that the period 8 elements will likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the previous known elements, and that unbinilium may even be the last element that can be synthesized with current technology. Its position as the seventh alkaline earth metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbinilium is expected to be less reactive than barium and radium and be closer in behavior to strontium, and while it should show the characteristic +2 oxidation state of the alkaline earth metals, it is also predicted to show the +4 oxidation state unknown in any other alkaline earth metal.|$|E
30|$|Successful <b>implant</b> {{placement}} {{is dependent}} on the achievement and maintenance of osseointegration [30]. Early studies with <b>implant</b> treatment relied on the placement of <b>implants</b> followed by healing period of 3 to 6  months during which the <b>implants</b> were protected from externally applied forces [31 – 34]. With the development of new <b>implant</b> types, surface technology, and advanced knowledge about the physiology of osseointegration, the requirement for delayed restoration of dental <b>implants</b> has been challenged [35 – 38]. However, <b>implants</b> placed in augmented sinus are different from conventional <b>implants.</b> Therefore, the timing of the <b>implant</b> loading is important for survival of <b>implant</b> placed in augmented sinus. Lang et al. [39] suggested that timing of sinus elevation and <b>implant</b> placement in relation to <b>implant</b> survival is affected by time of <b>implant</b> loading. Their results showed that <b>implants</b> that were immediately loaded regardless of the timing of the sinus elevation showed greater failure rates than <b>implants</b> in augmented bone that received a delayed loading protocol or those that were loaded immediately in sites that did not require a bone augmentation procedure. In this study, we applied the load on <b>implant</b> at least 5  months after <b>implant</b> placement and there was no failure.|$|R
25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous <b>implants</b> {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the <b>implant.</b> Wrapping these <b>implants</b> allows {{attachment}} of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve <b>implant</b> movement and reduce the incidence of <b>implant</b> migration. Porous <b>implants</b> may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the <b>implant,</b> these <b>implants</b> are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the <b>implant</b> in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous <b>implants.</b> The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene <b>implants</b> either by passing the suture through the <b>implant</b> material or by using an <b>implant</b> with fabricated suture tunnels.

ResultsMean ISQ value for all 162 <b>implants</b> was 79. 09 (5. 97). Statistically significant differences were noted between mean ISQ value of SLA and modSLA <b>implants</b> (76. 92 vs. 80. 80). Also significantly lower mean ISQ values have been recorded for 8 mm length <b>implants</b> compared to 10 mm length <b>implants</b> in the SLA group (74. 15 vs. 79. 57).

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the failure rates of <b>implants</b> with either a {{machined}} surface or a TiUnite surface used to replace failing <b>implants.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of 578 patients, ie, of all patients who were treated at the Department of Periodontology of the University Hospital in Leuven by means of oral <b>implants</b> during 3 recent consecutive years, were analyzed. The <b>implants</b> included in the study had an observation time ranging from 9 to 49 months. All patients had been provided with Brånemark System <b>implants.</b> Only 2 types of <b>implant</b> surfaces were used: machined and TiUnite. Data collection and analysis focused on the replacement <b>implants,</b> ie, <b>implants</b> placed at sites where the original <b>implants</b> had failed. Data were statistically analyzed by means of Statistica for Windows Software version 5. 1; a Fisher exact P test was used. The level of significance was set at P =. 05. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients experienced the nonintegration of 58 <b>implants.</b> Of those, 29 <b>implants</b> with a machined surface were replaced by <b>implants</b> with the same surface. Six of the replacement <b>implants</b> failed. Nineteen machined-surface <b>implants</b> were replaced by TiUnite surface implants; 1 failed. Ten TiUnite-surface <b>implants</b> were replaced by <b>implants</b> with the same surface; none failed. The difference in failure rate between machined-surface replacement <b>implants</b> and TiUnite replacement <b>implants</b> was statistically significant (P =. 05). DISCUSSION: In addition to the usual patient-related compromising factors, replacement of a failing <b>implant</b> involves the challenge of achieving osseointegration in a nonpristine bone site. In the present study, <b>implants</b> with TiUnite surfaces were associated with fewer failures than machined-surface <b>implants</b> under the same conditions. CONCLUSION: An improved <b>implant</b> surface such as TiUnite may offer a better prognosis when a failed <b>implant</b> has to be replaced at the same site. status: publishe...|$|R

Results: Stress in the periodontal ligament (PDL) of the first premolar teeth ranged between 0. 133 MPa in 10 mm <b>implants</b> with 15 ° angle and 0. 248 MPa in 7 mm <b>implants</b> with 0 ° angle. The minimum stress was noted in <b>implants</b> with 10 mm length with 0 ° angle (19. 33 MPa) while maximum stress (25. 78 MPa) was found in <b>implants</b> with 10 mm length and 15 ° angle. In <b>implants</b> with 7 mm length, {{with an increase in}} <b>implant</b> angle, the stress on <b>implants</b> gradually increased. In <b>implants</b> with 10 mm length, increasing the <b>implant</b> angle gradually increased the stress on <b>implants.</b> Conclusion: Not only the length of <b>implant</b> but also the angle of implantation are important to minimize stress on <b>implants.</b> The results showed that vertical <b>implant</b> placement results in lower stress on <b>implants</b> and by increasing the angle, distribution of stress gradually increases.

The following data were collected: type of <b>implants</b> (saline or silicone), duration of implantation, type of <b>implant</b> shell, degree of capsular contracture, associated symptoms, cause of rupture, diagnostic tools, and management. ResultsForty-five Saline <b>implants</b> and 27 silicone <b>implants</b> were used. Rupture was diagnosed at a mean of 5. 6 and 12 years after insertion of saline and silicone <b>implants,</b> respectively. There was no association between shell type and risk of rupture.
