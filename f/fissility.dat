What we know experimentally and theoretically on the nuclear structure of SHE is reported in a first section. The making of the elements with an analysis of production cross sections and its macroscopic limitation to Z = 112 + #epsilon# is presented in a second section. The break-down of fusion cross sections in the ''Coulomb Falls'' within a range of about 10 elements is introduced as the universal limiting phenomenon. How the nuclear structure of the collision partners modifies the on-set of this limitation is presented in section 3. Reactions induced by deformed nuclei are pushed by side collisions to higher excitation energies (4 n-and 5 n-channels), whereas reactions driven by the cluster-like, closed-shell nuclei, " 2 " 0 " 8 _ 1 _ 2 _ 6 Pb and " 1 " 3 " 8 _ 8 _ 2 Ba, are kept at low excitation energies (1 n- and 2 n-channels).

First chance fission cross sections trends of Pa are based on consistent description of 232 Th(n,F), 232 Th(n, 2 n) and 238 U(n,F), 238 U(n,xn) data, supported by the ratio surrogate data by Burke et al., 2006, for the 237 U(n,F) reaction. Ratio surrogate data on fission probabilities of 232 Th(6 Li, 4 He) 234 Pa and 232 Th(6 Li,d) 236 U by Nayak et al., 2008, support the predicted 233 Pa(n, F) cross section at En= 11. 5 - 16. 5 MeV. The predicted trends of 230 - 232 Pa(n, F) cross section up to En= 20 MeV, are consistent with <b>fissilities</b> of Pa nuclides, extracted by 232 Th(p,F) (Isaev et al., 2008) and 232 Th(p, 3 n) (Morgenstern et al., 2008) data analysis. The excitation energy and nucleon composition dependence of the transition from asymmetric to symmetric scission for fission observables of Pa nuclei is defined by analysis of p-induced fission of 232 Th at Ep= 1 - 200 MeV. Predominantly symmetric fission in 232 Th(p,F) at En(p) = 200 MeV as revealed by experimental branching ratios (Dujvestijn et al., 1999) is reproduced. Steep transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission with increase of nucleon incident energy is due to fission of neutron-deficient Pa (A≤ 229) nuclei. A structure of the potential energy surface (a drop of f f symmetric and asymmetric fission barriers difierence (EfSYM - EfASYM) from ~ 3. 5 MeV to ~ 1 MeV) of N-deficient Pa nuclides (A≤ 226) and available phase space at outer fission saddles, are shown {{to be responsible for}} the sharp increase with En(p) of the symmetric fission component contribution for 232 Th(p,F) and 230 - 233 Pa(n, F) reactions. That is a strong evidence of emissive fission nature of moderately excited Pa nuclides, reliably quantified only up to En(p) ~ 20 (30) MeV. Predicted fission cross section of 232 Pa(n,F) coincides with that of 232 Th(p,F) at En(p) ≥ 80 MeV, that means that entrance channel dependence of fission cross section with increase of nucleon incident energy diminishes...|$|R
