5000|$|Artist Patrick J. Reynolds {{was born}} in New Orleans in 1963 where he began his long and {{distinguished}} career. At age 11 he began winning awards and receiving {{the respect of the}} elite of the art world. Having unlimited styles at his disposal in the art community of New Orleans, Patrick decided early on to not conform to any of them, Instead, carving out his own way creating a style never before seen.Today, Patrick is the only artist in the United States to maintain graphite block and limestone suspended in oil. As he developed the medium over time, graphite figurative romanticism was born. And one could easily say that his art will be carved into the history books and studied for generations to come.Today, Patrick pushes the envelope of his style, forever exploring the stories that can be told through art. The signature style remains evident in every new layout drawing or final masterpiece. [...] "The passion is the same" [...] says Patrick. [...] "It's a burning desire to begin a piece that has already been completed in my head. It must materialize, it must come to life."."Fanciful or not, the winged beings tell the tales that course through Reynolds' soul and spring from his fingertips." [...] Says [...]Patrick begins his pieces by grinding graphite and limestone into boiled linseed oil and varying thickness on his palette. He then uses a brush to swirl the mixture onto the board creating both texture and form. The result becomes a rock hard fine art that will last for centuries.Art collectors {{from all walks of life}} describe the work as moving, and that is what it is intended to do, move you. Rarely, if ever, does it match the couch or the curtains. Patrick's work falls into the category of generational collections. Found in some of the most prestigious corporate and family collections in the world.As a published author, of his art and writings such as Principals of Peace, Patrick continues work on new projects such as Journey of Dreams, a new book <b>due</b> <b>out</b> <b>this</b> summer, and Tears of a Dreamer, a book based on the philosophies of Patrick Reynolds works. Known for painting notable art works as [...] "Heavens Hues America". An angel bows her head over an American flag and weeps.

40|$|The {{organic foods}} {{industry}} is booming: by one estimate, {{the market for}} organic foods is worth $ 4 billion annually {{and is expected to}} grow at a rate of more than 24 % per year. Faced with the threat of pesticide exposures and other food safety problems, many consumers are turning to organic foods in hopes of finding a healthy alternative, but there is currently no consistency in organic food labeling and no guarantee that foods labeled as organic are actually grown and processed in a purely organic fashion. There is also controversy about whether the label "organic" covers such new technologies as irradiation and genetic engineering. As part of the 1990 Farm Bill, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working to develop a proposed rule on organic foods. The rule would regulate the allowable methods, practices, and substances used in producing and handling crops and their processed products. The first draft of the proposed rule, released in December 1997, met with unprecedented opposition, which centered around the fact that the proposal appeared to virtually ignore the recommendations of a standards board formed to assist in the rule's development. Other criticism opposed three practices put forward for comment by the USDA: irradiation, genetic engineering, and the use of sewage sludge in farming. Due to the vehemence of the opposition to its original proposal, the USDA has decided to rewrite the proposed rule. In preparation for that proposal, the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service released three issue papers in October 1998 for public comment. The 10, 000 -plus comments received in response to those papers will be incorporated into the second draft proposal, <b>due</b> <b>out</b> later <b>this</b> year...|$|R
