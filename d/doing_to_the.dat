His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example.

Even {{those who could not}} physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E
25|$|The damage George Holloway was <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Head and the {{coastline}} became apparent and local opposition grew. There was also some dispute {{as to whether}} he had violated the terms of his lease. Even so, {{by the time he was}} stopped in 1867, a third of the Head had been removed or lost through increased erosion and his mine had almost cut through to the sea beyond. Removal of the ironstone doggers on the sea side of the Head caused the Spit at the Harbour entrance to grow in length, extending to Steamer point by 1890. A long groyne had to be constructed to take the place of the missing doggers and check the erosion. In 1930, after Christchurch Council had refused to meet the asking price, Hengistbury Head (then in private ownership) was sold to Bournemouth for £25,000.|$|E

The Corps was responsible for constructing more than [...] of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C), run by {{former members of the}} Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. [...] "What a liar I turned out to be!" [...] remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, [...] "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they take it out on us by playing with cement".|$|E

500|$|The {{book is a}} travelogue and {{biological}} record, but also reveals the two men's philosophies: it dwells on the place of humans in the environment, the interconnection between single organisms and the larger ecosystem, and the themes of leaving and returning home. A number of ecological concerns, rare in 1940, are voiced, such as an imagined but horrific vision of the long term damage that the Japanese bottom fishing trawlers are <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea bed. Although written {{as if it were}} the journal kept by Steinbeck during the voyage, the book is to some extent a work of fiction: the journals are not Steinbeck's, and his wife, who had accompanied him on the trip, is not mentioned (though at one point Steinbeck slips and mentions the matter of food for seven people). Since returning home is a theme throughout the narrative, the inclusion of his wife, a symbol of home, would have dissipated the effect. Steinbeck and Ricketts are never mentioned by name but are amalgamated into the first person [...] "we" [...] who narrate the log.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case has a knack for bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations".|$|E
500|$|Raj Lyubov is the {{anthropologist}} in the colony, a scholar {{who holds the}} honorary rank of [...] "captain". He is depicted as being from an Indian heritage. Selver is initially a servant in the central camp; Lyubov enlists him as an assistant, and builds a relationship of trust with him. The two of them compile a dictionary of the Athshean and Terran languages. When Selver's wife Thele is raped and killed by Davidson, Selver attacks Davidson, who nearly kills him; Lyubov rescues Selver, and nurses him back to health. During {{the attack on the}} colony's headquarters, Selver tells the Athsheans to leave Lyubov's house alone, but Lyubov leaves his house and is killed by a collapsing building. As he dies, Lyubov warns Selver {{about the impact of the}} killings on the Athshean society. In comparison to Davidson, Lyubov reflects a lot upon his actions, and tries to analyze them in a detached manner. His contradictory position of being a colonial officer despite recognizing the damage that the colony is <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Athsheans gives him migraines. He feels a strong sense of guilt at the impacts of the colony, and is willing to destroy his own reputation in order to protect the Athshean people. He is one of the only Terrans to treat the Athsheans as human beings, although this loses him the respect of his fellow Terrans.|$|E

500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio, this time at Vanguard Studios in New York City, between July and September 1967. When [...] "Superbird", a tune mocking President Lyndon Johnson, was not banned from radio promotion, the band was given the go-ahead to record [...] "The Fish Cheer", which saw the group {{moving away from the}} original folk composition toward electric instrumentals more synthesized toward psychedelia. The song became the title track of the band's second album, I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die, released in November 1967. The album was not as successful as its predecessor, but still charted at number 67. The composition represented growing anti-war sentiment expressed by those opposing the Vietnam War, and is often {{considered one of the most}} recognized and celebrated protest songs of the era. [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was also pivotal in communicating the attitude against the war, but was set apart from other anti-war songs for its use of sarcastic humor and satire on the controversial conflict. Writer Lee Andresen reflects on the song's meaning, saying, [...] "the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to historians David Bankier and Hans Mommsen a through {{knowledge}} of the Holocaust was well within {{the reach of the}} German bishops, if they wanted to find out. According to historian Michael Phayer, [...] "a number of bishops did want to know, and they succeeded very early on in discovering what their government was <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jews in occupied Poland". Wilhelm Berning, for example, knew about the systematic nature of the Holocaust as early as February 1942, only one month after the Wannsee Conference. Most German Church historians believe that the church leaders knew of the Holocaust by the end of 1942, knowing more than any other church leaders outside the Vatican.|$|E

Although this song was not on music charts probably because it was too radical, it was performed at many public events including the famous Woodstock music festival (1969). [...] "Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag" [...] was a song that used sarcasm to communicate the problems with not only the war but also the public's naïve attitudes towards it. It was said that [...] "the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{difference from the}} original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who {{is a much more}} important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question [...] "What are we <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> children?" [...] At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became [...] "in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy." ...|$|E

The company partnered with Colony Capital, a private equity firm, in its bid. [...] The Trump Organization bid pledged to spend $200 million to turn the structure into a 250-room (later sources said 261-room) luxury hotel. Much of the investment would be in cash, not debt. The hotel would include a conference center, spa, three high-end restaurants, and a [...] meeting and banquet facility. The company also pledged to create a small museum dedicated {{to the history of}} the building and the Bells of Congress, and to maintain the historic exterior. The Trump Organization also tentatively agreed to pay GSA $3 million a year in rent. The Trump Organization bid touted the involvement of Arthur Cotton Moore, a noted local architect who had renovated historic buildings in the area before and who had helped design the Old Post Office Building renovations in the 1970s. Moore left the effort within less than a year for health reasons.
