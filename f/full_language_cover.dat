40|$|Abstract—Model Driven Development (MDD) {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} a mainstream {{practice for the}} development of complex aerospace systems. UML has emerged as the de facto standard for modeling languages, supporting a wide range of modeling aspects and refinement levels. As a consequence, models can easily become too complex for manual verification and simple static analysis. 12 This paper describes an approach to using the Java™ Pathfinder (JPF) software model checker to systematically verify UML state charts. While state machines in general are amenable to model checking, embedded actions and guards in UML state charts are not, since they require execution and analysis of a <b>full</b> programming <b>language</b> to <b>cover</b> the whole model behavior.

2500|$|In non-signing communities, home sign {{is not a}} <b>full</b> <b>language,</b> but {{closer to}} a pidgin. Home sign is {{amorphous}} and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on {{from one generation to}} the next. Where they are passed on, creolization would be expected to occur, resulting in a <b>full</b> <b>language.</b> [...] However, home sign may also be closer to <b>full</b> <b>language</b> in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various Australian Aboriginal sign languages and gestural systems across West Africa, such as Mofu-Gudur in Cameroon.|$|R
