40|$|Abstract Health impact {{assessment}} (HIA) has been advanced {{as a means}} of bring-ing potential health impacts to the attention of policy makers, particularly in sectors where health impacts may not otherwise be considered. This article examines lessons for HIA in the United States from the related and relatively well-developed field of environmental {{impact assessment}} (EIA). We reviewed the EIA literature and con-ducted twenty phone interviews with EIA professionals. Successes of EIA cited by respondents included integration of environmental goals into decision making, im-proved planning, and greater transparency and public involvement. Reported short-comings included the length and complexity of <b>EIA</b> <b>documents,</b> limited and adver-sarial public participation, and an emphasis on procedure over substance. Presently, EIAs consider few, if any, health outcomes. Respondents differed on the prospects for HIA. Most agreed that HIA could contribute to EIA in several areas, including assess-ment of cumulative impacts and impacts to environmental justice. Reasons given for not incorporating HIA into EIA were uncertainties about interpreting estimated health impacts, that <b>EIA</b> <b>documents</b> would become even longer and more complicated, an...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate how far away health assessment stands from best practice, taking two departures points. The first one is a theoretical basis for advised practices in HIA that we propose from a literature review and compilation. This comprises 25 requirements for analysis, divided in three categories: theoretical lines of argumentation (biomedical/risk, promotion, and social/political features), broad measurability (which includes impacts magnitude and mitigation), and detailed measurability (going deep into biological, behavioral, circumstantial, environmental and institutional aspects). The second one is a set of six <b>EIAs</b> <b>documents</b> delivered by practitioners in Southern Brazil, that we take as a case study in order to assess their performance in relation to the international best practices outlined.

40|$|Biodiversity {{has become}} a central concern in {{environmental}} management. As such, {{it is crucial that}} it is included and fully considered in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This paper explores the definitions and perceptions of biodiversity, and the associated management implications, held by those involved in preparing and assessing <b>EIA</b> <b>documents</b> in Western Australia. This State has world-recognised biodiversity values and comprehensive impact assessment processes. These practitioners defined biodiversity in a range of ways from a very basic through to a sophisticated, extended definition. A range of approaches to its assessment was also evident. The most sophisticated practitioners placed biodiversity in its spatial and temporal context as well as being cognizant of community aspirations and the principle of net conservation benefit. The ability to properly consider biodiversity in EIA is dependent on good information, not only on flora and fauna but also on the concepts and processes associated with biodiversity. Clear policy directions, from the assessing authority, regarding the level and detail of assessment required, are also critical...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{achievement}} {{of sustainable development}} demands the integration of environment and development. To achieve sustainable development requires a close collaboration and cooperation between environmentalists and the decision-makers. The evidence is that in developing countries (Egypt, as an example) the gap is widening rather than closing. Intensive research programs are needed, for instance {{in the field of}} sustainable development and urban environmental management, to narrow that gap. Envi-ronmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has become a management tool for achieving acceptable forms of environmentally sound development and sustainability; at best it is proving nothing more than a permit to move a project ahead. It is recommended that indicators for sustainable development and their progress be fully monitored. Performance indicators should always be established, not only for project implementation, but also during and after the implementation process {{to make sure that all}} mitigation measures are satisfactorily imple-mented. This can be achieved by linking the license granting authority for action to the actual implemen-tation of these measures. To secure the environmental sustainability of an environmental project, it is also important to have the <b>EIA</b> <b>document</b> as an integral part of the license application document, and to make it available to inspectors during their necessarily frequent inspection visits...|$|R

This paper summarizes the legal and empirical research that underpinned {{the development of these}} protocols. Specifically: Section 1 describes the observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on the built environment and presents the rationale for incorporating climate risk assessments into project-level EIA. Section 2 outlines the legal requirements of NEPA and explains why the consideration of climate impacts falls squarely within the realm of the environmental analysis conducted by federal agencies under NEPA. Section 2 also briefly identifies other state, local, and foreign EIA laws which require consideration of climate change impacts on proposed projects. Section 3 reviews the existing guidelines for integrating climate impact and vulnerability assessments into <b>EIA</b> <b>documents,</b> including guidelines developed by governmental as well as non-governmental actors.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} by the long lasting media and politicians’ discussions about building the Nord Stream Pipeline in the Baltic Sea.

That is why, the main idea was to show that current environmental instruments and legislation are not strong enough to guarantee environment protection and rights of future generations, especially, where business and politics are involved. It would be ideal for a strong mechanism, controlling activities, to be created, which could prohibit excessively dangerous projects in global commons like the seas.

40|$|When {{the local}} {{authorities}} establish a plan for land use planning, they have to judge if the influence on the environment could be of such a grade {{that they have to}} make a special Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), following national laws and EU-directives. The laws for the process in Sweden is set by the Swedish Parliament, with advisory given by the central government authority, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, Boverket. For EU, the laws is set by the European Parliament and the Council. The laws and directions for this process have been changed for Sweden in recent years, and the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contents of three different Environmental Impact Assess¬ments to see if there has been any change in appearances and content in later years, as well as to see if different municipalities and authors have effect on the EIAs. According to different studies some of the EIA done are without insufficient focus on main environmental issues in the EIA, or even that some information is missing. In some studies there are arguments that the EIA should be a document that should be possible to read alone. These aspects has also been studied in the material. The result is partly described in a matrix where different criteria is compared between the three EIAs to spot differences easily. There is also a part where the content and structure of the three EIAs is compared in text. The result of the study was that there are big differences in structure, while their content has more in common. In one of the three Environ¬mental Impact Assessments much facts are only put in other documents. The conclusion of the study is that there is a need for implementing a common way of presenting the content of an EIA. There is a risk that facts are overlooked that are not presented in the <b>EIA</b> <b>document.</b> There is also a risk that {{the local authorities}} has too big interest in implementing the plan and that they make the EIA with a biased look.

40|$|Analysis of fecal {{glucocorticoid}} (GC) metabolites {{has recently}} become the standard method to monitor adrenocortical activity in primates noninvasively. However, given {{variation in the}} production, metabolism, and excretion of GCs across species and even between sexes, there are no standard methods that are universally applicable. In particular, {{it is important to}} validate assays intended to measure GC production, test extraction and storage procedures, and consider the time course of GC metabolite excretion relative to the production and circulation of the native hormones. This study examines these four methodological aspects of fecal GC metabolite analysis in tufted capuchins (Cebus apella). Specifically, we conducted an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) challenge on one male and one female capuchin to test the validity of four GC enzyme immunoassays (<b>EIAs)</b> and <b>document</b> the time course characterizing GC me- tabolite excretion in this species. In addition, we compare a common field-friendly technique for extracting fecal GC metabolites to an established laboratory extraction methodology and test for effects of storing “field extracts” for up to 1 yr. Results suggest that a corticosterone EIA is most sensitive to changes in GC production, provides reliable measures when extracted according to the field method, and measures GC metabolites which remain highly stable after even 12 mo of storage. Further, the time course of GC metabolite excretion is shorter than that described yet for any primate taxa. These results provide guidelines for studies of GCs in tufted capuchins, and underscore the importance of validating methods for fecal hormone analysis for each species of interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Head of Environmental Management Agency Decree 08 of 2000 (HEIMAD 8 / 2000), or the first guidelines concerning Public Involvement and Information Transparency in Indonesian EIA, {{is essential for the}} Indonesian EIA process. These participation guidelines require the local Environmental Impact Management Agencies (EIMAs) and proponents to inform the public about proposed projects, collect feedback, including written comments, through consultations, and embrace the public in <b>EIA</b> <b>document</b> reviews through their own representatives. Nevertheless, the performance of HEIMAD 08 of 2000 as the participation instrument for Indonesian EIA, in the context of indigenous peoples’ participation in the EIA decision-making process is rarely discussed. Therefore, investigations into the experience of indigenous peoples who get involved in Indonesian EIA practices need to be followed up to improve comprehension. In brief, this study aims to critically evaluate indigenous peoples’ participation in Indonesian EIA practices to improve and increase their involvement. To enable further understanding regarding their involvement in Indonesian EIA, this study starts by reviewing the participation guidelines. Initial reviews of the guidelines suggest that while indigenous people now have opportunities to engage in the EIA process, major inadequacies within the participation guidelines, that have the potential to hamper indigenous communities’ involvement, exist as well. To address the need for investigating indigenous participation in EIA practices, the study presented four case studies: (1) EIA of the BUS Coalmine project in Maybrat; (2) EIA of the MIL wood chip and pulp industry project in Merauke; (3) EIA of the ERII sago processing project in Nabire; and (4) EIA of the PPWD ring-road construction project taking place in the Jayapura region. All these projects are situated in the Papua or Papua Barat provinces and their EIA studies are required by legislation to involve local indigenous communities affected by them. Within the study, multiple qualitative methods such as document analysis, in-depth interviews of stakeholders, and direct observation of some indigenous participation activities were undertaken. Purposive sampling was used to select the informants. NVIVO 10 was used as well for data management and interpretation. Based on the evaluation of the case studies, this study reveals common patterns in indigenous participation. The participation process is often exclusive in character, as it primarily involved traditional landowner groups; other potentially affected stakeholders were rarely included or encouraged to get involved. In examining the enforcement of the participation guidelines, this study finds that not all of them were executed properly in the case studies. Inadequate information published in newspapers and broadcast during announcement stages, limited involvement of the affected communities in consultation forums, and the absence of formal appointments from the affected indigenous communities are the main examples of non-compliance issues identified in this area. In addition to the improper implementation of some of the provisions within the guidelines (non-compliance issues), this study also reveals that various operational issues (i. e. inappropriate public announcement approaches, the poor utilisation of written submissions, improper consultations, and the limited role of community representatives), coupled with the potential for future conflict also add to the complexity of indigenous community involvement. Although the participation guidelines, at a certain level, succeed in encouraging the involvement of indigenous communities in EIA processes, this study argues that the weak role of EIA institutions (local EIMAs) in enforcing those guidelines, coupled with the procedural gaps that exist within them, limit the benefit that can be derived from indigenous participation. Lessons from the case studies showed that a new approach for better indigenous participation is essential to ensure that indigenous communities have a strong voice in decisions that may impact their environment, culture and livelihoods. This study suggests that by complying with the participation guidelines, EIA institutions (EIMAs) can better fulfill the rights to participate for communities. In addition, improving the participation guidelines to embrace elements such as information access, indigenous capacity, time allocation and management, invitation mechanisms, access to EIA meeting venues, representative selection mechanisms, cultural influences, capacity improvement, and the mechanism for written submissions, is also critical for indigenous peoples’ participation...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{on-going}} exponential {{increase in}} development-induced disasters globally, especially in low and middle-income countries. This upward {{trend in the}} occurrence of development-induced disasters challenges sustainable development efforts. It has been generally accepted that instruments such as an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reduce disaster risks of development projects. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) for disaster risk reduction promotes using EIAs to address the disaster risk of development projects. Over 65 percent of the countries that have met the HFA progress-reporting obligation in the 2009 - 2011 reporting cycle, state that disaster risks of development projects are addressed by implementing EIA. However, the claims that EIA processes effectively address disaster risks {{have yet to be}} demonstrated empirically. It is clear that successful implementation of EIA processes also depends on the level of governance quality existing in a particular country. It is suggested that a well-conceived EIA process should reflect many of the elements of good governance principles including transparency, sufficient information flows, accountability, and stakeholder participation. Quality governance, therefore, is considered as having a direct bearing on why impact assessments in some countries are performing better than others. The influence of governance quality on the effectiveness of EIAs can be addressed by comparing the EIA processes of two or more countries with different levels of governance quality. In this research, the effectiveness of the EIA process in addressing development-induced disasters is evaluated by comparing the EIA processes of Sri Lanka and New Zealand. These two countries have quite different governance quality ratings and, therefore, offer a test of the influence of governance characteristics on EIA processes in addressing disaster risks. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the EIA processes of the above countries, a set of evaluation criteria was identified, mostly from existing literature. Eight criteria were specifically developed for this research. Data for the research were collected from in-depth interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussions with interviewees selected on the basis of their role, knowledge and expertise of the <b>EIA</b> process. <b>Documents</b> from both state and non-state actors relevant to the EIA process were also analyzed. Several recently conducted development projects in each country were used as cases to understand how the legislation is used in practice. It is clear that explicit reference to disaster risk is absent in environmental management policies in both Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Even though the New Zealand EIA process has a higher procedural and contextual effectiveness than Sri Lanka, both countries have lower levels of substantive effectiveness. Neither of the two EIA processes is found to be effective in addressing disaster risk because of inadequate policy integration of disaster risk into the environmental legislation that governs the EIA process. The results suggest more specificity is needed in legislative provisions and suggest a review of standard practice in using EIA to address disaster risk. The findings also imply the need to undertake evaluations of EIA systems elsewhere to assess their effectiveness in addressing development-induced disaster risks...|$|R
40|$|An intensifying {{and ever}} {{widening}} {{range of human}} activity occurs in the area south of the Antarctic Convergence. Amongst its various consequences {{it is reasonable to}} see increasing environmental pressures. Whilst not all activity occurring here is subject to particular international legal instruments, most is. A cluster of Antarctic-specific instruments, comprising the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, 1972 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS), 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol), form what is termed ‘the Antarctic Treaty System’ (ATS) and address a large part of present activity. Whaling and harvesting of Southern blue-fin tuna are regulated under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) through its International Whaling Commission (IWC), and the 1993 Convention for the Conservation of Southern Blue-fin Tuna (CCSBT) through its Commission respectively, legal instruments that are external to the Antarctic Treaty System. Other high seas activities in the region are subject to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Modern integrated environmental management approaches are largely confined to only two of these six instruments - CCAMLR and the Protocol. The obligation for prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), one of the major tools deployed in modern environmental management globally, is confined to the latter. EIA obligations in the Protocol are coupled with the advance notice obligations of Article VII. 5. a of the Antarctic Treaty. Although EIA has been applied to national Antarctic programmes and tourism activities, as a matter of state practice this has (drawing on a number of considerations) generally excluded EIA application to any whaling or fishing activities (although there are exceptions in relation to one state). States active in the region, whatever their positions on whaling and the modalities of other marine harvesting, have generally resisted calls to broaden the range of activities subject to <b>EIA.</b> This paper <b>documents</b> the basis for EIA within the Antarctic Treaty System, examines the arguments that have been used to deny its applicability to the wider range of Antarctic activities, enquires into the exceptions, considers the place of EIA {{in the context of the}} declaratory positions of Antarctic-active states in relation to ecosystem maintenance and environmental and other use values, and suggests mechanisms whereby some broadening of EIA coverage might be achieved if the political will existed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} government initiatives to regulate {{the impact of the}} two forces: roads and population pressure, which contribute to deterioration of the environment in Tanzania. In Tanzania environmental impact assessment (EIA) is being widely practised as a planning tool that identifies the potential impacts associated with development and determines their level of significance and the need for mitigation measures. The object of this thesis is {{to draw attention to the}} limitations of the project-level environmental impact assessment (EIA) with regard to contributing to sustainable development within the planning process. First it is documented that barriers for the effective operation of the EIA system, are found within the implementation of rules, laws and regulations relevant to EIA in the Road Sector in Tanzania. After documenting the extent of these challenges light is shed on barriers found within the implementation of criteria for reaching set EIA goals in the Road Sector. Finally, the attitudes of the professionals in the <b>EIA</b> system are <b>documented</b> to have an impact on the effective operation of the system. Results show that the rules, laws and regulations are poorly implemented due to i. a. the ineffective decentralisation of environmental responsibility and the powerlessness of the EIA tool in securing coerciveness to recommended legislative mitigation measures. Results also indicate that implementation of criteria for reaching EIA goals is challenged by poorly institutionalised conceptions of these criteria throughout the EIA system. Furthermore, challenges are found in the partial lack of a common “thoughts pattern” regarding the environmental planning system and the decision-making ideal among professionals in the EIA system. Based on a collective interpretation of these challenges it is concluded that the success of the government’s recommendations of widening the scope of EIA to include environmental assessment of all new policy, plans and programmes (Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)) will be highly dependent on changing the mind-sets and motivation of top personnel at ministerial level, as well as promoting awareness at regional and local level. Furthermore, a major factor that will influence on the increased success of EIA, and a requirement for the success of SEA, is found to be the establishment and enforcement of land-use plans and regulations, as well as a change in the national energy supply and enforcement of existing environmental laws. Without these changes, population increase, resulting from improved roads, will continue to result in unsustainable land-use and use of natural resources...|$|R
