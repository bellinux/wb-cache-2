5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E

25|$|Coins {{were one}} of the first objects to bear the image of the reigning {{sovereign}} in what is today Canada. After 1640, French colonists employed the Louis d'or ("Gold Louis", which <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> the effigy of King Louis XIII and then all subsequent French monarchs) until the transfer of New France to the British in 1763. After, British sovereigns and coppers were used, sometimes long {{after the end of the}} reign of the monarch appearing on the coin. The first coins minted specifically for the Province of Canada came in 1858 and had on their obverse the image of Queen Victoria, as did the first coins of the Dominion of Canada. Since then, the reigning sovereign's image has remained on Canadian coins, illustrating the responsibility of the monarch (as personification of the state) to guarantee the value of the medium of exchange. The effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on current Canadian coins was rendered by Susannah Blunt.|$|E

One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path {{of the tunnel}} that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. A total of nine workers were killed during the construction of both bores. Further complicating construction was that the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high altitudes, and the productivity was significantly less than planned. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, [...] "We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read". The <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> was dedicated March 8, 1973. Initially this tunnel was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the second tube (the Johnson bore), which was finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million; the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ million today). Approximately 90% of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E
500|$|All work on {{the large}} masses of bedrock was {{conducted}} by hand, without any help of powered machines, as the first power station in Boden was not constructed until almost ten years later in 1909.

Creating patrol trenches and placements for the turrets {{on the top of the}} forts was also work done early on. The teams of workers would <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> down in the bedrock using pinch bars and sledgehammers, then use black powder to blast the rock into manageable pieces which could be transported away from the site, using wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carriages and in some cases Decauville railways. When the ditch, or parts of it, had been completed, work started on the inner part of the fort by boring horizontally from the bottom of the ditch into the mountain itself. This work was a lot harderthe cost for each cubic metre of blasted tunnel was five times the cost of a cubic metre of blasted ditchboth due to the confined space in the tunnels and the risk of damaging the bedrock. The use of black powder instead of dynamite reduced the risk of bedrock damage, but it also increased the time needed to complete the tunnels. All in all, the amount of bedrock bored, blasted, loaded and transported away from the forts has been estimated to be around [...]|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, the British {{government}} secured undertakings {{from the}} trucial rulers not to sign concessions with foreign companies. Aware {{of the potential}} for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were agreed with local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement, which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a [...] bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.|$|E

60|$|Be this as it may, the {{earliest}} and simplest forms of bronze axe {{with which we}} are acquainted are profoundly interesting, as casting a flood of light upon the general process of human evolution all the world over. Every new human invention is always at first directly modelled upon the other similar products which have preceded it. There is no really new thing under the sun. For example, {{the earliest}} English railway carriages were built {{on the model of}} the old stage-coach, only that three stage-coaches, as it were, were telescoped together, side by side--the very <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> the significant motto, Tria juncta in uno--and it was this preconception of the English coachbuilder that has hampered us ever since with our hateful 'compartments,' instead of the commodious and comfortable open American saloon carriages. So, too, the earliest firearms were modelled on the stock of the old cross-bow, and the earliest earthenware pots and pans were shaped like the still more primitive gourds and calabashes. It need not surprise us, therefore, to find that the earliest metal axes of which we have any knowledge were directly moulded on the original shape of the stone tomahawk.|$|E
6000|$|Going up {{the side}} of a cliff about the first of November, I saw a {{vigorous}} young apple-tree, which, planted by birds or cows, had shot up amid the rocks and open woods there, and had now much fruit on it, uninjured by the frosts, when all cultivated apples were gathered. It was a rank wild growth, with many green leaves on it still, and made an impression of thorniness. The fruit was hard and green, but looked as if it would be palatable in the winter. Some was dangling on the twigs, but more half-buried in the wet leaves under the tree, or rolled far down the hill amid the rocks. The owner knows nothing of it. The day was not observed when it first blossomed, nor when it <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> fruit, unless by the chickadee. There was no dancing on the green beneath it in its honor, and now there is no hand to pluck its fruit,--which is only gnawed by squirrels, as I perceive.

60|$|So {{we walked}} forward towards the impi that was {{gathered}} on the further side of the kraal.

I looked upon the foremost of them, and ah! my father, my heart grew faint with joy, for I knew him across the years. It was Umslopogaas! my fosterling, Umslopogaas! and none other, now grown into manhood--ay, into such a man as {{was not to be}} found beside him in Zululand. He was great and fierce, somewhat spare in frame, but wide shouldered and shallow flanked. His arms were long and not over big, but the muscles stood out on them like knots in a rope; his legs were long also, and very thick beneath the knee. His eye was like an eagle's, his nose somewhat hooked, and he held his head a little forward, as a man who searches continually for a hidden foe. He seemed to walk slowly, and yet he came swiftly, but with a gliding movement like that of a wolf or a lion, and always his fingers played round the horn handle of the axe Groan-Maker. As for him who followed, he was great also, shorter than Umslopogaas by the half of a head, but of a sturdier build. His eyes were small, and twinkled unceasingly like little stars, and his look was very wild, for now and again he grinned, showing his white teeth.|$|E
6000|$|As {{this was}} only gibberish to the listeners, no answer was made, but all {{prepared}} to follow Ben, who was soon ready to change his ground. The bee-hunter took {{his way across the}} open ground to a point fully a hundred rods distant from his first position, where he found another stump of a fallen tree, which he converted into a stand. The same process was gone through with as before, and le Bourdon was soon watching two bees that had plunged their heads down into the cells of the comb. Nothing could exceed the gravity and attention of the Indians, all this time. They had fully comprehended the business of [...] "lining" [...] the insects toward their hives, but they could not understand the virtue of the [...] "angle." [...] The <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> so strong an affinity to their own pursuit of game, as to be very obvious to their senses; but the last included a species of information to which they were total strangers. Nor were they much the wiser after le Bourdon had taken his [...] "angle"; it requiring a sort of induction to which they were not accustomed, in order to put the several parts of his proceedings together, and to draw the inference. As for Gershom, he affected to be familiar with all that was going on, though he was just as ignorant as the Indians themselves. This little bit of hypocrisy was the homage he paid to his white blood: it being very unseemly, according to his view of the matter, for a pale-face not to know more than a redskin.|$|E
60|$|Although {{it may be}} {{admitted}} that Lithotrya has the power of enlarging its cavity, how does it <b>first</b> <b>bore</b> down into the rock? It is quite certain that the basal cup is absolutely fixed, and that neither in form nor state of surface it is at all fitted for boring.[66] I was quite unable to answer the foregoing question, until seeing the admirable figures by Reinhardt[67], (Pl. VIII, figs. 2 and 2 a´) of L. Nicobarica, still attached in its cavity. Subsequently I obtained from Mr. Stutchbury several pieces of rock completely drilled with holes, many of small diameter, by L. dorsalis, and in these I found numerous instances of the linear rows of little discs, like those of L. Nicobarica, showing in the plainest manner, that each time a new disc is formed, that is, at each exuviation, the animal moves a short step downwards; and as the lowest of these little discs in none of the burrows was placed at the very bottom, {{we see that the}} lowest point of the peduncle must be the wearing agent. In the peduncle of an individual of L. dorsalis, nearly ready to moult, I found, it may be remembered, beneath and round the basal disc, under the old membrane of the peduncle, a new membrane studded with calcified beads, but with the horny star-headed spines not yet developed, whilst on the old outer coat these latter had been worn down quite smooth, and the calcified beads worn entirely away. Here, then, we have an excellent rasping surface. With respect to the power of movement necessary for the boring action, the peduncle is amply furnished with transverse, oblique, and longitudinal striæ-less muscles,--the latter attached to the basal disc. In all the pedunculata, I have reason to believe that these muscles are in constant slight involuntary action. This being the case, I conceive that the small, blunt, spur-like portion of the peduncle, descending beneath the basal rim of the lowest disc, would inevitably partake slightly of the movements of the whole distended animal. As soon as the Lithotrya has reached that depth, which its instinct points out as most suitable to its habits, the discs are converted into an irregularly growing cup, and the animal then only increases in diameter, enlarging its cavity by the action of the serrated scales on the peduncle, and of the serrated lower edges of the valves of the capitulum. With respect to those reversed individuals attached with their capitulums downwards, I suppose that the larvæ had crept into some deep cavity, perhaps made originally by a Lithotrya, of which the rock in the specimen in question was quite full, and had there attached themselves. Finally, it appears that in Lithotrya the burrowing is simply a mechanical action; it is effected by each layer of shell in the basal attached discs overlapping, in a straight line, the last-formed layer,--by the membrane of the peduncle and the valves of the capitulum having excellent and often renewed rasping surfaces,--and, lastly, {{by the end of the}} peduncle (that is homologically the front of the head) thus roughened, extending beyond the surface of attachment, and possessing the power of slight movement.|$|E
