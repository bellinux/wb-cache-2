40|$|The {{distribution}} of direct public funding to political parties {{is based on}} two criteria: (1) performance at the election (funding per vote), or (2) representation in the parliament (funding per seat). Using a two-party group turnout model, we compare {{the effect of the}} two <b>funding</b> <b>systems</b> on parties’ mobilization effort and the equilibrium turnout. Allowing one party to have a larger support than the other, we uncover interesting differences regarding the equilibrium structure: while in the unique equilibrium of per seat <b>funding</b> <b>systems</b> both parties exert the same amount of effort, a per vote <b>funding</b> <b>system</b> results in an asymmetric equilibrium in which the advantaged party exerts higher effort than its opponent. We furthermore show that, at the same cost, a per vote <b>funding</b> <b>system</b> always yields higher turnout than a per seat <b>funding</b> <b>system,</b> sacrificing the representativity of the electoral outcome...|$|R

In general one could tentatively conclude that Kentucky’s capital-funding system was reasonably equitable until an expansion of district options in 2003 – 04 was followed by greater measures of inequity. This analysis points to specific methods for Kentucky to restore equity to its school capital funding structure as well as a model for analysis of other capital <b>funding</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Nearly half of the states that established performance <b>funding</b> <b>systems</b> education eventually discontinued these systems. This report examines the political forces that shaped performance funding policies in eight states. The report begins by contrasting the experiences of six states that established performance funding (Florida, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington) with two states that did not (California and Nevada). Second, the report analyzes the demise of performance funding in four states: Washington, Illinois, Missouri, and Florida. Finally, the report examines how and why two performance <b>funding</b> <b>systems</b> that have lasted to this day―in Tennessee and Florida―have changed over time. In conclusion, the report draws evidence-based recommendations for policymakers...|$|R

The “culture” of the university system thus becomes endogenous. This makes the model useful for the analysis of reforms in funding and also for international comparisons.
