In his anger {{he makes the}} rash oath that the wolf [...] "mot <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> at anis! [...] ". However, the wolf is lying nearby with the fox, and, overhearing it, promises to make him stay true to his word. Eventually the oxen calm down, but {{on the way back}} home the wolf jumps into their path. The wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them, since they are not his, to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before. The wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration, to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything. They argue, and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness; in response, he produces the fox. The creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute, and takes each aside in turn. To the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him {{were it not for the}} [...] "grit coist and expence" [...] of doing so; the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has, to which the fox acedes and goes off. To the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case.|$|E
