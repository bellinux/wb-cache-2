[...] It was also his 11th road victory (matching the club record held by Rick Helling (1998) and Padilla (2008)), and he matched the club record set by Bobby Witt (1990) with his 7th consecutive road win of the season.

500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with the more militant gays of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, {{made it clear that}} nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E

Daniel Martin gave the episode a positive review on The Guardian guardian.co.uk, {{saying that it}} [...] "can lay credible claim to being the greatest episode of Doctor Who there has ever been". He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's face as he realises he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance". IGN's Matt Wales gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it was [...] "packed with huge, iconic moments" [...] and stated, [...] "by the end of it, we were left with {{more questions than answers}} and a far better sense of Moffat's meticulous planning".|$|E

Cleave discussed: [...] "When you are choosing a lover, you're choosing a philosophy; it's not about sex, it's not about marriage. With Sarah, her unfaithfulness {{is just one of}} the symptoms of the fact that she's torn and <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make this strong moral choice." [...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders we draw, and the real damage they inflict".|$|E

500|$|To {{explain how}} to break free of the prison and its institutions, Satin {{develops}} a [...] "psychocultural" [...] class analysis that reveals the existence of [...] "life-", [...] "thing-", and [...] "death-oriented" [...] classes. [...] According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging [...] "third force" [...] in post-industrial nations. [...] The third force is generating a [...] "prison-free" [...] consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. [...] To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> launch an [...] "evolutionary movement" [...] to replace– or at least supplement– monolithic institutions with life-affirming, [...] "biolithic" [...] ones. [...] Some representative biolithic institutions are: deliberative democracy {{as an alternative to}} bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit {{as an alternative to the}} private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. [...] According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization– not capitalism– is said to be responsible for the prison. [...] But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be honest with her.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?', so I am sure he’s heard that." [...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You".

The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined.
