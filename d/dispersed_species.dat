60|$|As {{regards the}} second objection, {{it has been}} {{observed}} that orchideae, which have often exceedingly small and light seeds, are remarkably absent from oceanic islands. This, however, may be very largely due to their extreme specialisation and dependence on insect agency for their fertilisation; while the fact that they do occur in such very remote islands as the Azores, Tahiti, and the Sandwich Islands, proves that they must have once reached these localities either by the agency of birds or by transmission through the air; and the facts I have given above render the latter mode at least as probable as the former. Sir Joseph Hooker remarks on the composite plant of Kerguelen Island (Cotula plumosa) being found also on Lord Auckland and MacQuarrie Islands, and yet having no pappus, while other species of the genus possess it. This is certainly remarkable, and proves that the plant must have, or once have had, some other means of dispersal across wide oceans.[177] One of the most widely <b>dispersed</b> <b>species</b> in the whole world (Sonchus oleraceus) possesses pappus, as do four out of five of the species which are common to Europe and New Zealand, all of which have a very wide distribution. The same author remarks on the limited area occupied by most species of Compositae, notwithstanding their facilities for dispersal by means of their feathered seeds; but it has been already shown that limitations of area are almost always due to the competition of allied forms, facilities for dispersal being only one of many factors in determining the wide range of species. It is, however, a specially important factor {{in the case of the}} inhabitants of remote oceanic islands, since, whether they are peculiar species or not, they or their remote ancestors must at some time or other have reached their present position by natural means.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> are {{adapted to the}} seasonal variation in ant activity, i. e. that ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits when the activity of their seed dispersers is especially high. Two testable predictions of this hypothesis exist: 1. Ant dispersed and differently <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> differ in their seasonal development, i. e. ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> fruit (flower) earlier or {{later in the year}} than other plant species. Floristic investigations yielded ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> to flower and fruit 1. 5 - 2 month earlier than non-ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species.</b> Since other factors such as growth form, seed size or pollination mode may have caused this seasonal difference, multivariate analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that these additional factors had only little influence on the seasonal difference and that the effect was mainly due to the mode of seed dispersal. 2. At times when ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits the ant activity must be higher than at times when non-ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> do. Investigations of seasonal frequencies of ant individuals and of seasonal seed removal rates revealed ant activity to be especially high from May to July. Mean fruiting time of ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> was the beginning of July. Mean fruiting time of non-ant <b>dispersed</b> plant <b>species</b> was end of August / beginning of September. Statistical tests revealed that if ant dispersed plants had fruited as late as the other plants, they would have suffered a significant loss in seed removal.

40|$|Most Australian {{rainforest}} {{plants are}} dispersed by fruit-eating birds. In partly deforested landscapes, seed dispersal {{within and between}} forest patches is influenced by these birds' use of forest fragments, and by their patterns of fruit consumption. If the dispersers of a plant species decline or disappear, this will set an ultimate limit {{to the fate of}} its seeds – reduced dispersal. Therefore an important question for the conservation of rainforest plant communities is how to sustain or recover seed disperser abundances in fragmented forests. We assessed the effects of fragment size and surrounding forest cover on communities of seed disperser birds in an extensively-cleared Australian rainforest landscape, where different bird species vary in both their sensitivities to fragmentation and their roles as seed dispersers. In surveys of single one-hectare plots within 25 rainforest fragments, we recorded 20 seed <b>disperser</b> <b>species.</b> We used regression modelling to test how well particular seed <b>disperser</b> variables (<b>species</b> abundances, richness and abundance of functional groups) could be predicted by fragment size and six measures of surrounding forest cover (within 200 m, 1000 m and 5000 m radii, for cover of rainforest and of all forest types). Model comparisons showed that the amount of rainforest cover within 200 m was the best predictor of the abundances of fragmentation-sensitive <b>disperser</b> <b>species,</b> and of birds which <b>disperse</b> most plant <b>species</b> (including plants which have few dispersers). We conclude that a high proportion of local rainforest cover will help maintain seed disperser assemblages and seed dispersal in forest fragments and during forest restoration...|$|R

50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} within the park to assess the factors influencing forest regeneration and forest management techniques. One such study’s results suggested that forest restoration could be achieved through preventing fires within the park and allowing natural succession to occur so that the grasslands formed due to human activity could naturally regenerate to forests. The results showed that plots within the park that had the longest history of fire exclusion had the highest species diversity of trees. Furthermore, species of trees that required animal dispersal of their seeds were far more abundant than non-animal <b>dispersed</b> <b>species</b> in the plot with the longest duration of fire exclusion. This suggests that seed dispersing animals were also more abundant in areas where fire was excluded. Lastly, the presence of seed dispersers and animal <b>dispersed</b> <b>species</b> of trees in some grassland plots suggest that suppressing fire and allowing natural seed dispersal to occur can encourage forest regeneration. Another study evaluated the use of exotic pine and cypress tree plantations as a forest restoration technique within the park. This study showed a high level of natural regeneration of indigenous trees within pine plantations most likely due to the use of these plantations by seed dispersing animals such as redtail monkeys, chimpanzees, duikers, and bushpigs, all of which were sited or tracked within the plantations.|$|E

It is simple and cost-effective, but it can only operate on trees that are already present, mostly light-loving pioneer species. Such tree species are not usually those that comprise climax forests, but they can foster recolonization of the site by shade-tolerant climax forest tree species, via natural seed dispersal from remnant forest. Because this is a slow process, biodiversity recovery can usually be accelerated by planting some climax forest tree species, especially large-seeded, poorly <b>dispersed</b> <b>species.</b> It is not feasible to plant all the tree species that may have formerly grown in the original primary forest and it is usually unnecessary to do so, if the framework species method can be used.|$|E

If such thresholds exist, identifying them is fundamental to understanding extinction processes and critical to landscape management and conservation design.|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{dispersal}} {{events in}} plants faces important challenges and limitations. A methodological issue that limits advances {{in our understanding}} of seed dissemination by frugivorous animals is identifying 'which <b>species</b> <b>dispersed</b> the seeds'. This is essential for assessing how multiple frugivore species contribute distinctly to critical dispersal events such as seed delivery to safe sites, long-distance dispersal and the colonization of non-occupied habitats. Here, we describe DNA-barcoding protocols successfully applied to bird-dispersed seeds sampled in the field. Avian DNA was extracted from the surface of defecated or regurgitated seeds, allowing the identification of the frugivore species that contributed each dispersal event. <b>Disperser</b> <b>species</b> identification was based on a 464 -bp mitochondrial DNA region (COI: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I). We illustrate the possible applications of this method with bird-dispersed seeds sampled in the field. DNA-barcoding provides a non-invasive technique that allows quantifying frugivory and seed dispersal interaction networks, assessing the contribution of each frugivore species to seed rain in different microhabitats, and testing whether different frugivore species select different fruit/seed sizes. DNA barcoding of animal-dispersed seeds can resolve the distribution of dispersal services provided by diverse frugivore assemblages, allowing a robust and precise estimation of the different components of seed dispersal effectiveness, previously unattainable to traditional field studies at individual seed level. Given that seeds are sampled {{at the end of the}} dispersal process, this technique enables us to link the identity of the <b>disperser</b> <b>species</b> responsible for each dispersal event to plant traits and environmental features, thereby building a bridge between frugivory and seed deposition patterns. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} knowledge about metapopulation and metacommunity processes in patchy, dynamic landscapes, using epiphytic bryophytes as a model system. Host trees and deciduous forest stands in the coniferous landscape are patchy, temporal and undergo changes in habitat quality during succession. Epiphytes must track this dynamic habitat network for their long-term survival. Community patterns at different spatial scales were explored and linked to regional metapopulation processes and local population dynamics. Spatial structuring in species richness both at a local and regional scale indicated stronger dispersal limitation but lower sensitivity to habitat quality in species with large asexual than in species with small sexual diaspores. In sexually <b>dispersed</b> <b>species,</b> a strong rescue effect was indicated by a bimodal frequency distribution of the species and by increasing local abundance with increasing patch connectivity. Present connectivity to other deciduous forest patches had positive effects on richness of asexually <b>dispersed</b> <b>species,</b> whereas richness of sexually <b>dispersed</b> <b>species</b> was instead related to the landscape connectivity 30 years ago. A study of local growth and reproduction suggested that this is caused by delayed sexual, but not asexual, reproduction. Habitat conditions affected the production of sporophytes, but not of asexual diaspores. No differences in either growth rates or competitive abilities among species with different dispersal and life-history strategies were found. In vitro experiments showed that establishment is higher from large asexual diaspores than from small sexual. Establishment of all diaspore types was limited by pH. There were indications of trade-offs between high germination and protonemal growth rates, desiccation tolerance and a rapid development of shoots from protonema. The {{results indicated that the}} epiphyte metacommunity is structured by two main trade-offs: dispersal distance (diaspore size) versus age at first reproduction, and dispersal distance versus sensitivity to habitat quality. Trade-offs in species traits may have evolved as a consequence of conflicting selection pressures imposed by habitat turnover, connectivity and irregular water supply rather than by species interactions. Syndromes of interrelated species traits imply that fairly small changes in habitat conditions can lead to distinct changes in metacommunity diversity: the results indicate that increasing distances among patches cause most harm to asexually <b>dispersed</b> <b>species,</b> whereas cuttings of forests of high age and quality as well as increasing patch dynamics are most harmful to sexually <b>dispersed</b> <b>species.</b> Senarelagd disputation från: 2009 - 09 - 26, Lindahlsalen, EBC, Villavägen 9, 75236 Uppsala, Uppsala, 10 : 0...|$|E

The ecological roles of ephemeral systems are rarely studied. This paper describes movement patterns {{of fish in}} the Mulligan River, an ephemeral system in the Lake Eyre Basin, central Australia. Several sites were sampled along a temporal gradient encompassing floods and dry periods. After a single major flood in 2007 up to seven fish species were found at sites up to 300 ?km from the closest permanent waterhole. Following a series of floods (when waterholes were replenished and remained wet between 2009 and 2011) a further five species were recorded including the first records for the Lake Eyre hardyhead, Craterocephalus eyresii, from the rivers of far western Queensland. The presence of all species known from the parent catchment (the Georgina, where permanent waterholes occur) in the ephemeral catchment (the Mulligan) suggests that many fish species present in the river systems of central Australia are capable of dispersing long distances following the opening of movement pathways during flooding.

40|$|Ecological {{reserves}} {{provide important}} wildlife habitat inmany landscapes, and the functional connectivity of reserves and other suitable habitat patches {{is crucial for}} the persistence and resilience of spatially structured populations. To maintain or increase connectivity at spatial scales larger than individual patches, conservation actions may focus on creating andmaintaining reserves and/or influencing management on non-reserves. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we assessed the functional connectivity and spatial distribution of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, an intensively cultivated agricultural matrix, at four assumed, but ecologically realistic, anuran dispersal distances. We compared connectivity in the current landscape to the historical landscape and putative future landscapes, and evaluated the importance of individual and aggregated reserve and non-reserve wetlands for maintaining connectivity. Connectivity was greatest in the historical landscape, where wetlands were also the most densely distributed. The construction of irrigation reuse pits for water storage has maintained connectivity in the current landscape by replacing destroyed wetlands, but these pits likely provide suboptimal habitat. Also, because there are fewer total wetlands (i. e., wetlands and irrigation reuse pits) in the current landscape than the historical landscape, and because the distribution of current wetlands is less clustered than that of historical wetlands, larger and longer <b>dispersing,</b> sometimes nonnative <b>species</b> may be favored over smaller, shorter <b>dispersing</b> <b>species</b> of conservation concern. Because of their relatively low number, wetland reserves do not affect connectivity as greatly as non-reserve wetlands or irrigation reuse pits; however, they likely provide the highest quality anuran habitat. To improve future levels of resilience in this wetland habitat network, management could focus on continuing to improve the conservation status of non-reserve wetlands, restoring wetlands at spatial scales that promote movements of shorter <b>dispersing</b> <b>species,</b> and further scrutinizing irrigation reuse pit removal by considering effects on functional connectivity for anurans, an emblematic and threatened group of organisms.

ConclusionsThis is the first study to report sex-specific differences in genetic structure based on matrilineally-inherited mtDNA in a passively <b>dispersing</b> <b>species</b> that lacks social structure or sexual dimorphism.

Using a historic data set and our own surveys of 59 northern hardwood understories, we {{examined the relationship between}} temporal shifts in local and regional abundance and 3 ecological attributes: taxonomic group, photosynthetic guild, and dispersal mode. We predicted non-graminoid monocots would decline more than dicots and ferns, and early summer herbs would decline more than other photosynthetic guilds (because non-graminoid monocots and early summer herbs are more vulnerable to deer browse). We also predicted species with limited dispersal would decline more than widely-dispersed species.

Third, even though mtDNA is typically used to study historical demographic processes, it also contains information about contemporary processes. Higher survival rates of males in non-native habitats can erase the genetic structure present in their mothers within a single generation. </p...|$|R
