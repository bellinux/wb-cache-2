40|$|Abstract What makes {{recycling}} work? We {{study the}} factors driving household waste disposal and recycling in 18 cities in Taiwan and Japan {{in order to}} understand the impact of alternative waste management incentives. We show that this depends on the effect of distinct policies on the relative costs of the main alternative disposal methods: recycling, <b>disposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> and illegal dumping. The willingness both to recycle and to dispose to landfill depends on the relative costs of the waste collection regime, and these are dominated by the time cost of alternative disposal methods. The higher the frequency of waste collection, the less recycling and the more <b>disposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> there will be. This is because frequent collection reduces the marginal time-cost of <b>disposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>landfill.</b> Curbside collection of recy-clable material, and the frequency of that collection, has a similar effect on the recycling rate. Although direct incentives, such as unit pricing are important in the waste disposal decision, recycling depends primarily on management of the time-costs it involves...|$|E

The Discarded vehicle tyres which are historically been disposed of into landfills constitute an important part of the solid waste. Tyre <b>disposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>landfills</b> is problematic, as waste rubber is not easily biodegradable. An emerging field for the reuse of scrap tyres is in the production of concrete, where rubber tyres can be used as a partial replacement to natural aggregates.
