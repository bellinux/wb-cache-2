5000|$|Multispindle lathes {{have more}} than one spindle and {{automated}} control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called screw machines, while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. Screw machines usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a screw machine is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a screw machine can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part</b> much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Whitney's {{demonstration}} of 1801 appeared {{to show the}} ingenuity of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts,</b> Merritt Roe Smith concludes that Whitney's demonstration was [...] "staged" [...] and [...] "duped government authorities" [...] into believing that he had created <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts.</b> The charade was only useful {{in order to gain}} more time and resources for the project but not to create <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Indexing {{is vital}} in manufacturing, {{especially}} mass production, where a well-defined cycle of motions must be repeated quickly and easily—but precisely—for each <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part</b> that is made. Without indexing capability, all manufacturing {{would have to}} be done on a craft basis, and interchangeable parts would have very high unit cost because of the time and skill needed to produce each unit. In fact, the evolution of modern technologies depended on the shift in methods from crafts (in which toolpath is controlled via operator skill) to indexing-capable toolpath control. A prime example of this theme was the development of the turret lathe, whose turret indexes tool positions, one after another, to allow successive tools to move into place, take precisely placed cuts, then make way for the next tool.|$|E
5000|$|Davidson's {{religious}} philosophy had important {{consequences for}} social thought. Apeirotheism was utterly democratic and perfectionistic because it entailed that each individual {{has the potential}} to be a God, although restrictive social relations have thwarted the development of most people's potential. For Davidson, because we contain the divine within us, our unfettered natural instincts would impel us to act morally. As individuals became increasingly aware of the divine within themselves, so they became increasingly moral. James believed this individualistic religion made Davidson [...] "indifferent...to socialisms and general administrative panaceas." [...] According to James, Davidson taught that [...] "Life must be flexible. You ask for a free man and these Utopias give you an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part,</b> with a fixed number, in a rule-bound social organism." [...] Apeirotheism called for the release of each individual's potential divinity through self-cultivation and the nurturing of others rather than through changes in one's material conditions. Davidson was convinced that this release would lead to the only true reform of human society; it was to this task that he devoted the rest of his life.|$|E
5000|$|While the CRF450R and the TRX450R {{share the}} same {{displacement}} number, {{there are very few}} of the same components between the two engines. Initially, many people were disappointed because the first TRX450R was very weak compared to the CRF450R. Honda claims that it designed the TRX450R engine to produce more torque so that the engine was more suited for ATV purposes. In 2004 and 2005, the only <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part</b> between the ATV and motorcycle engines was the camshaft. In 2006, Honda overhauled the TRX450R engine to make it more similar to its motorcycle variant. This included a more aggressive cam profile, a larger bore with a shortened stroke, a new, short skirt piston and titanium rather than steel valves. In addition, Honda changed the carburetor from a 42 mm Keihin butterfly type to a 40 mm Keihin FCR. This increased the power from about [...] in the first generation to over [...] in the second. The first generation engine had a 10.5:1 compression ratio while the second generation had a 12:1 compression ratio.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The germ of the {{component}} idea arose in mass production as the <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part,</b> but in today’s information and communications technology (ICT) industries {{the component}} can connote considerably more, such as multiple uses, opportunistic combinations with other components, design by assembly, and incremental evolution through field replacement with upgraded components. In {{spite of its}} many advantages, the component has failed {{to keep up with}} increasing scales of integration, increasing use of software, and the resulting complexity and application diversity. A rethinking of the component and associated industry practices is needed in light of modern technology and applications. Componentization has many payoffs, including as a process for industry coordination, most notably in large multi-vendor complex systems with fragmented administrative and ownership domains. Invigorating componentization requires abandoning antiquated concepts such as components are exclusively hardware or software or even exclusively technological, are units of manufacture and packaging, or that each component is the responsibility of an individual firm. The system component, which incorporates hardware, software, and oftentimes even human process or organizational elements–whatever is necessary to achieve a coherent body of functionality–is the appropriate perspective toda...|$|E

40|$|Amino acid {{nitrogen}} isotopic {{analysis is}} a relatively new method for estimating trophic position. It uses the isotopic difference between an individual’s ‘trophic’ and ‘source’ amino acids to determine its trophic position. So far, there is no accepted explanation for the mechanism by which the isotopic signals in ‘trophic’ and ‘source’ amino acids arise. Yet without a metabolic understanding, the utility of nitrogen isotopic analyses as a method for probing trophic relations, at either bulk tissue or amino acid level, is limited. I draw on isotopic tracer studies of protein metabolism, together with a consideration of amino acid metabolic pathways, to suggest that the ‘trophic’/ ‘source’ groupings have a fundamental metabolic origin, to do with the cycling of amino-nitrogen between amino acids. ‘Trophic’ amino acids are those whose amino-nitrogens are <b>interchangeable,</b> <b>part</b> of a metabolic amino-nitrogen pool, and ‘source’ amino acids are those whose amino-nitrogens are not interchangeable with the metabolic pool. Nitrogen isotopic values of ‘trophic’ amino acids will reflect an averaged isotopic signal of all such dietary amino acids, offset by the integrated effect of isotopic fractionation from nitrogen cycling, and modulated by metabolic and physiological effects. Isotopic values of ‘source’ amino acids will be more closely linked to those of equivalent dietary amino acids, but also modulated by metabolism and physiology. The complexity of nitrogen cycling suggests that a single identifiable value for ‘trophic discrimination factors’ is unlikely to exist. Greater consideration of physiology and metabolism should help in better understanding observed patterns in nitrogen isotopic values...|$|E
40|$|The Kepler Prize was {{a contest}} held {{this past year}} by The Mars Society to design the Mars Direct Earth Return Vehicle (ERV) in as great a detail as possible. This is the summary report of Team Daedalia, which won this {{international}} competition {{in the summer of}} 2004. SYSTEM OVERVIEW Before Project Constellation was announced, our design was made as modular as possible to allow for rapid construction, field serviceability, <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part</b> swapping for both repair of planned systems and, for future explorers, adaptation to unanticipated systems, and phased technology changes over the development of the ERV fleet. Nothing is done without reference to both pre-ERV needs and post-ERV re-use of system components on Mars. While the craft is divided into many sections, the design is somewhat unique in that a single passageway runs almost {{the entire length of the}} vehicle, from the base of the reentry capsule to the engine compartment in the back. This passageway, with rectangular doors at each break, allows suited crew members to switch to a pressurized environment the minute they arrive at the vehicle’s base. In an emergency, this could be critical. In addition to the internal ladder, a hoist assembly can lift large objects and crew members from the surface to the Mission Module. A small block and tackle can even finish the job of loading surface samples into the Command Module. The second major advantage of this feature is that the passage contains multiple access doors all the way to the surface. Any section can be closed off, depressurized (if appropriate) and access doors opened to allow repair at any point from the first stage engines to the Command Module. Finally, the pressurized tube down the middle of the entire vehicle acts as a backbone for structural purposes. The vehicle starts out very top-heavy on landing, and a separate structural component to take some of the weight away from the now-empty tanks is desirable. While other structural frameworks are used throughout the vehicle, having a core simplifies the compression element of the design. The craft is assembled from the following sections...|$|E
40|$|Introduction We have {{developed}} a low-cost stopcock valve actuator for radiochemistry automation built using a stepper motor and an Arduino, an open-source single-board microcontroller. The con-troller hardware can be programmed to run by serial communication or via two 5 – 24 V digital lines for simple integration into any automation control system. This valve actuator allows for automated use of a single, disposable stopcock, providing a number of advantages over stopcock manifold systems available on many commercial radiochemistry rigs or over using solenoid valves. This actuator allows for the use {{a wide variety of}} stopcocks, ranging in size, shape and material, giving flexibility to be used in a large variety of applications. Material and Methods The actuated valve consists of two main parts, the actuator and the control electronics. The actuator consists of a stepper motor, an infrared ‘home position’ sensor, a stopcock backplate, and a coupler from the driveshaft to stopcock handle. The stepper motor is a NEMA- 17 size that runs 200 steps/rotation with a 5 mm drive shaft. The coupler is an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part,</b> custom to each stopcock model, with each part drilled out to fit the motor drive shaft and milled out for a tight fit to the stopcock handle. The backplane consists of a plate offset from the motor body with 5 screws positioned to keep the stopcock body from rotating relative to the motor. A reflective optical sensor (Vishay TCRT 1000) is used as a limit switch to determine a ‘home’ position for the stopcock. With a slight modification to most any stopcock in cutting off a tab that limits rotation, the handle can rotate 360 °. This allows for opening all three ports to each other, which has been done to all stopcocks used with this actuator. The control electronics consist of an Arduino Uno board and a motor shield (add-on board), connecting to the actuator by an Ethernet cable. The motor shield functions to interface the low-power Arduino circuitry with a high power H-bridge motor driver circuit. The Arduino runs two sets of code, initialization and its loop. The initialization routine runs when power is first powered up, and then continues to run the loop. The initialization routine rotates the valve until the IR limit switch is activated, and rotates an-other 45 ° from position home, sealing off all ports on the stopcock. Following initialization, the Arduino enters its loop, which repeatedly compares its current position to its target posi-tion. When the target position and current posi-tion do not match, the stepper motor turns in the shortest direction towards its target position. The hardware can be interfaced by either serial communication or by two 5 – 24 V digital signals defining positions 1 – 4. The wide range of allowed input signal voltages is realized by using an optocoupler that accepts 5 – 24 V inputs but outputs TTL signals compatible with the Arduino’s hardware. Results and Conclusion A photo of the implementation of the actuator is shown in FIGURE 1. It has overall dimensions of 3. 5 × 1. 75 × 2. 5 ”, excluding a mounting bracket. Control electronics are housed in a compact box built for an Arduino, giving the control electron-ics a clean, professional look. Challenges in de-sign included determining a maximum motor speed where the motor would provide enough torque but yet move fast enough to be useful, finding that rotational speed of 6 seconds/full rotation is best...|$|E
