50|$|In June 1981, the Sydney bound {{services}} was altered {{to operate as}} a <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> departing Cooma at 08:50. On 31 May 1986 the Cooma Mail was withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|In December 1987 a <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> was {{introduced}} between Melbourne and Sydney {{but did not}} become a permanent feature. In September 1988 an overnight Melbourne to Adelaide service commenced.|$|R
50|$|A trial <b>daylight</b> <b>service,</b> the Mildura Sunlight was {{introduced}} by the Victorian Railways between Melbourne and Mildura on 3 September 1957. Air-conditioned Z type carriage stock was used, running thrice weekly.|$|R

Log and other wood-related traffic is moved between Wellington and Waingawa, just south of Masterton, with one {{overnight}} and one <b>daylight</b> return <b>service</b> on weekdays, and a <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> operates both weekend days. Two freight trains operate from Palmerston North to Pahiatua and return on weekdays, the first in the early hours of the morning and the second in the afternoon. No freights currently operate regularly at weekends.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{serviced}} by the overnight Northern Mail until it ceased in November 1988. The Northern Tablelands Express provided a <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> to Glen Innes, with some journeys extended to Tenterfield until truncated in October 1985 to Armidale and in February 1990 to Tamworth.|$|R
5000|$|The Silver Star {{service was}} later {{transferred}} to the DXs, while the Scenic <b>Daylight</b> <b>service</b> had earlier {{been replaced by the}} [...] "Blue Streak" [...] railcars. The introduction of further DX class locomotives in 1975-76 ended the dominance of the DAs on the NIMT.|$|R
50|$|Amtrak {{has worked}} on plans for {{resuming}} Coast <b>Daylight</b> <b>service</b> from San Francisco to Los Angeles since the late 1990s. It may be merged with the existing Pacific Surfliner route, thus extending the line to San Diego. More specific plans {{have been made in}} the last few years. The latest review of the possibility of service restoration was made on August 14, 2014, the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) organized and hosted a meeting between the Los Angeles - San Diego - San Luis Obispo (LOSSAN) Rail Corridor Agency and the Coast Rail Coordinating Council (CRCC), where substantial progress was made toward identifying which specific policy initiatives would be given priority so that restoration of the Coast <b>Daylight</b> <b>service</b> might be effectuated before the end of the decade.|$|R
50|$|The station {{building}} {{opened on}} 21 April 1924. From 1927 when Federal Parliament moved to Canberra, the rail passenger service was upgraded {{with the introduction}} of a Canberra portion to the Cooma Mail overnight train to Sydney that connected with Melbourne sleeper trains at Goulburn. A <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> from Sydney was also introduced.|$|R
50|$|In September 1956, car 9AS was {{similarly}} altered internally to become 3ABS. However, {{the car was}} not repainted into the Overland colour scheme. This car was occasionally used on the Overland service to replace {{one of the other}} two, {{but for the most part}} it was converted for the new The <b>Daylight</b> <b>service</b> running from Melbourne to Albury.|$|R
50|$|The last {{train to}} {{regularly}} service Glen Innes was the overnight Northern Mail which ceased in November 1988. The Northern Tablelands Express provided a <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> to Glen Innes until truncated in October 1985 to Armidale. The line to Glen Innes was still open in July 1992 when diesel locomotive 4499 operated a crew route learning service.|$|R

50|$|The day {{service from}} Melbourne to Sydney is the slowest {{scheduled}} trip of the 4 XPT services, with a travel time of 11.5 hours. The other three services are timetabled to take about 11 hours. This discrepancy {{is due to}} the northbound <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> being scheduled to wait in a loop south of Junee for the southbound service to cross.|$|R
50|$|With the {{standard}} gauge line from Perth to Kalgoorlie due {{to open in}} mid-1969, the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) decided to replace The Kalgoorlie overnight sleeper <b>service</b> with a <b>daylight</b> <b>service.</b> The new service commenced on 29 November 1971, cutting the 653 km journey time from fourteen to eight hours. With an average speed of 85 km/h, it was the fastest service in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Electric-hauled {{passenger}} services originated later, {{due to the}} New Zealand Railways being skeptical about electric locomotives on passenger trains, and because the then <b>daylight</b> NIMT <b>service,</b> the Silver Fern, utilised diesel-electric rail cars. When the locomotive-hauled Overlander <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> replaced the Silver Fern in December 1991, EF class locomotives began {{to be used to}} haul it across the central section, and later, the locomotives were used on the overnight Northerner passenger service until it was cancelled in November 2004. The EFs were not used initially on the Northern Explorer, however KiwiRail experimented for a short while with towing the whole consist - including the diesel locomotive - over the central section. However the need for locomotives for freight services curtailed this.|$|R
50|$|In May 2007, Great Southern Rail (GSR) relaunched the service. It was re-timetabled {{to operate}} as a three times weekly <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> and the {{carriages}} overhauled with a new blue, purple and green livery applied and the interiors renewed. A new emu logo was also unveiled. The motorail service was withdrawn in the early 2000s when the dock at the Melbourne end was removed {{as part of the}} Southern Cross station redevelopment, but was restored in February 2009.|$|R
50|$|In December 1937, the Governor class diesel railcars were {{introduced}} on <b>daylight</b> regional <b>services</b> from Perth. The longer distance services remained locomotive hauled.|$|R
5000|$|A Streamline coach {{from the}} <b>Daylight</b> <b>service</b> was {{converted}} for Commute use in 1965 by adding five-abreast seating (one seat for two, and another seat for three across the aisle) {{for a total}} of 122 seats. It was not popular and was sold to the Stockton Terminal & Eastern in 1971. Instead, to increase passenger capacity, SP purchased a third flight of [...] "Gallery" [...] cars, delivered in 1968, which may be distinguished from the 1955/57 Gallery cars by a different window configuration.|$|R
5000|$|... k > 1 means geometrically reduced bulge and {{a longer}} <b>service</b> <b>range.</b> On the other hand, k < 1 means a shorter <b>service</b> <b>range.</b>|$|R
50|$|By November 1986, The Vinelander {{was only}} {{operating}} two nights per week, with The Sunraysia <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> {{running as a}} replacement on some other days. The price of the sleeping car service also rose; from $17 per berth in 1985, it had risen to $30 per berth by July 1986. Staff levels were also reduced, with one conductor to manage two carriages (prior to this it was a one-to-one ratio). This was seen by some as an attempt by V/Line management to cut back the service.|$|R
50|$|The tilt trains cut {{the travel}} time between Brisbane and Cairns from nine to seven hours, with a <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> between Mackay and Cairns {{so as not}} to {{duplicate}} electric tilt trains to Rockhampton. Services were three times a week, departing Roma Street railway station, Brisbane on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6:25 pm, arriving Cairns railway station Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 7:20 pm; returning from Cairns on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8:15 am, arriving Brisbane at 9:10 am on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays.|$|R
5|$|The Lake Shore Limited {{has served}} Lakefront Station from its opening in 1977. The Capitol Limited began {{stopping}} at Lakefront on November 12, 1990, after Conrail's abandonment of {{portions of the}} ex-Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway in northwestern Indiana forced the re-routing of that train along with the Broadway Limited. Previously it had passed to the south, serving Canton. Between 1998 and 2003, the Pennsylvanian served Cleveland, providing <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> to Chicago and Philadelphia. Weak ridership prompted Amtrak to return the train to a Pittsburgh–New York schedule.|$|R
25|$|The RAF's Boulton Paul Defiant {{had some}} initial success over Dunkirk {{because of its}} {{resemblance}} to the Hurricane; Luftwaffe fighters attacking from the rear were surprised by its unusual gun turret. However, during the Battle of Britain, this single-engined two-seater proved hopelessly outclassed. For various reasons, the Defiant lacked any form of forward-firing armament, and the heavy turret and second crewman meant it could not outrun or outmanoeuvre either the Bf 109 or Bf 110. By the end of August, after disastrous losses, the aircraft was withdrawn from <b>daylight</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
25|$|Monday, 2 December 1991 saw the Silver Fern railcars {{replaced}} on {{the daylight}} NIMT {{run by the}} Northerner stock, InterCity having learned from the benefits a carriage train provided over the three 96-seat railcars. To facilitate this, a third modular van fitted with 11kW generator for power-luggage use and a Wairarapa Connection car turned 32-seat servery car were made available to form a third trainset. Also, the servery/observation/rear view Bay Express car and the observation/rear view TranzAlpine Connoisseurs car were added to provide extra viewing opportunities. The <b>daylight</b> <b>services</b> were named the Overlander Expresses.|$|R

5000|$|The first Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr was an eastbound-only <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> between Lincoln, Nebraska and Chicago. The 551 mi journey took nine hours. The train's consist {{included}} new lightweight {{equipment and}} traditional heavyweight cars. The [...] "Ak-Sar-Ben" [...] portion of name {{was created by}} spelling Nebraska (Neb-ras-ka) backwards; a fraternal organization (the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben) and an arena and horse racing facility in Omaha have also used the name. The Advance Flyer provided westward service. The new service began on December 11, 1940. The CB&Q ended this service in 1947; replacing it with the new Nebraska Zephyr.|$|R
50|$|The Sunset {{did receive}} a {{somewhat}} better schedule on May 7, 2012, moving its Westbound movements from New Orleans to a Monday, Wednesday, Saturday circuit. The changes restored <b>daylight</b> <b>service</b> to both Houston (11:10 a.m. eastbound, 6:18p westbound) and Tucson (7:28 a.m. eastbound, 6:45p westbound); a 10:00 p.m. departure from Los Angeles eastbound and a 5:35 a.m. arrival westbound; and arrival into New Orleans at 9:40 p.m. eastbound and departing westbound at 9:00 a.m. The times allow several 7- to 12-hour rides between major-city pairs; for example, overnight between Tucson or Maricopa (for Phoenix) and Los Angeles in both directions.|$|R
