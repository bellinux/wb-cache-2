5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E
25|$|Such fears proved unfounded, as Noda {{qualified}} {{within a}} second of Comas' time, {{and was the}} 25th fastest. But when David Brabham's best time in the Simtek was disallowed, Noda was bumped up to 24th on the grid, alongside Comas in 23rd. But in another department, he had comprehensively thrashed his more experienced teammate. Under braking, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> 4.1g, a Larrousse record, whereas Comas often pulled less than 3g. It showed how quickly he had got the hang of powerful Formula One brakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{dismissal}} of Kotomitsuki in July 2010 for involvement in illegal gambling on baseball left Kaiō {{as the only}} Japanese wrestler in the top two ranks. He expressed sympathy for his fellow ōzeki, telling reporters that dismissal was harsh and that he wished Kotomitsuki could {{have been given the}} chance to reform. On Day 10 of the Nagoya Sumo Tournament, Kaiō lost to fellow ōzeki Kotoōshū, and the next morning announced <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the tournament with a 6–4 record, citing an injured left shoulder. However, he returned to hold his rank yet again in the September tournament.|$|E
50|$|The Fellow won a race at Auteuil Hippodrome in {{the summer}} of 1994 but was well beaten in other races. This {{included}} a final effort at the King George VI Chase, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> up behind Algan. Ironically, that horse had the same trainer and owner as The Fellow. His last race was at Auteuil on 18 June 1995, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> up.|$|R

25|$|In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson {{began his}} {{re-election}} campaign. Eugene McCarthy ran against {{him for the}} nomination on an anti-war platform. McCarthy did not win the first primary election in New Hampshire, but he did surprisingly well against an incumbent. The resulting blow to the Johnson campaign, taken together with other factors, led the President to make a surprise announcement in a March 31 televised speech that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the race. He also announced the initiation of the Paris Peace Negotiations with Vietnam in that speech. Then, on August 4, 1969, U.S. representative Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese representative Xuan Thuy began secret peace negotiations at the apartment of French intermediary Jean Sainteny in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Nadal {{began his}} Asian tour at the 2010 PTT Thailand Open in Bangkok where {{he reached the}} semifinals, losing to compatriot Guillermo García-López. Nadal was able to regroup, and at the 2010 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo (debut), he {{defeated}} Santiago Giraldo, Milos Raonic, and Dmitry Tursunov. In the semifinals against Viktor Troicki, Nadal saved two match points in the deciding set tiebreaker to win it 9–7 in the end. In the final, Nadal comfortably defeated Gaël Monfils for his seventh title of the season. Nadal next played in the 2010 Shanghai Rolex Masters in Shanghai, {{where he was the}} top seed, but lost to world No. 12 Jürgen Melzer in the third round, snapping his record streak of 21 consecutive Masters quarterfinals. On 5 November, Nadal announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the Paris Masters owing to tendinitis in his left shoulder. On 21 November 2010, in London, Nadal won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award for the first time.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Israeli Jonathan Erlich, {{who had been}} {{suffering}} from an elbow injury since September, also announced <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out from the doubles field, alongside his partner Andy Ram, {{with whom he had}} won the Australian Open in January. Hoping that Erlich would be fit to play the year-end event, Ram had continued to compete with different players between September and the last ATP Tour event before the Masters Cup. During that period, he won a Davis Cup World Group Play-off match against Peru with Harel Levy, an ATP International Series Gold title in Vienna against Philipp Petzschner and Alexander Peya with Max Mirnyi, lost to Pablo Andújar and Marcel Granollers {{in the first round of}} the Madrid Masters with Mikhail Youzhny, won another title in Lyon against Stephen Huss and Ross Hutchins with Michaël Llodra, and eventually lost in the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters to Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra, with Bruno Soares.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to America. John Dos Passos {{recommended}} Key West, and they left Paris in March 1928. Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom when he pulled a skylight down on his head thinking <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar, he was reluctant to answer. After his departure from Paris, Hemingway [...] "never again lived in a big city".|$|E
500|$|Pepys found Bloodworth {{trying to}} {{co-ordinate}} the fire-fighting efforts and near to collapse, [...] "like a fainting woman", crying out plaintively {{in response to}} the King's message that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> down houses. [...] "But the fire overtakes us faster then we can do it." [...] Holding on to his civic dignity, he refused James's offer of soldiers and then went home to bed. King Charles II sailed down from Whitehall in the Royal barge to inspect the scene. He found that houses were still not being pulled down, in spite of Bloodworth's assurances to Pepys, and daringly overrode the authority of Bloodworth to order wholesale demolitions west of the fire zone. The delay rendered these measures largely futile, as the fire was already out of control.|$|E

[...] At another point [...] "it seemed like <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out a gun and the barrel just kept coming." [...] "I know he had an object and it was dark.

2500|$|BBC News {{reported}} that Taliban in the Swat District began {{to expand into}} the neighboring district of Buner after the peace deal was finalized.

Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else."
