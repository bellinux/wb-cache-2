40|$|The I/O {{subsystem}} {{is becoming}} a major bottleneck in {{an increasing number of}} computer systems. To provide improved I/O performance, as well as to accommodate growing storage requirements, disk subsystems are increasing in size. A major hurdle to obtaining the performance available from these large disk subsystems is load imbalance, or disk skew. Dynamic data placement, the conventional load balancing technique, is usually inadequate to deal with load imbalance because it is forced to accept atomic data sets with rapidly changing access patterns. We name this rapid fluctuation <b>floating</b> <b>load</b> imbalance and distinguish it from the conventional view of load imbalance, referred to as fixed load imbalance. Dynamic data placement also becomes increasingly difficult as the number of disks in the subsystem grows.

The transistor, Q1, adjusts the output (collector) current so as to keep the voltage drop across the constant emitter resistor, R2, almost equal to the relatively constant voltage drop across the Zener diode, DZ1. As a result, the output current is almost constant even if the load resistance and/or voltage vary. The operation of the circuit is considered in details below.|$|R

After obtaining the experimental results, using modern Op-Amps, and comparing to the theoretical and simulated ones, they confirm the design under study can be a good solution for multi-frequency wideband EBI applications because of higher values of the output impedance than 100 kÎ© at 1 MHz are obtained.
