Acad. Sci. of Ukraine conservatories, are presented. The higher absolute values of deviation in terms of flowering from the average long-term ones of the speciess originating from the Mediterranean geosynclinal belt may be accounnted for by their higher tolerance and better capacity of adaptation to the changeable conditions of the ground used for introduction. The percent of the species with a complete development cycle and <b>full-grained</b> seed production is also higher among the representatives of the Mediterranean geosynclinal belt, that allows to expect a greater success of introduction of these species...|$|E
40|$|The data on seed {{productivity}} of A. alba calculating for one cone {{has been studied}} in the 3 natural populations of the Ukrainian Carpathians are cited. A mean number of fertile scales was 88, 6 % and 11, 4 % of sterile ones in a cone. A specificity of A. alba cone structure has been revealed, lying {{in the presence of}} a transition zone between the fertile and sterile layers and comprising seeds, not having reached the normal size compared to seeds from the fertile layer, and conventionally termed by us ‘undersized’. They averaged to 16, 8 % of the general number of seeds in a cone, a number of seeds of a normal size (‘fullsized’ ones) being 83, 2 %. Further analysis of empty and <b>full-grained</b> seeds will allow to define tree specimens, which could serve a source of the seed material for the silver fir forests reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Decision tree (and its {{extensions}} such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forest) is {{a widely}} used machine learning algorithm, due to its practical effectiveness and model interpretability. With the emergence of big data, there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of decision tree. However, most existing attempts along this line suffer from high communication costs. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree), to tackle this challenge. After partitioning the training data onto a number of (e. g., M) machines, this algorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For local voting, the top-k attributes are selected from each machine according to its local data. Then, globally top- 2 k attributes are determined by a majority voting among these local candidates. Finally, the <b>full-grained</b> histograms of the globally top- 2 k attributes are collected from local machines {{in order to identify}} the best (most informative) attribute and its split point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent {{of the total number of}} attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal decision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly outperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency...|$|E
