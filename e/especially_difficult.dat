All {{household}} members were punished by death if a Jew was found concealed in their home or on their property.

5|$|Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler {{continued}} and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, {{or at least}} differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution <b>especially</b> <b>difficult,</b> a problem compounded by the workshop system. It {{was not until the}} late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the attributions generally accepted today were established.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Clásica de Almería, Milan–San Remo, Gent–Wevelgem, the Tour of Flanders, the Scheldeprijs, the Grand Prix Pino Cerami, Paris–Roubaix, the Amstel Gold Race, and the Vuelta a La Rioja, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 12th {{in any of these}} races. Paris–Roubaix figured as an <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> day for the team, as Alan Pérez was the team's only classified finisher and was well down in 107th place on the day.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> for Jodie Foster, who was hounded relentlessly {{by the media}} during 1981 because she was Hinckley's target of obsession. Since then, Foster has only commented on Hinckley on three occasions: a press conference {{a few days after}} the attack, an Esquire magazine article she wrote in 1982, and during an interview with Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes II in 1999; she has otherwise ended or canceled several interviews after the event was mentioned or if the interviewer was going to bring up Hinckley.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} computational cognitive models of web-navigation like CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS+ to model 1) user interactions with search engines and 2) individual differences in search behavior due to variations in cognitive factors such as aging. CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS+ were extended to predict user clicks on search engine result pages. Their performance was evaluated using actual behavioral data from an experiment in which two types of information search tasks (simple vs. difficult), were presented to younger and older participants. The {{results showed that the}} model predictions matched significantly better with the actual user behavior on difficult tasks compared to simple tasks and with younger participants compared to older participants, <b>especially</b> for <b>difficult</b> tasks. Also, the matches were significantly better with CoLiDeS+ compared to CoLiDeS, <b>especially</b> for <b>difficult</b> tasks. We conclude that the advanced capabilities of CoLiDeS+ such as incorporating contextual information and implementing backtracking strategies enable it to predict user behavior significantly better than CoLiDeS, <b>especially</b> on <b>difficult</b> tasks. The usefulness of these modeling outcomes for the design of support systems for older adults is discussed...|$|R

5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|While the Carthaginians were in {{the process}} of {{defeating}} the cavalry, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle <b>especially</b> <b>difficult</b> for the infantrymen.|$|E
