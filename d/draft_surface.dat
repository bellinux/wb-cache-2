40|$|Abstract. Paper-based {{material}} has been frequently used {{as part of}} packaging solution as an option towards reducing municipal solid waste generation. Various studies on mechanical behaviour of paper-pulp packaging material have been conducted based on the machining direction and cross machining direction. However, there is still gap of information on paper-pulp packaging material behaviour at diagonal direction. A study has been conducted to investigate the variability to tensile properties of paper-pulp packaging at various packaging section (<b>draft</b> and base <b>surface)</b> and different specimen orientation (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal direction). In this research, results from the stress-strain relationship obtained from tensile and compression tests are presented. The data obtained are further analysed using ANOVA {{to find out whether}} material variations are significantly different with varying sections and orientations. Findings in this research supported the anisotropic properties of paper-based packaging material. <b>Draft</b> <b>surfaces</b> exhibit weaker strength than base surface.

40|$|Final {{published}} versionData {{are presented}} from {{a survey by}} airborne scanning laser profilometer and an AUV-mounted, upward looking swath sonar in the spring Beaufort Sea. The air-snow (surface elevation) and water-ice (<b>draft)</b> <b>surfaces</b> were mapped at 1 x 1 m resolution over a 300 x 300 m area. Data were separated into level and deformed ice fractions using the surface roughness of the sonar data. The relation (R = d/f) between <b>draft,</b> d, and <b>surface</b> elevation, f, was then examined. Correlation between {{top and bottom surfaces}} was essentially zero at full resolution, requiring averaging over patches of at least 11 m diameter to constrain the relation largely because of the significant error (similar to 15 cm) of the laser instrument. Level ice points were concentrated in two core regions, corresponding to level FY ice and refrozen leads, with variations in R attributed primarily to positive snow thickness variability. Deformed ice displayed a more diffuse "cloud," with draft having a more important role in determining R because of wider deformed features underwater. Averaging over footprints similar to satellite altimeters showed the mean surface elevation (typical of ICESat) to be stable with averaging scale, with R = 3. 4 (level) and R = 4. 2 (deformed). The "minimum elevation within a footprint" characteristic reported for CryoSat was less stable, significantly overestimating R for level ice (R > 5) and deformed ice (R > 6). The mean draft difference between measurements and isostasy suggests 70 m as an isostatic length scale for level ice. The isostatic scale for deformed ice appears to be longer than accessible with these data (> 300 m). University of Delaware. Department of Geography...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Flattening was performed in ball rolling mill in which cylindrical rollershave been replaced with balls of ~ 15 mm diameter. Due to small dimensions to be measured we suggested themethod of vector measurement of digital image. In order to evaluate the influence of technological parameters offlattening process, experimental planning method was used. The adoption of fractional experiment plan of 35 - 1 typeenabled to reduce the number of experiments to 81, despite 5 variables. Findings: The results of performed tests have shown that strip spread is dependent on ball roughness, used draft,relation of wire diameter to ball diameter, back tension stress. The influence of tension stress has not been proved. Strip flatness depends on used draft. Observations have proved good quality of strip edges. No fractures have beendetected, even in the case of flattening by means of big <b>draft.</b> Strip <b>surface</b> was of good quality. Research limitations/implications: Test results we have obtained indicate usefulness of research methodthat has been used as far as determination of influence of flattening process technological parameters on spreadand strip geometrical properties are concerned. It has also been proved that it is purposeful to replace cylindricalrollers with balls in rolling mills. Practical implications: Flattening process mathematical models enable to assess rational procedure of flatteningprocess parameters selection in a ball rolling mill, that determines obtaining of the required geometrical characteristicsof strips. The results can be used directly when manufacturing strips for springs made of stainless steel 1. 4310. Originality/value: Uniform thickness throughout strip width, parallel flat surfaces, narrow dimension tolerance,good surface quality and naturally rounded side edges make it presumable that flattening method by means of ballshapedtools is likely to become an accepted method of metal strips with required flatness manufacturing...|$|R

The analysis was based on municipal spatial acts applicable between 2003 (Spatial constituents of the long-term plans of the respective municipalities) and 2010 (Municipal spatial plans of the respective municipalities). The legislation was studied prior to carrying out the analysis, and a comparative table of intended spatial use categories was prepared {{on the basis of}} the regulations, which further enabled a <b>draft</b> of <b>surface</b> inventories for each municipality. The changes were also established with the aid of selected socio-economic indicators, such as the number of residential, central, production, green and transport surfaces per capita, and others. The results revealed a minor increase in construction land, which was harmonised with the objectives of ZPNačrt (Spatial Planning Act, 2007) due to the fixing of settlement boundaries and building on construction land plots that had not yet been built up. Only Roma settlements are expected to expand, due to the increasing population. The Murska Sobota-Lendava motorway connection revealed the greatest non-compliance in construction land recorded in both municipal spatial acts; it also resulted in the destruction of the best agricultural land. This finding rebutted ARSO claims (ARSO, 2011) that the destruction of the best agricultural land was the result of residential and commercial construction. Renaturation took place in two of the municipalities (Črenšovci and Tišina) i. e. with the conversion of unutilised space intended for commercial zones into agricultural land and by minimising the marginal section of the settlements. In the final part of diploma paper we find that the expansion trend of the intended use of space is consistent with the trend of demographic and economic development, as the negative demographic trend does not increase the living area. With the high unemployment rate there is increase in areas earmarked for economic and productive land. It would be reasonable to compare the result of analysis with the changes in actual land use and in that way follow the objectives within the municipal spatial planning documents. ...|$|R

The use of air cushions to support marine vehicles, heavy floating structures and in other operation is well known. The main problem in Multi-purpose Amphibious Vehicles (MAV) {{is the amount of}} power needed in order to overcome the hydrodynamic resistance acting on the hull which is included the frictional and pressure resistances. Therefore, more power is needed to move the MAV forward. In this respect, more fuel will be required to operate the amphibious vehicles. This problem could be effectively reduced by the introduction of the air cushion concept. With the air being drawn from top of craft to the cavity below the hull will produce some cushioning effect and also help to reduce skin friction drag. In this paper, air cushion effect will be studied in rigid surface cavity instead of using flexible skirts. This would avoid the problem of high maintenance due to replacement of damaged skirts. Finally, the MAV will be supported using air cavity and bubbles generated by an air pump (compressor and air pressure vessel) to pushes the hull of multi-purpose amphibious vehicle up and reduce the frictional resistance due to <b>draft</b> and wetted <b>surface</b> reduction and layer of air between hull surface and water.

The inclusion of matters of the environment, which will be lent additional weight in the future, should take place on this level already. The regionally based assessment of landscape ecological matters is an important basis for the evaluation of concrete measures or scenarios for the further development. Due to the fact that the registration, processing and evaluation of ecologically relevant data is only efficient and sufficiently up to date using computer assisted methods, t he use of Geo-Information Systems (GIS) is increasing in importance in landscape ecology especially. Using a section of the central part of the Saxonian Vogtland (Plauen map sheet), we can see the possibilities, but also the limitations, of a GIS assisted landscape-ecological evaluation in medium scale. In t he field of nature and landscape conservation, particular attention is paid to sensitive areas, the description of the structural variety of the landscape, the slicing of free areas as well as the networking of biotope structures. In this way, indicators which are relevant for the planning, such as Ökoton length (boundary length between 2 types of biotope), level of slicing and networking can be determined and depicted in their spatial surroundings with the aid of analysis functions. Using the example of the natural recreational suitability, it is demonstrated how a complete evaluation can take place, which is able to provide a well suited, differentiated picture for maximum size statements, using the overlapping of various influential factors. By allocating building sites in the settlement periphery to a greater extent in the course of economic structural transformation, there are conflicts of use in the examined area of the Vogtland, particularly in rural and sensitive areas. The statistical and region-related analysis of these helps in defining conflict potential. Ecological evaluation is constantly faced with the accusation of being subjective. The use of GIS for the purposes of landscape ecology and regional planning will not change this situation in general, but offers through various possibilities of quantitative analysis a new quality of complex, regional observations on the scale level which is required. This should be given consideration for future planning and monitoring tasks, even if an ecological evaluation can only ever be made against the background of social desires and conceptions of the value attributed to the natural regions...|$|R

The Hodge star operator on 1 -forms induces a complex structure on X. This structure is integrable, so that X is a complex curve. The metric on X is automatically Kähler, and the Kähler form ω agrees with the volume form. 1. 2 Unitary connections on Hermitian line bundles Let L be a complex line bundle over X with Hermitian metric. Up to isomorphism, this is determined by its degree deg(L). The curvature form FA of a unitary connection A on L is an imaginary 2 -form on X, and (i/ 2 π) FA is the first Chern form. It represents the first (real) Chern class of L. Conversely, every representative comes from such a connection. We may write FA = ˆFA ω with the imaginary function ˆFA = ∗FA on X. If the connection A has a harmonic curvature form, the curvature form is a (locally) constant multiple of the volume form, and conversely. In that case, i 2 π FA = deg(L) vol(X) ω, or equivalently i ˆFA = 2 π deg(L) /vol(X), as integration shows. If A is a unitary connection on L, the complex structure on X splits the covariant differential: dA = ∂ A + ∂ A. The operator ∂ A defines a holomorphic structure on L. Conversely, a holomorphic structure and the Hermitian metric determine a unique connection, the Chern connection...|$|R
40|$|Deployable aeroshells {{offer the}} promise of {{achieving}} larger aeroshell surface areas for entry vehicles than otherwise attainable without deployment. With the larger surface area comes the ability to decelerate high-mass entry vehicles at relatively low ballistic coefficients. However, for an aeroshell to perform even at the low ballistic coefficients attainable with deployable aeroshells, a flexible thermal protection system (TPS) is required {{that is capable of}} surviving reasonably high heat flux and durable enough to survive the rigors of construction handling, high density packing, deployment, aerodynamic loading and aerothermal heating. The Program for the Advancement of Inflatable Decelerators for Atmospheric Entry (PAIDAE) is tasked with developing the technologies required to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) of inflatable deployable aeroshells, and one of several of the technologies PAIDAE is developing for use on inflatable aeroshells is flexible TPS. Several flexible TPS layups were designed, based on commercially available materials, and tested in NASA Langley Research Center's 8 Foot High Temperature Tunnel (8 ft HTT). The TPS layups were designed for, and tested at three different conditions that are representative of conditions seen in entry simulation analyses of inflatable aeroshell concepts. Two conditions were produced in a single run with a sting-mounted dual wedge test fixture. The dual wedge test fixture had one row of sample mounting locations (forward) at about half the running length of the top surface of the wedge. At about two thirds of the running length of the wedge, a second test <b>surface</b> <b>drafted</b> up at five degrees relative to the first test surface established the remaining running length of the wedge test fixture. A second row of sample mounting locations (aft) was positioned {{in the middle of the}} running length of the second test surface. Once the desired flow conditions were established in the test section the dual wedge test fixture, oriented at 5 degrees angle of attack down, was injected into the flow. In this configuration the aft sample mounting location was subjected to roughly twice the heat flux and surface pressure of the forward mounting location. The tunnel was run at two different conditions for the test series: 1) 'Low Pressure', and 2) 'High Pressure'. At 'Low Pressure' conditions the TPS layups were tested at 6 W/cm 2 and 11 W/cm 2 while at 'High Pressure' conditions the TPS layups were tested at 11 W/cm 2 and 20 W/cm 2.

Kinetics in {{treatment}} plants: There were no generally accepted testing and calculation methods, validated by way of examples, for a realistic assessment of the behavior of substances in treatment plants. At the start of the project there was a draft standard for a continuous testing method to predict the concentration of water-soluble substances in the treatment plant discharge (OECD 303 A, <b>Draft).</b> Kinetics in <b>surface</b> waters: Since 1996 there has been a draft standard for a batch test to determine the degradation of substances in very small concentrations in surface waters (ISO 14592, Part 1, Draft). There are already some computer models in existence which simulate the water quality of running water courses (e. g. GREATER, ATV Model, EUSES, RIVAL). Kinetics in standard test methods: The importance of standard tests to predict the PEC of a substance was discussed at a SETAC workshop in 1996. The workshop came to the conclusion that all the OECD standard test methods are geared more to classifying the kinetic parameters rather than to determining them and that the testing systems need to be extended and complemented by appropriate, highly efficient modeling. It was the aim of the project to make the data from standard tests more useful and to develop laboratory test methods and simulation models which describe the elimination of individual substances in treatment plants and surface waters more precisely and contribute to a more realistic determination of the PEC.

40|$|The {{area of the}} Southern Ocean {{covered by}} sea ice is {{relatively}} well described by a longterm time series of satellite observations spanning over 35 years. Throughout the seasonal cycle, Antarctic sea-ice cover varies between approximately 3 x 10 ⁶ km² {{at the end of}} summer to approximately 20 x 10 ⁶ km² during winter. This has profound implications for ocean-atmosphere heat and momentum exchange and also for global oceanic circulation induced by sea-ice production and melt. However, the thickness distribution of Antarctic sea-ice is poorly described. Without detailed knowledge of the distribution of sea-ice thickness (and hence volume) it is difficult to assess the magnitude of its influence, and its feedback within the ocean-ice-atmosphere system. Current estimates of the sea-ice thickness distribution derived from satellite-based altimetry rely on empirical models describing the relationship between sea-ice topography, snow depth and sea-ice draft. The input to these empirical models include approximations for the density of snow, sea ice and seawater, and relationships between snow depth and the total freeboard (ice + snow) of sea ice derived from sparse in-situ observations. Further, observations from comparatively lower resolution satellite altimetry remain insensitive to small scale features that often characterise sea ice. This research estimates high-resolution sea-ice thickness from airborne nadir-looking photography and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), deployed over East Antarctic pack ice between 2007 and 2012. It presents a detailed analysis of empirical models for snow depth estimation derived from in-situ observations. For altimetry without coincident methods to remotely sense the snow/ice interface, using an empirical relationship between snow depth and measured elevation is the only available means to estimate snow depth. This represents a novel direct comparison between empirical snow depth models and in situ observations at scales of less than hundreds of metres. Examination of sources of uncertainty in altimetry observations follow, with the development of a method for deriving the uncertainty of each point position in a LiDAR swath. This allows the rigorous propagation of uncertainties from the airborne instruments through to snow depth and ice thickness estimates. A unique comparison of draft estimates from airborne LiDAR with sea-ice draft mapped by upward looking SONAR from an underwater robot forms a key component of this research. SONAR-based ice drafts are used to empirically derive parameters for the ice thickness model applied to airborne LiDAR observations. Using the same small patch of sea ice, relationships between surface and under-ice features are explored, providing a unique insight into how well ice <b>drafts</b> derived from <b>surface</b> topography characterise the under-ice environment. The empirically derived model parameters from this exercise are then applied to a larger-scale dataset, which is compared to near-coincident ship-based visual sea-ice observations (using the ASPeCt protocol). Using in situ and sonar observations collected by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to inform parameter choices for modelling sea ice thickness from LiDAR altimetry, a close match between sub-floe scale ice draft from AUV and LiDAR-derived estimates was obtained. The ice density parameter used in the model was artificially high, at 915. 6 kgm³ compared to observed values which ranged from 800 kg m³ to 870 kg m³ on SIPEX-II. The distribution of ice keels associated with surface ridges was broadly similar in both AUV observations and LiDAR-derived estimates, although keels modelled using surface topography are narrower and deeper than keels present in the AUV observations. Smallscale topography was also added at the ice-ocean interface for draft estimates from airborne LiDAR, reflecting the influence of snow dunes at the surface. Importantly, co registration of in situ, AUV and airborne observations shows clearly that in situ observations captured only the thinnest and least deformed region of the surveyed ice floe. At a broader scale, the knowledge gained from validating sea ice thickness estimates over a single floe was applied to a 120 km flight leg with a near-coincident ASPeCt ship-based ice thickness observations. The distribution of ice thickness estimates from airborne LiDAR exhibited a shallow peak in the 3 m to 4 m range, where ship-based observations were predominantly showing ice thicknesses between 1 m to 2 m. This pattern is also seen for the smaller floe-scale study, suggesting that in situ observations for regions of deformed ice off East Antarctica may only represent one tail of the sea-ice thickness distribution. The implications for the use of in situ observations in tuning algorithms for satellite-based estimates of sea-ice thickness are clear, suggesting a bias toward thin ice especially in regions of heavy deformation. This work advocates for the combination of multiple observation types and techniques given their ability to offer insight into biases that affect a particular method at a particular spatial scale. Technologies spanning in situ, airborne and satellite platforms have a strong and integrated future in sea-ice observation...|$|R
