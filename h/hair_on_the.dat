5|$|After sacrificing an animal, another {{important}} rite of Hajj is shaving head or trimming hair (known as Halak). All male pilgrims shave their head or trim their <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of Eid al Adha and women pilgrims cut {{the tips of}} their hair.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{patch of}} <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor. Since these patches become enlarged during breeding season, {{they are likely}} {{used to make a}} scent trail to allow fishers to find each other so that they can mate.|$|E
5|$|A Dandie Dinmont Terrier {{is a small}} Scottish {{breed of}} dog in the terrier family. The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a {{distinctive}} topknot of <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head. A character in Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering has lent the name to the breed, with Dandie Dinmont thought {{to be based on}} James Davidson, who is credited as being the originator of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.|$|E

50|$|Adetomyrma cilium is {{only known}} from males. The male of A. cilium is {{distinguished}} easily {{from the other}} Adetomyrma males {{by a combination of}} long <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eye, long suberect <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anterior surface of the mesofemur, and a well-developed subpetiolar process.|$|R

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the addax's coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 Abismo Negro won {{the hair}} of the Panther in Lucha del reves match, a contenst where two masked wrestlers put their <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line instead of their mask. On September 7, 2001 Abismo Negro won another Lucha del reves match, {{defeating}} El Alebrije. In December 2002, Negro and Mini Abismo Negro {{made it to the}} finals of a tournament to crown the first ever AAA Mascot Tag Team Champions but lost to Mascara Sagrada and Mascarita Sagrada. Negro qualified for the Rey de Reyes (2003) final, but La Parka, Jr. once again defeated him. In 2004, LLL was phased out in favor of a new super group known as La Legión Extranjera or the Foreign Legion in English, which meant that Los Vipers now regularly teamed with foreign wrestlers, especially NWA-TNA performers such as Abyss.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 50 mm for males. Adult {{males have}} a hairy red {{body with a}} pale plume of <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tail and pale <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thorax and head.

50|$|Hirticlavula elegans fruit {{bodies are}} highly distinctive. The {{characteristic}} hairy stems {{are very different}} from those of any other species in the Clavariaceae. Hairy stems are seen among more distant relatives, including members of Typhula, Pistillina and Pterula. However, the hairs of H. elegans are specialised structures containing numerous cells, while <b>the</b> more irregular <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stems of the other species are merely branched hyphae. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> H. elegans stems thicken at the furthest point from the stem, while any <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stems of other known species of clavarioid fungi thin at the end.|$|R
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is {{medium-sized}} for its genus, being larger than, for example, O.bicolor, but {{smaller than}} O.concolor and O.mamorae. Its short, soft, and fine fur is bright ochraceous brown to pale tawny on the upperparts, changing moderately abruptly into the generally gray underparts. The fur on the chin, throat, {{and part of}} the belly is entirely white. The head is more grayish {{than the rest of the}} upperparts and the eyelids are black. Short hairs thinly cover the external ears, which are brown to gray-brown in color. The short and broad hindfeet are dirty white and show some characters that are typical of the genus, including well-developed pads and tufts of <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> digits and a long fifth digit. The tail is slightly longer than the head and body on average, but relatively short for the genus. It is uniformly brown, but with a somewhat paler portion below near its base. Sparsely haired, the tail ends in a rudimentary pencil. There is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that}} the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ears short {{can be used as}} a preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
50|$|Workers {{can range}} from 3.5 to 7.5 mm in length. The queen ant's size {{can range from}} 4 to 10 mm. This species can be {{distinguished}} from other subgenus by little amounts of erect <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gena, limited erect <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clypeal disc and finally by the color which is a concolorous dark brown-black.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Mexico, Stock signed with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), AAA's rival promotion. She began working regularly for CMLL as Dark Angel in the promotion's newly-rebuilt women's division, while also working for various independent promotions. On March 25, 2005, she defeated Princesa Sujei to win Federación Internacional de Lucha Libre Women's Championship. On September 9, Stock {{was one of}} two winners, along with Marcela, of a Torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine who would get to battle for the vacant CMLL World Women's Championship. However, on September 16, at CMLL's 72nd Anniversary Show, Marcela defeated Stock to win the title. Afterwards, Stock entered a feud with La Amapola, which concluded on April 14, 2006, when Stock put her <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line against Amapola's mask. Stock ended up winning the match and forcing Amapola to unmask herself.|$|E
5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E
