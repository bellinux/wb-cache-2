500|$|The {{photographer}} Charles Brittin, {{who knew}} Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her [...] "a sweet {{person with a}} great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be". Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having [...] "many different crowds of friends, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a different personality with each crowd... She wasn't an even personality at all, but she was always a very gracious person." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There {{was something about}} that kid's personality that really came off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special. Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make it easy on Scully. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an eye on her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. Jackson recorded the whole album, but A label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album. She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track, titled [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records. Jam remembered, [...] "She was sitting outside in the lounge and said, 'Man, that's a funky track. Who's that for?' And we said, 'It's for you', and she said, 'Oh, cool'. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very pleased when she heard the track".|$|E

500|$|McKellen's {{father was}} a civil {{engineer}} and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent. Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a [...] "strict, evangelical Protestant minister" [...] in Ballymena, County Antrim. His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. [...] "My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met." [...] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father {{died when he was}} 24. After his coming out of the closet to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, {{who was a member of}} the Religious Society of Friends, he said, [...] "Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore." [...] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a [...] "grandfather of the modern weekend".|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E

[...] He defended the FBI's recommendation against bringing charges because it [...] "… would have been unfair and virtually unprecedented …" ...|$|E

2500|$|Richards said, [...] "I’ve been {{a friend}} to Texas film since {{the number of people}} who cared about Texas film could have fit in a phone booth." [...] She was an {{advocate}} for the Texas film industry and traveled to Los Angeles to market her state. Gary Bond, the director of the Austin Film Commission, noted, [...] "She was far from being the first governor to appoint a film commissioner; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the first that really brought the focus of Hollywood to Texas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rollins {{said that}} he had {{conducted}} a thorough internal investigation into Harris's ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges. Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, [...] "her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don't tell the same story twice ... Maybe you don't think you did anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may perjure yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don't think she set out to violate the law, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very careless. She heard whatever she wanted to hear, but we could find no evidence whatsoever that this was a project going into her district." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "He {{has that}} wall up, and it's not {{necessarily}} his fault; it's his past that has built the wall. I think maybe Babe had unrealistic expectations hoping, 'Oh, with time he'll let me in.' Well, it's their second marriage {{and they have}} a child together and it still has not changed. That wall is not budging." [...] Havins continued, [...] "Babe can only take so much. Plus, her husband tried to kill her. I honestly think, in a way, this is a hint of a delayed reaction, emotionally, to that." [...] Havins felt that JR's murder attempt on Babe seemingly came out of nowhere: It happened so fast, and the resolve was {{in the blink of an}} eye. I would walk away for a lot less! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so wanting to get that family unit back on track that she didn't allow herself the proper time to heal. Then, on top of it, here's Josh. Everything she wants to feel with her husband she's feeling with Josh, and that's what's missing, because JR doesn't talk.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> eager {{for me to go}} into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People said to my mother, 'Are you letting that girl go to that awful place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
2500|$|Foster also {{acted in}} another film {{nominated}} for the Palme d'Or in 1976, Bugsy Malone. The British musical parodied films about Prohibition Era gangsters by having all roles played by children; Foster appeared in a major supporting role as a star of a speakeasy show. Its director Alan Parker was impressed by her, saying that [...] "she takes such an intelligent interest {{in the way the}} film is being made that if I had been run over by a bus <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> probably the only person on the set able to take over as director." [...] She gained several positive notices for her performance: Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "at thirteen she was already getting the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore", Variety described her as [...] "outstanding", and Vincent Canby of The New York Times called her [...] "the star of the show". Foster's two BAFTAs were awarded jointly for her performances in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Her third film release in spring 1976 was the independent drama Echoes of a Summer, which had been filmed two years previously. The New York Times named Foster's performance as a terminally ill girl the film's [...] "main strength" [...] and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune stated that she [...] "is not a good child actress; she's just a good actress", although both reviewers otherwise panned the film.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{came to know}} Ann {{first as}} a moviegoer. I’d walk into various movie theaters and see the white hair up above the stadium seating. That’s how you'd know she was there. People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
