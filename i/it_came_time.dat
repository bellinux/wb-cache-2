5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson {{at the top}} of their lists when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck to fool him into believing it. This seemed to manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed he could take Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E

Years later, during the early seasons of The Simpsons, when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose Abraham, unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.|$|E

5|$|When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to {{translate}} The Black Island, {{which is set}} in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true-to-life; such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had {{compiled a list of}} 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking Studios Hergé to rework it completely. The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today. , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E
5|$|When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to {{kill off}} Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time}} to create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E

Schultz's first trial ended in a deadlock; prior to his second trial, Schultz had the venue moved to Malone, New York, then moved there and {{garnered}} the sympathy of the townspeople through charitable acts so that when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> for his trial, the jury found him innocent, liking him too much to convict him.|$|E
25|$|The Drillers {{success was}} {{noted by the}} league, and when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> for the annual All-Star game both Pat Onstad and coach Ongaro were {{selected}} to represent the club.

As the season progressed, their winning ways continued, and with only two games remaining (both home contests against the St. Louis Ambush), the Drillers needed only one win to clinch the conference title.|$|E

During Woodrow Wilson's administration (from which she was banned in 1916 for a bawdy joke at Wilson's expense), Alice worked against the entry of the United States into the League of Nations.|$|E
25|$|When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to {{consider}} further tramline closures in the mid-1930s, the Board {{decided to go}} with A.E.C. diesel buses as they felt the technology had matured {{to the point where}} they were a reliable option. Though the trolley buses introduced only a few years earlier had performed well and found favour with passengers, their dependence on fixed infrastructure did not suit the Board's preference for operational flexibility. The first order for ten chassis was placed with A.E.C. in 1935–1936.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} that Italy held the {{territory}} by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, {{which was to be}} incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> to integrate the two parts.|$|E

25|$|Caddy was {{inducted}} into the United States Marine Corps through the Selective Service system on October 27, 1943 and was put on inactive duty until November 10, 1943 when he was ordered to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, for recruit training. While attending recruit training Caddy received training on several weapons in use at the time including the Reising sub-machine gun, Browning automatic rifle, M-1 carbine, bayonet and the hand grenade.

25|$|In 1996, Pillman {{had left}} the Horsemen, but they added Steve McMichael and his wife Debra in June, which didn't sit well with Woman.

The Four Horsemen were often given {{interview}} time on Nitro and when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> for Debra to speak on the mic, she'd often go into a soliloquy regarding Woman's looks and fashion sense — usually when the two weren't within the vicinity of each other. Despite the heavy tension, the two managers never had a physical altercation.|$|E
