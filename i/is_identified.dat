5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|Jesus' {{childhood}} home <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> in the gospels of Luke and Matthew {{as the town}} of Nazareth in Galilee, where {{he lived with his}} family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter. His other family members—his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned in the gospels and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Some Vaishnava {{literature}} reverentially link Shiva to {{characters in}} its mythologies.

5|$|The {{function}} of the lungs can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes.

5|$|The {{single tooth}} of Trapalcotherium <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> as a lower molar {{because it has}} two {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps; as a first molar because it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as labial, {{in the direction of}} the lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, the direction of the tongue). The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide. Part of the back labial corner is missing.|$|E

5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a glyph <b>is</b> <b>identified,</b> and {{the rest}} is discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ glyph which retains most of its original shape (except for the addition of the ‘defining feature’). This is done {{in such a way that}} aesthetic unity is maintained. Typically, either one or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E
5|$|Units can now level up in battle, {{increasing}} their capabilities. Units increase their level once for each enemy unit that they destroy. The level of each unit <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> as I, II, or Vet, with Vet being the highest level. While units {{with higher levels}} are more powerful than new units, the power increase is slight. Unit experience is not persistent, and the player begins each mission with new units.|$|E
5|$|Vimala <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> {{with the}} goddesses Katyayini, Durga, Bhairavi, Bhuvaneshvari and Ekanamsha in various texts and rituals.

5|$|A fragmentary molar, {{preserving}} two cusps, <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> {{as from a}} multituberculate. Although multituberculates {{are common}} in nearly contemporaneous deposits in Laurasia, this tooth {{is one of the}} few records from Gondwana; a few fragmentary remains, the multituberculate affinities of some of which are disputed, are also known from South America (Argentodites), Africa (Hahnodon), and Australia (Corriebaatar). Another fragmentary tooth, UA 8699, is recognizable as a tribosphenic lower molar. Krause identified it in 2001 as a marsupial, but in 2003 a group led by Alexander Averianov instead argued that the tooth was placental and related to zhelestids (a primitive group possibly related to ungulates). Both placentals and marsupials are mostly known from Laurasia during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> with Central Europe).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
