In the frequency domain, the generalised damping matrix and the <b>generalised</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix of the stochastic computational reduced-order model are random frequency-dependent matrices. Due to the causality of the dynamical system, these two frequency-dependent random matrices are statistically dependent and their probabilistic model involves a Hilbert transform. In this paper, a computational analysis of the propagation of uncertainties is presented for a composite viscoelastic structure in the frequency range...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -month-old {{dachshund}} {{was presented}} with a recent history of episodic muscle rippling and <b>generalised</b> <b>stiffness.</b> An uncoordinated gait was present since eight weeks of age. On presentation the dog showed cerebellar-like ataxia and poor menace responses. Myokymic contractions were visible in the appendicular and truncal muscles and neuromyotonic discharges were detected by electromyography. Central components of the brain auditory evoked potentials were absent and the onset latencies of the tibial sensory-evoked potentials recorded at the lumbar intervertebral level were delayed. Response to slow-release phenytoin was temporary. The clinical picture together with the electrophysiological findings in this dachshund are identical to the findings in Jack Russell terriers with hereditary ataxia and neuromyotonia. This is the first description of neuromyotonia associated with clinical and electrophysiological signs of spinocerebellar ataxia in a breed other than the Jack Russell terrier. This case also strengthens the theory that spinocerebellar ataxia and neuromyotonia are related. An ion channel dysfunction is presumed to link both disorders...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the association between}} joint complaints and locomotor disability. METHODS [...] During a home interview survey 1901 men and 3135 women aged 55 years and over (the Rotterdam Study) were asked about joint pain and morning stiffness in the past month, and locomotor disability was assessed by six questions from the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). RESULTS [...] The prevalence of locomotor disability was 24. 5 % for men and 40. 5 % for women. The prevalence of joint pain in men was 0. 7 % for pain in the hips, knees, and feet simultaneously, 3. 7 % for pain at two joint sites, 16. 0 % for pain at one joint site, and 20. 4 % for pain in the hips and/or knees and/or feet (any joint site); the corresponding estimates for women were 1. 9 %, 9. 0 %, 23. 7 %, and 34. 5 %, respectively. The prevalence of <b>generalised</b> morning <b>stiffness</b> was 4. 9 % for men and 10. 4 % for women. The age adjusted odds ratios for locomotor disability in men ranged from 2. 4 of pain at one joint site to 8. 8 of pain at all three joint sites; for women these odds ratios varied between 2. 5 and 5. 7, respectively. The age adjusted odds ratios of <b>generalised</b> morning <b>stiffness</b> were 8. 0 for men and 7. 3 for women. CONCLUSION [...] There is a strong and independent association between locomotor disability and age, joint pain, and <b>generalised</b> morning <b>stiffness</b> in people aged 55 years and over. The odds for locomotor disability increase onefold for every year increase in age, while the presence of <b>generalised</b> morning <b>stiffness</b> is of greater influence than the presence of joint pain...|$|R

40|$|The paper summarises an {{approach}} to the forced vibration analysis of skeletal elastic structures, making use of "exact" matrix technique. The analysis {{is based on the}} modal superposition method, which has been developed in the context of models that retain characteristics of both distributed mass and stiffness. The free vibration analysis is performed using <b>generalised</b> dynamic <b>stiffness</b> functions appropriate to a Rayleigh-Timoshenko-Euler beam-column element. The contributions to dynamic displacements and dynamic internal forces by inertia effects during forced vibration are properly accounted for, and all results are obtained from explicit solutions to the relevant equations at all stages. Numerical integration or other approximate procedures are not required. It is the objective of the present paper to summarise procedures, numerical examples being available elsewhere (e. g. [1 - 3]). However, the paper is concluded with a practical example illustrating results obtainable by the techniques described below...|$|R
40|$|A 5 -year-old Arabian mare was {{referred}} {{for the investigation}} of recent behavioural change, <b>generalised</b> <b>stiffness,</b> and owner-reported polyuria and polydipsia. Clinical examination revealed severe pain associated with palpation along {{the entire length of}} the suspensory ligament (SL) and palmar soft tissues of the pastern regions of both forelimbs. Radiographs of the distal forelimbs demonstrated marked radiopaque striations within the straight sesamoidean ligaments (SSL), and less severe but similar changes in the regions of the SL branches. Ultrasonography of both distal forelimbs revealed multifocal, hyperechoic lesions within the SSLs. The SL bodies and branches were enlarged and had mixed echogenicity on ultrasound scan. The horse was euthanased at the ownerâ€™s request and submitted for post-mortem examination. Relevant gross findings were restricted to the SLs and SSLs of all four limbs, all of which contained severe mineralisation and irregularly arranged fibres. Histological examination revealed severe, multifocal to coalescing, dystrophic mineralization with cartilaginous and osseous metaplasia, which suggested a primary calcifying desmopathy affecting all four SLs and SSLs. Clinical findings in the case reported here were similar to that of degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD) previously reported by many authors, but diagnostic imaging and histopathological findings were significantly different...|$|E
40|$|In {{the finite}} element {{modelling}} of steel frames, external loads usually act along the members {{rather than at}} the nodes only. Conventionally, when a member is subjected to these transverse loads, they are converted to nodal forces which act at the ends of the elements into which the member is discretised by either lumping or consistent nodal load approaches. For a contemporary geometrically non-linear analysis in which the axial force in the member is large, accurate solutions are achieved by discretising the member into many elements, which can produce unfavourable consequences on the efficacy of the method for analysing large steel frames. Herein, a numerical technique to include the transverse loading in the non-linear stiffness formulation for a single element is proposed, and which is able to predict the structural responses of steel frames involving the effects of first-order member loads as well as the second-order coupling effect between the transverse load and the axial force in the member. This allows for a minimal discretisation of a frame for second-order analysis. For those conventional analyses which do include transverse member loading, prescribed stiffness matrices must be used for the plethora of specific loading patterns encountered. This paper shows, however, that the principle of superposition {{can be applied to the}} equilibrium condition, so that the form of the stiffness matrix remains unchanged with only the magnitude of the loading being needed to be changed in the stiffness formulation. This novelty allows for a very useful <b>generalised</b> <b>stiffness</b> formulation for a single higher-order element with arbitrary transverse loading patterns to be formulated. The results are verified using analytical stability function studies, as well as with numerical results reported by independent researchers on several simple structural frames...|$|E
40|$|In {{the finite}} element {{modelling}} of structural frames, external loads such as wind loads, dead loads and imposed loads usually act along the elements {{rather than at}} the nodes only. Conventionally, when an element is subjected to these general transverse element loads, they are usually converted to nodal forces acting at the ends of the elements by either lumping or consistent load approaches. In addition, it is especially important for an element subjected to the first- and second-order elastic behaviour, to which the steel structure is critically prone to; in particular the thin-walled steel structures, when the stocky element section may be generally critical to the inelastic behaviour. In this sense, the accurate first- and second-order elastic displacement solutions of element load effect along an element is vitally crucial, but cannot be simulated using neither numerical nodal nor consistent load methods alone, as long as no equilibrium condition is enforced in the finite element formulation, which can inevitably impair the structural safety of the steel structure particularly. It can be therefore regarded as a unique element load method to account for the element load nonlinearly. If accurate displacement solution is targeted for simulating the first- and second-order elastic behaviour on an element on the basis of sophisticated non-linear element stiffness formulation, the numerous prescribed stiffness matrices must indispensably be used for the plethora of specific transverse element loading patterns encountered. In order to circumvent this shortcoming, the present paper proposes a numerical technique to include the transverse element loading in the non-linear stiffness formulation without numerous prescribed stiffness matrices, and which is able to predict structural responses involving the effect of first-order element loads as well as the second-order coupling effect between the transverse load and axial force in the element. This paper shows that the principle of superposition can be applied to derive the generalized stiffness formulation for element load effect, so that the form of the stiffness matrix remains unchanged with respect to the specific loading patterns, but with only the magnitude of the loading (element load coefficients) being needed to be adjusted in the stiffness formulation, and subsequently the non-linear effect on element loadings can be commensurate by updating the magnitude of element load coefficients through the non-linear solution procedures. In principle, the element loading distribution is converted into a single loading magnitude at mid-span in order to provide the initial perturbation for triggering the member bowing effect due to its transverse element loads. This approach in turn sacrifices the effect of element loading distribution except at mid-span. Therefore, it can be foreseen that the load-deflection behaviour may not be as accurate as those at mid-span, but its discrepancy is still trivial as proved. This novelty allows for a very useful <b>generalised</b> <b>stiffness</b> formulation for a single higher-order element with arbitrary transverse loading patterns to be formulated. Moreover, another significance of this paper is placed on shifting the nodal response (system analysis) to both nodal and element response (sophisticated element formulation). For the conventional finite element method, such as the cubic element, all accurate solutions can be only found at node. It means no accurate and reliable structural safety can be ensured within an element, and as a result, it hinders the engineering applications. The results of the paper are verified using analytical stability function studies, as well as with numerical results reported by independent researchers on several simple frames...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{boundary}} {{conditions on the}} mode count and modal density of one- and two-dimensional structural systems, beams and plates, respectively, are investigated by using the wavenumber integration method. Bending vibrations are examined first for a single beam. In this case it is demonstrated that the average mode count is reduced by between 0 and 1 for each boundary constraint, {{depending on the type}} of boundary conditions. For more <b>generalised</b> mass and <b>stiffness</b> constraints a frequency-dependent coefficient, which need not lie between 0 and 1, is obtained. The effects of line constraints on the mode count of two-dimensional systems are similar to the equivalent one-dimensional constraints but they are always frequency dependent. Then the mode count of systems of multiple collinear beams and coplanar plates is studied. It is found that an intermediate constraint has the same effect on the average mode count as the same type of constraint applied at an end of the system. The modal density is largely independent of boundary conditions for one-dimensional systems although there are exceptions, while it is dependent on boundary conditions for two-dimensional systems. The results are compared with those from previously published formulae for natural frequencies and with results from finite element method (FEM) analysis. Inclusion of the effect of the boundary conditions in statistical energy analysis (SEA) estimations will result in improved agreements with both analytical and numerical results...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{fibromyalgia}} syndrome is a chronic disorder characterised by <b>generalised</b> pain, muscle <b>stiffness,</b> reduced physical condition and fatigue that limit their daily life activities. Little knowledge {{is available on}} the feasibility and effects of long-lasting physical training in warm water on major physical abilities related with everyday life in patients with FM. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the feasibility and effects of 8 months of supervised exercise therapy in warm water on physical function, fitness and disease impact in women with fibromyalgia. Methods: Thirty women with fibromyalgia [mean Â± SD] age 50. 8 Â± 8. 7 (years); body mass index 27. 7 Â± 4. 1 (kg/m 2); duration of symptoms 19. 8 Â± 7. 4 (years); number of tender points 17. 0 Â± 1. 0; number of specific drugs 1. 4 Â± 0. 8 (antidepressives, muscular relaxants and analgesics); were randomly assigned into 2 groups: an experimental group, performing 3 weekly sessions for 60 minutes of exercise therapy in warm water (n= 15); and a control group, continuing their usual care and habitual leisure-time activities (n= 15). Physical function and fitness were evaluated using the following tests: 10 -m maximal walking speed, 10 -step stair-climbing, blind one-leg stance, hand-grip dynamometry and Canadian Aerobic Fitness. The disease impact was evaluated using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The data was examined by applying statistical tests for the analyses of variances. Results: Patients in both groups were in a similar condition at baseline. After 8 months of exercise therapy, the experimental group showed improvements in several aspects of physical function and fitness, such as balance (30 %; p= 0. 031), maximal walking speed (6 %; p= 0. 006), stair-climbing capacity with no extra weight (14 %; p= 0. 003) and 10 kg-weighted (25 %; p = 0. 002) and maximal oxygen uptake (8 %; p= 0. 015). These patients also showed ameliorations of the disease impact in terms of pain (9 %; p = 0. 040), stiffness (53 %; p= 0. 015), anxiety (41 %; p= 0. 037), depression (28 %; p= 0. 030) and self-perceived physical function (20 %; p= 0. 047), with an overall reduction in the total FIQ score (18 %; p= 0. 017). Conclusion: 8 months of aquatic exercise therapy for fibromyalgia was feasible and led to relevant improvements in physical function and fitness, reducing the disease impact in FM women...|$|R
