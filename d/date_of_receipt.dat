[...] Malaysian police have arrested a resort owner after he allowed 13 Buddhists to use a Muslim prayer room(surau) for their meditation at [...] Kota Tinggi, Johor. The incident has been a frown upon Muslims in Malaysia. It has also become a hot topic in the social media. Following up at 28 August 2013, the controversial prayer room was demolished by the resort management within 21 days from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> of the notice after much protests by the residents of Kota Tinggi. At the time, Syed Ahmad Salim, the resort owner explained that he had allowed the group of Buddhists to use the surau for a meditation session as he was unaware that it was an offence.|$|E

We report the detection of sub-gauss surface magnetic fields on the normal, rapidly-rotating A-type star Vega and on the moderately-rotating Am star Sirius A. These magnetic detections constitute the first evidence that tepid stars that do not belong to the class of Ap/Bp stars can also host magnetized photospheres, suggesting that a significant fraction of stars in this mass regime are magnetic. We present here the observational clues gathered so far to progress towards understanding the physical processes at the origin of this newly identified Vega-like magnetism. c © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Difficulties occur when a large number of modes of oscillations with a low signal-to-noise ratio are observed. In those cases, it is of common use to apply a likelihood-ratio test to discriminate between the possible scenarios. We present here a statistical analysis of the likelihood-ratio test and discuss its accuracy to identify the correct modes. We use the AsteroFLAG artificial stars, simulated over a range of magnitude, inclination angle, and rotation rate. We show that the likelihood-ratio test is appropriate up to a certain magnitude (signal-to-noise ratio). c © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R

5000|$|The law {{assumes that}} future {{property}} {{is of no}} benefit to the life tenant, and thus must be sold to obtain income producing investments. The proceeds of sale are apportioned between the life tenant and the remainderman by using the formulae set out in Re Earl of Chesterfield's Trusts (1883) 24 Ch D 643. This provides that the sum which is reserved for the remainderman is the sum [...] "which, put out at 4 per cent. per annum ... and accumulating at compound interest at that rate with yearly rests, and deducting income tax at the standard rate, would, with accumulation of interest, have produced, at the respective <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt,</b> the amounts actually received; and that the aggregate of the sums so ascertained ought {{to be treated as}} principal and be applied accordingly, and the residue should be treated as income."

We find that on sub-parsec scales different emission lines are emitted by different regions with evidently different physical conditions. Kinematical properties of the ionized gas show evidence for moderately high (V ∼ 100 km s− 1) supersonic motions. [O III]λ 5007 emission {{is found to be}} multi-component and differs from lower-excitation [S II]λ 6717 line both in spatial and kinematical properties. Indirect evidence for very low characteristic densities of the gas (n ∼ 0. 1 cm− 3) is found. We propose radiative (possibly incomplete) shock waves in low-density, moderately high metallicity gas as the most probable candidate for the power source of the optical filament. Apparent nitrogen over-abundance is better understood if the location of W 50 in the Galaxy is taken into account. ...|$|R

The achieved performances for the first 2 years of the ACP are analysed, showing that half of all our classifications were made within 5 days from transient detection. The distribution of the supernova types of this sample resembles {{the distribution of the}} general list of all the supernovae listed in the Asiago SN catalog (ASNC 8, Barbon et al. 1999). Finally, we use our sub-sample of 78 core-collapse supernovae, for which we retrieve the host-galaxy morphology and r-band absolute magnitudes, to study the observed subtype distribution in dwarf compared to giant galaxies. This ongoing program will give its contribution to the classification of the large number of transients that will be soon delivered by the Gaia mission. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{presenting}} the characteristic features of Spanish library and information science journals, both their information quality as {{means of communication}} {{and the quality of}} the editorial process is analysed. The characteristic profile of the Spanish LIS journal is that of a young journal, under the auspices of a LIS professional association or university unit, published in Madrid, of long periodicity (annual/biannual), of general scope and audience, and with a consolidated editorial structure although not professionalised which is also medium-sized, recruited locally and preferably of academic affiliation. In general, Spanish LIS journals do not comply with international standards pertaining to scientific publication. Their main deficiencies are: lack of detailed instructions to authors; lack of information on manuscript selection and evaluation processes; missing translations of titles, abstracts and keywords; missing <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt,</b> acceptance and publication of originals. The editorial process presents important gaps insofar as publication dates are disregarded, author instructions are not followed, the system for manuscript revision and evaluation is not rigorous in the least, a system for the control, auditing and selfevaluation of journals is not in place and the management of the editorial process is very little professionalised.
