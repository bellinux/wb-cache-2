500|$|Diagnosis {{is made by}} {{studying}} {{the cause of the}} injury, physical examination and chest radiography. [...] Typical signs and symptoms include direct effects of the physical trauma, such as chest pain and coughing up blood, as well as signs that the body <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>receiving</b> enough oxygen, such as cyanosis. [...] The contusion frequently heals on its own with supportive care. Often nothing more than supplemental oxygen and close monitoring is needed; however, intensive care may be required. For example, if breathing is severely compromised, mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Fluid replacement may be required to ensure adequate blood volume, but fluids are given carefully since fluid overload can worsen pulmonary edema, which may be lethal.|$|E
