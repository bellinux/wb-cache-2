50|$|Qigong {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} set of practices that coordinate body (調身), breath (調息), and mind (調心) based on Chinese philosophy. Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, {{performed in a}} broad array of body postures. Qigong is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active qigong (dong gong), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive qigong (jing gong), with still positions and inner movement of the breath. From a therapeutic perspective, qigong can be classified into two systems:1) <b>internal</b> <b>qigong,</b> which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and;2) external qigong, which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits qi.|$|E
40|$|Objectives Qigong {{has been}} {{recommended}} to improve health and prevent disease {{but the evidence}} is inconclusive. The aim of this overview was to critically evaluate all systematic reviews (SRs) of qigong {{for the treatment of}} any condition or symptom. Design Literature searches were carried out in 11 electronic databases for all systematic reviews of the effectiveness of qigong in any indication. Reviews were defined as systematic if they included an explicit and repeatable methods section describing the search strategy and explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria. Setting Retrospective review of medical database. Participants Participants with any type of medical conditions of any severity were included. Main outcome measures Evidence from each systematic review. Results Ten systematic reviews were included. They related {{to a wide range of}} conditions. The primary studies and several of the reviews were associated with a high risk of bias. Five reviews concluded that qigong is effective and five reviews were inconclusive. Conclusion The effectiveness of qigong is based mostly on poor quality research. Therefore, it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage. Background Qigong has become a popular form of comp-lementary and alternative medicine. Proponents of qigong recommend it for a wide range of con-ditions, symptoms and situations, including stress management, hypertension, chronic pain, depression, insomnia, cardiac rehabilitation, immune function and for enhancing the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients. 1 Qigong has been practised for many years in the East to improve health, prevent disease and prolong life. 2 The term qigong is composed of two words: ‘qi ’ means energy flow and ‘gong’ means skill or achievement. There are numerous distinct forms of qigong which can be categorized into two main groups, <b>internal</b> <b>qigong</b> and exter-nal qigong. <b>Internal</b> <b>qigong</b> refers to a physical and mental training method for the cultivation of oneself t...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the experience of}} <b>internal</b> <b>qigong</b> practice in service members diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Theoretical Framework: The study used qualitative descriptive phenomenological methods originally described by Husserl and later refined by Giorgi. Methodology: Participants were interviewed about their experiences while learning qigong to determine their level of interest, benefits, and/or adverse effects; ease of learning/performing the routine; and any barriers to practice. Sample: Six service members with mTBI receiving outpatient neuro-rehabilitation at the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center–Charlottesville Rehabilitation Center. Intervention: Participants learned Reflective Exercise Qigong, a form of qigong developed specifically to require less complex movement and balance than most forms of qigong, making it ideal for those with potential coordination and balance issues. Data Collection: Semi-structured interviews took place after four weeks of formal qigong instruction, then again after the subjects completed eight weeks. Interview data were analyzed with phenomenological methods described by Giorgi. Results: Four themes emerged from the interview data: “the physical experience of qigong,” “regaining control,” “no pain, a lot of gain,” and “barriers to qigong practice. ” Participants offered examples of how qigong enabled them to control refractory symptoms after mTBI while decreasing reliance on pharmacotherapy. All agreed that qigong was uniquely conducive to the disciplined mindset of military service members and that the simplicity of Reflective Exercise qigong, compared with similar modalities such as tai chi and yoga, was well suited to individuals with decreased balance, cognition, and memory related to mTBI...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) often sustain {{cardiovascular}} complications after conventional cancer treatments. Tai Chi (TC) Qigong training may be {{a viable}} way to improve peripheral circulatory status and aerobic capacity in this population. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of a 6 -month TC Qigong training program on blood flow velocities and resistance, palmar skin temperature, and functional aerobic capacity in survivors of NPC. Methods: Twenty-five and 27 survivors of NPC volunteered to join the intervention group (mean age, 55. 4 ± 7. 5  years) and control group (mean age, 58. 7 ± 9. 5  years), respectively. The intervention group underwent a TC Qigong training program the modified 18 Forms TC <b>Internal</b> <b>Qigong</b> for 6  months, while the control group received no training. Peripheral arterial blood flow velocities and resistance, palmar skin temperature, and functional aerobic capacity were measured by a Doppler ultrasound machine, an infrared thermometer, and six-minute walk test, respectively. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, mid-intervention (3 -month), post-intervention (6 -month), and follow-up (12 -month) periods. Results: The TC Qigong group had higher diastolic blood flow velocity (p = 0. 010), lower arterial blood flow resistance (p = 0. 009), and higher palmar skin temperature (p = 0. 004) than the control group after TC Qigong training. However, only the diastolic blood flow velocity was higher in the TC Qigong group than in the control group during the no-training follow-up period (p = 0. 032). Additionally, an improvement in functional aerobic capacity was found in the intervention group after TC Qigong training (p < 0. 008) but not in the control group over time (Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis. Qigong {{exercise}} {{is a popular}} method for relieving {{the side effects of}} conventional cancer treatments in survivors of breast cancer, yet its effects are not empirically assessed. This study aimed to investigate the effects of qigong exercise on upper limb lymphedema, arterial resistance, and blood flow velocity in survivors with breast cancer and mastectomy. Study Design. This study was conducted as a prospective clinical trial. Methods. Eleven survivors of breast cancer with qigong experience (mean age = 58. 3 ± 10. 1 years) were assigned to the experimental group and 12 survivors of breast cancer without qigong experience (mean age = 53. 8 ± 4. 2 years) were assigned to the control group. They all had breast cancer-related lymphedema. All procedures were completed within one session. After baseline measurements were taken, the experimental group performed 18 Forms Tai Chi <b>Internal</b> <b>Qigong</b> for approximately 6 minutes while the control group rested for similar duration in a sitting position. Both groups were then reassessed. All participants were measured on their affected upper limb circumference (by using tape measures), peripheral arterial resistance, and blood flow velocities (using a Doppler ultrasound machine). Results. The between-group differences were not significant for all outcome measures at baseline (P >. 05). The circumferences of the affected upper arm, elbow, forearm and wrist decreased after qigong exercise (P. 0125). In terms of vascular outcomes, the resistance index decreased and the maximum systolic arterial blood flow velocity (SV) and minimum diastolic arterial blood flow velocity (DV) increased significantly after qigong exercise (P <. 05). The between-group difference was close to significant for SV (P =. 018) and was significant for DV (P <. 001) posttest. Conclusion. Qigong exercise could reduce conventional cancer therapy side effects such as upper limb lymphedema and poor circulatory status in survivors of breast cancer. However, such effects may be temporary, and further studies must be conducted to explore longer term effects.
