40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of {{protection}} <b>of</b> personality <b>rights</b> as one <b>of</b> the fundamental institutions of civil law. The thesis is mainly focused on contemporary conception of man and his personality in current civil law. The theoretical foundations of the concept <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> personality is summarized and valid legislation of protection <b>of</b> personality <b>right</b> made by Act no. 89 / 2012 Coll. - Civil Code, is described in the context <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> personality and its theoretical conception. The thesis is divided into twelve chapters; the first chapter defines basic concepts and terms such as the person, personality and legal personality. The second chapter deals with the theoretical concepts <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> personality in an objective and subjective sense. The third chapter {{is focused on}} the historical development of the protection <b>of</b> personality <b>right</b> in the world and in our country and the development of legislation on protection <b>of</b> personality <b>right</b> is described.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{analysis}} <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> to existential use {{of water resources}} (public waterways and water recipients) by owners of agricultural law located immediately next to these types of water resources. This right covers the right to drinkable water, livestock drinking water and basic irrigation without a use of special irrigation equipment. The right-holder of the listed types {{of the use of}} water resources is different from the right-holder of the general use of water resources. In the earlier case the right-holder is the owner of the riparian agricultural land. The holder <b>of</b> the <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> use may be any person, under equal terms, regardless of whether he owns agricultural or other type of land next to the waterway. The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the riparian land owners differs from the <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> use because they enjoy priority over the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> use by other persons holding <b>general</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> use over waterways. The water <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> riparian land owners overlaps with the <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> use in that it covers the use of water for existential needs. The <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the riparian land owner are different from the so called special or commercial use of water resources (use of water and water power for commercial purposes, such as production of electrical power, etc.). The difference is that the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the riparian land owners is derived directly from the law, without the need for any action by the state organs (water resource permits) and is free of charge. On the other hand, the right to commercial use of public water resources is always based on water use permits or approvals and concession agreements and is associated with a fee payable to the owners of the public water resource...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a {{sanctuary}} city goes back thousands of years. It {{has been associated with}} Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Baha'i, Sikhism, and Hinduism. [...] In Western Civilization, sanctuary cities {{can be traced back to}} the Old Testament. The Book of Numbers commands the selection of six cities of refuge in which the perpetrators of accidental manslaughter could claim the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> asylum. Outside of these cities, blood vengeance against such perpetrators was allowed by law. [...] In AD 392, Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I set up sanctuaries under church control. In AD 600 in medieval England, churches were given a <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary, and some cities were set up as sanctuaries by Royal charter. The <b>general</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary for churches in England was abolished in 1621.|$|R
