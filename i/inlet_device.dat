40|$|Modern {{diffusers}} {{applied in}} the field of ventilation of rooms are often complex in terms of geometry, including perforated plates, dampers, guide rails, curved surfaces and other components inside the diffuser, with the intention to create satisfying thermal comfort for the occupants. Also connecting ducts can be different for the same diffuser in different situations, affecting the supply velocity profile. It is obvious that simulation of airflow and air temperature particularly in rooms with displacement ventilation is very troublesome, particularly if the near-zone of the diffuser is of interest. Experiments commonly indicate very high turbulence intensities in the near-zone of displacement ventilation supply devices, especially close to the floor where high mean flow gradient occurs. This indicates that the air flow from <b>inlet</b> <b>devices</b> designed for displacement ventilation might be very unstable; the position of the stream leaving the diffuser and entering the room is changing with time, hence diffusion of momentum and temperature are increased. This effect is not captured in RANS simulations, since it is performed with the assumption of time-independent conditions. In this paper URANS simulations were performed for prediction of velocity and temperature distribution close to a complex air supply device in a room with displacement ventilation. The presented study show that unsteady simulations with the realizable turbulence k-ε model generates too high eddy viscosity and therefore damps out the unsteadiness of the flow especially inside the diffuser...|$|R

Because of the high pressures from the fields, some of the TEG will enter a gas phase and become carried over with the gas.

The separation efficiency of the current separators is not sufficient, and in this assignment there will be investigation on how the glycol separation can get better. There is {{a focus on the}} letdown station and the two filter separators in the KUP train. The methodology used in this study includes literature study, contact with vendors of new separation technology and valves. This study is based on a report from Statoil’s R&D center in Trondheim. The valves at the letdown station have been consider replaced with the Twister SwirlValve™ to minimize turbulence created in the flow upstream the separators. This could help the separation because the size range distribution of droplets would probably decrease, and therefore get easier to separate. The effect this change would have on the glycol recovery efficiency is impossible to determine, and Statoil have to decide rather or not they want to do a test on the Twister SwirlValve™ in this application.

40|$|The {{activities}} {{summarized in}} this paper included the testing of three representative stormwater control devices that were located at storm drainage inlets. The two proprietary devices utilized screening and filtering (using filter fabric and a coarser mesh). A conventional catchbasin inlet, having a sump, was also tested for comparison. These devices were monitored in Stafford Township, NJ, to evaluate their removal effectiveness for stormwater pollutants. Twelve paired samples collected at each device represented composite inflow and outflow stormwater. The samples were split into filtered and unfiltered components for extensive analyses of conventional and toxic pollutants. The experimental design was capable of identifying significant pollutant removals of at least 15 to 50 % at a 95 % confidence level, depending on the pollutant. The only significant pollutant removals were found during tests of a conventional catchbasin having a suitable sump. The median removal rates were about 30 % for suspended solids, about 40 % for turbidity, about 15 % for color, and about 20 % for total solids. No other pollutants {{were found to be}} significantly reduced. However, the coarse screened <b>inlet</b> <b>device</b> was found to significantly reduce the discharges of trash and other large debris. Unfortunately, flows passing through trapped material caught on the screen had increased concentrations of suspended solids and volatile solids, probably due to washing of decomposing large organic material through the screen.

40|$|The main {{prerequisite}} for applying a specific ventilation system in residential buildings {{is that the}} demands set upon the indoor air quality and thermal climate can be satisfied. If this cannot be guaranteed using a simple exhaust system, a system with treated supply air, i. e. balanced ventilation, should be considered. From the viewpoint of air quality, {{the location of the}} air intakes is important, while the location and design of air inlet devices is significant for achieving an acceptable thermal comfort in a building. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the knowledge about the factors that should be considered. The thesis is based on both field and full-scale laboratory tests which are presented in eight papers. Since the results are based mainly on measurements, the monitoring procedure and evaluating tools have been thoroughly analyzed. The results presented show that a balanced ventilation system is usually preferable when a building is located adjacent to streets with heavy traffic. It is also shown that investigations of air quality have to be carried out over quite a long period of time, so that the influence of various sources can be charted. Measuring equipment based on photoacoustic spectroscopy is useful for this type of studies. The interference from methane when determining the total concentration of volatile organic hydrocarbons is sometimes regarded as a problem. However, some of the measurement series carried out indicate {{that it is possible to}} eliminate this influence. The measurements also show a clear correlation between the concentrations of different traffic related contaminants. The critical part of a room from the viewpoint of thermal comfort is often the near-zone of an air <b>inlet</b> <b>device.</b> If the demands on thermal comfort are fulfilled here, the thermal climate is often acceptable in the rest of the occupation zone as well. The occupation zone should include the whole room volume, except the zones close to inlet air devices, near windows and outer walls and above head height. It is shown that air supply via the slot devices studied, can not be regarded as an acceptable solution especially at low outdoor temperatures, while air supply via a radiator air device can be acceptable if the radiator is warm. The thermal comfort in a room should be characterized mainly by individual parameters and indices not including clothing insulation or activity level. The results presented in this thesis also show that consideration should be taken to the inaccuracy of the measuring equipment when evaluating the thermal comfort. An instrument with a time constant larger than 0. 5 s (90 %) can be too slow to allow correct recording of the air velocity fluctuations. In addition, demands on the time constant of air temperature sensors may be set since temperature fluctuations up to 3 °C can exist in ventilated rooms. The upper frequency of those fluctuations is mainly found in the range 0. 2 to 1. 2 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{knowledge}} of the degassing process in separation of gas from oil is important in connection with development of subsea separation and boosting units for heavy oil fields. The focus in the thesis is on theory and equipment design for two-phase separation of oil and gas. A review of gravitational separators and compact separation technology {{with a focus on}} subsea installations is given first. An extensive literature review related to theory governing the degassing process is further presented. The effectiveness of the degassing process depends on the gas’ ability to migrate out of the oil. Bubble dynamics theory, especially correlations for calculation of a bubbles velocity in a liquid is therefore examined. Bubble size, fluid properties, especially liquid viscosity, and gas volume fraction in the liquid is decisive factors for the bubble velocity. A comparison of several correlations obtained in various literature is made to determine the best available for modeling degassing. Most of the correlations have a limited range of validity in terms of bubble size and Reynolds number. It is verified that they are highly inaccurate outside this range. A correlation developed to be valid for a large range of bubble sizes seems to predict bubble velocities reasonably well. Because of its large range of validity, this is chosen {{to be used in the}} development of a separator model. Some experimental work is performed on two liquids with different viscosity. It is verified that separation of gas in viscous liquids requires significantly more retention time for the smallest bubbles reach the liquid surface. Occasional deviations from the examined theory are observed, especially for the more viscous liquid. Based the chosen correlation for bubble velocity a simplified model for horizontal and vertical gravity separators is developed. Separator size, fluid properties, flow rate and distribution of bubbles are input parameters. The model calculates how much of the initial gas volume fraction that remains in the liquid after separation. Consequence of high liquid viscosity and distribution of bubble size and bubble distribution in the liquid are evaluated by use of the model. When the oil becomes very viscous is it important that separator and internals are designed to optimize the conditions for degassing. This implies among others an <b>inlet</b> <b>device</b> which provides an ability to control the bubble distribution and keep the size of bubbles as large as possible. Methods are suggested for increased effectiveness in degassing of heavy oils, by reducing viscosity, increase the coalescence rate and affecting the flow pattern. Separation of other phases and undesirable components is also important and may make it difficult to optimize the design for the degassing process. However, a separator should be efficient in all respects, making {{knowledge of}} the degassing process anyhow important. The thesis gives an overview of important parameters in the degassing process. Much work still remains to develop correlations and models which can give a more exact description of real systems. Continuous development in separator components and not at least compact separation technology is important to effectively be able to produce heavy oil, especially in terms of subsea installations. </p...|$|E
