Metode elektrodekolorisasi merupakan suatu proses elektrokimia untuk menghilangkan zat warna dengan menggunakan arus listrik searah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menurunkan konsentrasi limbah cair pewarna batik secara optimum menggunakan metode elektrodekolorisasi dengan memanfaatkan batang karbon baterai bekas. Limbah cair batik yang diuji adalah rhodamin B (RhB), naphtol {{blue black}} dan <b>indigosol</b> sebagai sumber limbah pewarna. Katoda sel elektrokimia berupa batang karbon berasal dari baterai bekas dan anodanya berupa lempeng besi. Optimalisasi pada proses degradasi pewarna ini dilakukan pada variasi arus, pH dan jarak elektrode. Variasi arus diatur pada 3, 5 dan 7 A; variasi pH pada 3, 5, 7, 9, dan 11; serta variasi jarak elektrode pada jarak 1; 1, 5 dan 2 cm. Penurunan konsentrasi pewarna rhodamin B (RhB) menunjukkan keadaan jarak, pH dan arus optimum berturut turut 1 cm, pH 9 dan arus 7 A sebesar 78, 68 %. Penurunan konsentrasi pewarna <b>indigosol</b> pada keadaan jarak, pH dan arus optimum berturut turut 1 cm, pH 11 dan arus 7 A sebesar 95, 90 %, sedangkan pewarna naphtol blue black menunjukkan keadaan jarak, pH dan arus optimum berturut turut 1 cm, pH 9 dan arus 7 A sebesar 74, 15 %.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to decrease the concentration of the liquid waste of batik dye optimally by electrodecolorization method by utilizing the carbon rods of used batteries. The batik liquid waste is rhodamine B (RhB), naphtol blue black and <b>indigosol</b> as a source of dye. Electrochemical cell cathode in the form of carbon rod derived from used batteries and anode in the form of iron plate. Optimization in dye degradation process is done on the variation of the current, pH and distance of two electrodes. Current variation is set at 3, 5 and 7 A; pH is at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; distance of two electrodes is set at 1; 1. 5 and 2 cm. Decreasing the concentration of rhodamine B (RhB) shows that the distance, pH and optimum current respectively 1 cm, pH 9 and the current 7 A that is 78. 68 %. Decreasing the concentration of <b>indigosol</b> shows that the distance, pH and optimum current respectively 1 cm, pH 11 and the current 7 A that is 95. 90 %, whereas naphtol blue black dye shows that the distance, pH and optimum current respectively 1 cm, pH 9 and current 7 A that is 74. 15 %...|$|E
40|$|Batik {{wastewater}} have color contents as naphtol, <b>indigosol,</b> and remazol {{which is}} streamed {{directly to the}} environment without treatment can decrease environment quality because batik wastewater consist heavy metals, suspended solids, and organic matters. Batik wastewater can be treated by electrocoagulation method. These research targets are to determine the removal efficiency of TSS and pH, compare to the quality standard, and knowing the effect of voltage and contact time. The electrocoagulation basin reactor is made in 30 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm of dimentions with total volume of wastewater is 10 L, using aluminium electrode plates with size of plate is of 17 cm x 17 cm, the plate thickness is 3 mm the distance between plates is 1 cm. The variabele of research are voltage (10, 15, and 20 volts) and contact time 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The result showed that the most efficient is 20 volts of voltage 60 minutes of contact time. The percent removal for TSS is 99, 11 % with concentration of effluent is 11 mg/L. The pH value is 11, 2. Based on the result TSS parameter already complied the standard of PERMENLH/ 5 /XLII/ 2014, except pH parameter...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{number of}} Indonesian Batik SMEs has been started since UNESCO {{announced}} batik as world heritage from Indonesia in 2009. However, this condition also brings negative impact related to water pollution. Huge variety of dyestuff {{always has been}} a challenge in estimating total pollution load from this sector. This study aim to estimate pollution load of some key parameters (BOD 5, COD and TSS) of wastewater generated by Batik SMEs in Trusmi cluster. By calculating pollution load factor per unit product (PLU) trough analyzing waste water quality and quantity in every step of batik making process and considering type of fabric (cotton and silk) and type of dyestuff (Naphtol and <b>Indigosol)</b> as variable, {{it can be concluded}} that the PLU factor for BOD 5 and TSS is associated to the type of fabric, meanwhile COD parameter is associated to the type of dyes. By multiplying the PLU factor with total production capacity from all SMEs in Trusmi cluster, it can be estimated that the total pollution load range in Trusmi area for BOD is at 5, 9 – 39, 5 ton/year; COD at 112 - 426 ton/year; and TSS at 4, 88 - 16, 3 ton/year...|$|E

40|$|Utilization {{of natural}} dye in batik {{industry}} is a preventive solution taken to avoid environmental problems. Natural dyes is used to substitute synthetic dyes, naphtol and <b>indigosol</b> which has COD of 10. 000 - 20. 000 mg/L. Although the solution has been taken, the wastewater quality still exceed the limits stated on Regulation of the Ministry of the Environment No. 5 / 2014. The research aim is to generate cleaner production solution, specifically material substitution and process modification to increase biodegradability. The implementation is conducted six times. The research process is pre-assessment of natural dye and batik wastewater, implementation of material substitution in mordanting, washing material and process modification. Natural dyes used has BOD of 203 - 975 mg/L, COD 1. 316 - 2. 453 mg/L and BOD/COD 0, 1 - 0, 4.
