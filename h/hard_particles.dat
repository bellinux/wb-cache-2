We thus recover and extend some results previously obtained by means of matrix integrals. Proofs are purely combinatorial and rely on the idea that planar maps are conjugacy classes of trees.

For all Bodies, so far as Experience reaches, are either hard, or may be harden'd; and we have no other Evidence of universal Impenetrability, besides a large Experience without an experimental Exception. Now if compound Bodies are so very hard as we find some of them to be, and yet are very porous, and consist of Parts which are only laid together; the simple Particles which are void of Pores, and were never yet divided, must be much harder. For such <b>hard</b> <b>Particles</b> being heaped up together, can scarce touch one another in more than a few Points, and therefore must be separable by much less Force than is requisite to break a solid Particle, whose Parts touch in all the Space between them, without any Pores or Interstices to weaken their Cohesion.

6000|$|A creed like this, {{whatever}} else it may be, is plainly a powerful solvent of every system of exclusive dogma. If the one essential to true worship, {{the worship of}} the heart and the inner sentiment, be mystic adoration of an indefinable Supreme, then creeds based upon books, prophecies, miracles, revelations, all fall alike into the second place among things that may be lawful and may be expedient, but that can never be exacted from men by a just God as indispensable to virtue in this world or to bliss in the next. No better answer has ever been given to the exclusive pretensions of sect, Christian, Jewish, or Mahometan, than that propounded by the Savoyard Vicar with such energy, closeness, and most sarcastic fire.[348] It was turning an unexpected front upon the presumptuousness of all varieties of theological infallibilists, to prove to them that if you insist upon acceptance of this or that special revelation, over and above the dictates of natural religion, then you are bound not only to grant, but imperatively to enjoin upon all men, a searching inquiry and comparison, that they may spare no pains in an affair of such momentous issue in proving to themselves that this, and none of the competing revelations, is the veritable message of eternal safety. [...] "Then no other study will be possible but that of religion: hardly shall one who has enjoyed the most robust health, employed his time and used his reason to best purpose, and lived the greatest number of years, hardly shall such an one in his extreme age be quite sure what to believe, {{and it will be a}} marvel if he finds out before he dies, in what faith he ought to have lived." [...] The superiority of the sceptical parts of the Savoyard Vicar's profession, as well as those of the Letters from the Mountain to which we referred previously, over the biting mockeries which Voltaire had made the fashionable method of assault, lay in this fact. The latter only revolted and irritated all serious temperaments to whom religion is a matter of honest concern, while the former actually appealed to their religious sense in support of his doubts; and the more intelligent and sincere this sense happened to be, the more surely would Rousseau's gravely urged objections dissolve the <b>hard</b> <b>particles</b> of dogmatic belief. His objections were on a moral level with the best side of the religion that they oppugned. Those of Voltaire were only on a level with its lowest side, and that was the side presented by the gross and repulsive obscurantism of the functionaries of the church.|$|E

We demonstrate the effectiveness of low order virial coefficients in describing the compressibility factor of fluids of hard polyhedra. The second virial coefficient is obtained analytically from particle asphericity {{and can be used}} to define an effective sphere with similar low-density behavior. Higher-order virial coefficients [...] - efficiently calculated with Mayer Sampling Monte Carlo [...] - are used to define an exponential approximant that exhibits the best known semi-analytic characterization of hard polyhedron fluid state functions. We present a general method for the exact calculation of convex polyhedron diffraction form factors that is more easily applied to common shape data structures than the techniques typically presented in literature. A proof of concept user interface illustrates how a researcher might investigate the role of particle form factor in the diffraction patterns of different particles in known structures. We present a square-triangle dodecagonal quasicrystal (DQC) in a binary mixture of nanocrystals (NCs). We demonstrate how the decoration of the square and triangle tiles naturally gives rise to partial matching rules via symmetry breaking in layers perpendicular to the dodecagonal axis.
