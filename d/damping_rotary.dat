40|$|The dynamic {{stability}} of an elastic prismatic slender column with semirigid connections {{at both ends}} of identical stiffness and with sidesway between the two ends totally inhibited, subject to parametric axial loads including the combined effects of rotary inertia and external damping is investigated in a classical manner. Closed-form expressions {{that can be used to}} predict the dynamic instability regions of slender columns are developed by making use of Floquet’s theory. The proposed solution is capable of capturing the phenomena of stability of columns under periodic axial loads using a single column element. The proposed method and corresponding equations can be used to investigate the effects of <b>damping,</b> <b>rotary</b> inertia and semirigid connections on the stability analysis of slender columns under periodically varying axial loads. The effects produced by shear deformations along the span of the column as well as those produced by the axial inertia, the coupling between longitudinal and transverse deflections and the curvature are not taken into account. Sensitivity studies are presented in a companion paper that show the effects of rotary inertia, damping and semirigid connections on the {{dynamic stability}} of columns under parametric axial loads...|$|E

The orthosis reduces tremor amplitude and is small enough to be worn under the sleeve of a shirt. Hand and forearm cuffs couple the damper to the user. The cuffs permit full thumb and finger motion, wrist flexion and extension, and forearm pronation and supination. Damping is provided by a constrained-layer-damping (CLD) system, distinct in that it can <b>damp</b> large <b>rotary</b> deflections through a small bending radius. A bending-plate transmission linearly converts wrist extension/flexion to rectilinear translation within the damper. Bending deformation of two plates held a fixed distance apart within the transmission results in relative displacement along the lengths of the plates. A viscous fluid incorporated between the plates provides shear damping. Silicone fluids with viscosities as high as 10 million centistokes (cS) and shear layers as thin as 0. 76 mm have been tested. With these parameter values, damping constants as high as 2. 0 × 10 - 3 N-m/(°/s) have been measured. This testing was conducted with strain rates as high as 4, 580 °/s.

This massively redundant telerobot, designated the Robotics Research K/B- 2017 Dexterous Manipulator, employs a modular mechanism design with joint-mounted actuators based on brushless motors and harmonic drive gear reducers. Direct joint torque control at the servo level causes these high-output joint drives to behave like direct-drive actuators, facilitating the implementation of an effective impedance control scheme.

5000|$|Sport bikes {{have a short}} {{wheelbase}} and an aggressive steering geometry to provide {{the ability to make}} very quick changes in direction. This has the harmful side-effect of making the bike less stable, more prone to feedback from uneven road surfaces, and more difficult to control. [...] If the front wheel significantly deviates from the direction of travel when it touches down, it may cause an unwanted wobble. Steering dampers are factory installed on some high-end sport motorcycles and fitted to most contemporary racing bikes to counter these behaviours.Steering dampers are also mounted to off-road motorcycles such as motocross bikes. A damper helps keep the bike tracking straight over difficult terrain such as ruts, rocks, and sand, and also smooths out jolts through the handlebars at the end of jumps. They also reduce arm fatigue by reducing the effort to control the handlebars.On motorcycles, one end of the damper is mounted to the steering yoke or triple tree, the other to the frame. Two main types are linear and rotary. Linear dampers resemble a telescoping shock absorber and operate in a similar manner. They can be aligned either longitudinally and {{to one side of the}} steering, or transversely across the bike. Rotary dampers resemble small boxes and operate via a rotating pivot. They are mounted coaxially with the steering axis and are typically located on top of the steering head. An electronically variable <b>damper</b> uses a <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> with hydraulic fluid that flows freely at low speeds, allowing easy turning, while restricting flow at higher speeds when more damping is necessary, as determined by the engine control unit.|$|R

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{sponsored}} by QinetiQ Limited (QinetiQ); whose aim it is to model the dynamics of a prototype high-speed military tracked vehicle. Specifically their objective is to describe the mechanism by which force inputs are transmitted from the ground to the vehicle’s hull. Many track running gear components are steel and can be modelled as simple lumped masses or as linear springs without internal damping. These present no difficulty to the modeller. However tracked vehicle running gear also has nonlinear components that require more detailed descriptions. Models for two rubber components, the road wheel tyre and track link bush, and {{a model for the}} suspensions <b>rotary</b> <b>damper,</b> are developed here. These three components all have highly nonlinear dynamic responses. Rubber component nonlinearities are caused by the materials nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. Stiffness is amplitude dependent and the material exhibits a significant amount of internal damping, which is predominantly Coulombic in nature but also relaxes overtime. In this work, a novel method for measuring the elastic and viscoelastic response of Carbon Black Filled Natural Rubber components has been devised and a ‘general purpose’ mathematical model developed that describes the materials response and is suited to use in multibody dynamic analysis software. The vehicle’s suspension <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> model describes three viscous flow regimes (laminar, turbulent and pressure relief), as a continuous curved response that relates angular velocity to damping torque. Hysteresis due to the compression of entrapped gas, compliance of the dampers structure and compression of damper oil is described by a single non-parametric equation. Friction is considered negligible and is omitted from the model. All components are modelled using MSC. ADAMS TM multibody dynamic analysis software. The models are shown to be easily implemented and computationally robust. QinetiQ’s requirement for ‘practical’ track running gear component models has been met.

40|$|With a {{successful}} and rapid development of offshore wind industry and increased research activities on wave energy conversion in recent years, {{there is an}} interest in investigating the technological and economic feasibility of combining offshore wind turbines (WTs) with wave energy converters (WECs). In the EU FP 7 MARINA Platform project, three floating combined concepts, namely the spar torus combination (STC), the semi-submersible flap combination (SFC) and the oscillating water column (OWC) array with a wind turbine, were selected and studied in detail by numerical and experimental methods. This paper summarizes the numerical modeling {{and analysis of the}} two concepts: STC and SFC, the model tests at a 1 : 50 scale under simultaneous wave and wind excitation, as well as the comparison between the numerical and experimental results. Both operational and survival wind and wave conditions were considered. The numerical analysis was based on a time-domain global model using potential flow theory for hydrodynamics and blade element momentum theory (for SFC) or simplified thrust force model (for STC) for aerodynamics. Different techniques for model testing of combined wind and wave concepts were discussed with focus on modeling of wind turbines by disk or redesigned small-scale rotor and modeling of power take-off (PTO) system for wave energy conversion by pneumatic <b>damper</b> or hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>damper.</b> In order to reduce the uncertainty due to scaling, the numerical analysis was performed at model scale and both the numerical and experimental results were then up-scaled to full scale for comparison. The comparison shows that the current numerical model can well predict the responses (motions, PTO forces, power production) of the combined concepts for most of the cases. However, the linear hydrodynamic model is not adequate for the STC concept in extreme wave conditions with the torus fixed to the spar at the mean water level for which the wave slamming on the torus occurs and this requires further investigation. Moreover, based on a preliminary comparison of the displacement, the PTO system as well as the wind and wave power production, the STC concept will have a lower cost of energy as compared to the SFC concept. However, the cost of energy of either the STC or the SFC concept is higher than that of a pure floating wind turbine with the same floater...|$|R

Firstly, the background and current methods for wind induced flutter vibration control of bridge structures are summarized. Then, equations of motion of the bridge segment model are developed based oon the classical Lagrange principle, and the critical wind speed of flutter vibration of Humen Bridge is solved using both Scanlan and state space baased methods.

40|$|The NAWC/AD F- 18 C/D {{simulation}} {{is capable}} of modeling in-control and out-of-control flight motions in a very representative manner. While many sources of static and dynamic data were considered during analysis of flight motions versus simulation response, the method of implementing dynamic terms was never rigorously examined. This report examines methods of combining dynamic data (steady wind axis rotary and body axis forced oscillation). The current model’s static and dynamic data coverage of the angular and rate excursions experienced during out-of-control motions was evaluated. This revealed that extending static sideslip effects to higher sideslip benefits modeling of some out-of-control maneuvers. When implemented using methodology proposed by Kalviste, properly collected dynamic data are capable of providing adequate dynamic definition. When the simulation was revised to incorporate an entirely as-tested dynamic data set with the Kalviste mechanization, rigorous correlation with flight test revealed a significant improvement in modeling of flight motions over the original model, which used empirically adjusted forced oscillation terms.

40|$|There {{are over}} 15 million people {{affected}} by strokes worldwide {{with a third}} left disabled. It is estimated that only 5 to 20 % regain upper limb functionality. However, {{research has shown that}} repetitive movement on the affected limb improves motor relearning. With the number of people affected by strokes rising each year the demand has begun straining hospital resources, therefore {{there is a need for}} some therapy to be moved away from clinical settings and into a person’s home. Robot assisted therapy is a growing field aiming to meet this demand. However currently there are no low cost devices able to actively exercise and strengthen a person’s hand during the acute (early) stage of stroke rehabilitation. This study is a part of a larger project involving the development of a low cost, assistive stroke rehabilitation device requiring a controllable damper. The aim of the study is to determine whether the use of magnetorheological fluid in a controllable damper is viable for use in the planned rehabilitation device. A <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> configuration was chosen as it can be made compact and avoid fluid leakage. To be deemed suitable for the application, the viscous torque of the damper needed to be controllable with varying input current. The required damping torques produced must be repeatable and needs to be generated below 34 C, the specified maximum operating temperature of the system. The performance of three vane designs for the <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> were investigated. These three designs were layered discs, a paddle and a helix. A test rig using a pulley configuration was designed and constructed to quantify the performance of the vane designs. The test rig recorded the opposing force and temperature measurements for each damper design. The measurements of interest were the off-state (no input current) torque, the achievable torque range, and also the consistency of the measurements. Experiments were conducted with the damper containing air to determine the pre-existing friction between the vane and housing, and water and motor oil were used as the damper fluid to investigate the performance of the designs with known fluid viscosities. Lastly experiments containing magneto-rheological fluid were conducted to determine the controllability and consistency of the viscous torque of each design. The paddle design was selected based on its range and consistency of produced torque, simplicity of the design and expected economical manufacture. With an input current of 0 to 2 A the damper produced a viscous torque range of 0. 0036 Nm to 0. 044 Nm, which was the equivalent opposing force of approximately 7. 3 N. During testing of the various damper designs, a few imperfections were found. A modified version of the chosen damper was constructed to determine whether those features were manufacturing artifacts. It was found that the force measurements became smoother and previous periodic oscillations in the measurements were eliminated. The viscous torque of the paddle design was found to be controllable within the given operational conditions and therefore the use of magnetorheological fluid is a viable solution for use in a low cost stroke rehabilitation device...|$|R

As the key element in the system, the regenerative electromagnetic TMD (EMTMD) is able to convert vibration energy of structures to electrical energy, and thus plays dual functions, namely, vibration mitigation and energy harvesting. With the aid of EHC, the electrical energy can be further stored and used to power WSS that closely monitor structural vibration responses. The feasibility of the proposed SVCM system was validated via shaking table tests, in which a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structural model equipped with the SVCM system was tested under random excitations. The functionality of the SVCM system was discussed {{with regard to the}} vibration control, energy harvesting and vibration monitoring performance. The experimental results revealed that the proposed regenerative EMTMD device can provide regenerative and economical power to WSS. The harvested power reaches about 312. 4 mW under random ground motions with root-mean-square (RMS) acceleration equal to 0. 05 g. Meanwhile, the comparison shows that the peak magnitude of the frequency response function of structural displacement is reduced by 10 dB with the aid of the EMTMD. This study demonstrates that the SVCM system provides a novel and promising solution to the power supply problem associated with wireless sensing technology, and will stimulate the integration of vibration control and monitoring system.

Aerodynamic data in pitch, yaw, and roll were obtained from transient motions induced by small pulse rockets firing at intervals in the pitch and yaw directions. From {{the results of this}} brief aerodynamic investigation, it is observed that very slender body shapes can provide increased volumetric capacity with little or no increase in zero-lift drag and that body fineness ratios of the order of 20 should be considered in the design of long-range supersonic aircraft. The zero-lift drag and the drag-due-to-lift parameter of the test configuration varied linearly with Mach number. The maximum lift-drag ratio was 7. 0 at a Mach number of 1. 25 and decreased slightly to a value of 6. 6 at a Mach number of 1. 81.

40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) damper is {{one type}} of {{semi-active}} devices that shows a great potential for vibration suppression and hazard mitigation of civil structures. One special advantage of the damper is that its damping characteristics can be adaptively and quickly altered by a varying magnetic field. A linear valve-mode MR damper was obtained from Lord Corporation for investigation. A phenomenological model based on Bouc-Wen hysteresis model was developed to emulate the highly nonlinear behavior of the MR damper. A simplified yet relatively accurate inverse dynamic model that can directly relate the damper force to the input voltage was then proposed. This inverse dynamic model can directly estimate voltage required to be commanded into the damper {{in order to produce}} a desired damping force. Experiments demonstrate that MR damper using this inverse model can closely reproduce the prescribed forces. Two control algorithms, the classical pole placement technique and the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) with output weighting method, were used to illustrate how this inverse model can be implemented in the applications.

Modeling of viscoelastic materials is always difficult whereas modeling the elastic behavior is easy, modelling the energy dissipation mechanism possess difficulty. This work attempts to study the dynamics of a viscoelastic rotor-shaft system considering the effect of internal material damping in the rotor. The rotation of rotors introduces a <b>rotary</b> <b>damping</b> force due to internal material damping, which is well known to cause instability in rotor-shaft systems. Therefore, a reliable model is necessary to represent the rotor internal damping for correct prediction of stability limit of spin speed and unbalance response amplitude of a rotor-shaft system. An efficient modelling technique for viscoelastic material, augmenting thermodynamic field (ATF) {{has been found in}} literature. Here the material constitutive relationship has been represented by a differential time operator. Use of operators enables to consider general linear viscoelastic behaviours, represented in the time domain, for which, in general, instantaneous stress and its derivatives are proportional to instantaneous strain and also its derivatives. The operator may be suitably chosen according to the material model. The constitutive relationships for ATF approach is represented in differential time operator to obtain the equations of motion of a rotor-shaft system after discretizing the system using beam finite element method. The equations thus developed may easily be used to find the stability limit of spin speed of a rotor-shaft system as well as the time response as a result of unbalance when the rotor-shaft system is subjected to any kind of dynamic forcing function. In this work dynamic behavior of an aluminium rotor is predicted through viscoelastic modelling of the continuum {{to take into account the}} effect of internal material damping. To study the dynamics of an aluminium rotor-shaft system stability limit of spin speed, unbalance response amplitude and time response are used as three indices. It is observed that, the operator based approach is more suitable for finding the equation of motion of a viscoelastic rotor which is used to predicts the dynamic behaviour of that continuum. ...|$|R
