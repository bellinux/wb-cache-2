Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rise}} of grunge and {{alternative}} rock in the 1990s, her record label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour {{all over the world}} and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and <b>in</b> <b>studio</b> with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in her long career.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his Sendiri tour, Chrisye began to explore the {{possibility}} of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa. On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music, Gutawa agreed to an acoustic-flavoured album. Aciu also agreed, despite the expected cost of Rp 600 million (US$70,000). After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and sound engineer Dany Lisapali spent two weeks <b>in</b> <b>Studio</b> 301 in Sydney finishing off the album. The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney. AkustiChrisye was released in 1996 and sold well.|$|E

5|$|He {{died from}} natural causes at age 95 {{at his home}} <b>in</b> <b>Studio</b> City, Los Angeles on December 18, 2006 at 11:44p.m., ending a 70-year career in animation.

5|$|In 1992, {{while living}} in Los Angeles, Mitchell bought a home in Blue Hill, Maine. In the early 1990s, he {{operated}} the Company of CharActors Theatre, which performed stage plays, one of which he directed, <b>in</b> <b>Studio</b> City, California. In the 1993 film Gettysburg, set during the American Civil War (1861–65), he portrayed the real-life Union Army flag bearer Sergeant Andrew Jackson Tozier. In the early to mid-2000s, he survived three cancers and then moved back to Blue Hill with his family, where he semi-retired while occasionally appearing in local stage productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even <b>in</b> <b>studio</b> news releases. Q. David Bowers says that the attribution of these early directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E
