Bouldin faced a mob of men crossing the river that consisted of a mix of Union and Confederate soldiers. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> he was able to slow down Gibson's Brigade—which was becoming scattered and disorganized. After hearing the gunfire, Lieutenant Colonel John T. Radford ordered the 22nd Virginia Cavalry into the fray. Radford's cavalry rode to the west side of the 14th Virginia, and joined the fight.|$|E

5|$|One account has it {{that the}} Germans paid Bogdan-Pitești the cost of paper and printing, which had been {{hitherto}} provided, for free, by Cantacuzino. Bogdan-Pitești (and German funds) were probably involved in financing a new platform, Cronica, launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915. In October of that year, with probable German support, Bogdan-Pitești, Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper, Libertatea ("Freedom"), presided upon, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> by N.

5|$|Romblon {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by aboriginal Filipinos {{prior to the}} arrival of the Spanish in 1569. Archaeological artifacts recovered by the National Museum in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon already have a rich and advanced culture. Under Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the newly established province of Arevalo, until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of Capiz. With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule.

5|$|A {{native of}} Texas, Applewhite {{attended}} several universities and, {{as a young}} man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as {{the chair of the}} music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten years}} as the vicar, Wheelwright was {{suspended}} in 1633 following his attempt to sell his Bilsby ministry back to its patron to get funds to travel to New England. Instead of procuring the necessary funds, {{he was convicted of}} simony (selling church offices), and completely removed from his office. After his removal from Bilsby he was likely in Laceby in June 1633 where his daughter Elizabeth was baptized. He then preached <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> at Belleau, Lincolnshire, but was soon silenced by the Anglican authorities for his Puritan opinions, and began making plans for his emigration from England. Wheelwright left England in 1636 with his second wife, her mother Susanna Hutchinson, and his five living children.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E

5|$|In Alameda County, {{the freeway}} {{begins in the}} city of Fremont, where it intersects SR 262, which was {{unsigned}} until 2000. Continuing through the city, it meets Mission Boulevard at SR 238 before exiting the city. Prior to 2002, two ghost ramps existed here, remains of an abandoned freeway project replacing Mission Blvd. Amid Alameda County, it abruptly turns northeastward and enters a hilly area, where it crosses over Mission Pass, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it runs concurrently with SR 84 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while.</b> Afterwards, it enters Pleasanton and intersects with I-580, currently California's longest auxiliary interstate providing access to Oakland and the Central Valley.

5|$|Jon Hol {{sided with}} Johan Sverdrup, a liberal jurist {{who had become}} the {{spearhead}} of parliamentary opposition to the King.

From 1881, he worked on their publication Samfundet. This periodical eventually ceased publication, but was succeeded by Nordmanden in 1883, which Hol co-owned. Hol used Samfundet and Nordmanden as the main public arenas for his activism. He was also behind the rifle associations' member magazine Norsk Skyttertidende, which had been started in 1882 and edited by David Dietrichson <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> before Hol took over.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to the {{continent}} from England, Henry sought to secure his French lands and quash any potential rebellion. As a result, in 1154 Henry and Louis agreed a peace treaty, under which Henry bought back the Vernon and the Neuf-Marché from Louis. The treaty appeared shaky, however, and tensions remained—in particular, Henry had not given homage to Louis for his French possessions. In an attempt to improve relations, Henry met with Louis at Paris and Mont-Saint-Michel in 1158, agreeing to betroth Henry's eldest living son, the Young Henry, to Louis's daughter Margaret. The marriage deal would have involved Louis granting the disputed territory of the Vexin to Margaret on her marriage to the Young Henry: while this would ultimately give Henry the lands that he claimed, it also cunningly implied that the Vexin was Louis's to give away in the first place, in itself a political concession. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> a permanent peace between Henry and Louis looked plausible.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{began on}} 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary {{declared}} war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it {{was taken by the}} Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, between 6 and 9 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October 1915. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Espérey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Since Belgrade was decimated as the front-line city, Subotica overtook the title of the largest city in the Kingdom <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
5|$|A slow {{weakening}} trend began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. The weakening trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. The weakening trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. The weakening trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E

5|$|Dakota tribes, {{mostly the}} Mdewakanton, {{as early as}} the 16th century were known as {{permanent}} settlers near their sacred site of St. Anthony Falls. New settlers arrived during the 1850s and 1860s in Minneapolis from New England, New York, and Canada, and during the mid-1860s, immigrants from Finland and Scandinavians (from Sweden, Norway and Denmark) began to call the city home. Migrant workers from Mexico and Latin America also interspersed. Later, immigrants came from Germany, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Southern and Eastern Europe. These immigrants tended to settle in the Northeast neighborhood, which still retains an ethnic flavor and is particularly known for its Polish community. Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe began arriving in the 1880s and settled primarily {{on the north side of}} the city before moving in large numbers to the western suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. Asians came from China, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea. Two groups came <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> during U.S. government relocations: Japanese during the 1940s, and Native Americans during the 1950s. From 1970 onward, Asians arrived from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Beginning in the 1990s, a large Latino population arrived, along with immigrants from the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia. The metropolitan area is an immigrant gateway which had a 127% increase in foreign-born residents between 1990 and 2000.|$|E

5|$|Heliade {{progressively}} distanced {{himself from}} the more radical groups, especially after discussions began {{on the issue of}} land reform and the disestablishment of the boyar class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within Frăţia just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by Nicolae Bălcescu). The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, responsible government, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the National Assembly), freedom of the press, and decentralization. On June 21, 1848, present in Islaz alongside Tell and the Orthodox priest known as Popa Şapcă, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (see Proclamation of Islaz). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by Metropolitan Neofit, it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, Ştefan Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, and, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> the Bucharest merchant Gheorghe Scurti.|$|E
