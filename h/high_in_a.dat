5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|Rivera's 2008 {{season was}} one of his best {{individual}} years. Along with a 1.40ERA and 39saves in 40opportunities, he set career bests in multiple statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as a closer. He pitched with such control that his 12.83strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season (minimum 50innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{uncommon in}} Salukis, with the breed ranking joint lowest {{in a survey}} by the British Veterinary Association in 2003. The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is <b>high.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma. The secondary cause of death was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects. Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death.|$|E

5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very <b>high.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, {{he hit the}} 100th {{home run}} of his career, off Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester in a 63 victory. On July 11, he hit his 34th home run of the season, eclipsing his {{previous}} season <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 31 victory over the Rangers. He earned his 87th and 88th RBIs {{of the season with}} a two-run home run against Mark Buehrle on July 12, setting a new Orioles record for most RBIs before the All-Star break; the previous record was 86 by Boog Powell. He ultimately ended up with 93 RBIs before the All-Star break. On July 14, he hit his 37th home run of the season against Josh Johnson in a 74 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Reggie Jackson for the second most home runs before the All-Star break by any MLB player and the most by an American League player. The home run was also his 500th career hit.|$|E

In 36 minutes of action, he {{recorded}} a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds in a 129–100 loss. Three days later, he recorded 30 points and 17 rebounds (one shy {{of his career}} <b>high)</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 122–114 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. In his third game for Golden State on October 30, he had a 37-point outing in a 106–100 win over the Phoenix Suns. On November 3, he matched his career high with seven three-pointers and scored 39 points in a 122–96 win over his former team, the Thunder. With 22 points against the New Orleans Pelicans on November 7, Durant had at least 20 points for his 71st straight game, matching Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the fifth-longest streak in NBA history. He increased that streak to 72 games with at least 20 points on November 9 against the Mavericks, tying Michael Jordan for the fourth-longest streak ever. The streak ended the following day when he scored 18 points in a win against the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E

The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of aneurysms are asymptomatic. However, as abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, they may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest, lower back, or scrotum. The risk of rupture is <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> symptomatic aneurysm, which is therefore considered an indication for surgery. The complications include rupture, peripheral embolization, acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and inferior vena cava) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the duodenum) fistulae. On physical examination, a palpable and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted. Bruits can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial stenosis.|$|E
