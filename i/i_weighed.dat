"I had {{resolved}} on {{a voyage}} around the world, {{and as the}} wind {{on the morning of}} April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon <b>I</b> <b>weighed</b> anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the Spray had been moored snugly all winter. The twelve o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the port tack, then coming about she stood to seaward, with her boom well off to port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on the outer pier of East Boston got a picture of her as she swept by, her flag at the peak throwing her folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood." ...|$|E

And out of the data of past experience, I reached certain conclusions.|$|E
