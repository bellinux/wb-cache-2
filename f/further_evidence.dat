She is perhaps more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn Forkbeard, future King of the English. Her son was Harold Harefoot, King of the English.|$|E

5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship. <b>Further</b> <b>evidence</b> for this relationship came {{from the work of}} Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the {{conservation}} {{status of the}} North Pacific right whale as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> to conclude the three living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{study by}} Nicolás Campione and David Evans, the authors {{conducted}} {{the first ever}} morphometric analysis to compare the various specimens assigned to Edmontosaurus. They concluded that only two species are valid: E. regalis, from the late Campanian, and E. annectens, from the late Maastrichtian. Their study provided <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> that Anatotitan copei is a synonym of E. annectens; specifically, that the long, low skull of A. copei {{is the result of}} ontogenetic change and represents mature E. annectens individuals.|$|E
5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Many Southerners {{believed}} his warnings and read every political news {{story from the}} North as <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> of the planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death {{with the election of}} Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new Confederate States, which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.|$|E

5|$|Nico Ditch, an {{earthwork}} {{stretching from}} Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, {{is evidence of}} Anglo-Saxon activity in Tameside. It was probably dug between the 7th and 9th centuries {{and may have been}} used as a boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. <b>Further</b> <b>evidence</b> of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names from Old English such as -tun, meaning farmstead, and leah meaning clearing.|$|E
5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between the thick basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks {{suggest that the}} breccia {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia—but not in adjacent country rock—provide <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{the quantum}} {{nature of the}} atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam {{could be expected to}} spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E

50|$|Routledge {{regard for}} the Musgrave family is <b>further</b> <b>evidenced</b> in three of five Routledge wills testated between 1597 and 1631, which were interpretated by J V Harrison and {{presented}} to the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archeogocial Society in 1967.|$|R

5|$|The first {{documentary}} {{record of the}} castle dates from 1086 and <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> is limited until the 13th century. Robert's son, William, rebelled against William Rufus in 1106, who confiscated the castle. Reginald de Dunstanville held it between 1141 and 1175, and it passed to the then Prince John when he acquired {{the title of the}} Count of Mortain in 1189, and then passed back {{into the hands of the}} Crown after John's rebellion against his brother, Richard I, in 1191.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of pneumatic foramina in Majungasaurus, besides providing {{an understanding of}} its respiratory biology, also has larger-scale implications for evolutionary biology. The split between the ceratosaur line, which led to Majungasaurus, and the tetanuran line, to which birds belong, occurred {{very early in the}} history of theropods. The avian respiratory system, present in both lines, must therefore have evolved before the split, and well before the evolution of birds themselves. This provides <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> of the dinosaurian origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.
