Model and actress Jaime Bergman chose the [...] "quick and bold" [...] Ayane as a Dead or Alive 2 character she would partner with. While awarding the Annual GameSpy E3 Award to Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, Raymond 'Psylancer' Padilla wrote, [...] "Ayane should be my new girlfriend." [...] He later elaborated: [...] "To be honest, I always thought Ayane was an uptight bitch with a massive chip on her shoulder. I always rooted for Kasumi in their feud. Then a funny thing <b>happened</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw the trailer for Dead or Alive Ultimate during E3 2004 -- I started to care about Ayane. Learning more about her story, her upbringing, and the root of her feud with Kasumi made me change sides." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey also described himself as [...] "more of an Ayane sort of guy." [...] In 2005, she was described as his favourite Dead or Alive character by James Mielke from 1UP.com. Featuring Ayane as a [...] "videogame babe of the day" [...] in 2009, IGN's Chris Carle commented: [...] "After that awkward goth stage in high school, not many people continue to rock the violet locks, but Ayane is different… she's hot enough {{to get away with}} it." [...] "Kayane", pseudonym of the professional gamer Marie-Laure Norindr comes from a mix of [...] "Kasumi" [...] and [...] "Ayane". Kayane said: [...] "She has a lot of charisma and is pretty. She’s full of anger but has a sweet heart in fact. I think she has the most interesting story and personality in the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had <b>happened,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
