5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a <b>dinner</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E

When he was nearly 80, he visited his Nevada silver mine by canoeing down the Colorado River and descending into the mine in a bucket, and when he was 81, he traveled to Germany with his grandson, Joseph Wharton Lippincott, to visit Kaiser Wilhelm II and had <b>dinner</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kaiser's yacht.

News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, {{and by the end of}} June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair.

The Dissenters found themselves forced to plead ignorance and decry the [...] "radical" [...] ideas promoted by the handbill. It was becoming clear by 12 July that there would be trouble at the dinner. [...] On the morning of 14 July graffiti such as [...] "destruction to the Presbyterians" [...] and [...] "Church and King for ever" [...] were scrawled across the town.

500|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of his death, Carradine's widow, Annie, {{announced}} that she had filed a lawsuit for wrongful death against the company that produced the film Carradine was working on {{at the time of his}} death.

[...] "The suit alleges, the assistant left him behind for <b>dinner</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night before the actor was found dead.

However, after hearing Pete discuss his future plans, Jim realizes that he used to have Pete's ambition but has become stuck at the same job for over nine years.

500|$|Ferguson {{wrote that}} Sheila {{believed}} the devil {{had given her}} the power to project evil onto others, and that she could make her sons have sex and cause violence with her. She called them the [...] "devil's children", the phrase June had used of Sheila, and said she believed she was capable of murdering them or of getting them to kill others. She spoke about suicide, although the court heard that Ferguson did not regard her as a suicide risk. She was discharged in September 1983. He continued treating her as an outpatient with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug. She was re-admitted to St Andrew's in March 1985, five months before the murders, after a psychotic episode in which she believed herself to be in direct communication with God and that people, including her boyfriend, were trying to hurt or kill her. She was discharged just under four weeks later, and as an outpatient received a monthly injection of haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that has a sedative effect. From that point, the twins lived {{all or most of}} the time with Colin in Kilburn. According to Bamber, the family discussed placing the boys in daytime foster care over <b>dinner</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of the murders, with little response from Sheila.|$|E
500|$|The animus {{that had}} been {{building}} against Dissenters and supporters of the American and French Revolutions exploded in July 1791. Priestley and several other Dissenters had arranged to have a celebratory <b>dinner</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, a provocative action {{in a country where}} many disapproved of the French Revolution and feared that it might spread to Britain. Amid fears of violence, Priestley was convinced by his friends not to attend. Rioters gathered outside the hotel during the banquet and attacked the attendees as they left. The rioters moved on to the New Meeting and Old Meeting churches—and burned both to the ground. Priestley and his wife fled from their home; although their son William and others stayed behind to protect their property, the mob overcame them and torched Priestley's house [...] "Fairhill" [...] at Sparkbrook, destroying his valuable laboratory and all of the family's belongings. Twenty-six other Dissenters’ homes and three more churches were burned in the three-day riot. Priestley spent several days hiding with friends until he was able to travel safely to London. The carefully executed attacks of the [...] "mob" [...] and the farcical trials {{of only a handful of}} the [...] "leaders" [...] convinced many at the time—and modern historians later—that the attacks were planned and condoned by local Birmingham magistrates. When George III was eventually forced to send troops to the area, he said: [...] "I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled, and that the people see them in their true light." ...|$|E
