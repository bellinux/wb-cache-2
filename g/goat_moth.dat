50|$|The Metarbelinae are a {{subfamily}} of the Cossidae {{also called}} the carpenter or <b>goat</b> <b>moths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zyganisus caliginosus, the Australian <b>goat</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Cossidae family. It {{is found}} in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Endoxyla encalypti, the wattle <b>goat</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Cossidae family. It {{is found}} in Australia, {{where it has been}} {{recorded}} along the eastern coast from Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria to Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the <b>Goat</b> <b>Moth</b> colony. Saki saved him from {{drowning}} when he fell into a river. Two years later, he repaid the favor by saving Mamoru after he fell off a cliff. He gives Saki a letter from Maria.|$|E
50|$|Caterpillars are smooth {{with a few}} hairs. Most cossid {{caterpillars}} are tree borers, in {{some species}} taking {{up to three years}} to mature. The caterpillars pupate within their tunnels; they often have an unpleasant smell, hence another colloquial name is <b>goat</b> <b>moths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sesioidea is the {{superfamily}} currently containing clearwing moths (Sesiidae), castniid moths (Castniidae) {{and little}} bear moths (Brachodidae). There is evidence from head and thoracic morphology {{that the first}} two families, internally feeding in plants as caterpillars, are sisters, whilst some brachodids are known to feed on leaf surfaces (Edwards et al., 1999). Sesioidea {{are considered to be}} the sister group of Cossoideahttp://tolweb.org/Apoditrysia which contain the also internal-feeding <b>Goat</b> and Leopard <b>moths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Cossinae are the {{nominate}} subfamily of the Cossidae (carpenter or goat moths). The caterpillars {{of several}} Cossinae species, {{such as the}} carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae) and the <b>goat</b> <b>moth</b> (Cossus cossus), are significant pests. On the other hand, in Chile the caterpillars of the Chilean moth (Chilecomadia moorei) are collected on a commercial scale for sale as fishing bait and terrarium pet food; they are usually called [...] "butterworms" [...] in international trade.|$|E
5000|$|The family {{includes}} the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae) and the <b>goat</b> <b>moth</b> (Cossus cossus) which have gained notoriety as pests. However, the large caterpillars {{of species that}} do not smell badly are often edible. Witchetty grubs [...] - [...] among the outback's most famous bush tucker [...] - [...] are most commonly the caterpillars of Endoxyla leucomochla, {{one of the more}} than 80 cossid species in Australia. In Chile, the sweet-smelling caterpillars of the Chilean moth (Chilecomadia moorei) are harvested in quantity and internationally traded as butterworms, for use as pet food and fishing bait.|$|E
40|$|Living {{stages of}} the {{quarantine}} pest Anoplophora chinensis Forster, the so called Citrus Longhorned Beetle (CLB), have been detected repeatedly during import inspections of young trees in several European Union member states. CLB infested plants show almost no external symptoms for identification by visual inspection. Therefore, according to the European Union plant health legislation (EU-Commission-Implementing Decision 2012 / 138 /EG), destructive sampling of the plants at random is required. Infrared thermography has been assessed as alternative, non-destructive testing method. Due to the quarantine status of CLB, the native <b>goat</b> <b>moth,</b> Cossus cossus L., was used as surrogate for the studies. Three types of thermography cameras have been tested using standardized wooden samples during two long-term measurements. Neither passive nor active thermographic methods were able to visualize enough differences in temperatures to detect larvae, boreholes or boredust inside of wooden samples. Therefore infrared thermography with its currently available technology {{seems to be no}} appropriate technique for detecting insect stages or defects in young trees...|$|E
