Each {{molecule}} {{shown in}} line-angle representation, where each angle (vertex) represents a carbon atom, and each line a bond between atoms (and where necessary hydrogen atoms to fulfill carbon's valence of four are implied). The heterocyclic spiro product, at right of arrow, {{is a common}} ketal (acetal) structure prepared from a monocyclic type of ketone and a generally acyclic type of diol (both at left of arrow). The schematic is for the synthesis of the protected 1,4-dioxaspiro4.5decane from cyclohexanone and the alcohol, <b>ethanediol.</b> Note the apparent planarity, which masks the actual orthogonal orientation of the two rings.|$|E
50|$|A common {{case is the}} {{presence}} of two atoms that are not carbon in one of the rings, with those two rings both attached to the spiro atom; indeed, often the earliest exposure of a chemist in training to a spiro compound is to a heterocyclic form, the ketal (acetal) formed in the protection of ketones by diols and dithiols. An example of this is shown above, in the synthesis of the acetal 1,4-dioxaspiro4.5decane from cyclohexanone and <b>ethanediol.</b> In this case, because the four atoms attached to the spiro atom are not all carbons, the spiro atom is not a quaternary carbon. A further example of an acetal formed from a cyclic ketone, except with a dithiol, is the spiro compound spirapril, which has a five-membered ring formed from 1,2-ethanedithiol. Again, while the rings could be identical, in the heterocyclic case they are, again, almost always non-identical. Once again, the best-fit planes to each ring are generally non-coplanar to one another (i.e., the rings are not coplanar, despite appearing so in images).|$|E

There was a marked increase in the oxalic acid excretion by the rats given <b>ethanediol</b> while rats given the alkoxyacetates excreted large amounts of ethoxyacetic and butoxyacetic acid, respectively. While not increased compared with controls, the excretion of oxalic acid by the latter group of rats was correlated to the excretion of the respective alkoxyacetic acids. The ammonia and glycosaminoglycan excretion was also smaller than that of controls. The urinary activity of succinate dehydrogenase was decreased in rats given the alkoxyacetates but not in animals exposed to <b>ethanediol</b> or propanediol. The data show that oxalic acid is actually a minor metabolite of the alkoxyacetates while the biochemical effects in kidney are associated more with the alkoxyacetic acid load.

The melting behaviour of the copolyesteramides was studied by d. s. c. The dynamic mechanical properties were investigated on injection moulded bars using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The melting temperature decreased with increasing 1, 4 -butyleneisophthalamide ester content. The crystallisation rate, the modulus above the glass transition temperature and the glass transition temperature hardly changed. The APEA of 1, 4 -butyleneisophthalamide ester and <b>ethanediol</b> was amorphous. The lowering of the melting temperature of the copolymers was probably caused by a decrease in lamellar size.

Alkyl chain length and linker structure are important potential modifiers of antiviral activity and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized a series of alkoxyalkyl esters of CDV or cyclic CDV with alkyl chains from 8 to 24 atoms and having linker moieties of glycerol, propanediol, and <b>ethanediol.</b> We also synthesized alkyl esters of CDV which lack the linker to determine if the alkoxyalkyl linker moiety is required for activity.

The most active compounds had 20 atoms esterified to the phosphonate of CDV. Both alkoxypropyl and alkyl esters of CDV provided enhanced antiviral activities against CMV in vitro.

30|$|A {{significant}} promotion {{effect of}} low-molecular hydroxyl compounds (LMHCs) {{was found in}} the nano-photoelectrocatalytic (NPEC) degradation of fulvic acid (FA), which is a typical kind of humic acid existing widely in natural water bodies, and its influence mechanism was proposed. A TiO 2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) material is served as the photoanode. Methanol, <b>ethanediol,</b> and glycerol were chosen as the representative of LMHCs in this study. The adsorption performance of organics on the surface of TNAs was investigated by using the instantaneous photocurrent value. The adsorption constants of FA, methanol, <b>ethanediol,</b> and glycerol were 43.44, 19.32, 7.00, and 1.30, respectively, which indicates that FA has the strongest adsorption property. The degradation performance of these organics and their mixture were observed in a thin-layer reactor. It shows that FA could hardly achieve exhausted mineralization alone, while LMHCs could be easily oxidized completely in the same condition. The degradation degree of FA, which is added LMHCs, improves significantly and the best promotion effect is achieved by glycerol. The promotion effect of LMHCs in the degradation of FA could be contributed to the formation of a tremendous amount of hydroxyl radicals in the NPEC process. The hydroxyl radicals could facilitate the complete degradation of both FA and its intermediate products. Among the chosen LMHCs, glycerol molecule which has three hydroxyls could generate the most hydroxyl radicals and contribute the best effective promotion. This work provides a new way to promote the NPEC degradation of FA and a direction to remove humus from polluted water.|$|E

To convert these compounds into stable and combustible oxygenated organics (alcohols and esters), one step hydrogenation-esterification (OHE) was carried out over Raney Ni catalyst (RN) and Mo, Sn, Fe, Cu modified Raney Ni catalysts (RNs) in the presence of methanol. 100 % conversions of furfural and hydroxyacetone were achieved over RNs with high selectivity to desired products. The acetic acid conversion was only 35. 1 % with no methanol addition, while within 6 g/ 8 g methanol/MCB addition, the conversion of acetic acid increased to 81. 1 %.

The ingredient chemicals LiNO 3 (A.R, Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd., China), iron (III) nitrate Fe(NO 3) 3 · 9 H 2 O (A.R, Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd., China), and NH 4 H 2 PO 4 (A.R, Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd., China) were dissolved stoichiometrically in the saturated solution of complexing agent in water, and then, ascorbic acid was added to form a homogeneous solution after continuous stirring for 1 h at 55 °C. The reaction mixture was adjusted to a pH of 6.5 with ammonia water and stirred at 75 °C, and then, the solution was evaporated to dryness. The residue was formed into gel, which was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mixture was pelletized and heated {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} at 600 °C for 4 h, and then cooled slowly to room temperature.|$|E
30|$|In summary, pure SnO 2 NBs and Pd-SnO 2 NBs {{have been}} {{successfully}} synthesized by thermal evaporation at 1, 350 °C, and a highly sensitive single Pd-SnO 2 NB and SnO 2 NB sensor devices have been developed. The sensing properties of the two devices were investigated systematically. It is found that the single pure SnO 2 NB sensor shows a high sensitivity at 230 °C to ethanol, and the Pd-SnO 2 NB one exhibits a higher sensitivity of 4.3 to ethanol at the concentration of 1, 000  ppm, which is the highest sensitivity for a single SnO 2 NB. The Pd-SnO 2 NB can detect C 2 H 5 OH from 25 °C to 300 °C {{for a wide range}} of concentration (1 [*]~[*] 1, 000  ppm). Additionally, whether it is ethanol, <b>ethanediol,</b> or acetone, the Pd-SnO 2 NB shows a better gas-sensing property than the pure SnO 2 NB. Furthermore, both at low temperature and low concentration, the response of Pd-SnO 2 NB is better than that of its counterpart.|$|E
