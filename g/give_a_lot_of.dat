25|$|There {{have been}} few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, {{who knew how to}} squeeze the last drop out of any {{situation}} that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition with just the right run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me wince. It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> credit to the developer on. It just looks right. They were smart about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E

Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to {{which there was no}} response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E

500|$|Allen and May's {{first series}} in control {{resulted}} in a 3–2 win over South Africa. In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2–1. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed {{for the inclusion of}} Cyril Washbrook, who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years. The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by Bill Bowes, a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, Fred Trueman, to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place. Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, David Sheppard, who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test Denis Compton was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94. The Wisden editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: [...] "I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [...] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was too much trouble for them." [...] Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> assistance to spin bowlers, which led to Laker's extraordinary success in the series. Allen denied any involvement. During the winter, Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket.|$|E

We're all really {{dependent}} in nearly everything, {{and we all}} make a fuss about being independent in something. The Prime Minister prides himself on doing without a chauffeur, but he can't do without a factotum and Jack-of-all-trades; and poor old Bunker has to play {{the part of a}} universal genius, which God knows he was never meant for.

And here we have old Hook pretending to produce his own fish when he couldn't produce his own fish knives or fish forks to eat it with.

A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly, and then I continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy. You see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea; and I do not pretend {{to be such a}} genius as to have been sure of coming in first, {{in the case of a}} race for the discovery. And you see it was important that if I really meant to make a pile, people should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus. The money simply flowed away. I grudged myself everything except scientific appliances. I tried to keep things going by a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and I have no university degree, nor very much education except in chemistry, and I found I had to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time and labour for precious little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing. Three years ago I settled the problem of the composition of the flux, and got near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon composition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing tightly, and heating." ...|$|E

Pity she couldn't marry a curate and leave him (Kipps) alone! Then he'd know what to do. He disliked the whole gathering collectively and in detail. Why were they all trying to make him one of themselves? He perceived unexpected ugliness everywhere about him. There were two great pins jabbed through the tall girl's hat, and the swirls of her hair below the brim with the minutest piece of tape tie-up showing did not repay close examination. Mrs. [...] "Wogdelenk" [...] wore a sort of mumps bandage of lace, and there was another lady perfectly dazzling with beads, and jewels and bits of trimming. They were all flaps and angles and flounces--these women. Not one of them looked as neat and decent a shape as Ann's clean, trim, little figure. Echoes of Masterman woke up in him again. Ladies indeed! Here were all these chattering people, with money, with leisure, with every chance in the world, and all they could do was to crowd like this into a couple of rooms and jabber nonsense about anagrams.|$|E
