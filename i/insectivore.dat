5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal <b>insectivore</b> {{something}} like a tree shrew. Due to their nocturnal habits, most mammals lost their color vision, and greatly improved their sense of hearing. All mammals of today are shaped by this origin. Primates later re-evolved color-vision.|$|E
5|$|Forest cobras {{will feed}} {{on a wide}} variety of prey, {{including}} amphibians, fish, other snakes, monitor lizards and other lizards, bird eggs, rodents, and other small mammals. It has been recorded as taking mudskippers, and in west Africa, one specimen had eaten a Gifford's giant shrew, an <b>insectivore</b> with a smell so noxious, most other snakes would not touch it.|$|E
5|$|These dainty birds {{resemble}} Old World warblers {{in their}} structure and habits, moving restlessly through foliage while seeking insects. The gnatcatchers are mainly a soft bluish gray {{in color and}} have the long sharp bill typical of an <b>insectivore.</b> Many species have distinctive black head patterns (especially males) and long, regularly cocked black-and-white tails. One species has been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
50|$|For <b>insectivores,</b> {{abundance}} and species richness of most frequently captured birds declined significantly in post-isolation reserves. The obligate army ant-following species disappeared completely from 1 and 10 ha isolates within 2 years of isolation. As with <b>insectivores,</b> frugivores showed significant declines in capture rates after isolation and four species showed effects of time since isolation. Nectarivores, such as understory hummingbirds, {{proved to be}} less vulnerable to fragmentation than <b>insectivores</b> and frugivores.|$|R

50|$|Seminole bats are <b>insectivores.</b> <b>Insectivores</b> are {{animals that}} feed {{primarily}} on insects. They {{have been found}} to eat relatively large amount of Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (moths). They have also been shown to eat smaller amounts of Homoptera (cicadas) and Diptera (flies).|$|R
5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an <b>insectivore</b> or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear patterns on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|The huia, {{with the}} {{previously}} endangered saddleback, {{were the two}} species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal <b>insectivore</b> guild in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of Wallace's line; their ecological niche is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and Nothofagus forests; one was the huia {{and the other was}} the kaka.|$|E
5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an <b>insectivore</b> or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth {{suggests}} that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E

40|$|Understory avian <b>insectivores</b> are {{especially}} sensitive to deforestation, although regional {{differences in how}} these species respond to human disturbance {{may be linked to}} varying land-use histories. South Asia experienced widespread conversion of forest to agriculture in the nineteenth century, providing a comparison to tropical areas deforested more recently. In Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats of India, we compared understory <b>insectivores</b> to other guilds, and to <b>insectivores</b> with different vertical strata preferences, both inside mixed-species flocks and for the whole bird community. Overall species richness did not change across the land-use gradient, although there was substantial turnover in species composition between land-use types. We found that the proportion of species represented by <b>insectivores</b> was ~ 1. 14 times higher in forest compared to agriculture, and the proportion of <b>insectivores</b> represented by understory species was ~ 1. 32 times higher in forests. Mass-abundance relationships were very different when analyzed on mixed-species flocks compared to the total community, perhaps indicating reduced competition in these mutualisms. We show that South Asia fits the worldwide pattern of understory <b>insectivores</b> declining with increased land-use intensity, and conclude that these species can be used globally as indicator and/or umbrella species for conservation across different disturbance time scales.

5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking <b>insectivore),</b> roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) {{appeared}} in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million {{years after the first}} therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal <b>insectivore</b> niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; The Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, was a near-relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the Nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids. The earliest known metatherian is Sinodelphys, found in 125 million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.|$|E

25|$|Indiana bats live in {{hardwood}} {{forests and}} hardwood-pine forests. It {{is common in}} old-growth forest {{as well as in}} agricultural land like croplands and old fields. Overall, the bats mostly live in forest, crop fields, and grasslands.

25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is {{primarily}} a scavenger, though it will occasionally attack and kill any defenseless animal it can overcome, and will supplement its diet with fruits. The spotted hyena, though it also scavenges occasionally, is an active pack hunter of medium to large sized ungulates, which it catches by wearing them down in long chases and dismembering them in a canid-like manner. The aardwolf {{is primarily a}}n <b>insectivore,</b> specialised for feeding on termites of the genus Trinervitermes and Hodotermes, which it consumes by licking them up with its long, broad tongue. An aardwolf can eat 300,000 Trinervitermes on a single outing.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Cuvier and Blumenbach, Samuel Thomas von Soemmering interpreted Collini's fossil as a mammal. Specifically, he interpreted {{it as an}} unusual bat, which morphologically linked mammals with birds. He named this strange creature Ornithocephalus. Soemmering may have interpreted this series of forms in an evolutionary sense, following the early evolutionary ideas of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. Soemmering's analysis of the specimen was blemished by anatomical errors, like the misidentifications of bones. Soemmering agreed with Cuvier that the creature was a flying <b>insectivore,</b> however. Soemmering argued that pterosaurs walked on all fours like bats when on the ground. His advocacy for this interpretation of pterosaur terrestrial gait has been regarded {{as the beginning of}} a multi-century debate on the subject.|$|E
25|$|On Oahu, a white morph of {{the monarch}} has emerged. This {{is because of}} the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two bulbul species, Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus jocosus. They are now the most common <b>insectivore</b> birds, and {{probably}} the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be tolerant of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e. the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} of higher-level relationships among placental mammal {{centers on the}} order Inserctivora. Huxley argued that <b>insectivores</b> retain many primitive features. They are closer to their ancestor mammals than the living groups. Cladistic analysis suggests that living <b>insectivores</b> are “united by derived anatomical features”. <b>Insectivores</b> are not monophyletic, golden moles included. This clade also includes hyraxes, manatees, elephants, elephant shrews and aardvarks. They are from an African origin.
