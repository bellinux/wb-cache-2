Indeed, in the next scene they have set Baron up with a cop in drag to entrap him with procurement of prostitutes.|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau thought {{highly of}} the album, however, writing in The Village Voice at the time: [...] "The {{music is not}} only simple and attractive, with the {{synthesizer}} used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously." [...] He later wrote: [...] "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you <b>know</b> <b>why?</b> <b>It</b> has soul, that's why – it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero {{but as long as}} he's Roger's that doesn't matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and {{seemed to want to}} make sure that I knew he had never married her. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E
500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the move}} to a Friday evening timeslot, Enterprise was going up {{directly}} against episodes of Stargate SG-1 on the Sci Fi Channel. The overall ratings by Nielsen Media Research placed the show in 150th place for the season. The season opened with ratings of 2.0/4 percent {{for the first part}} of [...] "", [...] but the series lowest ratings were received for the mid season episode [...] "". Five other episodes equalled the 2.0/4 percent ratings of [...] "Storm Front" [...] while [...] "Cold Station 12", [...] "The Augments" [...] and [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] each received 2.1/4 percent ratings. However, the highest ratings of the seasons were received for the series finale, [...] "These Are The Voyages...", which gained ratings of 2.4/4 percent. Rick Berman credited the falling ratings received by the series to a variety of elements saying, [...] "The show certainly had a great start. It got very good reviews and it had a huge audience for the first half a dozen episodes and then it started to slip. I could take the blame for it. I could put the blame into the scripts. I could put the blame into franchise fatigue. I don’t <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> didn’t work." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Bush {{was widely}} seen as a [...] "pragmatic caretaker" [...] {{president}} who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts. Indeed, Bush's sound bite where he refers {{to the issue of}} overarching purpose as [...] "the vision thing" [...] has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties. [...] "He does not say why he wants to be there", wrote columnist George Will, [...] "so the public does not <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> should care if he gets his way".|$|E
2500|$|Page {{was born}} to James Patrick Page and Patricia Elizabeth Gaffikin in the west London suburb of Heston on 9 January 1944.

In 1952, they moved to Feltham and then to Miles Road, Epsom in Surrey, which is where Page came across his first guitar.

2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Noddy Holder {{spoke of the}} success in Belgium: [...] "What {{happened}} in Belgium was that Return to Base was available on import, and it started to climb the import charts. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>it</b> {{was as much a}} surprise to us as it was to anybody. Warner Bros. Records then said to us, due to it starting to show some action, would we want to release it over there as a major release. We thought [...] "why not?" [...] – and now it's the number one album over there!" [...] Speaking of [...] "I'm a Rocker", Holder said: [...] "That was the track getting the most airplay from the album. But it's not just a case of that applying in Belgium – we've had so many people writing to us asking why we've not released it as a single. [...] "I'm a Rocker" [...] is not even one of our songs though – it's a Chuck Berry number." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beatles guitarist George Harrison {{described}} {{the song in}} 1969 as [...] "one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge." [...] Lennon described it as [...] "more of Paul's granny music". In 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being [...] "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out {{at that time in}} my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|The United States Coast Guard {{records that}} in 1795, Lynx, {{under the command}} of Beresford, fired a shot across the bow of the United states revenue Cutter Eagle. [...] Hendrick Fischer, Eagle's acting captain, {{attempted}} to heave-to, but he had on board Senator Pierce Butler, from South Carolina, who ordered him to sail on. [...] Lynx then began to fire continuously as Eagle sailed towards the shoal waters on the north point of Jekyll Island. [...] As Lynx drew too much water to continue the chase, Beresford sent his pinnace and cutter in pursuit, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Alexander Skene, who four years later would command Lynx. [...] The British quickly overtook the schooner and came on board, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> hadn't come about in response to the shots. After learning the schooner was in fact a revenue vessel of the U.S. government, Skene and his men returned to Lynx.|$|E

2500|$|On April 27, 1998, {{the hotel}} tower was {{imploded}} at 7:27 pm {{to make way}} for construction of the new Aladdin resort. The Aladdin Theatre was retained and incorporated into the new resort. It was the fifth Las Vegas resort to be imploded. Aladdin executives set up a 1,000-person tent near the Aladdin and charged $250 a ticket for people to watch the implosion from inside the tent, with the proceeds benefiting the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Southern Nevada. The old resort's sign read, [...] "Out of the dust Aladdin rises anew. See you in 2000." [...] Frank Wright, the curator of the Nevada State Museum, said about the Aladdin's lack of success: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> never made it. It never had the glamour of the Sands or the exotic dancers of the Tropicana or the Dunes or Stardust. Maybe it was location, but the Hacienda was farther out, and it was a success." ...|$|E

It blamed Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein for orchestrating the toll lane closures. The report revealed that Wildstein said that he informed Christie of the ongoing lane closures during a September 11, 2013, memorial event, but asserted that Christie did not recall that exchange. It noted that Michael Drewniak said Wildstein appeared [...] "anxious" [...] during a dinner with him on December 4, 2013, and that Wildstein [...] "had mentioned the Fort Lee traffic study to the Governor" [...] while the lane closures were taking place. Drewniak said Wildstein {{told him that the}} plan to shut the lanes and attribute it to a [...] "traffic study" [...] were Wildstein's idea, and that Kelly and Bill Stepien had [...] "some knowledge." [...] The report also found [...] "no evidence" [...] that Stepien or Baroni knew of the improper motives for the lane closures, although they were aware that the lanes were to be closed and that traffic patterns were to be changed as a result.|$|E
