40|$|Two studies {{evaluated}} the proteolysis of alfalfa that was <b>ensiled</b> in laboratory silos under different modified atmospheres. In the first study, fourthcutting alfalfa was <b>ensiled</b> at 25 % dry matter (DM) for 28 d. The forage treatments were a modified atmosphere of 3 % O 2 : 20 % CO 2 : 77 % N 2, or formic acid (6 ml/kg of fresh weight); an untreated control {{was used for}} comparison. Proteolysis was assessed from the concentrations of NH 3 N, free amino acid (AA) N, and nonprotein N (NPN). Peptide N was estimated as the difference between total NPN and the sum of NH 3 N plus free AA N. Higher silage pH and lower concentrations of total organic acids suggested that the modified atmosphere reduced forage fermentation. The modified atmosphere was effective in reducing proteolysis to a level similar to that achieved with formic acid. Alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> under the modified atmosphere had more peptide N than did alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with formic acid, which may be advantageous. In the second study, alfalfa was <b>ensiled</b> at 20 and 28 % DM as an untreated control or treated with N 2 gas or a modified atmosphere composed of 3 % O 2 : 15 % CO 2 : 82 % N 2. The NH 3 N concentrations were higher in alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> at 28 % DM under N 2 gas or the modified atmosphere.

50|$|Using {{the same}} {{technique}} {{as the process}} for making sauerkraut, green fodder was preserved for animals in parts of Germany {{since the start of}} the 19th century. This gained the attention of a French agriculturist, Auguste Goffart of Sologne, near Orléans, who published a book in 1877 which described the experiences of preserving green crops in silos. Goffart's experience attracted considerable attention. The conditions of dairy farming in the USA suited the <b>ensiling</b> of green corn fodder, and was soon adopted by New England farmers. Francis Morris of Maryland prepared the first silage produced in America in 1876. The favourable results obtained in the U.S. led to the introduction of the system in the United Kingdom, where Thomas Kirby first introduced the process for British dairy herds.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} determine the effect of the additive Sill-All application on ad libitum intake, in vivo digestibility and nitrogen balance of alfalfa haylage. About 40 % alfalfa plants was <b>ensiled</b> at the phonological flowering stage into plastic foil-wrapped bales without or with additive (2 L t- 1 plant mass). No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> without additive and alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with additive for the content of dry matter (DM) (632 g and 631 g DM kg- 1 fresh sample, respectively). Alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> without additive contained 921 g organic matter (OM) kg- 1 DM, which was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) compared to alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with additive (902 g OM kg- 1 DM). Alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> without additive contained 141 g crude proteins (CP) kg- 1 DM, which was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) compared to alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with additive (139 g CP kg- 1 DM). Alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with additive contained significantly less acid detergent fibers (ADF) (P< 0. 001) compared to alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> without additive (445 g kg- 1 DM and 456 g kg- 1 DM, respectively) and had a lower pH value (P< 0. 001) (5. 29 and 5. 56, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found between the studied feeding treatments for ad libitum intake of fresh ration and DM ration, for the measured parameters of digestibility and N balance.

5000|$|Silos are {{potentially}} hazardous: deaths may {{occur in the}} process of filling and maintaining them, and several safety precautions are necessary. There is a risk of injury by machinery or from falls. When a silo is filled, fine dust particles in the air can become explosive because of their large aggregate surface area. Also, fermentation presents respiratory hazards. The <b>ensiling</b> process produces [...] "silo gas" [...] during {{the early stages of the}} fermentation process. Silage gas contains nitric oxide (NO), which will react with oxygen (O2) in the air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is toxic. Lack of oxygen inside the silo can cause asphyxiation. Molds that grow when air reaches cured silage can cause organic dust toxic syndrome. Collapsing silage from large bunker silos has caused deaths. Silage itself poses no special danger.|$|E

50|$|Weed cutting {{boats are}} {{developed}} {{to enable the}} maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers and to remove excessive aquatic life such as algae and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's ecology. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have underwater cutting blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be composted, sent to a landfill site or used in land reclamation. In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by hand, crane, pump or conveyor system. The harvested vegetation {{may be used for}} the feeding of livestock. To reduce the high moisture content and {{to make it easier to}} transport, the weed can be chopped and pressed. Other uses to which the harvested vegetation can be put include <b>ensiling</b> the material for livestock fodder, adding it to the soil as a bulky organic fertilizer, manufacturing the raw material into pulp, paper or fibre, and fermenting it to produce methane for energy production.|$|E

Starch soluble fraction (A) of the dent hybrid <b>ensiled</b> corn grains was greater comparing to the dry materials and in both conservation forms this fraction was reduced in the flint texture hybrid, while the insoluble fraction potentially degradable (B) the opposite occurred. The degradation potential was higher in grains <b>ensiled</b> in two textures. The <b>ensiled</b> allowed more starch effective degradation in relation to dry grain in two textures and the grains dent texture hybrid also increased such degradation in both conservation methods. The dent texture and the <b>ensiled</b> high-moisture grains proved the best option considering the starch degradability. Regardless of the conservation forms, the grains of corn hybrid flint texture should be finely ground, for providing higher ruminal degradation, while for the dent texture hybrid, the coarsely and whole grinding are the most suitable for <b>ensiled</b> and dry grain, respectively...|$|R

In the first period the <b>ensiled</b> AP {{and in the second}} period the dried AP were fed in an iso caloric, iso nitrogenous total mix ration. The Dry Matter (DM), crude protein and neutral detergent fiber of <b>ensiled</b> and dried AP were 247. 1, 63. 85, 386. 4 g kg - 1 DM and 888. 4, 51. 2, 385. 6 g kg - 1 DM, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>ensiling</b> {{temperature}} {{and duration of}} <b>ensiling</b> on the feeding quality of whole-crop maize (Zea mays L.) silages were investigated. Samples of one cultivar of maize plants were collected from two different fields, grown in different years on sandy soils. Samples were collected when the whole-plant dry matter content was approximately 330 g/kg. Maize plants were chopped and ensiled in mini silos at three different ambient temperatures (5, 12 and 18 °C). The <b>ensiling</b> temperature affected the <b>ensiling</b> fermentation processes, causing different rates of pH decline and different final pH values. Samples from the silos were taken after 0 (not ensiled, i. e. control), 4, 8 and 16 weeks of <b>ensiling.</b> The silage samples were not dried, but ground-frozen under liquid nitrogen to pass a 1 -mm sieve. The gas production technique {{was used to evaluate}} the influence of the <b>ensiling</b> temperature and the duration of <b>ensiling</b> on the degradation of the silage samples in rumen fluid. The gas production was highest when the maize was ensiled at 12 °C (p < 0. 0001). An increase in <b>ensiling</b> duration caused a decrease in silage pH, accompanied by a decrease in gas production (p < 0. 0001). The decrease in gas production was linearly related to the decrease in pH at the three temperatures.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ensiling</b> is {{a common}} method of {{preserving}} energy crops for anaerobic digestion, and many scientific studies report that <b>ensiling</b> increases the methane yield. In this study, the <b>ensiling</b> process and the methane yields before and after <b>ensiling</b> were studied for four crop materials. Results The changes in wet weight and total solids (TS) during <b>ensiling</b> were small {{and the loss of}} energy negligible. The methane yields related to wet weight and to volatile solids (VS) were not significantly different before and after <b>ensiling</b> when the VS were corrected for loss of volatile compounds during TS and VS determination. However, when the TS were measured according to standard methods and not corrected for losses of volatile compounds, the TS loss during <b>ensiling</b> was overestimated for maize and sugar beet. The same methodological error leads to overestimation of methane yields; when TS and VS were not corrected the methane yield appeared to be 51 % higher for ensiled than fresh sugar beet. Conclusions <b>Ensiling</b> did not increase the methane yield of the studied crops. Published methane yields, as well as other information on silage related to uncorrected amounts of TS and VS, should be regarded with caution. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this experiment {{was to compare}} the drying and <b>ensiling</b> methods to reduce cyanides contents in cassava, as well as related nutrient components. This experiment used roots and stems of cas-sava, fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB) and molasses.

40|$|The {{brown seaweed}} Sargassum muticum is an {{invasive}} species to {{the coasts of}} the British Isles, mainland Europe and North America. Attempts at its eradication and control have generally not been successful, although time-consuming and costly. Commercial exploration of this biomass for fuel could encourage its harvesting and control. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been suggested {{as one of the}} most promising methods of exploiting algae for biofuel. The harvesting of S. muticum is seasonal, and thus there will be a need to preserve and store seaweed to supply a year-round anaerobic digestion process. <b>Ensiling</b> is widely used in terrestrial agriculture, but there has been little research on <b>ensiling</b> seaweed. The aim of this research was to study the effect of <b>ensiling</b> on the biomethane potential of S. muticum and effect of size reduction prior to ensilage on leachate and other losses during <b>ensiling</b> and examine the mass balance and energy losses of <b>ensiling</b> S. muticum. <b>Ensiling</b> was found to be an effective, low energy loss method of preserving seaweed with energy loss from the biomass due to <b>ensiling</b> < 8 % of the Higher Heating value of seaweed feedstock. <b>Ensiling</b> results in losses of salt from the biomass and the virtual total loss of organic sulphur. Size reduction of seaweed prior to ensilage reduced leachate and energy loss from the biomass. <b>Ensiling</b> had no significant effect on methane yield. However, methane yields from S. muticum are low ≤ 0. 11 L CH 4 g- 1 VS at ~ 25 % of the theoretical maximum. Further research is needed to establish the reasons for the recalcitrance of S. muticum, but the C: N ratio of S. muticum is low (8 : 1), and co-digestion with a low nitrogen content substrate such as crude glycerol may be a potential method of improving methane yield...|$|E

In vitro digestibility of DM (IVDMD), ADF (IVADFD) and NDF (IVNDFD) was determined after digesting the by-products in buffered rumen fluid for 24 or 48 h in an incubator. CP content in peel, seed and peel silage is 4. 68, 4. 19 and 5. 27 % respectively. As expected, mango seed has a higher fibre content than mango peel and peel silage as indicated by NDF (53. 01 vs 25. 87 and 27. 56 % respectively) and ADF (31. 02 vs 19. 14 and 17. 68 % respectively). However, mango seed also has greater GE than mango peel and peel silage (4, 070 vs 3, 827 and 3, 984 kcal/g DM respectively), probably due partly to its high fat content. Four head of male native cattle {{were used to determine}} nutrient digestibility of <b>ensiled</b> mango by-products by randomly allowing them to receive <b>ensiled</b> mango peel with rice straw (EMPR) and different levels of Leucaena leaves. Treatments consisted of: 1) <b>ensiled</b> mango peel + rice straw (90 : 10); 2) <b>ensiled</b> mango peel + rice straw + Leucaena leaves (85 : 10 : 5); 3) <b>ensiled</b> mango peel + rice straw + Leucaena leaves (80 : 10 : 10); and 4) <b>ensiled</b> mango peel + rice straw + Leucaena leaves (75 : 10 : 15). Addition of Leucaena leaves to silage increased apparent digestibility of DM (53. 84, 55. 43, 59. 04 and 58. 69 % for the four formulations above respectively), probably because of increasing amounts of CP from Leucaena leaves, resulting in greater digestibility of NDF (39. 11, 44. 47, 47. 12 and 43. 32 % for the four formulations above respectively). Total digestible nutrients (TDN) and digestible energy (DE) showed the same trends as apparent digestibility of DM...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} coarse or fine grinding of three forms of corn {{on the performance of}} lactating cows. Six diets, fed as total mixed rations, were identical except for the corn portion of the diet. Corn treatments were dry shelled corn, high moisture <b>ensiled</b> ear corn, and high moisture <b>ensiled</b> shelled corn, either coarsely or finely ground. The experimental design was a 6 × 6 Latin square with 36 cows. Eighteen cows were assigned to the six different treatments and were fed once daily. Within this group of 18 cows, six had a ruminal cannula and were used to evaluate nutrient digestibilities and ruminal fermentation. The remaining 18 cows, six of which were ruminally cannulated, were similarly assigned, except they were fed twice daily. In the group fed once daily, milk production and composition were not affected by treatment. Starch digestibility was greater with the high moisture and with the finely ground corn treatments. In addition, the high moisture <b>ensiled</b> corn treatments had reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations. In the group that was fed twice daily, milk production and protein yield were greatest for the finely ground high moisture <b>ensiled</b> shelled corn treatment. Starch utilization was improved by fine grinding. Lower ruminal ammonia concentrations were obtained with the high moisture <b>ensiled</b> corn treatments, and there was a tendency for reduced ammonia concentration with fine grinding. Results indicate that high moisture <b>ensiled</b> corn as well as fine grinding improved nitrogen and starch utilization.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the effect of additional calcium carbonate into concentrate diet, {{on the performance of}} sheep fed <b>ensiled</b> king grass as a basal diet, a trial was conducted using 28 growing sheep (average body weight 17 _+ 1. 4 kg). Based on body weight, the animals were grouped and randomized into four dietary treatments in block randomized design. Dietary treatments were (i) chopped king grass + 400 g of concentrate, (ii) <b>ensiled</b> king grass + 400 g concentrate + 0 % of calcium carbonate, (iii) <b>ensiled</b> king grass + 400 g concentrate + 5 % calcium carbonate and (iv) <b>ensiled</b> king grass + 400 g concentrate + 10 % calcium carbonate. Results showed that offering 5 % of calcium carbonate into concentrate diet increased (P 0. 05) for all groups. No differences in the apparent digestibility of the nutrient components were observed, but crude protein decreased significantly (P < 0. 05). A significant relationship (P < 0. 01) was found between nitrogen intake (NI) and nitrogen retention (NR), and the equation was NR = - 0. 1848 + 0. 3788 NI (r = 0. 9). Based on data found that feeding only <b>ensiled</b> king grass as a single diet could not meet the maintenance requirement of energy and protein, therefore, additional energy and crude protein sources is needed...|$|R
