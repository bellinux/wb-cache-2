40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{characterization}} of measured electric fields on <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> due to lightning channel was studied done. Likewise, previous studies on this case were discussed and reviewed accordingly. Furthermore, the <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> was analyzed done in detailed and was indicated on the real measured electric fields. Later the results were discussed appropriately. The behaviorsof <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> signal has beencharacterized from previous researchers. This study shows themeasured data in detailed, which include there are slow front time, <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> peak, time to peak, zero crossing time and 10 % to 90 % rise time. The characteristic of <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> signal data in Malaysia was compared with data gathered in Sweden. Moreover In addition, the statistical correlation between electric field zero times and corresponding rise times was also been studied...|$|R

40|$|The common {{assumption}} that future {{increases in the}} number of elderly people will result in a parallel increase in the burden of care of long term disabled survivors of stroke was examined. The number of patients with <b>first</b> ever <b>strokes</b> and the net number of people handicapped after these strokes in England and Wales every five years until 2023 have been projected. Between the base year 1983 and the year 2023 an increase in population of about 5 % will occur; <b>first</b> ever <b>strokes</b> are projected to increase by about 30 % and deaths within six months of <b>first</b> ever <b>strokes</b> by about 40 %. The net number of severely handicapped people six months after a <b>first</b> ever <b>stroke</b> is projected to increase by only about 8 %, however, and the net {{number of people who are}} moderately or severely handicapped by only 4 %. This paradox occurs because <b>first</b> ever <b>stroke</b> often kills people who have been handicapped by other causes, particularly if they are elderly. It is concluded that despite the limitations of these data they strongly suggest that the increased burden of health care of patients with <b>first</b> ever <b>strokes</b> in the next 40 years will be primarily that of caring for those in the acute stages of stroke and not with the management of chronic handicap after a stroke...|$|R

25|$|George's <b>first</b> <b>stroke</b> {{occurred}} in 1890, after a global speaking tour concerning land {{rights and the}} relationship between rent and poverty. This stroke greatly weakened him, and he never truly recovered. Despite this, George tried to remain active in politics. Against the advice of his doctors, George campaigned for New York City mayor again in 1897, this time as an Independent Democrat. The strain of the campaign precipitated a second stroke, leading to his death four days before the election.|$|E

He was five films short of his personal goal. He is buried in Paris' Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Breaststroke {{uses the}} regular start for swimming. Some {{swimmers}} use a variant called the frog start, where the legs are pulled forward sharply before being extended again quickly during the airborne {{phase of the}} start. After the start a gliding phase follows under water, followed by one underwater pulldown and dolphin kick, then one whip kick as the hands are recovered back to a streamline. This {{is known as the}} pull-out. The head must break the surface before the arms reach their widest point on the <b>first</b> <b>stroke</b> after the pull-out. The downward butterfly kick was legalized by FINA, WWF and the NCAA in 2005, and remains optional. The downward fly kick is now allowed in MCSL.|$|E

40|$|TM (NLDN) in {{detecting}} cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning after an upgrade in 2002 and 2003. The 2 -year average flash detection efficiency (DE) in AZ was 93 % (1024 / 1097), and the measured (<b>first</b> plus subsequent) <b>stroke</b> DE was 76 % (2746 / 3620). The corresponding values in TX-OK were 92 % (338 / 367) and 86 % (755 / 882), respectively. After correcting {{for the time}} resolution of the video camera (16. 7 ms), we estimate that the actual NLDN stroke DE and video multiplicities were about 68 % and 3. 71 in AZ and 77 % and 2. 80 in TX-OK. The average DE for negative <b>first</b> <b>strokes</b> (92 %) was larger than the measured DE for subsequent strokes that produced a new ground contact (81 %) and the DE for subsequent strokes that remained in a preexisting channel (67 %). The primary cause of the NLDN missing strokes was that {{the peak of the}} radiated electromagnetic field was below the NLDN detection threshold. The average estimated peak current (Ip) of negative <b>first</b> <b>strokes</b> and the average multiplicity of negative flashes varied from storm to storm and between the two regions, but this variability did not affect the DE as long as the recording sessions had mor...|$|R

25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, {{prevention}} {{is an important}} public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In {{people who have had}} a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a <b>first</b> <b>stroke.</b> In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Henry's <b>first</b> <b>stroke</b> was in 1965 {{while he}} and his wife, Alice, were {{returning}} from Winston Churchill's funeral ceremony in their vehicle {{which resulted in a}} car crash. This, together with later strokes, left him dependent on a wheelchair, and he was unable to speak in his last remaining years. His last public appearance was at the unveiling of Queen Mary's plaque at Marlborough House in 1967, where he appeared weak and considerably older than the Duke of Windsor. In 1972, the Duke's elder son, Prince William, died in a plane crash. The Duke was in such poor health that his wife hesitated about whether to tell him. She later admitted in her memoirs that she did not, but that he may have learned of their son's death from television coverage.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{election}} in April 2005 {{there were several}} rumors about the Pope's health, {{but none of them}} were confirmed. Early in his pontificate Benedict XVI predicted a short reign, which led to concerns about his health. In May 2005 the Vatican announced that he had suffered another mild stroke. French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin said that since the <b>first</b> <b>stroke</b> Ratzinger had been suffering from an age-related heart condition, for which he was on medication. In late November 2006 Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had had a routine examination of the heart. A few days later an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, but this rumor was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider.|$|E

40|$|We aim to {{investigate}} the time-frequency profile for sets of lightning processes that occurred prior to the <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> which include narrow bipolar pulses, preliminary breakdown pulses and stepped leaders. The work is mainly using the wavelet transformation {{in order to gain}} the frequency spectrum while not losing the time information of the located pulses. 2 sets of events that include the narrow bipolar pulse (NBP) followed by preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs), stepped leaders (SLs) and the <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> (RS) are used in this paper. All selected data are recorded during northeastern monsoon season at the end of year 2012 in Malaysia. Parameters that used in this works includes the (1) upper and (2) lower frequency spectrum for both spectral and spread regions and (3) power spectrum. In average, the upper and lower frequency spectrum for NBP is at least 10 times higher when compare to the <b>first</b> return <b>stroke.</b> It is also found that the NBP radiates predominantly between 61 kHz and 168 kHz which much higher than the <b>first</b> return <b>stroke</b> with range from 2 kHz to 12 kHz. PBP pulses radiate intensely within 65 kHz to 1 MHz, whereas SL pulses radiate predominantly between 163 kHz and 455 kHz. In terms of power spectrum, PBP pulses tend to produce higher magnitude of power spectrum in the earlier stage and decreased towards the end of its process. In the contrary, SL pulses' power spectrum magnitudes are lower in the beginning and tend to increase when approaching to the <b>first</b> return <b>stroke...</b>|$|R
25|$|Since then, the {{development}} of breaststroke has gone hand-in-hand with the FINA rules. In about the mid-1960s, the rules changed to prevent the arm stroke from going beyond the hip line, except during the <b>first</b> <b>stroke</b> after the start and after each turn. A rule change came in 1987, before, the head had to be kept above the water surface during the entire stroke. Later on, swimmers were also allowed to break the water with {{parts of the body}} other than the head. This led to a variant of the stroke in which the arms are brought together as usual under the body after the pull but then are thrown forward over the water from under the chin until the arms are completely extended. There was a controversy at the 2004 Summer Olympics at Athens after Japan’s Kosuke Kitajima won the gold medal in the 100m breaststroke race over American Brendan Hansen, the world-record-holder. Video from underwater cameras showed Kitajima using a dolphin kick at the start and at some of the turns. Officials claimed that these kicks were not visible from above the surface of the water, so the result stood. In July 2005, FINA changed the rules to allow one dolphin kick at the start and at each turn, this change taking effect on 21 September 2005.|$|E
