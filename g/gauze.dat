5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or <b>gauze)</b> weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gauze</b> is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver <b>gauze</b> or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of finding more {{advanced}} platinum catalyst manufacturing technologies and achieving {{a higher degree of}} ammonia oxidation, metallographic characterization has been done on the surface of catalyst <b>gauzes</b> and catalyst gripper <b>gauzes</b> made from platinum and palladium alloys. For the examined samples of <b>gauzes</b> as well as the cross section of the wires, a chemical analysis was provided. The {{purpose of this paper is}} the metallographic characterization of examined alloys carried out by way of electronic microscopic scanning, X-rays as well as chemical assays which contributed greatly to a better understanding of the surface deactivation, in other words a better consideration of structural changes occurring on the wire surface...|$|R
5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire <b>gauze</b> making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal <b>gauze</b> and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of black}} blow fly maggots in maggot therapy is common. After the maggots have hatched, they are {{carefully}} monitored {{until they reach}} roughly 2 to 3mm in length; at this point they {{are ready for the}} next step. Within 24 to 36 hours of hatching, the maggots are tested for their sterility; if they pass the rigorous tests, then they may be used in maggot therapy. These maggots are placed onto a sterile piece of <b>gauze</b> which is laid over the wound of the patient. The maggots will proceed through the <b>gauze</b> to the open wound, where they will then begin their work. When they are full-grown, they leave the wound and enter the <b>gauze</b> for the purpose of pupating. They are then removed with the waste <b>gauze</b> and disposed of properly.|$|E

25|$|Redi {{took six}} jars and divided them {{into two groups}} of three: In one experiment, in the first jar of each group, he put an unknown object; in the second, a dead fish; in the last, a raw chunk of veal. Redi covered {{the tops of the}} first group of jars with fine <b>gauze</b> so that only air could get into it. He left the other group open. After several days, he saw maggots appear on the objects in the open jars, on which flies had been able to land, but not in the gauze-covered jars. In the second experiment, meat was kept in three jars. One of the jars was {{uncovered}}, and two of the jars were covered, one with cork and the other one with <b>gauze.</b> Flies could only enter the uncovered jar, and in this, maggots appeared. In the jar that was covered with <b>gauze,</b> maggots appeared on the <b>gauze</b> but did not survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} Craig's monodramatic {{interpretation}} {{lay in the}} staging of the first court scene (1.2). The stage was divided sharply into two areas {{through the use of}} lighting: the background was brightly lit, while the foreground was dark and shadowy. The screens were lined up along the back wall and bathed in diffuse yellow light. From a high throne upon which Claudius and Gertrude sat, which was bathed in a diagonal, bright golden beam, a pyramid descended, representing the feudal hierarchy. The pyramid gave the illusion of a single, unified golden mass, from which the courtier's heads appeared to stick out through slits in the material. In the foreground in dark shadow, Hamlet lay slouched, as if dreaming. A <b>gauze</b> was hung between Hamlet and the court, further emphasising the division. On Claudius' exit-line the figures remained in place while the <b>gauze</b> was loosened, so that the entire court appeared to melt away before the audience's eyes, {{as if they had been}} a projection of Hamlet's thoughts that now had turned elsewhere. The scene, and the <b>gauze</b> effect in particular, prompted an ovation from the audience, which was unheard of at the MAT.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the possibility of increasing performance of the PtRh alloys used in industrial processes of catalytic ammonia oxidation. Design/methodology/approach: In order to reach this objective, the extensive studies have been carried out, which were aimed at better understanding of the phenomena taking place on a surface and inside the wires of catalytic <b>gauzes</b> during the process. The electron microscopy methods (SEM, TEM, HRTEM), optical microscopy and microanalysis were used to examine the alloys under investigation. Findings: It was found that the performance and lifetime of the catalytic <b>gauzes</b> is closely related with structural stability of the alloys and with the stability of parameters of the ammonia oxidation process. Practical implications: The PtRh 10 -based alloys modified with boron and yttrium have been developed, which are characterised by more stable structure than the classical PtRh 10 alloy and enable significant reduction of the grain growth effect during the use of the <b>gauzes.</b> This should contribute to the improvement of the process efficiency and selectivity, and increase the lifetime of the catalytic <b>gauzes.</b> Originality/value: The developed alloys are new and original...|$|R
40|$|Prevention and {{management}} of wound infections receive a lot of attention, since the presence of micro-organisms interferes with the wound-healing process. The aim of this work was to use cyclodextrins (CDs) to endow hydrogels and <b>gauzes</b> {{with the ability to}} take up antiseptics and sustain their delivery for several hours. Benzalkonium chloride (BzCl) can form inclusion complexes with cross-linked CDs that regulate the release through an affinity-driven mechanism. Grafting of CDs to cotton <b>gauzes</b> using citric acid as the linker, at 190 degrees C and for 15 min, led to grafting yields of about 148 %, much larger than those obtained at 180 degrees C or with shorter reaction times. Microbiological tests revealed that the BzCl-loaded networks can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli both on agar plates and in liquid medium. Furthermore, the antiseptic-loaded <b>gauzes</b> were able to inhibit biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus RN 1 HG pMV 158 GFP when applied in early stages of biofilm formation and could reduce the number of living cells in preformed biofilms grown in a chronic wound biofilm model. These findings highlight the role of CDs as main components of hydrogels and <b>gauzes</b> for the efficient delivery of antiseptics...|$|R
25|$|Originally, the <b>gauze</b> was heated with a Bunsen burner; later, a wire grid was heated electrically. The heat {{transferred}} to {{the air in the}} tube sets it into near half-wave resonance if the <b>gauze</b> is placed below the midpoint of the tube as shown in the figure on the right. There is no theoretically optimum position, as the wave speed upward is c0+u, the convection speed, while the wave speed downward is c0−u. Without a convection flow, the midpoint and the lower tube end are the best locations for heat transfer. With convection, a compromise position halfway between the two points is normally chosen which depends on the amount of heat added. One characteristic length associated with frequency is tube length L.|$|E
25|$|The {{combustion}} {{of ammonia}} in air {{is very difficult}} {{in the absence of}} a catalyst (such as platinum <b>gauze</b> or warm chromium(III) oxide), because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia–air mixture.

40|$|From ancientness, {{suitable}} {{materials have}} been developed to cover the wounds in order to prevent infections and promote proper wound healing. In this study, the successful development of functionalized nonwoven <b>gauzes</b> with liposomes entrapping anti-inflammatory piroxicam is reported. Piroxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can suppress a persistent inflammatory response, leading to improved wound healing. The results demonstrated that the highest NSAID concentration released is achieved when <b>gauzes</b> were previously cationized with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and high concentration of phospholipid (≈ 3000 μM) and multilamellar liposomes (MLVs) were used. MLVs were also the best vehicle considering their biocompatibility with skin human fibroblasts, where no toxicity was observed for neither of the tested conditions. The developed functionalized <b>gauzes</b> can be, therefore, a good strategy to treat chronic wounds.
