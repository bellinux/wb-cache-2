Abstract The EU counter-terrorism policy {{is an example}} of <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> with horizontal and vertical differentiation that can be analyzed with <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> theory.

The theory suggests that high and asymmetric politicization, asymmetrical interdependence, low preference convergence and weak supranational actors lead to <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> in this field. The analysis can only partly confirm this theory. Politicization is influential but the causal mechanism needs to be specified.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{configurations}} of supply chain integration. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use qualitative data from manufacturers shortlisted for the UK’s Manufacturing Excellence awards over three years. Detailed processes and policies of 68 manufacturers are analysed. Findings – Process structure and product newness require different supply chain configurations, which change as products mature. Supply chain integration is dynamic, and the extent of collaboration between suppliers and customers will be different at different moments in time. The authors define and discuss four key supply chain configurations: customised; ramp-up; recurring; coordinated. Research limitations/implications – Future studies on supply chain integration should be controlled for the variation in the configurations. A limitation is the use of data which were derived for an award. The paper explains how the authors have mitigated the associated risks. Practical implications – The configuration of integration will change as the manufacturing plant becomes more familiar with a product. Additionally, different suppliers may provide better support at different stages of a product’s lifecycle. To yield better performance, supply chain integration would need to take different forms. Efforts to integrate with suppliers should not be avoided as, when certain conditions are met, integration can lead to improved performance. Originality/value – The authors have identified manufacturers’ main process structures and products’ newness as two strategic characteristics that <b>differentiate</b> <b>integration</b> approaches with customers and suppliers, and defined four integration configurations. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to argue that these also define the configuration of supply chain integration...|$|R

By contrast, it is astonishing how poor our research and knowledge about the phenomenon iso Whereas there is an abundance of conceptual work and some normative analysis, positive theories on the causes or effects of <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> are rare. Empirical analysis has concentrated on a few important cases of treaty law (such as EMU and Schengen) {{while there is no}} systematic knowledge about <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> in secondary law.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> can be {{understood}} more thoroughly by using a multi-level approach that conceives of the nation state as an aggregate of partly autonomous subunits and actors.

By examining the case of the European Research Area, we document patterns of <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> across governance levels and discuss how the following factors shape these patterns: the competitive nature of the European distributive instruments, stark variation in national and sub-national material conditions and in the governance of national research systems, as well as the normative and cognitive factors specific to the research policy sector.

40|$|Few {{attempts}} have been made to develop a systematic normative analysis of where <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> may need justification, and by what standards. This contribution argues that <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration</b> should be evaluated by a standard of how far it improves the management of externalities. That standard allows for disagreement at the European level on what values best justify choices between differential and uniform integration. Yet it is none the less a standard that member states may need to follow if they are to meet their obligations to their own publics to secure values of democracy, freedom and justice. Whether, in addition to obligations to their own publics, member states owe one another any obligations that constrain choices of <b>differentiated</b> <b>integration,</b> can then be answered by investigating how far they accord one another rights in the course of managing externalities between themselves. The example of banking union illustrates the argument. This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis...|$|E

A previous comparative genomic analysis revealed that the vinyl chloride reductase operon, vcrABC, ofDehalococcoides sp. strain VS is embedded in a horizontally-acquired genomic island that integrated at the single-copy tmRNA gene, ssrA. Results: We targeted conserved positions in available genomic islands to amplify and sequence four additional vcrABC-containing genomic islands from previously-unsequenced vinyl chloride respiring Dehalococcoides enrichments. We identified a total of 31 ssrA-specific genomic islands from Dehalococcoides genomic data, accounting for 47 reductive dehalogenase homologous genes and many other non-core genes. Sixteen of these genomic islands contain a syntenic module of integration-associated genes located adjacent to the predicted site of integration, and among these islands, eight contain vcrABC as genetic ‘cargo’.
