50|$|A {{major source}} of food for many marine animals, {{lanternfish}} are an important link in the food chain of many local ecosystems, being heavily preyed upon by whales and dolphins, large pelagic fish such as salmon, tuna and sharks, grenadiers and other deep-sea fish (including other lanternfish), pinnipeds, sea birds, notably penguins, and large squid such as the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas. Lanternfish themselves {{have been found to}} feed on bits of plastic debris accumulating in the oceans. At least one lantern fish was found with over 80 pieces of plastic chips in its gut, according to scientists monitoring ocean plastic in the Pacific Ocean's <b>eastern</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Pacific, {{there are}} two mass buildups: the western garbage patch and the <b>eastern</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch,</b> the former {{off the coast of}} Japan and the latter between Hawaii and California. The two garbage patches are both part of the great Pacific garbage patch, and are {{connected}} through a section of plastic debris off the northern coast of the Hawaiian islands. It is approximated that these garbage patches contain 100 million tons of debris. The waste is not compact, and although most of it is near the surface of the pacific, it can be found up to more than 100 feet deep in the water.|$|E
40|$|Garbage {{landfills}} are {{not generally}} construed as aesthetically pleasing. Even though the user-landfill relationship is typically mediated in Western societies (through complex institutional arrangements), landfills can still elicit vivid imagery and olfactory sensations with acknowledgement of a user relationship. What of plastics in the ocean, or more precisely, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre <b>Eastern</b> <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> (Garbage Patch) ? This particular trash problem precludes direct sensory experience {{and understanding of}} the link between the ‘user’ (that inadvertently or intentionally introduces plastics in waterways) and plastics in the Garbage Patch. I argue this renders investigation of Garbage Patch knowledge flows on the internet especially pertinent. In this way, the internet can be understood as a social environment for competing knowledge claim flows. From a social constructionist perspective and using empirical data gathered from domain name registration, search engine rankings and the IssueCrawler tool I investigate Garbage Patch knowledge politics on the internet. With this exploratory study I hope to contribute to (1) dialogue on how competing stakeholders produce and reproduce their e-presence and e-networks in an attempt to dominate Garbage Patch e-flows, and (2) gain insights on how the respective e-social networks mirror 'material world’ social networks and issue dynamics.

5000|$|Like {{the other}} gyres, it {{contains}} a <b>garbage</b> <b>patch.</b> A <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> is a suspended region of marine debris within the water column that circulate the gyre constantly. The Indian Ocean’s <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> covers a massive area: at least five million square kilometers (two million square miles). [...] As <b>garbage</b> <b>patches</b> such as these circulate {{for long periods of}} time, they cause inorganic toxins to enter the food chain due to solar breakdown of plastics in the water. In the Indian Ocean gyre, the <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> has been more of a mystery. Having just been discovered in 2010, it is still under research. It is known, however, that like most <b>garbage</b> <b>patches,</b> it is very fluid, and changes with the seasons, making its location difficult to pinpoint. It seems to circulate with the Indian Ocean gyre, from the Australian side to the African side, down the African coast, and then back to Australia. According to the team who discovered the <b>garbage</b> <b>patch,</b> the full rotation of the gyre’s <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> takes about six years, until it reaches the center of the gyre, where it may remain indefinitely.|$|R

50|$|The Southern Pacific <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> {{is an area}} of {{elevated}} levels of marine debris and plastic particle pollution, most of which is concentrated within the ocean's pelagic zone. It is located within the South Pacific Gyre, which itself spans from waters east of Australia to the South American continent, as far north as the Equator, and south until reaching the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The degredation of plastics in the ocean also leads to a rise in the level of toxins in the area. This <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> is the most recently discovered having only been confirmed in mid-2017. The South Pacific <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> has been compared in nature to the Great Pacific <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch's</b> state in 2007, making the former ten years younger. The <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> is impossible to detect using satellites, or other visual means as most particles are smaller than a grain of rice.|$|R

The data collected combined with the data from their previous Mega Expedition, helped map the plastic pollution in Great Pacific <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> and results are expected to be published in 2017.|$|R

40|$|In global oceans, {{circulating}} current systems called gyres concentrate floating plastic waste into <b>garbage</b> <b>patches</b> far from land. This dissertation {{describes how the}} Great Pacific <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> accumulating between California and Japan comes to matter as an environmental problem and public concern {{at the turn of}} the 21 st century. It draws on participant observation, interviews, historical and textual analysis to "follow" plastic as it circulates - with water, images, people, knowledge and marine life - from the ocean, through laboratories and beyond. By tracing the intersecting trajectories of multiple materials, I take a problem often blamed on activist exaggeration or media misrepresentation and show how the <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> emerges with a diversity of collective practices. The production and sharing of knowledge not only shapes the <b>garbage</b> <b>patch,</b> but also the kinds of solutions and care that are possible in return. For some, the <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> becomes a solid 'trash island' twice the size of Texas in need of cleanup; for others, a whole new realm of inseparable associations between synthetics and life called the plastisphere. Plastic, however, continues to escape from these attempts to measure, know, cleanup and otherwise control it, challenging the cultural and political foundations of science and ecology. I argue that caring for the ocean requires responding to plastic in all its natural-cultural relationships, as it transforms humans and environments alik...|$|R

Moore encountered the Great Pacific <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> in 1997. Organizers hoped to [...] "creatively raise awareness about plastic debris and pollution in the ocean," [...] specifically the Great Pacific <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> trapped in the North Pacific Gyre, by sailing 2,600 miles across the Pacific Ocean on a 30 ft raft made from an old Cessna 310 aircraft fuselage and six pontoons filled with 15,000 old plastic bottles. Crewed by Dr. Marcus Eriksen of the Foundation and film-maker Joel Paschal, the raft set off from Long Beach, California on 1 June 2008, arriving in Honolulu, Hawaii on 28 August 2008.

50|$|It {{is thought}} that, like {{other areas of}} {{concentrated}} marine debris in the world's oceans, the Great Pacific <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> formed gradually {{as a result of}} ocean or marine pollution gathered by oceanic currents. The <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> occupies a large and relatively stationary region of the North Pacific Ocean bound by the North Pacific Gyre (a remote area commonly referred to as the horse latitudes). The gyre's rotational pattern draws in waste material from across the North Pacific Ocean, including coastal waters off North America and Japan. As material is captured in the currents, wind-driven surface currents gradually move floating debris toward the center, trapping it in the region.|$|R
