50|$|Founded in 1967, WAML was {{the first}} {{independent}} organization centered on map collections and the librarians who oversee them. Academic libraries have always been strongly represented in the membership, but members also hail from public libraries, private collections, and government and commercial entities, or have been simply aficionados of maps and cartographic information. While paper map collections were traditionally the focus of attention, the advent of geographic information systems (GIS) and other digital platforms <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> {{have led to a}} change in emphasis. Presentations at WAML's meetings range from cartographic history and innovative uses of historical maps and aerial photography to developments in digital cartography and issues of GIS use in a library setting. WAML has always had a practical bent, providing its members with networking opportunities and continuing education for their work in or with cartographic collections and geospatial data. As a result, it has attracted members from far beyond its principle region of the western United States and Canada.|$|E

40|$|In {{the global}} context, it is {{consensus}} that a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) covers the technologies, policies, standards, institutional arrangements {{and human resources}} needed to acquire, process, store, distribute and improve the use, availability and access to <b>geospatial</b> <b>data.</b> The standards should regulate all aspects relevant to SDI, with a key aspect is interoperability. Which allows for the rationalization of resources, allowing the sharing, reuse and exchange of data and services. In analyzing <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> in this viewpoint, it is natural to assume there are standards that determine the use of technical specifications {{for the production of}} standardized <b>geospatial</b> <b>data.</b> The preparation of Technical Specification <b>for</b> <b>Geospatial</b> Vector <b>Data</b> Acquisition (ET-ADGV), allocation of Brazilian Army Geographical Service (DSG), which is constituted as a standard approved by the Brazilian National Commission of Cartography (CONCAR) and of the SDI, aims to define the rules for the construction of the attribute "geometry" of each class of objects that, as well as the essential attributes of the perfect individual instances. The classes of objects and their attribute qualifiers are defined in Technical Specification <b>for</b> Vector Structuring <b>Geospatial</b> <b>Data</b> (ET-EDGV), which sets the standard structure of <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> vector of SDI.

30|$|The {{explosive}} growth of geospatial data has stimulated {{the development of}} many standards aimed at decreasing data heterogeneity and enhancing data use. Well-established design methods <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> standards typically involve the creation of two schemas for data structure, designated here as logical and physical, but {{this can lead to}} conceptual inconsistencies and modelling inefficiencies. In this paper we describe a design method that overcomes these issues by incorporating an additional schema – the conceptual schema – and demonstrate its application to the design of GroundWaterML 2 (GWML 2), a new international standard for groundwater data. Results include not only a new data standard, robustly constructed and tested, but also an enhanced method <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> standard design.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{geospatial}} {{catalogue service}} allows geospatial users to discover appropriate geospatial data {{and services in}} a Web-based distributed environment. Metadata <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> and services is organized structurally in catalogue services. Provenance <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> products, {{as a kind of}} metadata describing the derivation history of data products, can be managed in a same way as other kinds of metadata using metadata catalogue services, thus keeping consistency and interoperability with existing metadata catalogue services. Meanwhile, Semantic Web technologies have shown considerable promises for more effective connection, discovery, and integration of provenance information. This paper addresses how geospatial catalogue services can be enriched with semantic provenance. Semantic relationships defined in provenance ontologies are registered in an OGC standard-compliant CSW service by extending ebRIM elements. The work illustrates that such a semantically-enriched CSW can assist in the discovery of data, service, and knowledge level of geospatial provenance...|$|E
40|$|Geospatial data play a {{key role}} in a wide {{spectrum}} of critical data management applications, such as disaster and emergency management, environmental monitoring, land and city planning, and military operations, often requiring the coordination among diverse organizations, their data repositories, and users with different responsibilities.

In order to query a GML document we have designed a query language over GML/XML enriched with spatial operators.

In this paper, we propose an approach <b>for</b> integrating <b>Geospatial</b> <b>data</b> on the Web, stored in GML documents, using our Spatial Query language. This approach has been inspired by Web Portals technology <b>for</b> retrieving <b>Geospatial</b> information.

40|$|Cache {{replacement}} {{strategy is}} the core for a distributed high-speed caching system, and effects the cache hit rate and utilization of a limited cache space directly. Many reports show that there are temporal and spatial local changes in access patterns of geospatial data, and there are popular hot spots which change over time. Therefore, the key issue for cache replacement strategy <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> {{is to get a}} combination method which considers both temporal local changes and spatial local changes in access patterns, and balance the relationship between the changes. And the cache replacement strategy should fit the distribution and changes of hotspot. This paper proposes a cache replacement strategy based on access pattern which have access spatiotemporal localities. Firstly, the strategy builds a method to express the access frequency and the time interval <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> access based on a least-recently-used replacement (LRU) algorithm and its data structure; secondly, considering both the spatial correlation between geospatial data access and the caching location <b>for</b> <b>geospatial</b> <b>data,</b> it builds access sequences based on a LRU stack, which reflect the spatiotemporal locality changes in access pattern. Finally, for achieving the aim of balancing the temporal locality and spatial locality changes in access patterns, the strategy chooses the replacement objects based on the length of access sequences and the cost of caching resource consumption. Experimental results reveal that the proposed cache replacement strategy is able to improve the cache hit rate while achieving a good response performance and higher system throughput. Therefore, it can be applied to handle the intensity of networked GISs data access requests in a cloud-based environment...|$|E

The widespread access and sharing of <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> on the Internet yield many benefits.
