5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> {{room to maneuver}} in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics {{when he moved to}} Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Huynh of Game Music Online {{generally}} {{praised the}} soundtrack's quality, but {{felt there was}} too little variety. RPGFans Patrick Gann was generally positive, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of Nier. The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 Mendelssohn studied {{under the}} {{composer}} and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles, who confessed in his diaries that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> to teach him. Moscheles became a close colleague and lifelong friend. The year 1827 saw the premiere– and sole performance in his lifetime– of Mendelssohn's opera, Die Hochzeit des Camacho. The failure of this production left him disinclined {{to venture into}} the genre again.|$|E

He was rewarded with selection in the Under-19 Central Zone team for the zonal one-day tournament, taking five wickets at 25.00 in four matches. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success with the bat, scoring 47 on one occasion during the season, but otherwise only aggregating nine runs in six innings.|$|E
5|$|Lake {{initially}} sought Earp out {{hoping to}} write a magazine article about him. Earp was also seeking a biographer {{at about the same}} time. Earp, who was 80, was concerned that his vantage point on the Tombstone story may be lost, and may have been financially motivated, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> income in his last years of life.|$|E

5|$|Supervision of {{the mission}} was {{assigned}} to the German Ambassador to Turkey, Hans von Wangenheim, but as he was ill, his functions were delegated to Prince zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Following Wangenheim's death in 1915, Count von Wolff-Metternich was designated his successor. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> contact with the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> power. Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|After 1907, Cooke's {{dominance}} of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team was never the consistent winner {{that it was in}} the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923–1924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.|$|E
5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E

He played in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground when India fielded two spinners for {{the only time in}} the series. He was punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of1/211 from 45 overs, a run rate of 4.68, in a high-scoring draw.|$|E

5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet {{was convinced that the}} work was a failure; he {{died of a heart attack}} three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics {{which made him}} a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander {{had the ability to}} do so.|$|E
5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> choice but to present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E

And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59h, 53min, 30s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> regard for the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E
5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> military experience and protested {{he was not}} suited to the position.

Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.|$|E
