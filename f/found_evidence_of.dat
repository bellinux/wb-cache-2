5|$|The {{first known}} {{indigenous}} inhabitants of Key Biscayne were Tequestas. Shells, bones and artifacts {{found on the}} island indicate extensive use of it by the Tequesta. A large community appeared to inhabit the island between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew scoured much of the vegetation from {{the southern end of}} Key Biscayne. An archaeological survey of the exposed ground <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> extensive habitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{upon which}} the settlement of Uxbridge was established is largely unchanged from the Mesolithic era. Much of it was covered by oak and elm trees, which were gradually cleared by early settlers. An archaeological excavation by the Museum of London in the 1990s <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> flint items shaped by Mesolithic hunters, as well as various animal bones and traces of charcoal from the remains of campfires.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, comprising implements such as stone knives, flint blades {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves. Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew, long barrow at Chewton Mendip, and Fairy Toot tumulus at Nempnett Thrubwell. Maes Knoll fort, on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of the valley, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument that dates from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} between 1953 and 1955 by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield from the Ministry of Works <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> extensive human {{occupation of the}} area. Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years from the Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods (Old, Middle, and New Stone Age), to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind.

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 {{years from the}} very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
5|$|However, in a {{field study}} {{published}} in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has been followed by least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.|$|E

5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick Man) were found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recorded}} in Domesday that a priest was resident in Ashby, {{and that the}} church dedicated to St Helen consisted only of a nave. In about 1144, Philip Beaumais, lord of the Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the Augustinian community of Lilleshall Abbey, which retained possession until 1538. A 2013 excavation <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a two-storey vicarage dating from this period, but the building fell into disrepair following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the site was cleared in the English Civil War of 1642–49.|$|E

5|$|Lie is {{considered}} influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, {{he is best}} remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari was adapted for the stage and screen. However, {{as a result of}} the language politics in the Indies and independent Indonesia, his work has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of existing works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. Other critics, however, have <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> innovation in his writing style and handling of plots.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{from this}} era {{used to cover}} most of the site, and it is {{believed}} the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries.

40|$|According to the {{literature}} on foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers, when a transnational company (TNC) subsidiary is installed in a hots country, {{it comes with a}} package of new technologies that can be transferred to domestic companies, helping them to improve their productivity and competitiveness. In this sense, FDI is a powerful source of technology to developing countries, justifying every sort of incentive to attract foreign investments. In this paper we use firm level data and econometric techniques to assess the existence of productivity spillovers in the Brazilian industry in the 1997 - 2000 period. In the horizontal spillovers' model we <b>found</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> technology transfer from TNCs to domestic firms, although not for all firms. Actually we show that when national companies were more exposed to the TNCs competition, negative spillovers occurred. In the vertical spillovers' model we <b>found</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> positive productivity spillovers taking place through backward linkages. ...|$|R
