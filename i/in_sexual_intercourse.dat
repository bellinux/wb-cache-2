5|$|In his Fabulae, written around 1 A.D. Hyginus {{states that}} King Cinyras of Assyria had a {{daughter}} by his wife, Cenchreis. The daughter was named Smyrna and the mother boasted that her child excelled even Venus in beauty. Angered, Venus punished the mother by cursing Smyrna {{to fall in love}} with her father. After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide, she helped her engage her father <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> When Smyrna became pregnant, she hid in the woods from shame. Venus pitied the girl's fate, changing her into a myrrh tree, from which was born Adonis.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{transmitted}} in early 1999, when Parliament were discussing LGBT equality; the series première aired {{on the day}} the House of Lords was discussing the Sexual Offences Bill 1999, which eventually reduced the age of consent for homosexual couples to 16. The première was controversial, in particular because it depicted the character Nathan, aged 15, <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with an older man; the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 136 complaints and the series received criticism from Hunnam's parents and from activist Mary Whitehouse. The controversy was amplified when the sponsor Beck's withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained that the series was not representative of gay culture. Nevertheless, the show garnered 3.5million viewers per episode and a generally positive reaction from fans, and was renewed for a two-episode special due for the following year.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the series, Zima and Dita, persocom {{agents for}} the Japanese {{government}} who know the outcome of Chi's special program, arrive at Hideki's apartment. A minor scuffle ensues between Dita and Chi, before Zima restrains Dita, wishing to see the outcome of Hideki's decision and ultimately too falling under Chi's influence. Hideki confirms his love for Chi, only to find that Freya has taken control of her body. Learning that he that he can never engage <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with Chi without rebooting her systems, erasing everything that makes her a unique individual, Hideki states that he will love Chi regardless. Freya confirms that while Chi and herself are indeed the legendary Chobits, they possess neither sentience nor emotions, but rely on software programs just like every persocom. Again, Hideki stands by his love for Chi. Hideki declines her offer to tell him about Chi's special ability, and Freya vanishes after imploring him {{to take care of her}} sister. Chi awakens, embracing Hideki. The series ends with Chi holding Hideki's hand with visible rings Chi had chosen for the two of them.|$|E

30|$|Consistent use of {{a condom}} <b>in</b> vaginal <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> (<b>in</b> the {{previous}} 2  months) was calculated. To do this, first, the proportion of condom use <b>in</b> vaginal <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> <b>in</b> the previous 2  months was calculated, dividing the number of vaginal sexual relations using a condom {{by the total number}} of vaginal sexual relations. Then, the variable proportion of condom use <b>in</b> vaginal <b>sexual</b> relations over the previous 2  months was dichotomized, so that values equal to 1 indicated consistent use of condoms and values below 1 indicated inconsistent use of condoms. The same approach was used to calculate consistency of condom use <b>in</b> anal <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> (<b>in</b> the previous 2  months). To establish resilience levels (high, medium, and low), the 25 th (low level) and 75 th (high level) percentiles were considered. Scores between 25 th and 75 th percentiles were considered as medium level. We decided not to stratify the sample according to sexual orientation since it was a convenience and intentional sample, so the sample was not large enough for such analysis.|$|R

25|$|Several {{widely publicized}} cases of female-on-male {{statutory}} rape in the United States involved school teachers engaging <b>in</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with their underage students.

25|$|In {{statutory}} rape, overt {{force or}} threat {{need not be}} present.
