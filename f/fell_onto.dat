5|$|In Dominica, {{a mother}} and her seven-year-old son died when one of a dozen {{landslide}} caused by the heavy rains <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> their house. Landslides also blocked several roads in the mountainous country. In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> her poop deck, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E
5|$|August 27, 1998– Hurricane Bonnie moves ashore near Wilmington as {{a strong}} Category 2 {{hurricane}} with a moderate storm surge and heavy rainfall from its slow movement across the state. A girl in Currituck County was killed when a large tree <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> her home. The winds and rainfall cause heavy crop damage, and monetary damage in the state is estimated at about $480million (1998USD, $610million 2007USD).|$|E
50|$|Missile 107 (3 October) <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> LC-17A and {{exploded}} at launch {{due to the}} gas generator valve failing to open.|$|R
25|$|In 1989, {{two boys}} {{intentionally}} {{jumped out of}} this log flume ride. One died and the other <b>fell</b> safely <b>onto</b> an emergency platform.|$|R
50|$|A {{prolonged}} peace {{followed for}} Britain, until {{the beginning of}} the Crimean War in 1854. After the Train's disbandment, logistical support <b>fell</b> solely <b>onto</b> the Commissariat's shoulders.|$|R
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> the DRR's Holiday Red {{freight train}} while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries occurred {{as a result of this}} accident.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza would take care of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> another warrior and killed him, and this corpse <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom {{in the minds of the}} Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
5000|$|On February 28, 1973, Aeroflot Flight X-167, a Yak-40 (CCCP-87602), <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> {{the runway}} at Semipalatinsk Airport during takeoff due to crew error, killing all 32 on board.|$|R
50|$|On 22 December 1970, {{a launch}} of a target vehicle for ASAT tests lost thrust at liftoff and <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> the pad at Plesetsk, {{exploding}} and badly damaging it.|$|R
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} on June 8, Frémont's men {{encountered}} the Confederate advanced guard near Cross Keys Tavern. A few shots were fired and the Union cavalry <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> their main body, which was approaching. Darkness prevented further developments.|$|R
5|$|Carol {{maintained}} its intensity {{as it moved}} inland, and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15inches (63mm) in 12hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15million in damage in the state.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{across the}} state {{included}} a report of 47mph (76km/h) near the state's southeastern coastline. The winds downed some trees and resulted in power outages, and one person in Carrolwood was injured after a tree <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> a house. The storm spawned several tornadoes in the southern portion of the state, some of which damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds left about 2,000people without power after it knocked down a power line. Another tornado near Miami damaged a few homes and trees.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
50|$|LC-36A was {{the scene}} of the biggest on-pad {{explosion}} in Cape history when Atlas-Centaur AC-5 <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> the pad on March 2, 1965. The accident spurred NASA to complete work on LC-36B which had been abandoned when it was 90% finished.|$|R
50|$|One on-pad {{explosion}} occurred, {{the launch}} of Missile 51D in March 1960, which suffered combustion instability within seconds of launch. The Atlas <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> LC-13 in a huge fireball, putting the pad out of commission for the entire {{spring and summer of}} 1960.|$|R
30|$|When {{the upper}} magnet was applied, the microdroplets were magnetized, fly upward {{and stick to}} the PS surface due to its strong hysteresis. On the other hand, when the {{magnetic}} force was reversed, the microdroplet <b>fell</b> down <b>onto</b> the initial surface. The principal key point of this application is that the reversible transport is made without any lost of liquid.|$|R
5|$|When Robert Baker arrived he {{continued}} a photoelectric photometry program focusing on variable stars. He {{continued to use}} the 12-inch refractor until 1927 when a new photometer was constructed and attached it to the 30-inch reflector telescope in the Observatory annex. He supervised two graduate students who worked on this equipment in the early 1930s. On May 27, 1933 the star Arcturus provided light which <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> a photo cell in the observatory's annex and sent a signal to open the Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, 1968, 4 {{minutes into}} {{a game against the}} Minnesota North Stars at the Met Center, Bill Masterton was checked by Larry Cahan and Ron Harris, and <b>fell</b> {{backwards}} <b>onto</b> the ice. The force of {{the back of his head}} hitting the ice caused significant internal bleeding. Masterton lost consciousness and never regained it: he died two days later.|$|R
50|$|The program, {{originally}} {{slated to}} debut in 1981 {{with the new}} title and storyline, was delayed when Peter Barton <b>fell</b> backward <b>onto</b> pyrotechnics and was badly burned, while co-star Louis Gossett Jr., tied to a chair, had fallen on top of Barton but managed to rescue him. After months in the hospital, Barton was released, and the show resumed shooting.|$|R
5000|$|In the boardroom, Sir Alan {{effectively}} {{called out}} Ben on his constant boasts about achieving {{a scholarship to}} Sandhurst, something he repeatedly <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> during previous boardrooms, by stating it had little bearing with him after citing that Paul Callaghan, a former candidate from Series 3, had been infamous for poor management despite the fact he had attended Sandhurst himself.|$|R
5|$|In Nuevo León, fifteen {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have died: one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed {{on top of}} him; two men {{and a woman who}} died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi-trailer truck due to the intense rainfall; a 25-year-old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence; an elderly man who died after a wall toppled over him, a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home, and a young man who <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> the Arroyo Topo Chico. Eight more bodies were found after floodwaters began receding, although one {{is believed to have been}} washed away from a cemetery. Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E
500|$|The storm brought {{strong winds}} to Cuba, with a wind gust of [...] in Havana. The city {{suffered}} considerable damage, forcing police to patrol for looters. Nearly {{all of the}} city was left without electricity. In some portions of the neighborhood of Miramar, flooding was reported. Trees were <b>felled</b> <b>onto</b> Paseo del Prado, a famous street in Havana. In other parts of the city, falling trees and rubble also disrupted transportation. There were heavy crop losses in Havana and Pinar Del Rio provinces, where several rivers overflowed their banks. Homes and cattle were swept away by flash flooding. Overall, the hurricane left eleven fatalities, three of them due to houses collapsing on their occupants. Additionally, there were about 300injuries and an estimated $6million in damage. After the storm, Cuban President Ramón Grau, President-elect Carlos Prío Socarrás, and Major General Genovevo Pérez Dámera [...] Chief of Staff of the Army [...] assessed damage in the Havana area and developed plans for recovery.|$|R
500|$|In November 2008, {{shortly after}} the Olympic {{trampoline}} trials, 15-year-old Mortimer missed the sponge pit after bouncing on a mini-trampoline and <b>fell</b> [...] <b>onto</b> a concrete pad; her parents, spectators at the competition, saw the accident. The bones in her feet were shattered, and doctors suggested {{that she would never}} stand again. Amputation was a possibility, although Mortimer was only informed of it in 2011.|$|R
40|$|In this post, Latefa Guemar argues that, {{following}} the Arab spring the Algerian regime <b>fell</b> back <b>onto</b> “populism” by once again using women {{to negotiate and}} maintain power, and as was believed at the time, stability. In fact, no-one, except for the women, has engaged with serious measures of social transformation that might reshape both the “democratic” and the “popular” which mark the Algerian Republic...|$|R
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
5|$|The gusty winds {{from the}} passage of the {{hurricane}} resulted in widespread and extensive tree damage. Due to previous rainfall, moist grounds easily allowed for trees to be uprooted. Wind damage to structures was minor, however, with one house in Carroll County being damaged when a tree fell on it. Trees <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> cars, roads, homes, and power lines, leaving 358,000 without power after the storm. 600traffic signals were without power in Montgomery County, and about 70roads were closed due to fallen trees. Isabel destroyed 94buildings and damaged 87, including 33homes, six of which were severely impacted with one losing a portion of its roof. Fallen trees injured two in Frederick County. In western Maryland, damage totaled $2.07million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} {{platform}} screen doors {{to be installed}} at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they <b>fell</b> <b>onto</b> the railway tracks at above-ground stations. Underground stations already featured platform screen doors since 1987. The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs, but made an about-turn when the government announced plans to install half-height platform screen doors on the above-ground stations in January 2008, citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide. They were first installed at Jurong East, Pasir Ris and Yishun stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility.|$|E
5000|$|The famous Oldenburg {{meteorite}} ('Bissel' fragment, 4.84 kg) is {{also kept}} in the museum's collection. The meteorite <b>fell</b> in 1930 <b>onto</b> the villages of Bissel (parish of Großenkneten) and Beverbruch (parish of Garrel).|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the origin}} of the Blutfahne (blood-flag), which became stained with the blood of two SA members who were shot: the flagbearer Heinrich Trambauer, who was badly wounded, and Andreas Bauriedl, who <b>fell</b> dead <b>onto</b> the fallen flag. [...] A bullet killed Scheubner-Richter. [...] Göring was shot in the leg, but escaped. The rest of the Nazis {{scattered}} or were arrested. Hitler was arrested two days later.|$|R
