(It was proving difficult to find the number of draught horses required.) The War office ordered over 1,000 Holts caterpillar tractors, which transformed the mobility of the siege artillery. The army also mounted a variety of surplus naval guns on various railway platforms to provide mobile long-range heavy artillery on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Yoseph Yapi Taum, a {{lecturer}} at Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta, views Tini's aloof {{nature as a}} major force driving Tono to Yah; her lifestyle, of which Tono is not a part, alienates him and drives him to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> traditional woman. Tham Seong Chee, a political scientist from Singapore, views her as a weak-willed character, unwilling to act before meeting Hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with Tono. He also sees her as being fettered by her own values, which are incompatible with those held by the general Indonesian populace. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Goenawan Mohamad views her as driven {{in part by the}} stress placed on her by her husband's expectations.|$|E

50|$|In prehistoric South-West Asia, {{alternatives}} to chiefdoms were the non-hierarchical systems of complex acephalous communities, with a pronounced autonomy of single-family households.

40|$|This {{paper is}} on {{compulsion}} in active labour market programs (ALMP). When {{an unemployed worker}} has {{to participate in a}} programme order to remain eligible for benefits there are two separate effects. First, there is the treatment effect, i. e. the program makes the worker <b>more</b> attractive for <b>a</b> potential employer or makes search more efficient thus helping the unemployed worker to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> job <b>more</b> quickly. Second, there is the compulsion effect, i. e. because the worker has to attend the program his value of being unemployed drops and he is stimulated to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> job <b>more</b> quickly. So, both effects induce the worker to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> job <b>more</b> quickly. The difference between the treatment effect and the compulsion effect concerns the quality of the postunemployment job. The treatment effect improves the quality; the compulsion effect lowers the quality of postunemployment jobs. ...|$|R
25|$|Still in 1914, {{a revolt}} by the Mbunda people against the Portuguese Colonialists caused {{large numbers of}} the local people to flee {{across the border into}} Barotseland, now Zambia.

Jakeman and Andrew McGill relieved Mr. Bailey and established a number of outposts among the Mbunda and Luchazi people. In the ensuing years, four more stations were established: Cunjamba, N'inda, Casuango and Catota all in the fallen Mbundaland.|$|E
25|$|If an {{extrasolar planet}} is detected, a minimum mass {{for the planet}} can be {{determined}} from {{the changes in the}} star's radial velocity. To <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> precise measure of the mass requires knowledge of the inclination of the planet's orbit. A graph of measured radial velocity versus time will give a characteristic curve (sine curve {{in the case of a}} circular orbit), and the amplitude of the curve will allow the minimum mass of the planet to be calculated using the binary mass function.|$|E

Suffren arrived off the Indian coast in February 1782, where he clashed with a British fleet under Hughes, winning a narrow tactical victory. After landing troops at Porto Novo to assist Mysore, Suffren's fleet clashed with Hughes again Providien on 12 April. There was no clear victor, though Hughes' fleet came off worse, and he withdrew to the British-held port of Trincomalee. Hyder Ali wished for the French to capture Negapatam to establish naval dominance over the British, and this task fell to Suffren. Suffren's fleet clashed with Hughes again off Negapatam on 6 July. Suffren withdrew to Cuddalore, strategically defeated, and the British remained {{in control of}} Negapatam.

25|$|In Overwatchs Asia servers, {{there were}} {{problems}} with numerous players using hacks tied to {{the growing number of}} younger players using PC bangs in South Korea that allow them to play Overwatch on an inexpensive hourly rate rather than purchasing the game.
