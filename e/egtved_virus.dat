40|$|Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), a {{systemic}} infection of various salmonid {{and a few}} nonsalmonid fishes, {{is caused by a}} rhabdovirus designated as the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (Office International des Epizooties 1963). The virus infection occurs in salmonids and certain other fishes of any age and may result in significant cumulative mortality. Fish that survive may become carriers. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia has been reported under various names, of which 2 ̆ 2 Egtved disease 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Infektiose Nierenschwellung und Leberdegeneration 2 ̆ 2 are the best known. The viral etiology of the disease was established by Jensen (1965), and several serotypes of the virus (also known as 2 ̆ 2 <b>Egtved</b> <b>virus</b> 2 ̆ 2) are currently recognized. Comprehensive reviews of the disease and the virus have been published by de Kinkelin (1983), McAllister (1979), Pilcher and Fryer (1980), Roberts (1978), and Wolf (1988) ...|$|E
40|$|Purified {{infectious}} hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) {{virus and}} the virus of haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) (<b>Egtved</b> <b>virus)</b> each contain five structural proteins which were designated L, G, N, M- 1, and M- 2. The IHN viral polypeptides have molecular weights {{estimated to be}} 157, 000, 72, 000, 40, 000, 25, 000 and 20, 000, respectively, whereas those of VHS viral polypeptides {{are estimated to be}} 157, 000 74, 000, 41, 000, 21, 500, and 19, 000, respectively. The carbohydrate composition of the glycoprotein (G) was confirmed by demonstrating selective incorporation of [3 H]glucosamine into the designated G protein of both viruses. Phosphoproteins were identified by incorporation of [32 P]orthophosphate into the N and M- 1 proteins of IHN virus and into the N protein of VHS virus. The glycoprotein of each virus was selectively solubilized by treatment with Triton X- 100 in low salt buffer, whereas the M- 1, and M- 2 proteins along with the G protein were solubilized by Ttition X- 100 in 0. 43 M NaCl. The protein composition of the salmonid rhabdoviruses resembles that of the rabies virus group more closely than the vesicular stomatitis virus group...|$|E
40|$|A {{universal}} {{procedure was}} sought for plaque assay of eight fish viruses (bluegill myxovirus, channel catfish virus, eel virus, <b>Egtved</b> <b>virus,</b> infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, {{infectious pancreatic necrosis}} virus, lymphocystis virus, and the agent of spring viremia of carp (Rhabdovirus carpio), in dish cultures of various fish cells. Eagle minimal essential medium with sodium bicarbonate-CO 2 buffer (Earle’s salt solution) was compared with minimal essential medium buffered principally with tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane or N- 2 -hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′- 2 ′-ethanesulfonic acid at a pH or {{in the range of}} 7. 6 to 8. 0 depending upon temperature. Five fish cell lines collectively capable of replicating all fish viruses thus far isolated were tested and quantitatively found to grow comparably well in the three media. Two-phase (gel-liquid) media incorporating the various buffer systems allowed plaquing at 15 to 33 C either in partial pressures of CO 2 or in normal atmosphere, but greater efficiency and sensitivity were obtained with the organic buffers, and, overall, the best results were obtained with tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane. Epizootiological data, specific fish cell line response, and plaque morphology permit presumptive identification of most of the agents. At proper pH, use of organic buffers obviates the need for CO 2 incubators...|$|E
40|$|The {{replication}} of three rhabdoviruses associated with diseases of fish {{has been demonstrated}} in cells of continuously cultivated non-piscine cell lines. Spring viremia of carp (SVC) virus and the salmonid fish <b>viruses,</b> <b>Egtved</b> and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, all replicated in mammalian WI- 38 (human diploid cell strain) and BHK/ 21 cells and in cells {{of one or more}} reptilian cell lines at the temperatures commonly used to propagate these viruses in fish cells. The infections were cytopathic: SVC virus plaque assays may be performed in several types of mammalian cell culture. “Autointerference” apparently mediated by abortive “T” particle formation was observed during serial nondiluted passages of SVC virus in BHK/ 21 and TH 1 cells, but not in RTG- 2 or WI- 38 cells. Optimal temperatures for {{replication of}} SVC and <b>Egtved</b> <b>viruses</b> in BHK/ 21 cells were identical to those determined in poikilothermic vertebrate cell cultures. However, these viruses replicated relatively more efficiently at suboptimal temperatures in “cold-blooded” vertebrate cells than in the hamster cells. Studies of [3 H]uridine incorporation into uninfected BHK/ 21 cells incubated at different temperatures revealed that [3 H]uridine uptake is sharply reduced at temperatures below 24. 5 C. Growth curve studies of SVC virus in BHK/ 21 cells incubated at 23 C revealed that a clear-cut large excess of virus-induced [3 H]uridine incorporation could be demonstrated in the absence of actinomycin D. Actinomycin D treatment (1 μg/ml) led to efficient inhibition of control cell [3 H]uridine uptake, but also markedly reduced the total counts per minute of virus-induced [3 H]uridine uptake, without depressing the yield of released infectious virus. Actinomycin D added to SVC virus-infected BHK/ 21 cell cultures at concentrations as low as 0. 01 μg/ml caused a significant decrease in the level of virus-induced [3 H]uridine uptake, despite the fact that this concentration is insufficient to efficiently suppress “background” cellular [3 H]uridine incorporation...|$|R
