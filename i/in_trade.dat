That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut. Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because its cover (a reuse of the first issue's cover) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value <b>in</b> <b>trade.</b> Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew <b>in</b> <b>trade</b> due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{established}} a foreign trade department for the railroad, hoping {{to take advantage}} of the railway's ability to connect to the Mississippi Valley and Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. In 1915, when the railway lost 12percent of its revenue owing to disruptions <b>in</b> <b>trade</b> caused by the start of World War I, Harrison was concerned about longer-term changes underway. In the annual report that year he warned stockholders that automobile ownership could severely impact railroad passenger revenues. His words proved to be prophetic, as automobiles eventually resulted in the disappearance of most passenger train traffic.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, we explore empirically to what extent the {{determinants}} of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services differ from those of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods. Second, by the use of instrumental variables, we explore potential complementarities between bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods and bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services. Using a gravity framework, the main results show that bilateral trust and contract enforcement environment, networks, labour market regulations and variables denoting technology of communication have a higher impact on services trade than on goods trade. Finally, after using instrumental variables, we find that bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods explains bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services the resulting estimated elasticity is close to 1. Reciprocally, bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services also affects bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods, though to a lesser extent we find an estimated (positive) elasticity of 0. 46. international <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services, <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods, gravity equations...|$|R

5|$|In 1481 {{two local}} men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships {{looking for the}} mythical island of Hy-Brasil.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge <b>in</b> <b>trade</b> brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, who {{suffered}} from the disruption <b>in</b> <b>trade.</b> Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic.

40|$|My thesis {{examines}} the saliency and power that the personal attributes {{an individual is}} born with (nature variables) and life experiences (nurture variables) have on an individual's risk taking <b>in</b> <b>trading.</b> My research is motivated by studies in the psychology, economics and finance literature that posit these variables {{have an impact on}} an individual’s risk taking, albeit not specifically related to trading. My results show that both nature and nurture variables are significant predictors of risk taking <b>in</b> <b>trading</b> and imply it is possible to profile an individual’s risk taking propensity <b>in</b> <b>trading</b> by capturing these factors.
