5|$|Unit 64.07 was retired on 20 December 1982 after rust damage {{had been}} found on it. By 1984, the {{carriages}} were in such bad shape {{that they needed to}} be replaced. Trailers <b>from</b> <b>Class</b> 65 and Class 67 were taken into use, and for a short period a Class 91 trailer. On 28 August 1985, passenger traffic on the line was terminated and the two remaining trains were retired. Reasons for the termination included a lack of sufficient political support for financing new trains, and also that Class 64 was no longer suitable for use. The last two trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are stored at Garnes Station, part of the Old Voss Line.|$|E
