The consequences of <b>hypocuprosis</b> include a failure of copper metalloenzymes, many of which form part of the antioxidant defence system. This work focuses on the association between copper (Cu) plasma concentration and DNA damage in Aberdeen Angus cattle. Two-hundred and ninety-nine heparinized blood samples from 2 -year-old Aberdeen Angus cows were obtained from different farms located in the Salado River basin, Argentina. Plasma copper level analysis was carried out in whole samples, while cytogenetic analysis and single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) were carried out in 82 and 217 samples, respectively. Cytogenetic analysis showed {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of abnormal metaphases in moderate/severe hypocupremic group...|$|E
40|$|Molybdenum {{toxicity}} {{produces a}} state of secondary <b>hypocuprosis,</b> resulting into alterations in normal hematological profile. In the present study, ammonium molybdate alone and with copper sulfate (II) pentahydrate (ameliorative agent) was administered orally for 30 consecutive days in healthy goats of group 1 and 2, respectively, to access {{the effect on the}} hematological profile on different predetermined days of dosing. Administration of ammonium molybdate alone produced significant decline in the mean values of hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total leukocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), with a significant increase in neutrophil level and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). However, values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and differential leukocyte count were not significantly altered. On comparing observations of ameliorative group with the group 1 goats, it is concluded that the ameliorative copper salt has beneficial effects in alleviating the alterations in the values of Hb, PCV, TLC, TEC, MCV, MCHC, and neutrophils...|$|E

Following legal challenge, most Mo numerical standards were Aside from providing plant nutrients and enhancing soil withdrawn, pending additional field-generated data using modern bio- conditions, land application of biosolids can increase solids (Mo concentrations � 75 mg kg� 1) and a reassessment of this pathway. This paper presents a reevaluation of biosolids Mo data, refinement of the risk assessment algorithms, and a reassessment of Mo-induced <b>hypocuprosis</b> from land application of biosolids. Forage Mo uptake coefficients (UC) are derived from field studies, many of which used modern biosolids applied to numerous soil types, with varying soil pH values, and supporting various crops.

40|$|Abstract: Reproductive {{disorders}} and malnutrition {{are the main}} problems that determine productivity in buffaloes and cause great economic losses. This {{study was designed to}} correlate between copper status and ovarian activity in buffalo-cows. A total number of 1365 buffalo-cows reared at Lower Egypt was included in this study during the period from 2004 - 2008. Animals were clinically and gynecologically examined and blood samples were collected for carrying out some relevant analyses. Results revealed that 19. 12 % of the examined animals showed clear clinical signs of copper deficiency (<b>hypocuprosis)</b> and had a poor body condition score (BCS). Also, 21. 84 % of these hypocupremic buffalo-cows suffered from ovarian inactivity. In comparison with control cows, hypocupremic animals showed low serum progesterone level, especially during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle; anemia with no marked changes in leukogram; increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) and decreased, catalase (CAT), ascorbic acid (ASCA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH-R) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC); zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and ceruloplasmin. It could be concluded that copper deficiency causes oxidative stress to buffalo-cows resulting in cessation of Ovarian activity. Ceruloplasmin {{could be used as a}} good indicator for copper deficiency. It is recommended to supplement animal feeds with balanced mineral mixture to avoid retarded growth, anemia and cessation of ovarian activity...|$|E
