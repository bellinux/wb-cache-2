5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trading in {{financial}} markets based on a model with three types of traders: liquidity traders, market makers, and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> traders. Our four main findings are: i) The price impact of the liquidity trades is higher {{in the presence of}} the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader and is increasing with the size of the trade. In particular, we show that the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader reduces (increases) the prices that liquidity traders receive when selling (buying) their equity holdings. ii) Although market makers also lose revenue to the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader in every trade, they are compensated for these losses by a higher liquidity discount. iii) <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> trading increases the volatility of prices. iv) The volume of trades doubles as the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader intermediates all trades between the liquidity traders and market makers. This additional volume is a consequence of trades which are carefully tailored for surplus extraction and are neither driven by fundamentals nor is it noise trading.

5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E

40|$|AbstractSignal-averaged electrocardiograms (X, Y and Z leads) were {{acquired}} from 24 patients with {{coronary artery disease}} and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, 24 control patients with coronary artery disease and 23 normal subjects to assess the discriminant value of fast Fourier transformation of the entire late potential period of the QRS complex. Analysis of the vector magnitude in the temporal domain (25 to 250 Hz bandpass filters) measured <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration, the duration of terminal signals 25 Hz that were < 40 μV. Analysis in the frequency domain used a 120 ms window that encompassed (had onset with) all of the late potential, but the mean value was first subtracted to eliminate a direct current component. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (60 to 120 Hz) and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (100 × [60 to 120 Hz/ 0 to 120 Hz]) were calculated. Results in both temporal and frequency domains were similar in control patients with coronary artery disease and normal subjects. Patients with ventricular tachycardia had a longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex (p < 0. 0001) and longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> terminal signals < 40 μV (p < 0. 0004), but not significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms. The most useful temporal domain measurement was <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration (if ≥ 120 ms, odds ratio = 8. 2). Patients with ventricular tachycardia had increased <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (p < 0. 0002) in the late potential, and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> was especially increased (p = 0. 0000; if percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 %, odds ratio = 18. 4). The odds ratio and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were both greater for percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> than for <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration (p < 0. 03. All patients with ventricular tachycardia had a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex ≥ 107 ms or percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 % (sensitivity 100 %). For a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex ≥ 107 ms and percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 %, specificity was 96 %.
