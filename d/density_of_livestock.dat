50|$|Livestock grazing {{comparison}} {{is a method}} of comparing the numbers and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> grazing in agriculture. Various units of measurement are used, usually based on the grazing equivalent of one adult cow, or in some areas on that of one sheep. Many different schemes exist, giving various values to the grazing effect {{of different types of}} animal.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{farms in}} {{developed}} countries are highly mechanized. In the United States, livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great {{decrease in the number}} of agricultural workers needed. In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> because of climatic conditions. In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.|$|E
50|$|The {{boards and}} {{commission}} {{use a variety}} of measures to achieve their broad purposes. Among these measures are import restrictions, such as border controls and entry controls—some of which may be bilaterally negotiated—and variable import duties. If import restrictions are not sufficient to maintain prices because of excess production, the surplus is exported at subsidized prices (with the subsidies usually coming from federal or provincial authorities). Authorities also apply production controls, such as sales quotas or limits, on the size and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> holdings. Quotas exist for many different products, with the quotas usually fixed on the basis of past production. Price and quality controls and limits also exist, especially with respect to different prices for different grades of wheat or milk. The government can also pay direct income supplements, but these payments are generally restricted to certain mountain farming zones and other equally disadvantaged areas. Subsidies are mainly paid by the federal government but may in some instances be paid by provincial governments.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to pastoralists whose focus {{is almost entirely}} on livestock, agro-pastoralists may focus primarily on agriculture and derive less than 50 % of their income from livestock rearing (Rota and Sperandini 2010).

30|$|Short and Dwyer {{discuss how}} wildlife-orientated schemes in the UK are {{distorting}} {{the farming system}} {{in a way that}} might not be in the long-term interest of wildlife. Intensive production <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> (using mostly low lying land) is resulting in under-grazing in uplands and resultant increased fire, less watershed health, less biological diversity, and more gorse invasion. Also, agricultural biodiversity has decreased too, and uplands are being reserved for recreation. They also remark that in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the European Union Common Agricultural Programme (CAP) encouraged less hardier but higher-output breeds and higher <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock,</b> which led to land degradation - environmentalists then accused farmers of being ‘degraders’, rather than focusing on the negative incentives from the policy measures.|$|R
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{sequence}} type 398 (MRSA ST 398) {{has emerged}} in livestock worldwide. In particular, areas in Europe with high <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> farming are affected. Consequently, the incidence of human colonization and infection with ST 398 is rapidly increasing. Distinguishing different ST 398 isolates with standard typing tools is problematic. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the discriminatory power of Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat Fingerprinting (MLVF) on a highly diverse ST 398 collection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Living in a {{neighbourhood}} {{with a high}} <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> farms {{has been}} associated with adverse respiratory health effects, but less is known about healthcare utilisation. This study aimed at investigating the associations between livestock exposure and primary health care visits and self-reported symptoms. In addition, we examined the potentially confounding effect of distance from home to general practice. METHODS: Contact data between 2006 and 2009 were obtained from electronic medical records of 54, 777 persons registered within 16 general practices in an area with a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> farms in the Netherlands. Data on self-reported symptoms were used from a cross-sectional sample of 531 patients in 2010. Livestock presence in a 500 m radius from home was computed using Geographic Information System data. RESULTS: In general, livestock exposure was associated with fewer contacts and self-reported symptoms for respiratory and other conditions. The number of poultry within 500 m was positively associated with the number of contacts. A longer distance to general practice was associated with fewer contacts, but did not confound associations.

40|$|Aim of study: Wildfire {{incidence}} in Portugal is high {{in comparison}} with other Mediterranean Europe countries. Wildfire problems have been worsened by complex interactions between land use, livestock grazing and human population during the 20 th century. In this study we try to understand these interactions and relationships. Area of study: Portugal country. Material and Methods: For the mainland Portuguese territory we present a statistical temporal analysis (1930 - 2001) based on the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> grazing and human inhabitants at the smallest administrative unit level, the parish. We compare these data with fire incidence descriptors (average area burned and average fire density) between 1990 and 2007. Research highlights: We have identified clusters of parishes sharing common trends in the evolution <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> and human inhabitant densities. A cause-effect relationship was not detected between livestock grazing density and fire incidence. However, the results point out clusters of parishes where conflicts between forest, fire and livestock grazing are important in the North, Centre and South regions of Portugal.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effect <b>of</b> different <b>livestock</b> grazing treatments on breeding bird densities in a salt marsh habitat. To avoid an experiment on the large scale needed to directly measure grazing effects on bird densities, we followed a two-step approach. First, we measured vegetation micro-patterns (mosaic of lower vegetation and taller patches at 4 × 4 m) around Common Redshank Tringa totanus and Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus nests and at random sites paired with these nests sites to judge suitability of micro-patterns for nest building. Secondly, we measured micro-patterns at 120 permanent plots in five different experimental grazing treatments to determine how grazing affects micro-patterns. We compared low stocking <b>density</b> <b>of</b> both cattle and of horses, high stocking <b>density</b> <b>of</b> cattle and of horses, and intermittent grazing with a high stocking <b>density</b> <b>of</b> cattle (i. e. yearly intervals of grazing and no grazing). Redshank and Oystercatcher nests occurred in sites with taller vegetation and more pronounced micro-patterns than found at random sites. Paddocks grazed with low <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> or with a high density intermittent grazing treatment had micro-patterns preferred by the birds. We conclude that Redshanks and Oystercatchers may benefit in terms of potential nest sites from grazing at low livestock densities or at intermittent stocking <b>densities</b> through effects <b>of</b> grazing on micro-patterns in the vegetation. ...|$|R
30|$|Our transhumant {{system as}} we know it is going to face a lot of problems. The {{livestock}} population is increasing whilst the graze-able land is decreasing, which encourages competition of crop farmers with pastoralists. The crises are forcing Fulani to migrate to crisis-free areas. We used to have abundant grasses but {{as a result of the}} crises there is more migration of people and increases in the population of the grazing reserve. This has resulted in an increased population <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> per graze-able areas. If this continues, pastoralism and nomadism will have to stop. Agreeing to stop transhumance will take a long time, as most movements are to look for greener pasture otherwise our animals would starve.|$|E
30|$|Compared to Britain, Romania was a latecomer to industrialisation.

40|$|Livestock {{predation}} {{by large}} carnivores and their retaliatory persecution by pastoralists are worldwide conservation concerns. Poor {{understanding of the}} ecological and social underpinnings of this human¿wildlife conflict hampers effective conflict management programs. The endangered snow leopard Uncia uncia is involved in conflict with people across its mountainous range in South and Central Asia, where pastoralism is the predominant land use, and is widely persecuted in retaliation. We examined human-snow leopard conflict at two sites in the Spiti region of the Indian Trans-Himalaya, where livestock outnumber wild ungulates, and the conflict is acute. We quantified the snow leopard's dependence on livestock by assessing its diet in two sites that differed in the relative abundance <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> and wild ungulates. We also surveyed the indigenous Buddhist community's attitudes towards the snow leopard in these two sites. Our results show a relatively high dependence of snow leopards on livestock. A higher proportion of the snow leopard's diet (58 %) was livestock in the area with higher livestock (29. 7 animals km¿ 2) and lower wild ungulate abundance (2. 1 ¿ 3. 1 bharal Pseudois nayaur km¿ 2), compared with 40 % of diet in the area with relatively lower livestock (13. 9 km¿ 2) and higher wild ungulate abundance (4. 5 ¿ 7. 8 ibex Capra ibex km¿ 2). We found that the community experiencing greater levels <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> losses was comparatively more tolerant towards the snow leopard. This discrepancy is explained {{by the presence of}} a conservation-incentive program at the site, and by differences in economic roles <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> between these two communities. The former is more dependent on cash crops as a source of income while the latter is more dependent on livestock, and thereby less tolerant of the snow leopard. These data have implications for conflict management strategies. They indicate that the relative <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> and wild prey may be reasonable predictors of the extent of predation by the snow leopard. However, this by itself is not an adequate measure of the intensity of conflict even in apparently similar cultural settings...|$|R
30|$|These {{differences}} between natural and human-modified ecosystems are often {{attributed to the}} high stocking <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock,</b> but recent studies have found this view to be overly simplistic (Fuhlendorf and Engle 2004; Bagchi and Ritchie 2010 b; Winter et al. 2012). Intensive commercial ranching poses numerous challenges for ecosystem management in all continents (e.g. Fleischner 1994; Cabral et al. 2003; McIntyre et al. 2003; Albon et al. 2007). Even traditional pastoral land use is often thought to be inconsistent {{with the goals of}} conservation (Prins 1992), although studies have asserted that all forms of degradation and wildlife declines are not necessarily related to pastoralism per se (e.g. Homewood et al. 2001). Therefore, considerable uncertainties persist over how to utilize information from natural ecosystems to manage human-modified ecosystems and vice versa (Levin 1993; Watkinson and Ormerod 2001). This is further compounded by high variability as the effects of grazing can differ considerably, even idiosyncratically, between ecosystems (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1993; Proulx and Mazumder 1998; Olff and Ritchie 1998; Chase et al. 2000; Vesk and Westoby 2001; Gruner et al. 2008). But, amidst these differences, both within and between ecosystems, an important insight for managers is that grazer effects may vary predictably along prominent natural environmental gradients such as precipitation (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1993; Olff and Ritchie 1998; Anderson et al. 2007; May et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Western European landscapes have {{drastically}} {{changed since}} the 1950 s, with agricultural intensifications {{and the spread of}} urban settlements considered the most important drivers of this land-use/land-cover change. Losses of habitat for fauna and flora have been a direct consequence of this development. In the present study, we relate butterfly occurrence to land-use/land-cover changes over five decades between 1951 and 2000. The study area covers the entire Swiss territory. The 10 explanatory variables originate from agricultural statistics and censuses. Both state as well as rate was used as explanatory variables. Species distribution data were obtained from natural history collections. We selected eight butterfly species: four species occur on wetlands and four occur on dry grasslands. We used cluster analysis to track land-use/land-cover changes and to group communes based on similar trajectories of change. Generalized linear models were applied to identify factors that were significantly correlated with the persistence or disappearance of butterfly species. Results showed that decreasing agricultural areas and <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> farms with more than 10 ha of cultivated land are significantly related with wetland species decline, and increasing <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> seem to have favored disappearance of dry grassland species. Moreover, we show that species declines are not only dependent on land-use/land-cover states but also on the rates of change; that is, the higher the transformation rate from small to large farms, the higher the loss of dry grassland species. We suggest that more attention should be paid to the rates of landscape change as feasible drivers of species change and derive some management suggestions...|$|R

To a lesser degree productivity was influenced by natural conditions and the level of employment. Besides, the intensity of organization is to a considerable extent shaped by price relations between agricultural produce and means of production.

The results indicated that in 2001, the fodder yield of all varieties were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher than those of 2002. But not significant difference was recorded between the two sites during the two years. In 2001, at Ticko, “Baban waké", Kanannado and IT 93 K- 398 - 2 had higher fodder yields than the remaining varieties with 1032 kg/ha, 879 kg/ha and 866 kg/ha respectively. The lowest fodder yields were recorded for Locale variety which is grown by farmers, IT 89 KD- 349 and TVu 1234 - 9 with 715 kg/ha, 499 kg/ha and 677 kg/ha, respectively. In 2002, the highest fodder yields were also recorded for introduced varieties such as “Baban waké", IN 92 E- 3, IT 89 KD- 288, IT 89 KD- 349, Kanannado, IT 93 K- 398 - 2 and TN 256 - 87 compared to Locale variety. The results indicated the possibility to increase fodder production through the introduction of dual-purpose cowpeas and thus increasing farmers ’ income...|$|E
40|$|Information {{is needed}} on the biophysical and {{economic}} rationale for labour-demanding (and therefore, expensive) backyard animal rearing systems on smallholdings in the uplands <b>of</b> Java where <b>livestock</b> have been {{an integral part of}} highly intensive agriculture for centuries. The occurrence <b>of</b> high <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> ruminant <b>livestock</b> is counter-intuitive considering the extent and continuous nature of cropping on densely populated islands such as Java where little land remains suitable for grazing. As a consequence, livestock are permanently housed in backyards and fed indigenous forages cut from field margins and roadsides. Although cut-and-carry feeding is labour-intensive, it is surprising that farmers collect quantities of forage greatly in excess of the requirements <b>of</b> their <b>livestock.</b> In an experiment, indigenous forage was fed to sheep at increasing rates: 25, 50 or 75 g DM kg-' liveweight daily. The results showed that although DM intake and liveweight gain rose with increasing offer-rate, the incremental improvements from 50 to 75 were non-significant (p< 0. 05) and < 25 to 50. It is unlikely that farmers justify their excess-feeding strategies {{on the basis of these}} marginal gains in animal productivity alone. The rationale for excess-feeding also lies in the production of manure-composts. Group-interviews, involving preference-ranking and matrix scoring exercises, indicated that in upland areas, farmers have an extensive knowledge regarding organic fertiliser quality and use. Farmers place value on the inclusion of animal wastes, particularly urine, into composts. In rain fed areas, manure production ranked similar to meat production in importance as outputs from the sheep enterprise. The research demonstrates how livestock are traditionally used to produce high quality compost and provides evidence to support the hypothesis that integration <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> into Javanese agriculture is essential to sustaining some of the world's most intensive smallholder farming systems...|$|R
40|$|Studies that {{quantify}} {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) fluxes from African tropical forests and adjacent managed land uses are scarce. The expansion of smallholder agriculture and commercial agriculture into the Mau forest, the largest montane forest in Kenya, has caused large-scale land use {{change over the}} last decades. We measured annual soil N 2 O fluxes between August 2015 and July 2016 from natural forests and compared them to the N 2 O fluxes from land either managed by smallholder farmers for grazing and tea production, or commercial tea and eucalyptus plantations (n = 18). Air samples from 5 pooled static chambers were collected between 8 : 00 am and 11 : 30 am and used within each plot to calculate the gas flux rates. Annual soil N 2 O fluxes ranged between 0. 2 and 2. 9 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 at smallholder sites and 0. 6 – 1. 7 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 at the commercial agriculture sites, with no difference between land uses (p = 0. 98 and p = 0. 18, respectively). There was marked variation within land uses and, in particular, within those managed by smallholder farmers where management was also highly variable. Plots receiving fertilizer applications and those with high <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> showed the highest N 2 O fluxes (1. 6 ± 0. 3 kg N 2 O-N ha− 1 yr− 1, n = 7) followed by natural forests (1. 1 ± 0. 1 kg N 2 O-N ha− 1 yr− 1, n = 6); although these {{were not significantly different}} (p = 0. 19). Significantly lower fluxes (0. 5 ± 0. 1 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1, p < 0. 01, n = 5) were found on plots that received little or no inputs. Daily soil N 2 O flux rates were not correlated with concurrent measurements of water filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature or inorganic nitrogen (IN) concentrations. However, IN intensity, a measure of exposure of soil microbes (in both time and magnitude) to IN concentrations was strongly correlated with annual soil N 2 O fluxes. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Night corralling <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> {{directly}} in crop fields {{during the dry}} season contributes to nutrient cycling for the benefit of crops. Rangeland grazing and corralling livestock on selected croplands result in a spatial transfer of organic matter and nutrients from rangelands to the corralling sites. These transfers were measured over a year in three villages of Niger that differ in <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> human and <b>livestock</b> populations and proportion of land that is cropped. In each land unit, nutrient transfers were calculated as the difference between forage intake and excretions. Forage intake by livestock accounted for only 11 to 19 percent of the annual herbage yield of rangelands and 7 to 10 percent of weeds and millet crop residues. Through faecal excretion, livestock recycled 50 percent of organic matter, 48 percent of nitrogen and 85 percent <b>of</b> phosphorus intake. <b>Livestock</b> management led to a manure concentration on selected fields that received 5 to 13 times more manure than average village land. Despite moderate annual stocking rates, 7 to 12 TLU Km- 2 (Tropical Livestock Unit = 250 kg live weight), grazing pressure in early wet season reached 68 to 160 TLU d t- 1 of forage leading to deterimental effects on rangeland productivity and species composition...|$|R
