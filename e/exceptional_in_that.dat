5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|Excluding Kingston upon Hull {{there are}} several areas of {{settlement}} in the East Riding, each giving rise to distinctive types of small to medium-sized towns and villages. Cottingham and Willerby are <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> they are suburban villages which are almost contiguous with the Hull urban area. Bridlington is the most populous of the coastal settlements, which also include Flamborough, Hornsea, Withernsea and Aldbrough. Towns and villages on the flat agricultural area of Holderness are Hedon and Roos, and nestling in the Great Wold Valley is Rudston. Along the eastern foot of the Wolds lie Beverley, Bishop Burton, Driffield and Lockington. In the low-lying lands close to the Humber Estuary are Goole, Brough, North Ferriby, Hessle and Kirk Ella. Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Market Weighton, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Howden and South Cave all lie {{to the north and}} west of the area, between the River Derwent and the scarp slope of the Wolds.|$|E

25|$|A {{third of}} intermarried couples provide their {{children}} with a Jewish upbringing, and doing so is more common among intermarried families raising their children in areas with high Jewish populations. The Boston area, for example, is <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> an estimated 60% percent of children of intermarriages are being raised Jewish, meaning that intermarriage would actually be contributing to a net {{increase in the number}} of Jews. As well, some children raised through intermarriage rediscover and embrace their Jewish roots when they themselves marry and have children.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of trogons are birds of tropical and subtropical forests. They have a cosmopolitan {{distribution in the}} worlds wet tropics, being found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A few species are distributed into the temperate zone, with one species, the elegant trogon, reaching {{the south of the}} United States specifically southern Arizona and the surrounding area. The Narina trogon of Africa is slightly <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it utilises a wider range of habitats than any other trogon, ranging from dense forest to fairly open savannah, and from the Equator to southern South Africa. It is the most widespread and successful of all the trogons. The eared quetzal of Mexico is also able to use more xeric habitats, but preferentially inhabits forests. Most other species are more restricted in their habitat, with several species being restricted to undisturbed primary forest. Within forests they tend {{to be found in the}} mid-story, occasionally in the canopy.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, a {{corporation}} called AGES Group {{filed a lawsuit}} against Raytheon in a federal court in Alabama over a $450 million contract to service C-12 Huron and U-21 military aircraft. The Boston Herald reported that AGES alleged that the security firm Wackenhut Corporation, hired by Raytheon, used video and audio surveillance to spy on a consulting firm hired by AGES to help it prepare its bid. AGES also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to Raytheon. Both Raytheon and AGES had been vying for the contract, which Raytheon had held for decades but AGES won in 1996. On May 12, 1999, Reuters reported that Raytheon would pay $3 million to AGES Group and purchase $13 million worth of AGES aircraft parts to settle the AGES lawsuit. The settlement was <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> the parties agreed that judgment would be entered against Raytheon, legally establishing the validity of AGES' allegations.|$|E
500|$|Another {{remarkable}} {{example of}} neoclassicism is Liselund {{on the island}} of Møn in south-eastern Denmark. This rather small country home built in the French Neoclassical style in the 1790s is <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it has a thatched roof. Like the surrounding Romantic park, the house was the work of Andreas Kirkerup, one of the foremost landscape architects of the times. [...] It was designed as a summer retreat for Antoine de la Calmette, the island's governor, and his wife, Lise. The building is T-shaped with the main rooms on the ground floor, the first floor consisting of nine bedrooms. The interior was probably decorated by the leading decorator of the day, Joseph Christian Lillie.|$|E

He could describe a key as a key no matter what its size or color, and could determine how the key was different from others. Looking at a mirror, he said [...] "what color", and learned [...] "grey" [...] after being told [...] "grey" [...] six times.

60|$|Frederick {{was the son}} of the Emperor Henry VI and {{his mother}} was the {{daughter}} of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily. He inherited this kingdom in 1198 {{when he was a child}} of four years. Innocent III had been made his guardian. Sicily in those days had been but recently conquered by the Normans; the Court was half oriental and full of highly educated Arabs; and some of these were associated in the education of the young king. No doubt they were at some pains to make their point of view clear to him. He got a Moslem view of Christianity as well as a Christian view of Islam, and the unhappy result of this double system of instruction was a view, <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> age of faith, that all religions were impostures. He talked freely on the subject; his heresies and blasphemies are on record.|$|E

40|$|Cyclicity {{has long}} been a {{characteristic}} of urban land and property markets. In some periods, especially in times of macro-economic stability, it is subdued and readily manageable, and in other periods it is <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> terms of its amplitude, periodicity and overall economic impacts. In the post- 1980 period, however, not only have some cycles been <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> the above sense, they have also been <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> the sense <b>that</b> their causes and consequences are internationally transmitted. Accordingly, the post 1980 exceptional cyclicities merit theoretical and situational explanation.

6000|$|But even in {{connection}} with this mysterious figure there is a moral which affords another reason for mentioning him. Whether he was a sheriff or an outlaw, there was certainly something about him that suggested the adventurous violence of the old border life of America; and whether he was connected with the police or no, there was certainly violence enough in his environment to satisfy the most ardent policeman. The posters in the paper-shop were placarded with the verdict in the Hamon trial; a cause célèbre which reached its crisis in Oklahoma while I was there. Senator Hamon had been shot by a girl whom he had wronged, and his widow demanded justice, or what might fairly be called vengeance. There was very great excitement culminating in the girl's acquittal. Nor did the Hamon case appear to be entirely <b>exceptional</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> breezy borderland. The moment the town had received the news that Clara Smith was free, newsboys rushed down the street shouting, 'Double stabbing outrage near Oklahoma,' or 'Banker's throat cut on Main Street,' or otherwise resuming their regular mode of life.

We also show <b>that</b> <b>in</b> comparable countries, intense religion is on the decline or already at very low levels.
