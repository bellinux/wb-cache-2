On October 19 2014, the track list of Reclassified was released, which also included [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] as 9th track. On 23 October 2014, the track was available for streaming. A day later, the track was made available as an instant digital download track upon pre-ordering Reclassified via iTunes Stores. [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was written by Iggy Azalea, The Invisible Men, Jon Mills, Darryl Reid and Jon Turner. It was produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade. Lasting for a duration of 3:20 (three minutes and twenty seconds), [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] is built on [...] "club-ready" [...] electro handclap-based beats and heavy synthesisers. Lyrically, Azalea talks about her success and goes after her [...] "haters" [...] on the song. At one point, she raps: [...] "Haters gon' hate while critics critique, I pay them no mind whenever they speak / what they make a year I make in a week, I know you can't stand it, just <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> seat!" [...] On the hook, she raps: [...] "Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy SZN / Until l get what I want, I ain't leaving… Simmer down bitch / It's Iggy SZN." ...|$|E
2500|$|The number-one-hit [...] "Have You Ever?" [...] was {{the tenth}} track. Brandy {{states that it}} was the first time she had been in the studio with a {{producer}} like David Foster. Her voice wasn't as developed as it is now and the song required what producers call ‘money notes' – the kind that <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> No. 1 on the charts. She says she was really nervous but it all worked just fine.", [...] "Put That on Everything" [...] a mid-tempo ballad is the albums eleventh track and was written by Brandy Norwood, L. Daniels, Fred Jenkins III, Rodney Jerkins and Joana Tejeda and is produced by Rodney Jerkins.|$|E
2500|$|As many as 500 {{journalists from}} online, print, radio, and {{television}} take part, {{with access to}} all sessions in the official program, {{some of which are}} also webcast. Not all the journalists are given access to all areas, however. This is reserved for white badge holders. [...] "Davos runs an almost caste-like system of badges," [...] according to BBC journalist Anthony Reuben. [...] "A white badge means you're one of the delegates – you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country (although that would also <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little holographic sticker to add to your badge), or a senior journalist. An orange badge means you're just a run-of-the-mill working journalist." ...|$|E

I'm <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hat that says 'Ex VP,' that says 'Executive Vice President.' You're running the joint around here." ...

2500|$|Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee had {{an intern}} go around {{greeting}} attendees {{in a large}} orange squirrel suit. [...] It wore a shirt with the message [...] "Another Clinton in the White House is Nuts" [...] and was accompanied by other staffers handing out sheets with anti-Clinton talking points. [...] During one promotional appearance in Washington, D.C., Clinton {{went up to the}} orange figure and said, [...] "Hello, Mr. Squirrel, how are you? I wanted you to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> copy of my book," [...] adding, [...] "you bring a smile to a lot of people's faces." [...] The copy she gave the squirrel was inscribed, [...] "Squirrel – Please make a hard choice and read my book! Hillary".|$|E
2500|$|The Capp-Fisher feud {{was well}} known in cartooning circles, and it grew more {{personal}} as Capp's strip eclipsed Joe Palooka in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, Moe Leff. After Fisher underwent plastic surgery, Capp included a racehorse in Li'l Abner named [...] "Ham's Nose-Bob." [...] In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named [...] "Happy Vermin"—a caricature of Fisher—who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous [...] "temporary" [...] assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: [...] "I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do— I'll <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> new light bulb!!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he had {{originally}} intended to concentrate on production rather than his own music, in 1970 Todd formed the 'band' Runt, consisting of himself, teenagers Hunt Sales on drums, and his brother Tony Sales on bass (the Sales brothers, sons of US comedian Soupy Sales, were in a short lived band called Tony and the Tigers {{and went on to}} play with Iggy Pop, David Bowie, and Tin Machine). Rundgren himself wrote, produced, sang and played guitars, keyboards and other instruments. Whether Runt is best described as a band or simply as a pseudonym for Rundgren as a solo artist is unclear—for the album Runt (1970) the group appeared to be a bona fide trio, but on their second album [...] (1971), Hunt Sales plays only on two tracks and is replaced by N. D. Smart {{on the rest of the}} album. Furthermore, only Rundgren is pictured on the covers of both albums, and both albums have been subsequently reissued with the same titles and cover art, but bearing the artist credit [...] "Todd Rundgren". Whether a solo project or a band, Runt had a No.20 hit in the United States with [...] "We Gotta <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>a</b> Woman" [...] in 1970, and two other Runt songs placed in the lower reaches of the Hot 100.|$|E

2500|$|Hines {{recalled}} {{much of the}} group's early {{material as}} being [...] "primitive," [...] stating that [...] "the production on our early stuff didn't come up to par until [...] "Klap Ya Handz." [...] A producer named Dexx, also from Crown Heights, produced [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] for the group. In early 1991, Hines and Weston heard that EPMD would be hosting a talent show at Club Tropicana in Richmond, Virginia and decided to enter. Hines and Weston performed their song [...] "Klap Ya Handz," [...] which they'd recorded as a demo with Dexx (In fact, for the album, Hines and Weston had to rhyme over the demo for [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] because they didn't have an instrumental version of the music.). The group apparently had {{the highest score in}} the contest, which would earn the winner a $100 prize. However, according to Weston, although the duo had the highest score Parrish Smith, one half of the group EPMD, told the club announcer to give the second best group the prize. While the winning group went up to claim their prize, Smith came to Hines and Weston and said, [...] "yo, what would you guys rather have: a record deal or a hundred dollars? Meet me {{in the back of the}} club in five minutes." [...] Smith and Erick Sermon, the other member of EPMD, met with Hines and Weston in the back of the club and asked the two to play them the [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] track again. Sermon and Smith were so impressed by the song that they asked Hines and Weston for the tape, with Smith telling them, [...] "if you can get us nine more songs like the one you just performed, we can <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> deal." [...] Hines and Weston kept in touch with EPMD during their junior year in college, finishing out the school year in May.|$|E
