40|$|Intro: This {{case study}} {{profiles}} Claremont, {{a city of}} approximately 37, 000 residents. Since its formation in 1887, it has primarily been known as a college town {{with a history of}} citrus production. This case study investigates what components would need to be in place to rebrand or reposition the city as a unique, healthful destination. Case: A resident survey, interviews, and focus groups were used to gather qualitative data about residents??? perceptions of the city???s current brand and potential rebranding. Management & Outcome: Scope of work for the focus city included data gathering from residents, and identification of projects, services, and designations to support marketing of the city as a health/wellness destination. Discussion: Data from surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews indicated that residents were uncertain of the City???s current brand, in general appeared to care little about the brand, and lacked information about the City???s interest in a possible future rebranding. Further, City documents revealed a history of departmental rebrandings that may have obscured the City???s current brand image. Recommendations for the future include making no change of brand without resident and key stakeholder buy-in; sponsorship of health-related events versus rebranding; and possible creation of a staff position such as Public Health Specialist responsible for assessing the health impacts of City <b>initiatives,</b> <b>resolutions,</b> and policies, and assisting the City???s DMO in marketing healthful aspects of the City...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{sets out}} to focus the {{attention}} of scholars and policy-makers on the urgency of Nigeria's worsening debt crisis, {{with a view to}} suggesting initiatives which can be instrumental in preventing a further deterioration of the crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The recommendations suggested specifically addressed stated research objectives. The research framework attempted to evaluate the role played by Nigeria's past administrations in the evolvement of the crisis. It also appraised the crisis {{in the context of the}} new international environment surrounding it. The study suggested improvement to the methodological flaws inherent in modern-day debt resolution framework, which, so far, has only undermined the implementation of past <b>resolution</b> <b>initiatives</b> at the practical level. Findings - Among other findings, the study uncovered the following: without their modification to suit the peculiar needs and circumstances facing individual countries, modern-day debt <b>resolution</b> <b>initiatives</b> will only continue to further impoverish Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa; over time, Nigeria's successive administrations-through corruption and inconsistent administrative policies-significantly contributed to the crisis; creditors establishments-by knowingly favoring fraudulent administrations with huge, questionable loans (in their self-serving interest to benefit from reverse resource transfer) -in no small measure contributed to the crisis. Research limitations/implications - The projections into the future are only based on trends observed in the past. They do not include unexpected events which might dramatically affect the course of the crisis in the long or distant future. Practical implications - In order to ensure a successful implementation of resolution strategies suggested here and elsewhere, all the concerned parties will have to be actively involved-both Nigeria and other indebted African countries, and all their external creditors. Originality/value - Nigeria's external debt crisis was re-appraised in the context of the new environment of the crisis. The findings and <b>initiatives</b> suggested for <b>resolution</b> here have a tremendous research value for scholars in the field. They also have an immense practical value for implementation by policy-makers. Debt financing, Forecasting, Nigeria, Sub-Saharan Afric...|$|R

40|$|This note {{focuses on}} the ENP {{rather than on the}} {{strategic}} contexts in which the policy unfolds. Based on a realistic assessment of the EU’s limited capacities it argues that the definition of a clear endgame, an ‘association area’ along the EU’s current borders, would provide the ENP and the EU’s partners with a tangible medium-term goal. Clarity on the goal and timeframe of the policy would also allow for better coordination of the different elements of the policy (political and economic integration, democracy promotion, support for civil society, multilateral <b>initiatives,</b> conflict <b>resolution).</b> While such a basic strategic vision would need to be adjusted to continuously unfolding developments, it could nonetheless function as a guideline for a more coherent, proactive and firm EU policy, both in relations with partner countries and in the interaction with other external actors. The events in North Africa once again demonstrate the magnitude of the challenges the EU faces in its neighbourhood. The review of the ENP provides a good occasion to equip the policy with a strategic vision on how to meet these challenges...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a Master thesis for the Master’s program in International and European Relations in the Department of Management and Economics at Linköping University. As the title indicates, {{the aim of}} this thesis is to make a {{comparative}} analysis of the conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>initiatives</b> that were employed in the Sierra Leonean and Liberian conflicts. The research questions are: • What were the root causes and trajectories of the Sierra Leonean and Liberian conflicts? • What were the conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>initiatives</b> employed in resolving both conflicts? • Why did the Lome Peace Accord succeed in the case of Sierra Leone whilst the Abuja Peace Accord failed in bringing peace to Liberia? In order to answer the afore-mentioned questions and fulfil {{the aim of this}} paper, a qualitative research method has been chosen. The study is mainly based on secondary sources such as textbooks, official documents from ECOWAS and the UN, articles, magazines and newspapers as well as internet resources. In making the comparative analysis the Conflict Transformation Model as espoused by Kumar Rupesinghe has been utilized. This model has specifically helped in explaining the reasons why peace returned to Sierra Leone but eluded the people of Liberia for a long time. The conclusion drawn from the study is that a multi-track approach is required in dealing with conflicts in West Africa so that it would touch on the context of the conflict, the conflict structure, the intra-party as well as the inter- party divisions and the broader system of society and governance within the conflict area...|$|R
