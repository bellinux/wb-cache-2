However, radio transmission would not be feasible, if the distance of the GPS buoy is far from the coast, say more than 50 km. Satellite <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> would be more reliable in such a situation. However, such satellite <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> is still not cost-effective. Future cost reduction of satellite <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> is truly needed for earlier tsunami detection.|$|R

40|$|Time-variations in {{wireless}} channels affect opportunistic {{selection in}} a multi-node wireless system in two ways. First, the selected node can become sub-optimal {{by the time}} <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> commences. Second, the channel changes during <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b> We develop a comprehensive and tractable analytical framework that accurately accounts for both these effects. It differs from the extensive existing literature that primarily focuses on time-variations until the <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> starts. We first develop a novel concept of a time-invariant effective signal-to-noise ratio (TIESNR), which tractably and accurately captures the time-variations during the <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> phase with partial channel state information available at the receiver. Thereafter, we model the joint distribution of the signal-to-noise ratio {{at the time of}} selection and TIESNR during the <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> and analyze the average packet error rate (PER). Extensive numerical results verify the accuracy of each step of our approach and show that ignoring the correlated time-variations during the <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> phase can significantly underestimate the average PER...|$|R

30|$|In {{communications}} systems, {{two different}} ways utilized to transmit the data are continuous <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> and packet <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b> For the continuous <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> such as voice, the transmission rate {{is controlled by the}} transport layer. In this case, the receiver knows the transmission rate during the entire data flow. As for the packet <b>data</b> <b>transmission,</b> each packet consists of the header and the data, and the information of the switch configuration can be hidden in the header of each packet. Therefore, in order to adjust the transmission rate without notifying the receiver, the transmitter first encodes the switch configuration and then includes the encoded bits in the header. The length of the header depends on the coding rate of the error correcting codes. In this article, we consider continuous <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|R

40|$|Opportunistic <b>data</b> <b>transmissions</b> in {{cognitive}} radio networks {{is an effective}} <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism which reduces the limitations of fixed spectrum allocations. In cognitive radio networks secondary users (SUs) can transmit over the available spectrum when the primary users (PUs) are inactive. However, a SU may get interrupted over multiple times when the PU re-appear on that channel for <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b> For an interrupted SU, efficient spectrum hand-off management is vital to complete the <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b> Efficient spectrum hand-off necessitates greatly for delay sensitive <b>data</b> <b>transmissions</b> (e. g. time critical remote monitoring applications). For such <b>data</b> <b>transmissions,</b> delay sensitive spectrum hand-off mechanisms are necessary. However, the existing sensed spectrum hand-off management methods do not consider delay bounded repeated attempts for spectrum reallocation when there are multiple interruptions. In this paper a delay sensitive spectrum hand-off management for the re-entrant SUs due to multiple interruptions is proposed. Compared to the existing solutions, the proposed spectrum allocation strategy offers more reliable delay-tolerant opportunities for accessing the spectrum for the re-entrant SUs...|$|R
