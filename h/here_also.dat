5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers <b>here</b> <b>also</b> first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E

25|$|While {{glucokinase}} {{has been}} shown to occur in certain cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine and stomach, its function and regulation have not been worked out. It has been suggested that <b>here,</b> <b>also,</b> glucokinase serves as a glucose sensor, allowing these cells to provide one of the earliest metabolic responses to incoming carbohydrates. It is suspected that these cells are involved in incretin functions.|$|E

25|$|Occupy Wall Street (itself {{inspired}} by the Arab Spring began on September 17, 2011, sparking a wave of public encampments {{that came to be}} known as the Occupy Movement. Students at Harvard began organizing in response to that movement, and began to collaborate with the Occupy Boston encampment established on September 30, 2011. Harvard workers, many of them members of Local 615 (SEIU) and Local 26 (UNITE <b>HERE!),</b> <b>also</b> joined with Occupy Boston and helped to plan Occupy Harvard. The Harvard Crimson generally opposed the Occupy actions, and defended police officers who arrested Harvard students at Occupy Boston.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} five {{segments of}} the crayfish house the massive flexor and extensor muscles. Six abdominal ganglia run down {{the entire length of}} the abdomen and communicate with one another through projections. The first five abdominal segments each have their own ganglion, that contains three roots with outward projections. The first has mixed sensory and motor nerves innervating swimmerets while the second has sensory and motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles, while the third root contains only motor neuron projections that extend into the flexor muscles. The last segment contains the fusion of two ganglia. The ganglia <b>here</b> <b>also</b> receive sensory input from the sensitive hairs on the tail fan.|$|E
25|$|She {{referred}} to her early girlhood as the most eventful part of her life. There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother’s death only four days after reaching the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and where he wanted his little daughter’s company. Clear and vivid was her memory of that trip down the Hudson River taken with her father when she was three years old, and of their arrival at the small boarding school on then fashionable Bleeker Street. At six, {{she was back in}} Middlebury, browsing in her father’s large and well chosen library —she could not remember the time when she {{did not know how to}} read— a library established in a newly-built house four miles up the Otter from Middlebury village in a quarter of the town called Farmingdale, a house presided over by a new step-mother. <b>Here,</b> <b>also</b> she recited daily lessons to her father and did her daily “stent” of sewing or knitting. Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child. It is <b>here</b> <b>also</b> that the father engaged in business again, and devoted himself chiefly to the development of the Rutland marble quarries. The home also included her half-brothers, Edward H. Ripley and Major General William Y. W. Ripley, both of whom became prominent officers in the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} flanks fall gently over {{acres of}} sheep pasture {{in the manner}} of the Skiddaw range. At the base of the slope is the wooded valley of Whit Beck, separating Lonscale Fell from the east ridge of Latrigg. <b>Here</b> <b>also</b> is Lonscale, the farm which has given its name to the fell. Whit Beck is a tributary of the Glenderaterra, a stream which forms the eastern boundary of Lonscale Fell. This flows due south from Skiddaw Forest between the Skiddaw massif and Blencathra, before joining the River Greta and running on through Keswick. The eastern face of the fell above the Glenderaterra is a mile long scarp of crags, a singular feature in the Skiddaw range.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} long and gentle slopes run {{down from the}} summit of Dow Crag toward the Duddon, while further north on this flank is Seathwaite Tarn. The ground <b>here</b> <b>also</b> begins in a shallow descent, but turns steep above the tarn {{in a line of}} minor crags. Seathwaite Tarn is a {{reservoir}} in a side valley of the Duddon system. This was originally a much smaller waterbody, but was dammed early in the 20th century to provide drinking water for the Barrow in Furness area. The dam is almost 400yards long and is concrete cored with slate buttresses, the resulting depth being around 80ft. Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, {{on the north side}} of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was Sarah Curran's desire to be buried <b>here</b> <b>also</b> but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.|$|E
