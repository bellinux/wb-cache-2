40|$|The {{problem of}} the study was to {{determine}} the effect of a progressive muscle relaxation program on secretaries' self-reported job stress. It was hypothesized that there would be no difference in post-test scores of the control group and the experimental group on the Personal Strain subscale of the OSI-R questionnaire. It was also hypothesized that there would be no difference between the groups in post-test scores on the Occupational Stress subscale of the OSI-R questionnaire. The population of prospective subjects for the study consisted of Ball State University secretaries who were randomly selected and then randomly assigned to one of two groups. The experimental group received a multi-activity intervention which included: 1) a progressive muscle relaxation training session; 2) reminder sheets with the steps on how to do progressive muscle relaxation in case they forgot; 3) e-mail messages to remind them to do progressive muscle relaxation; and 4) the <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> of their progressive muscle relaxation activities. The design {{of the study was}} a post-test only control group design. All subjects were asked to complete the OSI-Rquestionnaire at the end of the three-week intervention period. Descriptive statistics and two-tailed paired t-tests were used to analyze the data. The results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two groups on both the Personal Strain subscale and the Occupational Stress subscale of the OSI-R questionnaire. Based upon the results of this study, it was concluded that 15 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation did not make a difference in job stress levels of the subjects. Also, a three-week intervention period may not have been a sufficient amount of time to see results from the stress management technique used. Some of the recommendations for future study include using a larger sample size and using logs as a covariate for data analysis. Using a larger sample size could help create more variance in subjects and their responses. Having a covariate could help account for those individuals not complying with the intervention requirements. Department of Physiology and Health ScienceThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

The study ran for four weeks. Subjects and setting: Nine community pharmacy branches of the Independent Pharmacy Care Centres PLC based in Hull, East Yorkshire and North & North East Lincolnshire.

40|$|Recently animal {{training}} {{has become a}} field that is gaining followers and even experts, breeders {{from all over the}} world are starting to show interest. One of the important factors that plays a significant role in the training of animals is the level of motivation. There are many motivation techniques available to animal trainers. A number of these techniques focuses on food as a form of motivation. They successfully put to use the recognition that food is one of the most important primary reinforcers. It can fulfill the role of reward, or it can be an element of food deprivation, and also it can serve as a regulator of body weight. Other motivation techniques are based on motivation through a simple exercise, the use of motivation with other animals, or motivating an animal in the form of a basic position. By selecting and applying the correct motivation technique it is possible to achieve a high level of motivation and successful training lessons. With a suitable motivation method trainers can prevent undesirable behavior, which can often be spotted at animals kept in zoos. A key part of each animal training is welfare that ensures appropriate conditions for training and also for the trained animal itself. With the increasing number of both experts and general interest regarding animal training, the question <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> records <b>of</b> individual training lessons has emerged. It was the aim of this thesis to evaluate the various training logs known up till now used by experts on animal training. Individual animal trainers rely on their own training logs that they use during trainings at their workplaces, which is where the training logs are also most frequently created. To gain information about the form <b>of</b> the training <b>logs</b> is no easy matter, and to some extent this issue is one that is not publicized. It would be beneficial if the individual methods <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> training <b>logs</b> were made public and by doing so a unified training log draft was made. It is not necessary for all animal trainers to pursue the creating <b>of</b> training <b>logs,</b> however, there is no doubt that with their aid the evaluation of the partial or entire effectiveness of individual trainings would be more precise...|$|R
