The results of simulation show that the mold filling velocity of the semi-solid aluminum alloy decreases markedly with increase of the apparent viscosity. The influence of the pouring temperatures of the semi-solid aluminum alloy on the mold filling velocity is consistent {{with that of the}} traditional die casting. The solidification temperatures at the same position of the casting increase with increase of the apparent viscosity of the semi-solid aluminum alloy. There is no casting defect in the casting after complete solidification...|$|E

5000|$|The Henry Lubben House, Smokehouse and Springhouse are a {{collection}} of historic buildings located north of Baldwin, Iowa, United States. They are three of over 217 limestone structures in Jackson County from the mid-19th century, of which 101 were houses, 13 were springhouses, and 36 were other farm related buildings.
