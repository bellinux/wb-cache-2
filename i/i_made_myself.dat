[...] By her later description, each fudged the age {{they said they were}} to the other: [...] "He made himself younger, and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> older, of course." ...|$|E
500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I was in {{a temple}} where they killed {{three or four times}} a day. They told us to watch and not to show any emotion at all. They would kill us if we reacted...if we cried, or showed that we cared about the victims. They would kill you right away. So I had to shut it all off...I can shut off {{everything}} in my body, practically, physically. I saw them killing people right in front of me, the blood was there, but I didn't smell it. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> numb...The killing was unbearable. You go crazy if you smell the blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shodhan also {{hinted at}} the same : [...] "All I {{can tell you is}} that no youngster could hope to play for long at that time because he had to ally himself to one camp or the other. One had to know how to survive. What did I know about the {{politics}} ? The captain Vijay Hazare was not a strong personality and the truth is, Vinoo Mankad was. He always had his way... I would have loved to play on. But then Hazare called quits and Mankad became captain. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> unavailable for the tour to Pakistan in 1954/55. It is unlikely that I would have been chosen".|$|E

2500|$|The Futuristic {{movement}} {{also influenced}} {{the concept of}} dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine. [...] The altitude of a flying plane, {{the power of a}} car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience. [...] The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian [...] Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her [...] "Aerodanze" [...] and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance {{as the result of a}} deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: [...] " [...] I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} old man, with his usual benignant quiet, [...] "I saved your life. It {{is yet to be}} seen, perhaps, whether thereby <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> your benefactor. I trust so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. And {{in so many}} things, I have MADE myself well. I was a very queer {{and nervous}} girl. And by {{learning}} to use my will, simply by using my will, <b>I</b> <b>MADE</b> <b>myself</b> right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Mistress Thankful," [...] {{said the}} major, in conscience-stricken horror, [...] "if <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> distant to you, believe {{me it was}} only because I feared to intrude upon your sorrow. I really--dear Mistress Thankful--I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, {{leave it}} alone! I asked because I was {{surprised}} that Lord Arthur should call here. I should have fancied, Clara, that <b>I</b> had <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> sufficiently clear on that point. Who received him?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} a gun went 'bang' some way off; and my sister, like a wise hare, scuttled away {{at full speed}} for the wood. But <b>I</b> only <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> smaller than usual and lay {{watching}} and listening.|$|R

6000|$|... "One of my {{teachers}} has issued an advertisement, and {{has referred to}} My address, without first consulting Me. Have <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> understood, sir?" [...] She looked at the carriage again, when she called him [...] "sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hiram and Harvey {{worked the}} oars. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> as {{comfortable}} {{as possible in the}} stern-sheets, while Archie perforce remained in the bow of the craft in order that he might, as Griffin expressed it, [...] "trim ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jude," [...] {{she said}} brightly, {{when he had}} {{finished}} and come back to her; [...] "will you let me make you a NEW New Testament, like the one <b>I</b> <b>made</b> for <b>myself</b> at Christminster?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{want to see}} the fair,' she said; 'and I {{am going}} to look for Anna. <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> {{responsible}} for her, and must see she comes to no harm. She ought to be indoors. Will you come with me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think me ungrateful or churlish, Mr. Fentolin," [...] he begged. [...] "I have {{a habit of}} keeping {{promises}} which I make to myself, and to-night <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a promise that I will {{be back at the}} Tower by ten o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} {{she would like}} me better for sacrificing you? She is not a woman to be flattered because <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> despicable--to believe that I must be true to her because I was a dastard to you." ...|$|E
60|$|One evening, having climbed {{farther than}} I had intended, I lost my way. It was not safe in that {{neighbourhood}} {{to try new}} pathways in the dark, and chancing upon a deserted shelter, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a bed upon the straw.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! my dears, {{you will}} be glad to hear that I have {{abandoned}} my idea of wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I was and how ridiculous <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself!</b> You shall never see it again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, an organ. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> it <b>myself,</b> {{except the}} pipes. I opened the case this {{afternoon}} to commence soothing myself at once. It {{is not a}} very large one, but quite big enough for a private house. You play, I dare say?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{approve of}} my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> of some {{mark in the}} world?" [...] said Will, trying hard to {{reconcile}} the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{said the}} latter, stiffly. [...] "I {{have no doubt}} I know all that you could tell me. It is—ha—only out of {{consideration}} for your long and faithful service that I have—ha—permitted you a glimpse into my affairs—our affairs.

6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{liked to}} see the mason go chip, chip, and I wanted {{to see the}}m fit the thing in. I got into that great pew, to see better; and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> a nest, but at last they were all gone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, as I say, there's Duncan, of the Central, and {{the other}} is Lovejoy, of the Northwestern. Lovejoy's a {{bachelor}} and a skinflint.

6000|$|... "Well, in {{the first}} place, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>myself</b> very {{attentive}} to the duenna; in the second place, the old lady is devout, and you know Ireland {{is the land of}} saints, and I presented her with an amulet containing a paring of the nail of St. Patrick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My son's are men: one {{follows the}} {{profession}} of arms, one has embraced the ecclesiastical state; my daughter is herself a mother.
