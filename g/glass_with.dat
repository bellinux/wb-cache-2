40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} effect of wearing <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> full {{correction}} or under-correction {{on the development of}} juvenile myopia. METHODS:This study included 132 cases(264 eyes) from January 2008 to September 2012 who were collected from our clinic. They were divided into 2 groups, full correction and under-correction. Students in group 1 wore <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> full correction, students in group 2 wore <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> under-correction 0. 25 D to 0. 5 D lower than normal. Reexamination was done every 6 mo. After 12 mo, refractions were checked, the development of myopia was compared. RESULTS:There were no statistically significant differences between two groups after 6 mo(P = 0. 0693); however, there were significant differences after 12 mo(P = 0. 0013). CONCLUSION:The development of myopia is slow if students often wear <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> full correction...|$|R

5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic <b>glass</b> <b>with</b> isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{crystallization}} {{studies have}} been carried out on bulk, semiconducting AsxTe 100 −x glasses of different compositions using Differential Scanning Caloritmery. AsxTe 100 −x <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> x < 40, are found to exhibit one glass transition and one crystallization. On the other hand, <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> composition 40 less-than-or-equals, slantxless-than-or-equals, slant 50 show one glass transition and two crystallization reactions. It has been found that in <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> x greater-or-equal, slanted 40, the two crystallization reactions progressively merge with an increase in arsenic concentration. Consequently AsxTe 100 −x <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> x greater-or-equal, slanted 50 show only one crystallization. The composition dependence of crystallization temperatures and activation energies for crystallization estimated by Kissinger's method, show marked deviations at a composition x = 40. These observations can be explained in terms of the changes in the local structure of the material with composition...|$|R

5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from <b>glass</b> <b>with</b> great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green volcanic <b>glass</b> <b>with</b> a trachytic {{matrix of}} plagioclase. About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E

The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed <b>glass)</b> <b>with</b> a bunch of grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a <b>glass</b> <b>with</b> a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate <b>glass.</b> <b>With</b> the displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.|$|E

The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E

Starting in the late Middle Ages, {{pitchblende}} was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered <b>glass</b> <b>with</b> chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
