5000|$|Having {{been used}} as a folk remedy for centuries, studies in the 1950s {{revealed}} that the rosy periwinkle Catharanthus roseus contained 70 alkaloids, many of which are biologically active. While initial studies for its use in diabetes mellitus were disappointing, the discovery that it caused myelosuppression (decreased activity of the bone marrow) led to its study in mice with leukemia, whose lifespan was prolonged by the use of a vinca preparation. Treatment of the <b>ground</b> <b>plant</b> with Skelly-B defatting agent and an acid benzene extract led to a fraction termed [...] "fraction A". This fraction was further treated with aluminium oxide, chromatography, trichloromethane, benz-dichloromethane, and separation by pH to yield vincristine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cannabis}} oil {{is a product}} based in a cooking oil that has been infused with cannabinoids by mixing cannabis with the heated oil. Ground cannabis plant material must be [...] "activated" [...] by the decarboxylation of (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol acid to (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) {{in order to become}} a psychoactive compound. This activation process can be done before or during the extraction into oil. A recent research study on the decarboxylation of THC performed by heating <b>ground</b> <b>plant</b> material found the highest yield of psychoactive THC to be achieved at 110 °C after 110 minutes. [...] Once this chemical conversion has been accomplished, the <b>ground</b> <b>plant</b> material must be solvated in a lipid solvent. Any cooking oil can be used for this. The activated plant material should be mixed with the oil vigorously for 5-10 minutes, and then the oil can be strained depending on preference. Activation and solvation can be accomplished simultaneously by mixing the plant material into pre-heated oil. Using a double boiler is a common method for this extraction technique as it keeps the temperature at a near-constant 100 °C. As a general rule, a higher temperature leads to a faster reaction rate and therefore requires less cooking time to be activated; it should be noted however that temperatures above 140 °C run the risk of beginning to vaporize compounds out of the mixture and temperatures below 90 °C may not lead to significant chemical conversion on a time scale of less than 24 hours. Cannabis cooking oils are available to medical cannabis patients in a variety of organic blends for various cooking applications.|$|E

5000|$|In {{what is now}} Maryland, Astrodon shared its paleoenvironment with dinosaurs such as coelurosaurians, the ankylosaurian Priconodon crassus, the nodosaurid Propanoplosaurus marylandicus, a {{possible}} basal ceratopsian, and potentially the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The fossil evidence points {{to the presence of}} the poorly known theropods Dryptosaurus medius, Capitalsaurus potens and Coelurus gracilis, and the well known large theropod Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, which likely were the apex predators in this region. Other vertebrates are not as well-known from the formation, but include freshwater sharks, lungfish, at least three genera of turtles including Glyptops caelatus and the crocodilian Goniopholis affinis. Evidence has shown that the multituberculate early mammal Argillomys marylandensis was also present. Trace fossils included theropod tracks known as Eubrontes and others assigned to the ichnogenus Pteraichinus belonging to a pterosaur, which demonstrate that these animals were present in abundance. The plant life known from this area included trees preserved as silicified wood, cycads like Dioonites, Ginkgo, the <b>ground</b> <b>plant</b> Selaginella and the giant redwood conifer Sequoia.|$|E
5000|$|According to Winifred Walker's All the Plants of the Bible, shecheleth {{is a form}} of rock rose, Cistus ladaniferus var. Cistus creticus, which {{produces}} a resin called labdanum. [...] This sweet spicy ingredient has been used in perfumes and incense for thousands of years and grows profusely in the Middle East, specifically in Israel and Palestine. The rock rose is a bush, not a tree (the Talmud states that onycha comes from a <b>ground</b> <b>plant</b> and not a tree) which bears flowers widely noted for the markings upon its petals resembling human fingernails. Labdanum is the gray-black resin that exudes from the branches of the rock rose bush. Labdanum, after it matures, becomes black and is referred to as black amber or black balsam. Gill states that the word [...] "shecheleth is certainly related to the Hebrew word shechor (black)," [...] denoting the color of the shecheleth used in the ketoret formula. Onycha is a play on the word onyx which was a gem. The onyx most esteemed by the ancients was the black gem. The Hebrew word for onyx was shoham and “Braun traces shoham to the Arabic sachma,'blackness:' 'Of such a color,' says he, 'are the Arabian onyxes, which have a black ground-color.' This agrees essentially with Charles William King's remarks [...] 'The Arabian species,' he says, 'were formed of black or blue strata.” [...] The rock rose also has an inseparable identification with rocks because its existence depends upon its roots anchoring among them in areas where no other foliage is able to grow. After labdanum became hard it may have been put through another process causing it to emulate even more of the [...] "beautiful" [...] attributes of the onyx or to refine it, [...] "that it be pleasant." [...] When used in sacred rites resins were often steeped in wine to, among other things, increase their fragrance.|$|E
