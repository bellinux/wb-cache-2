Time stamping services are typically divided into schemes which rely on unconditionally trusted Time Stamping Authorities (TSAs) and schemes which do not, namely {{the so called}} linking schemes. The proposed architecture relies on a multi-tier structure. The middle-tier exposes <b>digital</b> time <b>stamping</b> functions behind a unified interface. The specific scheme implemented in the back-end (i. e. trusted TSA or linking scheme) is hidden to the clients. Services are made available via Web services technology.

40|$|Payment {{systems are}} {{undergoing}} rapid and fundamental changes stimulated largely by technological progress especially distributed network technology and real-time processing. Internet and e-commerce {{will have a}} major impact on payment systems in the future. User demands and competition will speed up developments. Payment systems will move from conventions that were originally paper-based to truly network-based solutions. This paper presents a solution – E-Settlement – for improving interbank settlement systems. It is based on a decentralised approach to be fully integrated with the banks’ payment systems. The basic idea is that central bank money, the settlement cover, is transferred as an encrypted <b>digital</b> <b>stamp</b> as part of the interbank payment message. The future payment systems would in this model operate close to the Internet/e-mail concept by sending payment messages directly from the sending bank’s account/payment server to the system of the receiving bank with immediate final interbank settlement without intervening centralised processing. Payment systems would become more efficient and faster and the overall structure would be come straightforward. The E-Settlement and network-based system concept could be applied with major benefits for correspondent banking, ACH and RTGS processing environments. In order to assess this novel idea the Bank of Finland built a prototype of the E-Settlement model. It consist of a group of emulated banks sending payments to each other via a TCP/IP network under the control of a central bank as the liquidity provider and an administration site monitoring the system security. This paper contains an introduction to network-based payment systems and E-Settlement, the specifications of the E-Settlement model and the description, results and experiences of the actual E-Settlement prototype. network-based payment systems; settlement systems; interbank settlement; payment system integration...|$|E

The main objective of this project is {{to improve the quality of}} the core project documentation that serves for supporting the construction works in Spain and to facilitate an efficient exchange of information between the stakeholders in the Spanish Architectural Engineering and Construction sector, in particular their relationship with the Professional Associations and Spanish control public bodies. Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of XBRL taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, <b>digital</b> <b>stamping,</b> delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities. Our proposal can be extended to other countries, particularly in Europe, since regulations are becoming similar in all EU countries. The potential for spin-off technology utilization is also significant in the areas of insurance, inspection chamber, digital reporting and project management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} {{availability}} questions that arise when <b>digital</b> time <b>stamps</b> {{are used for}} preserving the evidentiary value of electronic documents. We analyze the time-stamping protocols known to date and point out some weaknesses {{that have not been}} addressed so far in scientific literature. Without addressing and solving them, any advantage of the linkage-based protocols over the hash-and-sign time-stamping would be questionable. We present several new techniques and protocols for improving the availability of both the hash-and-sign and the linkage-based time-stamping services. We introduce fault-tolerant linking as a new concept to neutralize fault-sensitivity as the main weakness of linkage-based time-stamping. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{cryptographic}} hash function {{has an important}} role in cryptography to achieve certain security goals such as authenticity, digital signatures, <b>digital</b> time <b>stamping,</b> and entity authentication. They are also strongly related to other important cryptographic tools such as block ciphers and pseudorandom functions. Due to the previous merits we present a proposal for a new secure hash algorithm based on the combination of some functions of SHA- 256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) -with its message expansion modification- and MD 5 (Message Digest 5) based on double-Davis-Mayer scheme to overcome the weakness existing in these functions. The proposal hash algorithm has been designed to satisfy the different levels of enhanced security and to resist the advanced hash attacks by increasing the complexity degree of the proposed hash algorithm. The security analysis of the proposed hash algorithm is compared to SHA 256 and gives more security and highly acceptable results as shown in our security results and discussions...|$|R

40|$|Time stamps in videos play an {{important}} role in video clustering and retrieval. For <b>digital</b> camcorders, time <b>stamp</b> is separately stored in the video stream using some specific bytes, thus it can be accessed easily. However, for analog camcorders, time stamp is superimposed on the video frame and mixed into the video data, thus we cannot extract it directly. Furthermore, extraction of time stamp in home videos is much harder than that of ordinary videotext due to the poor quality of the video. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient time stamp detection and recognition system for analog home videos. To deal with the special difficulties, we propose two approaches, which can remarkably improve the overall system performance. The final outputs are shot boundaries with the corresponding time indices, which are detected and recognized by the proposed system. These results can be used as metadata for further video processing...|$|R

40|$|Cryptographic hash {{functions}} {{are an important}} tool in cryptography to achieve certain security goals such as authenticity, digital signatures, <b>digital</b> time <b>stamping,</b> and entity authentication. They are also strongly related to other important cryptographic tools such as block ciphers and pseudorandom functions. The standard and widely used hash functions such as MD 5 and SHA- 1 follow the design principle of Merkle-Damgard iterated hash function construction which was presented independently by Ivan Damgard and Ralph Merkle at Crypto' 89. It has been established that neither these hash functions nor the Merkle-Damgard construction itself meet certain security requirements. This thesis aims to study the attacks on this popular construction and propose schemes that offer more resistance against these attacks as well as investigating alternative approaches to the Merkle-Damgard style of designing hash functions. This thesis aims at analysing {{the security of the}} standard hash function Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption Algorithm (CAVE) used for authentication and key-derivation in the second generation (2 G) North American IS- 41 mobile phone system. In addition, this thesis studies the analysis issues of message authentication codes (MACs) designed using hash functions. With the aim to propose some efficient and secure MAC schemes based on hash functions. This thesis works on three aspects of hash functions: design, cryptanalysis and applications with the following significant contributions: * Proposes a family of variants to the Damgard-Merkle construction called 3 CG for better protection against specific and generic attacks. Analysis of the linear variant of 3 CG called 3 C is presented including its resistance to some of the known attacks on hash functions. * Improves the known cryptanalytical techniques to attack 3 C and some other similar designs including a linear variant of GOST, a Russian standard hash function. * Proposes a completely novel approach called Iterated Halving, alternative to the standard block iterated hash function construction. * Analyses provably secure HMAC and NMAC message authentication codes (MACs) based on weaker assumptions than stated in their proofs of security. Proposes an efficient variant for NMAC called NMAC- 1 to authenticate short messages. Proposes a variant for NMAC called M-NMAC which offers better protection against the complete key-recovery attacks than NMAC. As well it is shown that M-NMAC with hash functions also resists side-channel attacks against which HMAC and NMAC are vulnerable. Proposes a new MAC scheme called O-NMAC based on hash functions using just one secret key. * Improves the open cryptanalysis of the CAVE algorithm. * Analyses the security and legal implications of the latest collision attacks on the widely used MD 5 and SHA- 1 hash functions...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{steganography}} {{is gaining}} wide acceptance {{in the world}} of electronic copyright <b>stamping.</b> <b>Digital</b> media that are easy to steal, such as graphics, photos and audio files, are being tagged with both visible and invisible copyright stamp known as a digital watermark. However, these same methodologies are also used to hide communications between actors in criminal or covert activities. An inherent difficulty in developing steganography attacks is overcoming the variety of methods for hiding a message and the multitude of choices of available media. The steganalyst cannot create an attack until the hidden content method appears. When a message is visually transmitted in a non-textual format (i. e., in an image) it is referred to as a semagram. Semagrams are a subset of steganography and are relatively easy to create. However, detecting a hidden message in an image-based semagram is more difficult than detecting digital modifications to an image 2 ̆ 7 s structure. The trend in steganography is a decrease in detectable digital traces, and a move toward semagrams. This research outlines the creation of a novel, computer-based application, designed to detect the likely presence of a Morse Code based semagram message in an image. This application capitalizes on the adaptability and learning capabilities of various artificial neural network (NN) architectures, most notably hierarchical architectures. Four NN architectures [feed-forward Back-Propagation NN (BPNN), Self organizing Map (SOM), Neural Abstraction Pyramid (NAP), and a Hybrid Custom Network (HCN) ] were tested for applicability to this domain with the best performing one being the HCN. Each NN was given a baseline set of training images (quantity based on NN architecture) then test images were presented, (each test set having 3, 337 images). There were 36 levels of testing. Each subsequent test set representing an increase in complexity over the previous one. In the end, the HCN proved to be the NN of choice from among the four tested. The final HCN implementation was the only network able to successfully perform against all 36 levels. Additionally, the HCN, while only being trained on the base Morse Code images, successfully detected images in the 9 test sets of Morse Code isomorphs...|$|R
40|$|This chapter, co-written by Susan Johanknecht and Katharine Meynell was {{commissioned}} for the publication 'The Book is A - Live!' This book was produced to document {{and respond to}} the conference ‘Book Live!’ International Symposium held in June 2012, at South Bank University. It was peer reviewed by Emmanuelle Waekerle, Bookroom, University of the Creative Arts and Richard-Sawdon-Smith, South Bank University, the institutions funding the event and publication. Collaborative practice and ‘transforming’ or ‘expanding’ of the page in relation to the book are key themes of my research. 'The Book is A - Live!' 2013 book publication was published by RGAP, distributed by Cornerhouse and DAP. Abstract Poetry of Unknown Words explores an expanded notion of the book and the archive socially culturally and politically. Using a number of libraries & archives we reference key works in a variety of technologies moving between the digital, letterpress and hand made mark. Responding to existing artifacts, making new works, we examine issues of material values and shifting meanings. This interest in the artifact itself, rather than the signifying text/image alone, gives us the opportunity to understand historical context through material means. Work aware of it’s history allows “a re-emergence of (that) history through detail” to not replicate or eradicate history but to keep the origins as visible traces. Taking the format of Iliazd La Poesie de mots inconnus and applying it to a new series of works which in turn reference extant works by women makers and thinkers. Sections pay particular attention to technologies, their scientific and artistic applications thus reworking ‘thingness’. If the medium is also the message, and the site and location carry additional meaning, these must be accounted for in a re-rendering – the physical qualities of the paper, ink or fustiness of the rare books collection –and being mindful of that which is left out. Implicit in this is our acknowledgement of the untranslatable, the lost nuances, and the stains collected by the shifting of context within a new language or medium. In both translation and transcription there are taints, residues and colouring, both lost from the original, and acquired in re-forming a work in a new guise, with new technologies. In considering the difference between translation and transcription it is useful to remember that one is notionally linguistic, and the other moves between modes of expression such as in music or in painting, or between movement and reenactment. What we understand we are doing in Poetry of Unknown Words incorporates both. For us these are open and moveable concepts – responsive and pragmatic. The literary section shown at the Poetry Library, South Bank (March–May 2012) included: HD's notes on thought and vision: taking the jellyfish as an erotic symbol of creative force, which we are using in combination with an archivist's account. Emmy Hennings' Dada performance writing and puppetry: reworked through ‘Google translatate’ keeping the spirit of non-sense for that era. Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons: transcribed from words to buttons, uses text to generate system and order. Scanned buttons represent words, set out as 'Type' in InDesign leading to a new typography and code. Valerie Solanas' SCUM Manifesto: we consider the form of manifesto as a work, which linguistically proclaims a struggle against oppressive forces. Using Chicago type designed by Susan Kare and on the verso, a loss of information without uploaded font. Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Women: using letterpress and random inking, presents her contents page as abstract with <b>digital</b> facsimile <b>stamp.</b> These processes of remaking engage with historical distance and new approaches to what the book can be. We see this chapter within 'The Book is A - Live!' as part of our ongoing 'process notes' - being reflections and documentation of our Poetry of Unknown Words project...|$|R
