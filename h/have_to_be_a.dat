5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided {{that he could make}} money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E

25|$|More {{complicated}} lower subsets are ideals, {{which have}} the additional property that each two of their elements have an upper bound within the ideal. Their duals are given by filters. A related concept {{is that of a}} directed subset, which like an ideal contains upper bounds of finite subsets, but does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lower set. Furthermore, it is often generalized to preordered sets.|$|E
25|$|Each router has an {{identifier}}, customarily {{written in}} the dotted decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, it does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.|$|E

25|$|Order theory {{captures the}} intuition of orders that arises from such {{examples}} {{in a general}} setting. This is achieved by specifying properties that a relation ≤ must <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mathematical order. This more abstract approach makes much sense, because one can derive numerous theorems in the general setting, without focusing {{on the details of}} any particular order. These insights can then be readily transferred to many less abstract applications.|$|E
25|$|Bullshit {{does not}} {{necessarily}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete fabrication. While a lie is related by a speaker who believes what is said is false, bullshit is offered by a speaker who does not care whether what is said is true because the speaker {{is more concerned with}} giving the hearer some impression. Thus bullshit may be either true or false, but demonstrates a lack of concern for the truth which is likely to lead to falsehoods.|$|E

25|$|Angles {{formed by}} two rays {{lie in a}} plane, but this plane does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Euclidean plane. Angles are also formed by the {{intersection}} of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces. These are called dihedral angles. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays {{at the point of}} intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the spherical angle formed by two great circles on a sphere is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that about 3% of all promotions are underpromotions. The frequency of truly significant underpromotions is, however, less than this. Note that the promoted piece does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> piece that {{has previously been}} captured. A player may promote to any piece they wish, {{regardless of whether or}} not such a piece has been captured. In theory, a player could have nine queens, ten knights, ten bishops or ten rooks, though these are highly improbable scenarios. Some chess sets come with an extra queen of each color to use for promoted pawns. If an extra queen is unavailable, it is often represented by an upside-down rook instead.|$|E
25|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{over how the}} Festival was to be managed after the retirement of Wolfgang Wagner {{at the end of}} August 2008. In 2001, the Festival's 21-member board of directors had voted for his daughter, Eva Wagner-Pasquier, to succeed him. Wolfgang Wagner, however, proposed to hand control over to his second wife, Gudrun, and their daughter Katharina. Gudrun died in 2007. No successor was named at that time, but it was speculated that Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina would eventually be named as joint directors of the festival. Directors have stated that preference will be given to descendants of Richard Wagner, and that a non-descendant would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> clearly better candidate.|$|E
