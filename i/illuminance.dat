25|$|The lux (lx) is this SI {{unit for}} <b>illuminance,</b> {{that is the}} amount of light that {{illuminates}} a surface (the road, {{in the case of a}} bike light) per unit area at a given point, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. Some manufacturers indicate the <b>illuminance</b> their front lights provide to the road at a point located a standard distance right in front of the bicycle.|$|E
25|$|In optical radiometry, {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} {{measuring}} heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., <b>illuminance</b> meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in solar irradiance measurements.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{principles}} of focal ratio are always the same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the focal ratio varies the focal-plane <b>illuminance</b> (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) {{is a function of}} absolute aperture area only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} lighting for pedestrians and how {{investigation of}} reassurance might lead toward {{an understanding of}} the right amount of light. A conventional approach is to evaluate reassurance after dark under road lighting of different illuminance: this tends to show the trivial result that higher <b>illuminances</b> enhance reassurance, and that alone does not enable an optimum light level to be identified. One reason is that the category rating procedure widely used is prone to stimulus range bias; experimental results are presented that demonstrate stimulus range bias in reassurance evaluations. This article also recommends alternative methods for future research. One such method is the day–dark rating approach, which does not tend toward ever higher <b>illuminances,</b> and results are presented of two studies using this method...|$|R

40|$|In {{lighting}} {{calculations and}} simulations, the emission {{of a light}} source is conventionally modeled using the far-field luminous intensity distribution. However, the advent of luminaires including large arrays of LEDs with focusing optics creating narrow beams has made the traditional limiting photometric distance to reach far-field conditions less easy to determine. Furthermore, even correct far-field data can lead to erroneous predictions when <b>illuminances</b> are determined on a task surface which is positioned within the near-field region. A near-field representation could overcome these problems, but experimental validation for such LED arrays is lacking. This paper reports on near-field and far-field laboratory experiments using an array of two and five narrow-beam LEDs. A near-field approach makes discussions to determine the far-field photometric distance superfluous and leads to correct <b>illuminances</b> at any location {{with respect to the}} array, irrespective of the dimensions of the array and the beam angle of the individual components. Introducing the near-field representation of light sources in lighting design offers more accurate predictions when luminaires based on LED arrays with focusing optics are involved. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|In {{this mode}} the diode is often reverse biased (with the cathode driven {{positive}} {{with respect to}} the anode). [...] This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the dark current without much change in the photocurrent. For a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the <b>illuminance</b> (and to the irradiance).|$|E
2500|$|If two cameras of {{different}} format sizes and focal lengths {{have the same}} angle of view, and the same aperture area, they gather {{the same amount of}} light from the scene.

50|$|Useful {{daylight}} <b>illuminance</b> {{focuses on}} the direct sunlight that falls into a space. The useful daylight <b>illuminance</b> calculation is based on three factors—the percentage of time a point is below, between, or above an <b>illuminance</b> value.
