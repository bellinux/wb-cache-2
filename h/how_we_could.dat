5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E

25|$|Dennett's {{thesis is}} that our modern {{understanding}} of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts {{with a description of}} the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see the light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E

25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E
25|$|The {{input-output}} equations {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there a big difference between the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E

Recalling Unwin's radio and television performances, Anderson thought that the self-made language would suit the character of an eccentric undercover operative, and could produce humour if demonstrated to have a confusing effect on enemies. He elaborated, [...] "As far as I was concerned, Stanley came first and then the idea had to accommodate him.

[...] When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the project {{was transferred to the}} Xbox console and the game's multiplayer mode was redesigned for online play. Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics [...] "just couldn't handle it." [...] Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware [...] "pretty hard", the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the Xbox 360.

Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution".

[...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes.

2500|$|Veteran animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston were {{assigned}} as directing animators {{over the three}} good fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Walt Disney urged for the fairies to be more homogeneous, which Thomas and Johnston objected to, with Thomas stating they [...] "thought 'that's {{not going to be}} any fun'.

[...] John Lounsbery would animate the [...] "Skumps" [...] sequence between Kings Hubert and Stefan. Chuck Jones, known for his work as an animation director with Warner Bros. Cartoons, was employed on the film for four months during its early conceptual stages when Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed when it was anticipated that 3-D film would replace animation as a box office draw. Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on Sleeping Beauty, which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation.|$|E

In his memoirs Time and Chance, Callaghan wrote that introducing the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill had been an unwelcome task but {{that he did not}} regret it. He claimed the Asians had [...] "discovered a loophole" [...] and he told a BBC interviewer: [...] "Public opinion in this country was extremely agitated, and the consideration that was in my mind was <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> preserve a proper sense of order in this country and, at the same time, do justice to these people—I had to balance both considerations".

2500|$|Britain's {{economic}} {{weakness and}} {{its dependence on}} the financial support of the United States (Britain had received a large American loan in 1946 and the Marshall Plan began in mid-1947), left him little alternative but to yield to American pressure over Palestine policy. At the reconvened London Conference in January 1947, the Jewish negotiators were only prepared to accept partition and the Arab negotiators only a unitary state (which would automatically have had an Arab majority). Neither would accept limited autonomy under British rule. When no agreement could be reached, Bevin threatened to hand the problem over to the United Nations. The threat failed to move either side, the Jewish representatives because they believed that Bevin was bluffing and the Arabs because they believed that their cause would prevail before the General Assembly. Bevin accordingly {{announced that he would}} [...] "ask the UN to take the Palestine question into consideration." [...] A week later, the strategic logic of Britain retaining a presence in Palestine was removed when the intention to withdraw from India in August of that year was announced. The decision to allow the United Nations to dictate the future of Palestine was formalised by the Attlee government's public declaration in February 1947 that Britain's Mandate in Palestine had become [...] "unworkable." [...] Of the UN partition plan which resulted, Bevin commented: [...] "The majority proposal is so manifestly unjust to the Arabs {{that it is difficult to}} see <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> reconcile it with our conscience." [...] During the remainder of the Mandate, fighting between the Jewish and Arab communities intensified. The end of the Mandate and Britain's final withdrawal from Palestine was marked by the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when five Arab states intervened in the inter-communal fighting. [...] The Arab armies were led by the state with that position which was most effective, Jordan, whose military forces were trained and led by British officers. The war ended with Israel, in addition to the territory assigned by the UN for the creation of a Jewish state, also in control of much of the Mandate territory which had been assigned by the UN for the creation of an Arab state. The remainder was divided between Jordan and Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of, overwhelmingly Arab, civilians had become displaced.|$|E
