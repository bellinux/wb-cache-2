25|$|The typical rather narrow lakes {{with a long}} {{north to}} south extent, which are very common <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> further north, are lacking in the province. The largest lake, Ivösjön in the north-east, has {{similarities}} with the lakes further north, but has a different shape. All other lakes tends to be round, oval or of more complex shape and also lacking any specific cardinal direction. Ringsjön, {{in the middle of}} the province, is the largest of such lakes.|$|E

25|$|As expected, {{the first}} three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring {{contests}} featuring stellar goaltending {{at both ends of}} the ice. Niittymaki, however, who was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> better than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1–0 shutout victory in Game 1. He was even better in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2–1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia where the next three games—if necessary—would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11–0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2–1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3–0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.|$|E
25|$|The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> in {{the regular}} season—finishing 53–29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets—but it was another {{successful}} year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, {{but in the end}} the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E

5000|$|Barry Hall {{was also}} {{seen to be}} {{suffering}} mental health problems, admitting he had been suffering depression throughout his AFL career and that he [...] "had nothing {{to get out of}} bed for" [...] (Hall, 2011). Simon Hogan was another player who came out about their depression and had contemplated killing himself during his career. Lance Picioane who played for Adelaide, Hawthorn and the Kangaroos said how he struggled to understand that he was actually suffering from depression and that it wasn't him <b>just</b> feeling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> down.|$|R

It was an offer I couldn't refuse. But in playing terms it was a mistake. He is still playing for Ajax at a really good level." [...] On the financial report, Manchester United announced the fee was £15.3 million.|$|R

500|$|In the Los Angeles Times, music {{journalist}} Randall Roberts {{was critical}} of the nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards, particularly for the Album of the Year category, noting the exclusion of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, [...] "the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record", as a snub in favor of nominating less substantial albums. West, who was vocal in his displeasure with past award snubs, responded onstage during a concert on the Watch the Throne Tour, saying [...] "That's my fault for dropping Watch the Throne and Dark Fantasy the same year. I should've just spaced it out, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song, {{along with}} other tracks on Fallen Empires, finds Snow Patrol venturing into dance territory.

He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more twisted and interesting.

500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] a B+ rating, calling its premise and {{structure}} [...] "reminiscent of classic Simpsons style" [...] and writing that the episode [...] "is effective because it doesn't just divide {{the kids and}} the parents: it sets them against one another." [...] He added that while the main plot [...] "loses some momentum at the conclusion, [...] keeps from sinking thanks to a steady stream of great lines going throughout." [...] Kowan concluded his review by stating that he was [...] "perfectly happy to laugh throughout an episode as a fan, even though as a critic [...] might occasionally want <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more." ...|$|E

We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off and go into the Hudson. But he <b>just</b> rose <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom! He disappears into the Trade Center." ...|$|R
500|$|... "When in Rome", {{the opening}} track on Why Should the Fire Die?, {{was chosen as}} the album's only single. The song's title alludes to the American proverb [...] "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", [...] and Chris Thile, the song's author, said [...] "The idea behind the song– and I do love it! - is if there is {{something}} better, it's worth leaning towards <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> because you'll have a great time here regardless." [...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica and Lisa Origliasso {{together}} with Shelly Peiken and Greg Wells – Wells also produced the track. The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we went through that a little bit when things started getting full on with us. It went from one extreme, where no one knew who we were, to the complete opposite".|$|E

Jones auditioned without knowing what X-Men character he was up for, saying he auditioned because it was a superhero that fit his biotype: [...] "I've got red hair and freckles, I'm not gonna be Batman, Robin or Spider-Man". The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> differently, you know, when I can." [...] As Jones suffers from acrophobia, using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E

500|$|Lead artist Arnold Tsang recounted {{that the}} body size, {{as well as the}} running pose of a character, were both {{characteristics}} that were considered during character design in order to make each one identifiable. Tracer, for instance, has a wild running animation, in addition to a unique trail of blue light, which follows behind her. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku commented that her jump animation appears [...] "hyper-exaggerated and kinda goofy looking". This {{is a result of the}} smear frame, combined with squash and stretch animation techniques, implemented in Overwatch. With respect to Tracer, Blizzard senior animator David Gibson pointed out frames from her jump animation, stating, [...] "we're trying to just push it a little further than normal. Something as simple as stretching the torso out, having her hang [...] <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> longer than normal. Really squashing her when she lands. Her head is tucking in. Everything is supporting this basic principle of squash and stretch in a gameplay asset." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{starting}} for {{an injured}} John David Booty in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom mouthguard that featured {{the colors of}} the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage. It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It’s <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it’s all for the best." [...] Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed.

[...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E
