40|$|Abstract. The use of {{a spatial}} index {{followed}} by an exact <b>geometry</b> <b>check</b> (a filter/refine strategy) is commonly applied in spatial database management systems. Its efficiency in selecting a small subset of geographic features from a large feature collection is undebatable. But {{there is a problem}} with the strategy: For a pure overlap test in the filter phase, the filter/refine strategy gets less optimal as the query window grows larger. Loosely speaken, the reason for this is that the candidates falling completely within the area of the query window are not included in the result although a decision can be made from the filter phase. We argue that an overlap test followed by an inside test will reduce the query costs from quadratic to linear as the query window doubles in north- and east dimension. A study on the Land-use resource data set in Norway (DMK) gives an indication of this. ...|$|E

The paper describes attempts to predict the structure of Pto encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase to understand the mechanism and function. A three-dimensional model based on the crystal structure of effect protein Avr ptob complexed with Kinase Pto and bacterial effector protein Avrpto was generated using Modeller 9 v 7. We adopted different modelling approaches for our study, Intialy, we generated a model based on a single template protein and then a model based on multiple templates. The models generated through these approaches were further assessed with ANOLEA energy assessment, Ram Page server and PROCHECK for stereochemistry and <b>geometry</b> <b>check.</b> Comparative analysis suggested that the model generated {{was better than the}} templates.

DEM codes simulate billions of small particles that {{interact with each}} other primarily through collisions. Different to state-of-the-art codes, we rely on triangulated non-spherical particles. This is computationally demanding, and we thus devise an asynchronous data exchange communication technique using MPI (Message Passing Interface) on manycore supercomputers, we discuss possible solutions to handle ghost particles that overlap multiple subdomains. At the compute node level, shared memory parallelism as well as vectorised SIMD executions are studied.

40|$|We {{describe}} a fluctuating volume [...] current formulation of electromagnetic fluctuations that extends our recent work on heat exchange and Casimir interactions between arbitrarily shaped homogeneous bodies [Phys. Rev. B. 88, 054305] to situations involving incandescence and luminescence problems, including thermal radiation, heat transfer, Casimir forces, spontaneous emission, fluorescence, and Raman scattering, in inhomogeneous media. Unlike previous scattering formulations based on field and/or surface unknowns, our work exploits powerful techniques from the volume [...] integral equation (VIE) method, in which electromagnetic scattering {{is described in}} terms of volumetric, current unknowns throughout the bodies. The resulting trace formulas (boxed equations) involve products of well-studied VIE matrices and describe power and momentum transfer between objects with spatially varying material properties and fluctuation characteristics. We demonstrate that thanks to the low-rank properties of the associatedmatrices, these formulas are susceptible to fast-trace computations based on iterative methods, making practical calculations tractable.

Existen diferentes hipótesis sobre la autoría de las trazas para la nueva iglesia, pero una de las más sólidas señala a Jerónimo Quijano como posible tracista (Gutiérrez-Cortines 1989 pp. 299 - 315). Las obras comenzaron pocos años antes de 1540 y se alargaron durante los siglos siguientes, en varias fases y con diferentes maestros cantero. [ENG] The presbytery {{of the church of}} El Salvador of Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia) is covered by a mid- 16 th century trellis vault, built as a mesh of curved ribs, filled with coffers. Vandelvira's {{manuscript}} (ca. 1585) explains a number of constructive solutions for this kind of vaults where ribs are defined by spherical surface spanning a rectangular area. However, a number of studies show that many trellis vaults are not really spherical (Palacios [1990] 2003 pp. 302 - 321; Bravo 2009; Bravo 2011). Taking this into account, Bravo (2011) puts forward a geometrical classification. In this paper we shall present a three-dimensional survey of this trellis vault. We have analyzed its <b>geometry,</b> <b>checking</b> it is not a spherical surface and, furthermore, it cannot be included in any type of classification posited in previous studies.

30|$|Having {{identified}} a suitable data structure, the following general procedure is proposed to perform spatial search: First, the basic octree data structure representing the immersed geometry is created. Then, every {{element of the}} background mesh is assigned with pointers to the corresponding leaf cells it intersects with. Based on this link of information from both domains, the intersection testing between the immersed geometry and the background mesh can be eased significantly. Instead of checking every element of the background mesh against each element of the immersed <b>geometry,</b> one <b>checks</b> for a given background element just a small subset of all geometry elements for potential intersections.

Algorithms based on visual appearance are becoming popular to detect locations already visited, {{also known as}} loop closures, because cameras are easily available and provide rich scene detail. These algorithms typically result in pairs of images considered depicting the same location. To avoid mismatches, most of them rely on epipolar <b>geometry</b> to <b>check</b> spatial consistency.

While competition with other DNA-binding factors and action of chromatin remodeling enzymes significantly affect nucleosome formation in vivo, nucleosome positions in vitro are determined by steric exclusion and sequence alone.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} region-of-interest (ROI) {{tracking}} in video sequences. The {{goal is to}} determine in successive frames the region which best matches, {{in terms of a}} similarity measure, an ROI defined in a reference frame. Two aspects of a similarity measure between a reference region and a candidate region can be distinguished: radiometry which checks if the regions have similar colors and <b>geometry</b> which <b>checks</b> if these colors appear at the same location in the regions. Measures based solely on radiometry include distances between probability density functions (PDF) of color. The absence of geometric constraint increases the number of potential matches. A soft geometric constraint can be added to a PDF-based measure by enriching the color information with location, thus increasing the dimension of the domain of definition of the PDFs. However, high-dimensional PDF estimation is not trivial. Instead, we propose to compute the Kullback-Leibler distance between high-dimensional PDFs without explicitly estimating the PDFs. The distance is expressed directly from the samples using the k-th nearest neighbor framework. Tracking experiments were performed on several standard sequences. 1...|$|R
