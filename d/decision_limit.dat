Estonian biochemistry doctors explained that the verdict was untimely {{and that there was no}} reliable method to distinguish artificial HGH from natural background hormone. Veerpalu appealed the test result to the FIS.The FIS antidoping commission found Veerpalu guilty and extended his ban to three years, due to Veerpalu's team's lack of co-operation with FIS. A group of top Estonian biochemists investigated the matter and insist Veerpalu was a false positive. The Court of Arbitration for Sport acquitted Veerpalu, lifted his doping ban and ordered the FIS to pay a part of Veerpalu's court costs on 25 March 2013. The court stated [...] "that there are many factors in this case which tend to indicate that the Athlete did in fact himself administer exogenous hGH" [...] but found that the <b>decision</b> <b>limit,</b> the threshold for considering the result an adverse analytical finding, was not sufficiently reliable to uphold the doping conviction.

40|$|The Jaffe and enzymatic {{methods are}} the two most common methods for {{measuring}} serum creatinine. The Jaffe method is less expensive than the enzymatic method but is also more susceptible to interferences. Interferences can lead to misdiagnosis but interferences may vary by patient population. The overall risk associated with the Jaffe method depends on the probability of misclassification and the consequences of misclassification. This study assessed the risk associated with the Jaffe method in an outpatient population. We analyzed the discordance rate in the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine measurements obtained by the Jaffe and enzymatic method. Method comparison and risk analysis. Five hundred twenty-nine eGFRs obtained by the Jaffe and enzymatic method were compared at four clinical decision limits. We determined the probability of discordance and the consequence of misclassification at each <b>decision</b> <b>limit</b> to evaluate the overall risk. We obtained 529 paired observations. Of these, 29 (5. 5 %) were discordant with respect to one of the decision limits (i. e. 15, 30, 45 or 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). The magnitude of the differences (Jaffe result minus enzymatic result) were significant relative to analytical variation in 21 of the 29 (72 %) of the discordant results. The magnitude of the differences were not significant relative to biological variation. The risk associated with misclassification was greatest at the 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 <b>decision</b> <b>limit</b> because the probability of misclassification and the potential for adverse outcomes were greatest at that <b>decision</b> <b>limit.</b> The Jaffe method is subject to bias due to interfering substances (loss of analytical specificity). The risk of misclassification is greatest at the 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 decision limit; however, the risk of misclassification due to bias is much less than the risk of misclassification due to biological variation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the commutability of different matrices for the material used in an EQAS for tobramycin. Methods: Proficiency testing material (PTM) and patient samples containing tobramycin were prepared, collected, pooled, and distributed to participating laboratories for analysis. Low, medium, and high tobramycin concentrations in liquid human, liquid bovine and lyophilized bovine serum were tested in this study. The patient serum results of every laboratory were plotted against each of the other laboratories, and the distances of the PTM results to the patient serum regression line were calculated. For comparison, these distances were divided by the average within-laboratory standard deviation (SDwl) of the results reported in the official EQAS for tobramycin, resulting in a relative residual. The commutability <b>decision</b> <b>limit</b> was set at 3 SDwl. Results: With 10 laboratories participating in this study, 45 laboratory couples were formed.

Study design: Subjects: 404 male (mean age 23. 9 yrs, range 12 ‚Äì 37 yrs) and 94 female elite athletes (mean age 24. 5 yrs, range 18 ‚Äì 34 yrs) participated. Blood samples were collected according to World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines at various sporting events including 238 samples collected as part of the UK Anti- Doping Testing Programme. Laboratory analysis: IGF-I was measured by Siemens Immulite IGF-I assay and Immunotech A 15729 IGF-I IRMA. P-III-NP was measured by RIA-gnost P-III-P and the UniQ‚Ñ¢ PIIINP RIA. Statistical analysis: The GH- 2000 score <b>decision</b> <b>limits</b> were developed through the analysis of the elite athlete samples.

40|$|Background: Medical {{laboratories}} {{are required}} to participate in interlaboratory comparisons of the analyses they perform. The materials used in these comparisons need to be of sufficient quality so that the comparison provides {{a picture of the}} performances. One of the main characteristics of the testing material is commutability, which is the ability of a material to yield the same numerical relationships between results of measurements as those relationships obtained when the same procedures are applied to patient samples. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the commutability of 3 different matrices for the preparation of proficiency testing material (PTM) for the analysis of carbamazepine and valproic acid. Methods: Patient samples and PTM containing various concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid were collected, prepared, and shipped to different laboratories for analysis. Reported results for patient samples from each laboratory were plotted against results for patient samples of each of the other laboratories, and the corresponding regression line was calculated. The distance of results from PTM to the regression line is a measure for commutability. The distance is expressed as a multiple of the SDwl (average within-laboratory SD as calculated from external quality assessment scheme results) and referred to as relative residual. A commutability <b>decision</b> <b>limit</b> of 2 SDwl was set. Results: For carbamazepine and valproic acid, a total of 78 and 105 laboratory couples respectively could be formed. The number of relative residuals for liquid human serum outside the commutability <b>decision</b> <b>limit</b> was 1, 4, and 0 for low, medium, and high concentrations of carbamazepine, respectively and 3, 1, and 0 for low, medium, and high concentrations of valproic acid, respectively.

Since the 1980 s, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) has been proactive in establishing recommendations to clarify the true significance of the term ‚ÄòRIs, to select the appropriate reference population and statistically analyse the data. The C 28 -A 3 guideline published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and IFCC is still the most widely-used source of reference in this area. In recent years, protocols additional to the Guideline have been published by the IFCC, Committee on Reference Intervals and <b>Decision</b> <b>Limits</b> (C-RIDL), including all details of multicenter studies on RIs to meet the requirements in this area.
