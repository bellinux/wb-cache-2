An equestrian center was constructed on a newly purchased plot of land that allows for resident or <b>day</b> <b>equestrian</b> programs. These campers train with a knowledgeable instructional staff and learn horse care and riding techniques. The day camp program allows campers {{to participate in the}} same individual activities and the residential campers with afternoon group activities {{with the rest of the}} unit.|$|R

5000|$|Because the {{community}} is built on hills and meadows in this subalpine valley surrounded by high mountain peaks, it has been dubbed the [...] "Switzerland of California." [...] The area is most famous for its trout fishing, which occurs in many modes: trolling or still fishing the lakes from a boat, float tubing, or shore fishing the many lakes and streams. Bait fishing is productive and popular, as are spin casting with lures and fly fishing. Rush Creek below the Grant Lake Dam is restricted to catch-and-release. The lakes are cool in temperature but swimming is possible in the midsummer months. There is a swimming beach on June Lake near the Oh! Ridge campground. Speed boats are restricted on the smaller lakes but speedboats and personal watercraft are allowed on Grant Lake, making waterskiing and wakeboarding also possible. Hiking is a favorite pastime of the area: June Lake offers many trails that lead into the nearby back country of the Ansel Adams Wilderness Area. Most of the hikes, including Fern Lake, Reversed Peak, and Agnew Lake are strenuous and vertical, {{with the exception of}} the Parker Lake Trail which is a 2-mile hike that only climbs 400 feet in elevation. The Frontier Pack Train at Silver Lake offers <b>equestrian</b> <b>day</b> rides, as well as backcountry trips. [...] Ample opportunities exist for mountaineering, climbing and bouldering activities, mountain or road bicycling, off-highway vehicle travel, photography, bird watching, and more. In Autumn, an abundance of Aspen groves change from green to gold and red hues as winter approaches. Winter brings snow and cold temperatures, but there are many sunny days during which skiing, snowboarding, ice climbing, ice skating, snowmobiling, sledding and snow play, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and winter mountaineering and touring may be enjoyed.|$|E

He launched his biography-travelogue on 30 May 2013, {{the first of its kind}} title for a local celebrity. Titled Sanuk Jing Jing Na!, the book celebrates three decades in show business as well as his frequent travels to Thailand. The book launch/live gig was held at critically acclaimed club venue, Zouk, on 30 May, where he performed with premier Chinese rock band, Queen Inc, and Scorpion's musician-daughter, Zsa Zsa Scorpion.|$|R
500|$|Tan's first Paralympic {{event was}} the para-dressage Individual Championship Test (class Ia). Riders in this event are {{categorized}} into classes I to IV, those in class I {{having the most}} severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old chestnut gelding loaned to her named Nothing to Lose (also known as Harvey) at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre in Sha Tin, Tan scored 68.80% to claim the bronze medal behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic <b>equestrian</b> medal. Two <b>days</b> after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she performed to music with Nothing To Lose. The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as [...] "beyond our expectations", and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport.|$|R
40|$|Potential {{impact of}} motor {{laterality}} on equine performance {{has resulted in}} research into this aspect of equine behaviour. Many studies demonstrate that equids exhibit a preference for one side over the other {{but there is little}} evidence for directional biases. In modern <b>day</b> <b>equestrian</b> practices, equids are frequently required to manoeuvre around objects and laterality preferences may hinder or aid in this movement. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if horses consistently show a directional preference during a detour task. Twenty three horses of various breeds, ages and sexes were required to obtain a goal, a piece of carrot placed in a food bucket located behind a barrier. Horses were started from an initial position of 4 metres from the goal. Each horse was released simultaneously after observing the carrot being placed in the bucket. The time (s) taken from release to reach the goal was recorded where the subject was considered to have attained the goal once it touched the carrot. A maximum duration of 180 s was allowed to achieve the goal. Successful trials were followed by extension of the barrier-goal distance at 2 m intervals until a maximum length of 8 m was reached. If a horse failed to complete a trial within 180 seconds the trial was terminated. An additional study was conducted to determine whether horses consistently show a directional preference in their detour behaviour, regardless of distance to the goal. Five horses completed the task and there was no directional bias evident during the detour task χ 2 (1, N = 5) = 6. 4, p >. 05, with only one horse showing a directional bias to the left. The 4 m trial was successfully completed by 15 horses, 6 m trial was completed by 12 horses and the 8 m trial was completed by 12 horses. At 4 m there was a greater tendency to manoeuvre around the object to the left as opposed to the right χ 2 (1, N = 15) = 8. 07, p. 05 or the 8 m trial χ 2 (1, N = 12) = 1. 33, p >. 05. There were no significant differences in the solving times exhibited for each trial H 2 = 1. 37; P >. 05, performance did not improve during subsequent trials. The exhibition of lateral preference changed as the detour tasks became increasingly difficult. The fact that solving times did not change throughout subsequent tasks may imply learning during this task did not occur. The overall absence of laterality biases in this study could be attributed to lack of congruity between ability of subjects and experiment requirement. This finding has importance for future studies as it must be recognised that horses should not be required to perform task outside of their behavioural ability and repertoire. This finding can be applied within the equestrian practical context for example when training and preparing horses for work...|$|R
