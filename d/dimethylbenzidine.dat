40|$|With the {{development}} of technology for aerospace applications, new thermal insulation materials are required to be flexible and capable of surviving high heat flux. For instance, flexible insulation is needed for inflatable aerodynamic decelerators which are used to slow spacecraft for entry, descent and landing (EDL) operations. Polyimide aerogels have low density, high porosity, high surface area, and better mechanical properties than silica aerogels and can be made into flexible thin films, thus they are potential candidates for aerospace needs. The previously reported cross-linkers such as octa(aminophenyl) silsesquioxane (OAPS) and 1, 3, 5 -triaminophenoxybenzene (TAB) are either expensive or not commercially available. Here, we report the synthesis {{of a series of}} polyimide aerogels cross-linked using various commercially available poly(maleic anhydride) s, as seen in Figure 1. The amine end capped polyimide oligomers were made with 3, 3, 4, 4 -biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and diamine combinations of <b>dimethylbenzidine</b> (DMBZ) and 4, 4 -oxydianiline (ODA). The resulting aerogels have low density (0. 12 gcm 3 to 0. 16 gcm 3), high porosity (90) and high surface area (380 - 554 m 2 g). The effect of the different poly(maleic anhydride) cross-linkers and polyimide backbone structures on density, shrinkage, porosity, surface area, mechanical properties, moisture resistance and thermal properties will be discussed...|$|E
