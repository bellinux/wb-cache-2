5000|$|Thermoacoustic-induced {{oscillations}} {{have been}} observed for centuries. Glass blowers produced heat generated sound when blowing a hot bulb {{at the end of}} a cold narrow tube. This phenomenon also has been observed in cryogenic storage vessels, where oscillations are induced by the insertion of a hollow tube open at the bottom end in liquid helium, called Taconis oscillations, but the lack of heat removal system causes the temperature gradient to diminish and acoustic wave to weaken and then to stop completely. Byron Higgins made the first scientific observation of heat energy conversion into acoustical oscillations. He investigated the [...] "singing flame" [...] phenomena in a portion of a hydrogen flame in a tube with both ends open. Putnam and Dennis gave a survey of the related phenomena. Rijke introduced this phenomenon into a greater scale by using a heated wire screen to induce strong oscillations in a tube (the Rijke tube). Feldman mentioned in his related review that a convective air current through the pipe is the main inducer of this phenomenon. The oscillations are strongest when the screen is at one fourth of the tube length. Research performed by Sondhauss in 1850 is known to be the first to approximate the modern concept of thermoacoustic oscillation. Sondhauss experimentally investigated the oscillations related to glass blowers. Sondhauss observed that sound frequency and intensity depends on the length and volume of the bulb. Lord Rayleigh gave a qualitative explanation of the Sondhauss thermoacoustic oscillations phenomena, where he stated that producing any type of thermoacoustic oscillations needs to meet a criterion: [...] "If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation or taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged". This shows that he related thermoacoustics to the interplay of density variations and <b>heat</b> <b>injection.</b> The formal theoretical study of thermoacoustics started by Kramers in 1949 when he generalized the Kirchhoff theory of the attenuation of sound waves at constant temperature to the case of attenuation in the presence of a temperature gradient. Rott made a breakthrough in the study and modeling of thermodynamic phenomena by developing a successful linear theory. After that, the acoustical part of thermoacoustics was linked in a broad thermodynamic framework by Swift.|$|E

Specifically, <b>heat</b> <b>injection</b> into unsaturated geomaterials may be enhanced through convection of liquid water and water vapor as well as through latent heat energy transfer associated with water phase change. Further, heat retention in unsaturated geomaterials may be enhanced by the reduction in thermal conductivity associated with the thermally-induced drying expected during <b>heat</b> <b>injection.</b> Multi-fidelity numerical models are employed in this study to consider the roles of different mechanisms of heat transfer during a cycle of <b>heat</b> <b>injection</b> and ambient cooling. A conduction-only model was found to be useful for evaluating scalability issues and for the geometric design of a full-scale SBTES system installed in Golden, Colorado, but required a low soil thermal conductivity to match collected field data. A numerical model the incorporates convection in the liquid and vapor phases as well as phase change was validated using the results from a full-scale SBTES system installed in an unsaturated rock layer in San Diego, California.

However, there is little industry consensus on whether the heat cuts should take the form of: (1) mass rate reductions while maintaining the same high steam quality, or (2) steam quality decreases while keeping the same mass rate. Through the use of a commercial three-phase, three-dimensional simulator, the oil recovery schedules obtained when reducing the injected steam mass rate or quality with time were compared under a variety of reservoir and operating conditions. The simulator input was validated for Kern River Field conditions by using the guidelines developed by Johnson, et at. (1989) for four steamflood projects in Kern River.
