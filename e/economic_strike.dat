[...] However, the appellate court concluded that a temporary lockout based on the perceived threat of a strike could be justified only if a strike would impose an unusual economic hardship on the employer. Since none of the seven employers had demonstrated such hardship, the Court of Appeals ruled that the employers had committed a ULP.|$|E

When, the village was established is still unknown because of insufficient sources of knowledge. It is believed that the village originated during the period of the Unification Campaign by King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The King's main aim was to capture the Kathmadu Valley, but to win Kathmandu Valley over he had to defeat the Kirtipur Valley. So he brought a large number of troops from the west to attack the Kirtipur Valley. But he failed twice to take over city. After a heavy loss of troops and his 'right-hand' Kalu Pandey, he started to conquer the small states around Kirtipur to impose <b>economic</b> <b>strike.</b> During those days Charghare was unnamed and open plain land. Some people migrated or may be troops who has come for battle form western part who started to settlement with the four houses(चार घर) in village. Later pronounced of Char ghar(चार घर) changed into Charghare(चारघरे) which consequenced the name of village as Charghare. This assumption of data about origin the village and may be fallacious or wrong because data are not based on primary and secondary sources. It is supposed that the name and village was developed in the 19th century but this place has the historical story which is more than thousand years old. Name of this place was mentioned in Swasthanibratha katha as Jalpadevi, Jalandhar. According to the religious history of the temple here, Sati Devi's lower chin fell in this place.|$|E

Izydor Geisler purchased the estate in the early 1890 s in order to open there glass works (which he did in 1896). Natural resources (such as sand or clay) found in the estate constituted the foundation for the investment whereas natural produce supported the development of the plant. Not much attention was paid to agriculture. Geisler introduced innovative solutions in the relations between an industrial worker and an employer. By allocating a piece of land or food allowance to each laborer, and allowing them to breed cows in estate cow-houses, Geisler taught them how to provide for themselves and how to become independent from economic trends.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical {{conceptualization of the}} rise of alternative dispute resolution and its impact on American employment relations in the individual rights era. The idea of an industrial relations system advanced by Dunlop is no longer a plausible general approach for understanding American employment relations given the decline of organized labor. This article examines the question of whether a new individual employment rights-based system of employment relations has replaced it. The old New Deal industrial relations system was based on three pillars: labor contracts that provided a web of rules governing the workplace; <b>economic</b> <b>strikes,</b> actual or threatened, which provided the bargaining power for unions to negotiate these contracts; and labor arbitration, which provided the workplace dispute resolution mechanism for enforcing these contracts. The institutions of the new individual employment rights era can be seen as based on three parallel elements: individual employment rights provide the new web of rules; litigation, actual or threatened, provides the new source of bargaining power for employees; and alternative dispute resolution procedures provide the new workplace-based mechanism for enforcing individual rights. However, each of these elements contains substantial limitations, which makes the institutional structures of the new individual employment rights era something different from a new Dunlopian integrated system...|$|R

40|$|Although {{built around}} the same basic {{principles}} of exclusive representation of unit employees in favour of the majority union, the legislative systems regulating the collective bargaining process in Quebec and within the American federal jurisdiction present significant differences with respect to both the scope of permissible strike action and {{the course of a}} legal strike. A survey of the relevant discrepancies reveals that the legislative framework is more stringent in Quebec. The relative flexibility of the American system tends to work against the employer when one looks at the greater availability of the right to strike that it affords. This is not only the case with respect to so-called <b>economic</b> <b>strikes</b> over collective bargaining issues, but also with respect to different kinds of protest strikes. On the other hand, the American employeur seems to enjoy a relatively freer hand in taking different measures to counteract a strike, for instance, through the use of permanent replacements. A certain internal equilibrium may then be prevalent within each of the compared legal systems. The competitive situation of American and Canadian employers included within the same free trade zone is also dependent upon wider juridical and non juridical factors. As to the more pronounced degree of state intervention with respect to collective bargaining in Canada, its historical roots would tend to preserve it...|$|R
