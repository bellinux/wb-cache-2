5|$|Hurricane Isidore {{was one of}} {{only four}} storms to hit {{the north side of the}} Yucatán since records have been kept.

5|$|When Iselle made {{landfall}} on the Big Island with {{winds of}} 60mph (95km/h), {{it became the}} strongest tropical cyclone on record to hit the island, and {{one of only three}} storms to hit the island at tropical storm intensity or higher, along with Tropical Storm Seven in 1958, and Tropical Storm Darby in 2016. If Iselle had made landfall as a hurricane, {{it would have been the}} first hurricane to <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> the Big Island. With estimated damage cost of $79.2 million (2014USD), Iselle surpassed Hurricane Dot in 1959 as the third-costliest tropical cyclone to <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> the U.S. state of Hawaii, even after accounting for inflation. The only storms to cause more damage to the islands were hurricanes Iniki and Iwa in 1992 and 1982, respectively. In addition, Iselle was the third-strongest tropical cyclone to ever make landfall on the Hawaiian islands after hurricanes Dot and Iniki.|$|E

The left-field upper deck had been reached by Jeff Bagwell twice, and Bob Robertson, Greg Luzinski, Howard Johnson, Glenallen Hill and Devon White (his home run struck the facade) once each.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{male and female}} abused and neglected children {{report higher levels of}} intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration in young adulthood than a matched control group. We also examined whether this association was mediated by early aggressive behavior, adult antisocial personality disorder, hostility, and problem drinking for men and women. The sample consisted of individuals who had official records of child abuse and/or neglect prior to age 12 and matched controls who were followed up and interviewed at approximately age 29 years. Individuals who had ever been married or lived with someone (N= 961) reported on lifetime perpetration of IPV. For the total sample, abused and neglected children reported significantly higher rates of <b>ever</b> <b>hitting</b> or throwing things at a partner, <b>ever</b> <b>hitting</b> or throwing first, and <b>ever</b> <b>hitting</b> or throwing first more than once. Both male and female abused and neglected children reported significantly higher rates of <b>ever</b> <b>hitting</b> or throwing things at a partner than matched controls. Antisocial personality disorder mediated the effects of abuse/neglect on IPV for men and women and hostility and alcohol problems also mediated the effects for abused and neglected women. Early aggressive behavior was not a significant mediator for either gender. Overall the results reveal a link between early childhood victimization an...|$|R

5|$|In other {{baseball}} leagues, {{the cycle}} is achieved less frequently. Through September 4, 2008, 63 players in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the top-level baseball organization in Japan, have hit for the cycle, {{the most recent}} being Rainel Rosario. Two players have hit for the cycle {{on the same day}} once in NPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB history. One NPB player has also hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game. No player has <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle in the MLB All-Star Game or the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Of the 14 players {{eligible}} for the Hall of Fame who have hit four home runs in a game, five have been elected. Players are {{eligible for}} the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 major league seasons and have been either retired for five seasons or deceased {{for at least six}} months. These requirements leave two players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons and one (Seerey) who did not play 10 seasons in MLB. No player has <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> four home runs in a postseason game (the record is three).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> the state. It {{was the strongest}} in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.|$|E

5|$|No {{player has}} <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> a cycle {{in both the}} Central and Pacific Leagues; however, after Alex Ochoa hit his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, he became the only player to hit a cycle in both MLB and NPB. Ochoa hit his first and only cycle in the MLB eight years prior on July 3, 1996, while playing for the New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, hitting one in game2 of the 1992 series. Furuta's cycle is not {{considered}} an official NPB cycle as it occurred during an exhibition game. Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple {{in the first inning}} and hitting a home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|While at {{its peak}} strength, Cimaron {{displayed}} two small concentric eyewalls, separated by a few kilometres. The storm later made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon shortly after 1200UTC on October29; it {{became one of the}} strongest storms to <b>ever</b> <b>hit</b> the region. Interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused substantial weakening, though Cimaron maintained typhoon status during its 12‑hour crossing. After emerging over the South China Sea on October30, the system initially maintained its west-northwest course. However, the following day, a weakness developed within the ridge previously steering the typhoon, and Cimaron briefly turned north before essentially stalling. During this time, the system reorganized somewhat and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) on November2. While executing a tight clockwise loop, increased wind shear and entrainment of dry air soon caused Cimaron to dramatically weaken. With a new ridge becoming established over China, the weakening system acquired a general southwestward track. Cimaron weakened to a tropical depression on November4 and ultimately dissipated three days later just off the coast of southeastern Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|Babe Ruth, who got {{his first}} hit as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920, hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single {{bleacher}} stand, went across the street, and hit a tree over 500feet away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second row of houses, again over 500feet distant and {{said to be the}} longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park.

25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2011 tennis tour Blake ended his partnership with coach Kelly Jones, choosing to travel alone. In a preseason interview, Blake stated he was healthy and carrying a positive attitude and would skip the Australian Open. In his first match of the year, on February 8 at the SAP Open in San Jose, Blake defeated American qualifier Jesse Levine after Levine succumbed to an injury late in the second set. The American ran into red-hot Canadian youngster Milos Raonic in the second round and fell after battling back from a late break down in the second set to force a tiebreaker. Raonic would go on to win the tournament, his first as a pro. In the 2011 US Open, Blake hit a forehand winner on match point against Jesse Huta Galung in the first round that was clocked at 125mph, thus making it the fastest forehand <b>ever</b> <b>hit,</b> eclipsing Gaël Monfils's earlier record of 122mph against Marcos Baghdatis.
