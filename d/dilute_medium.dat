50|$|Concentrated {{cellular}} suspensions {{that exist}} in a low-viscosity medium make good candidates for smear preparations. Dilute cell suspensions existing in a <b>dilute</b> <b>medium</b> are best suited for the preparation of cytospins through cytocentrifugation.

The constant among these preparations is that the whole cell is present on the slide surface.

The first outgrowths of new cells in the modified media did not occur sooner than in normal medium. In hypertonic medium the density of the area of cell proliferation appeared to be greater than the control, but in hypotonic or <b>diluted</b> <b>medium</b> there seemed to be no increase in actual mass over the control. These observations confirm the conclusions of Carrel and Burrows, as well as those of Lambert. Subsequent to {{the first few}} days of cultivation in hypertonic medium the area of cell proliferation decreased and in a short time conditions developed which were unfavorable to growth, and finally resulted in death of the culture, unless it revived before this stage. Hypotonic medium after about ten days no longer caused more extensive areas of proliferating cells; but instead, the extent of new growth gradually decreased, and the culture merely remained alive unless revived. In <b>diluted</b> <b>medium</b> the extent of the area of cell proliferation remained greater with no actual increase in mass. The area of cell proliferation which is observed during {{the first few days}} in a culture of fresh tissue recently extirpated does not indicate the actual influence of modified media.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{is able to}} form biofilms {{on various}} {{surfaces}} and this ability is thought to contribute to persistence in the environment and on contact surfaces in the food industry. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is {{a component of the}} biofilm matrix of many bacterial species and was shown {{to play a role in}} biofilm establishment of L. monocytogenes. In the present study, the effect of DNasel treatment on biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes EGD-e was investigated under static and dynamic conditions in normal or <b>diluted</b> complex <b>medium</b> at different temperatures. Biofilm formation was quantified by crystal violet staining or visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Biomass of surface-attached L. monocyto genes varies depending on temperature and dilution of media. Interestingly, L. monocytogenes EGD-e forms DNase-sensitive biofilms in <b>diluted</b> <b>medium</b> whereas in full strength medium DNasel treatment had no effect. In line with these observations, eDNA is present in the matrix of biofilms grown in diluted but not full strength medium and supernatants of biofilms grown in <b>diluted</b> <b>medium</b> contain chromosomal DNA. The DNase-sensitive phenotype could be clearly linked to reduced ionic strength in the environment since dilution of medium in PBS or saline abolished DNase sensitivity. Several other but not all species of the genus Listeria display DNase-sensitive and -resistant modes of biofilm formation. These results indicate that L. monocytogenes biofilms are DNase-sensitive especially at low ionic strength, which might favor bacterial lysis and release of chromosomal DNA. Since low nutrient concentrations with increased osmotic pressure are conditions frequently found in food processing environments, DNasel treatment represents an option to prevent or remove Listeria biofilms in industrial settings...|$|R

40|$|International audienceQuantitative {{ultrasound}} (QUS) techniques {{utilize the}} amplitude and frequency {{dependence of the}} backscatter coefficient (BSC) to determine the physical properties of the average tissue microstructure. QUS techniques typically rely on theoretical scattering models to fit the BSC from biological tissues to an estimated BSC using an appropriate theoretical model. The Structure Factor Model (SFM) was recently shown to better explain the BSCs from tissue-mimicking biophantoms (Franceschini et al JASA 2014). The {{aim of this study}} is to use the SFM to estimate the tissue microstructure in excised canine livers. Ultrasonic backscatter measurements were performed in excised canine livers at frequencies ranging from 12 MHz to 38 MHz using an ultrasound scanner (Vevo 770, Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) equipped with the RMV 707 probe. The mean scatterer radius r*, scatterer concentration ϕ* and impedance contrast Gz* were estimated using the SFM. The estimated parameters were classified according to the concentration estimates as a <b>diluted</b> <b>medium</b> (ϕ*< 0. 08) or a concentrated medium (ϕ*≥ 0. 08). The structural parameters classified as <b>diluted</b> <b>medium</b> (ϕ*< 0. 08) were equal to r*= 5. 43 ± 0. 95 µm, ϕ*= 0. 022 ± 0. 013 and Gz*= 0. 12 ± 0. 04 for most estimates (77 %). The estimated scatterer radius closely corresponded to the actual radius of the hepatocyte nuclei. By assuming that the hepatocyte cells occupy a volume fraction around 0. 74 and that 15 % of the cells are bi-nucleated, the nuclear volume fraction is expected to equal approximately 0. 039.

40|$|An {{analytical}} microscopic {{theory for}} the resonant multiple scattering of light by cold atoms with arbitrary internal degeneracy is presented. It permits {{to calculate the}} average amplitude and the average intensity for one-photon states of the full transverse electromagnetic field in a <b>dilute</b> <b>medium</b> of unpolarized atoms. Special emphasis is laid upon an analysis in terms of irreducible representations of the rotation group. It allows to sum explicitly the ladder and maximally crossed diagrams, giving the average intensity in the Boltzmann approximation and the interference corrections responsible for weak localization and coherent backscattering. The exact decomposition into field modes shows that the atomic internal degeneracy contributes to the depolarization of the average intensity and suppresses the interference corrections. Static as well as dynamic quantities like the transport velocity, diffusion constants and relaxation times for all field modes and all atomic transitions are derived. Comment: Corrected minor errors.

Both methods indicated large water potential differences (3 to 10 atm), in some cases approaching the osmotic pressure of the cells. However, indication was obtained that the rates of osmotic exchanges induced by mannitol solutions, and presumably also the equilibrium response sought in (a), are governed by the rate of diffusional exchange of mannitol with the free space {{rather than by the}} permeability of the tissue to water. Osmotic swelling of the tissue measured by immersing it in water after its turgor pressure had been reduced by evaporation, was at least two to four times more rapid than when mannitol was involved.
