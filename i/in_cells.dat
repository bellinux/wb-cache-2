5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot be made <b>in</b> <b>cells.</b> In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides {{when they are}} used <b>in</b> <b>cells.</b> Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E

5|$|The classic view {{of water}} <b>in</b> <b>cells</b> {{is that about}} 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules <b>in</b> <b>cells</b> extend throughout the cytosol and that water <b>in</b> <b>cells</b> behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility of water in living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E

5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate.

5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs <b>in</b> <b>cells</b> provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also.

However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E

40|$|Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) is a {{prevalent}} phosphoinositide <b>in</b> <b>cell</b> membranes, {{with important}} functions <b>in</b> <b>cell</b> signaling and activation. A large fraction of PIP 2 associates with the detergent-resistant membrane “raft” fraction, but the functional {{significance of this}} association remains controversial. To measure the properties of raft and nonraft PIP 2 <b>in</b> <b>cell</b> signaling, we targeted the PIP 2 -specific phosphatase Inp 54 p to either the raft or nonraft membrane fraction using minimal membrane anchors. Interestingly, we observed that targeting Inp 54 p to the nonraft fraction resulted in an enrichment of raft-associated PIP 2 and striking changes <b>in</b> <b>cell</b> morphology, including a wortmannin-sensitive increase <b>in</b> <b>cell</b> filopodia and <b>cell</b> spreading. <b>In</b> contrast, raft-targeted Inp 54 p depleted the raft pool of PIP 2 and produced smooth T cells void of membrane ruffling and filopodia. Furthermore, raft-targeted Inp 54 p inhibited capping <b>in</b> T <b>cells</b> stimulated by cross-linking the T cell receptor, but without affecting the T cell receptor-dependent Ca 2 + flux. Altogether, these results provide evidence of compartmentalization of PIP 2 -dependent signaling <b>in</b> <b>cell</b> membranes such as predicted by the membrane raft model...|$|R
5|$|By 1935, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} {{several hundred}} men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organized <b>in</b> <b>cells</b> of five men, and arranged military training for peasants.

Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.|$|E
