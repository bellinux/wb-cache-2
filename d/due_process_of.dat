5|$|The ACLU {{has also}} criticized {{targeted}} killings of American citizens who {{fight against the}} United States. In 2011 the ACLU criticized the killing of radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki {{on the basis that}} it was a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> law.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a right {{and that the government}} will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E
50|$|In earlier cases, the Court {{had struck}} down state {{legislation}} limiting {{the freedom of}} contract by using the <b>due</b> <b>process</b> clause <b>of</b> the Fourteenth Amendment, which only applied to the states.

5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful menâ€”not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause <b>of</b> the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause <b>of</b> the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines <b>of</b> procedural <b>due</b> <b>process</b> and substantive <b>due</b> <b>process.</b> Procedural <b>due</b> <b>process</b> is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive <b>due</b> <b>process</b> is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause <b>of</b> the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|R
