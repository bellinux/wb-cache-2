40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Dyselectrolytemia</b> is {{a common}} problem {{affecting}} elderly hospitalised patients. Although hypo/hypernatremia {{is the most common}} electrolyte abnormality found in elderly, abnormalities in other electrolytes may also occur in various settings. Information regarding the pattern of electrolyte abnormalities in elderly is lacking {{in this part of the}} country. With this background the following case control study was taken up with the following aims and objectives. OBJECTIVES • To study the various patterns of <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> in elderly and compare them with young. • To evaluate and compare the various aetiological factors and comorbid conditions involved in the occurrence of electrolyte abnormalities in these groups of patients. RESULTS The mean age of the study population was 66. 174 years (SD- 6. 512 years) and of the control group was 41. 94 years (SD - 10. 924 years). Hyponatraemia was the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in both the groups (57...|$|E
40|$|Methanol {{poisoning}} is rare but carries {{high risk}} of morbidity and mortality. Most of the cases witnessed in emergency are due to consumption of adulterated alcohol. Here we are reporting a very rare case of methanol poisoning through inhalational exposure leading to putamen necrosis and decreased visual acuity. He had <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> and metabolic acidosis which was successfully managed with early intervention. Its importance {{lies in the fact}} that inhalational methanol poisoning is an entity which if picked up early can prevent long-term neurological sequelae...|$|E
40|$|Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) and hypokalemic paralysis {{are common}} causes of acute flaccid quadriparesis and specific therapeutic interventions differ. Simultaneous occurrence of severe hypokalemia {{in patients with}} GBS {{at the time of}} presentation can cause diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Presence of hypomagnesemia with hypokalemia in patients with GBS can be perplexing and pose further challenges. Evaluation for preexisting inherited or other associated metabolic disturbances is needed in the presence of such complex <b>dyselectrolytemia.</b> We report the rare association of GBS with severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia in a 41 -year-old male presenting with acute flaccid quadriparesis and the therapeutic challenges faced...|$|E
40|$|Chemotherapy is {{a common}} modalityfor {{treatment}} of cancer. Regardlessof the fact that chemotherapy improvessurvival; {{it has its own}} toxicity and side-effects, which {{have a negative impact on}} the quality of life of children with cancer. Severe side-effects, and non-compliance because of those side-effects, can lead to loss of time at school for the child, loss of time at work for the caregiver, and additional office visits to the doctor; all of which contribute both to death and disability, and to the annual costs of cancer. It is therefore imperative to optimize chemotherapy and ensure minimum side-effects. Nausea and vomiting continue to be significant side-effects of cancer therapy and can affect patient compliance(1). To avoid the clinical sequelae of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) like malnutrition, dehydration, <b>dyselectrolytemias,</b> anorexia, stress, esophageal tears, and anxiety, it is imperative to provide prophylaxis and treatment for CINV. CLASSIFICATION Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is broadly classified into acute, delayed or anticipatory type depending upon the time period of vomiting(2). Vomiting occurring in the first 24 hours of administering chemotherapy is labeled as acute CINV and in the absence of effective prophylaxis, it most commonly begins within one to two hours of chemotherapy and usually peaks in the first four to six hours. Vomiting occurring later is called delayed CINV. Classically, this phenomenon was described with cisplatin. While the frequency and number of episodes of emesis may be less during the delayed period compared to acute emesis, the delayed form is less well controlled with current antiemetic medications. Anticipator...|$|R
40|$|Malrotation can be {{difficult}} to diagnose beyond the newborn period because of its non-specific symptoms and clinical findings. We present an unusual case of malrotation with midgut volvulus and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis in an adolescent. An 11 -year-old girl presented to the paediatric emergency department with persistent vomiting, <b>dyselectrolytemia,</b> and metabolic alkalosis. An unremarkable abdominal radiograph and ultrasonography examination prompted a computerised scan of the abdomen. The diagnosis of malrotation with midgut volvulus and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis was made. The findings were confirmed on laproscopy and the patient underwent successful Ladd’s procedure. This case report emphasizes the importance of imaging, especially computed tomography, in making accurate diagnosis of malrotation and its complications, beyond the newborn perio...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Escilatopram is an orally {{administered}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The ADRs {{associated with}} Escilatopram are- abnormal bleeding, Hyponatremia, activation of Mania/Hypomania, Seizures, Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance. Also it has got serious Drug-Drug Interactions {{with a variety}} of drugs. A female patient of age 60 years was brought to casualty with hypertensive urgency. She was put on metoprolol, amlodipine, telmisartan and hydrochlorthiazide combination, escilatopram and clonazepam combination, along with other drugs. On day 2 her lab reports stated <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> and upon analysing the prescription, it was found that there were many drug- drug interactions. By avoiding such combination of drugs and also by choosing an appropriate antidepressant, such adverse effects could have been averted.

40|$|Abstract: Spiranolactone and Eplerenone were {{belongs to}} the class of {{potassium}} sparing diuretics where as Torsemide {{belongs to the}} loop diuretic class, they mainly acts by blocking the function of aldosterone hormone to retain the sodium and excrete potassium. By irrational use of these drugs induced <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> like hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. A 55 years female patient was admitted in cardiology department with the chief complaints of drowsiness and slow response to commands by using of the diuretics (Spiranolactone, Eplerenone and Torsemide) causes the electrolytes induced hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. These electrolytes abnormalities will causes the cardiac arrhythmias, muscle paralysis and sometimes death also. Whereas both rechallenge and dechallenge was done and the ADR assessment scales like Naranjo and WHO gives certain ADR {{and it can be}} managed by stopping of the above drugs.

40|$|Four hundred {{patients}} who {{presented in the}} emergency of GMC Jammu as a case of perforation peritonitisover {{a period of two}} years were studied. In most of the cases diagnosis was made by clinical examinationsupplemented by investigations in the form of standing X-ray chest PA view with domes of diaphragm,Ultrasound abdomen and abdominal paracentesis. Contrast enhanced CT scans of abdomen wereconducted on patients where the diagnosis of perforation peritonitis was doubtful. After resuscitation,Laparotomy was done in all the patients and thorough peritoneal lavage was done. A note of the site,size, type, number of perforations was made and biopsy was taken {{from the edge of the}} perforationwhenever indicated. The most common cause of gastrointestinal perforation in our study was duodenalulcer perforation, followed by appendicitis, typhoid perforation, blunt/penetrating trauma, gastric perforation,obstruction, iatrogenic, malignancy, and recurrent perforation. Primary closure of the perforation wasmost commonly done procedure, followed by appendectomy, resection anastomosis of the gut andexteriorization of the gut. The overall mortality was 6 % and morbidity in the form of wound infection,fever, respiratory complications, residual abscess, <b>dyselectrolytemia,</b> burst abdomen, jaundice, sepsis,cardiac complications, anastomotic disruption was presen...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Capreomycin is a second-line drug {{often used}} for multidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} which can result in nephrotoxic effects similar to other aminoglycosides. We describe a case of capreomycin induced Bartter-like syndrome with hypocalcemic tetany. Case Report. 23 -year-old female patient presented with carpopedal spasms and tingling sensations in hands. Patient was being treated with capreomycin for two months for tuberculosis. On further investigation, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis were noted. Vitamin D and serum PTH levels were within normal limits. Hypercalciuria was confirmed by urine calcium/creatinine ratio. Calcium, potassium, and magnesium supplementation was given and capreomycin was discontinued. Electrolytes normalized in two days after cessation of capreomycin with no further abnormalities on repeat investigations. Discussion. Aminoglycosides can result in renal tubular dysfunction leading to Fanconi syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and distal tubular acidosis. Impaired mitochondrial function in the tubular cells has been hypothesized as the possible cause of these tubulopathies. Acquired Bartter-like syndrome phenotypically resembles autosomal dominant type 5 Bartter syndrome. Treatment consists of correction of electrolyte abnormalities, indomethacin, and potassium-sparing diuretics. Prompt {{diagnosis and treatment of}} severe <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> are warranted in patients on aminoglycoside therapy...|$|E
40|$|Emphysematous {{pyelonephritis}} (EPN) is {{a life-threatening}} condition most commonly observed in diabetes, with nephrectomy {{believed to be}} the treatment of choice. However, nephrectomy in EPN is associated with increased risk of complications secondary to associated hemodynamic instability and may result in lifelong hemodialysis in case of bilateral EPN. We present three patients of severe bilateral EPN and one patient of unilateral EPN with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) successfully managed conservatively. Patient 1 (severe bilateral EPN) and patient 4 (unilateral EPN with DKA) responded to aggressive broad spectrum antibiotics, whereas patients 2 and 3 (severe bilateral EPN) responded to broad spectrum antibiotics along with percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD). PCD resulted in initial drainage of 300 and 200 ml of pus, respectively. All patients had associated uncontrolled hyperglycemia, poor glycemic control (HbA 1 c > 8. 5 %), prerenal and intrinsic renal failure, leukocytosis, and <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> which responded to aggressive supportive management and insulin. There are several reports of successful medical management of severe bilateral EPN. Nephrectomy might no longer be the preferred treatment of severe bilateral EPN and may be reserved for patients′ refractory to antibiotics and PCD. Urgent randomized controlled trials are warranted in EPN to optimize the treatment protocols...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) {{patients}} {{are prone to}} kidney injury by various mechanisms including reduced blood flow, ischemia, and papillary necrosis. Sickle cell nephropathy may progress to end-stage renal disease with increased morbidity and mortality. Objective: To assess renal function tests and their relationship with kidney length in steady state SCA patients. Subjects and Methods: Seventy-four adult SCA patients in steady state and 20 hemoglobin AA controls were enrolled into the study. Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine, and uric acid were assayed while estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. Renal scan was also performed to assess the kidney length. Results: Serum potassium, phosphate, and uric acid were statistically significantly higher while sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and eGFR were significantly lower in SCA patient than in controls (P < 0. 05). eGFR of < 90 ml/min was found in 50 (67. 6 %) of SCA patients out of which 7 (9. 5 %) had Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (< 60 ml/min) and one patient with Stage 4 CKD who also had shrunken kidneys with elevated serum creatinine (203 μmol/L) and urea (11. 7 mmol/L) concentration. Renal ultrasonography revealed reduced renal size in 20 (27. 1 %) of the patients while 2 (2. 7 %) had a renal enlargement. There was no correlation between renal length and serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and eGFR. Conclusion: The majority of steady state SCA patients in Zaria have reduced eGFR and <b>dyselectrolytemia.</b> However, there was no association between the kidney length and the biochemical parameters. We, thus, recommend renal function tests to be routinely requested for proper management of these patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundConcurrent {{chemoradiation}} causes toxicities such as enteritis, hematologic toxicities {{which may}} lead to treatment interruptions, and therefore inferior outcomes. Adequate supportive care {{is very important to}} complete the scheduled protocol. Most of our patients are from rural background with a heterogeneous social background (nutrition and social support). There is paucity of literature to evaluate the tolerance of this intense treatment in these groups of patients, and hence, this study was undertaken. MethodsIn this observational study, 30 rural women having carcinoma cervix treated with concurrent chemoradiation between January and July 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. They were assessed weekly for <b>dyselectrolytemia,</b> enteritis, and hematologic toxicity using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. Treatment gaps along with reasons were recorded and correlated. ResultsMedian age of patients was 54 years. Of the patients, 43. 3 % were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage II and 46. 7 % stage III. Grade 3 enteritis was seen in 7 of 30 patients (23. 3 %). None (0 %) had grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity. Dyselectrolytemia–hyponatremia (46. 66 %), hypokalemia (26. 66 %), hypocalcemia (6. 66 %), and hypomagnesemia (10 %) were noted. Two of thirty patients (6. 66 %) received the planned 5 cycles, cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 weekly. There were treatment interruptions in radiation in 6 (20 %) and treatment delays in chemotherapy in 10 (33. 33 %) patients. ConclusionConcurrent chemoradiation for patients from rural areas is associated with higher acute toxicities. Regular monitoring for enteritis and dyselectrolytemias and timely intervention can help improve compliance and decrease treatment interruptions and thereby achieve the optimum treatment outcome...|$|E
40|$|Bile duct {{injuries}} and subsequent leaks can occur following laparoscopic and open cholecystectomies and also during other hepatobiliary surgeries. Various patient related and technical factors are {{implicated in the}} causation of biliary injuries. Over a period of twenty five years managing such patients of biliary injuries our team has found a practical approach to assess the cause of biliary injuries based on the symptoms, clinical examination and imaging. Bismuth classification is helpful {{in most of the}} cases. Immediate referral to a centre experienced in the management of bile duct injury and timely intervention is associated with improved outcomes. Resuscitation, correcting <b>dyselectrolytemia,</b> aspiration of undrained biloma and antibiotics take the priority in the management. The goal is to restore the bile conduit, and to prevent short and longterm complications such as biliary fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, biliary stricture, recurrent cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Endoscopic therapy by reducing the transpapillary pressure gradient helps in reducing the leak. Endoscopic therapy with biliary sphincterotomy alone or with additional placement of a biliary stent/ nasobiliary drainage is advocated. In our tertiary care referral unit, we found endoscopic interventions are useful in situations where there is leak with associated CBD calculus or a foreign body, peripheral bile duct injury, cystic duct stump leak and partial bile duct injury with leak/ narrowing of the lumen. Endotherapy is not useful in case of complete transection (total cut off) and complete stricture involving common hepatic or common bile ducts. In conclusion, endoscopic treatment can be considered a highly effective therapy and should be the first-line therapy in such patients. Though less successful, an endoscopic attempt is warranted in patients suffering from central bile duct leakages failing which surgical management is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A {{large number}} of unknown {{patients}} without any personal, family, or other identification details represent a unique problem in the neurological emergency services of developing countries like India {{in a context of}} legal, humanitarian, and treatment issues. These patients pose a diagnostic and management challenge to treating physicians and staff. There are sparse data on these patients. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the clinical, socio-demographic, and investigational profile of “unknown” patients. Materials and Methods: We did retrospective chart review of all “Unknown” patients from January 2002 to December 2011, who was admitted under Neurology Emergency Service at a Tertiary Care Neuropsychiatry Center in South Indian Metropolitan City. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and clinical outcome of the sample were analyzed. Results: A total of 151 unknown patients were admitted during the 10 years. Out of these, 134 (88. 7 %) were males with the mean age of 43. 8 ± 14. 8 years and 95 (63 %) were aged > 40 years. Among them, 147 (97. 4 %) were from the urban vicinity, 126 (83. 6 %) were brought by police and 75 (49. 7 %) were registered as medico-legal cases. Out of these, only 3 (2 %) patients had normal sensorium, whereas 101 (66. 9 %) presented with loss of consciousness. Forty-one (27. 2 %) unknown patients had a seizure disorder, 37 (24. 5 %) had metabolic encephalopathy, 26 (17. 2 %) had a stroke, 9 (6 %) had neuro-infection, and 17 (11. 3 %) had a head injury. Deranged liver functions were seen in 65 (43 %), renal derangement in 37 (24. 5 %), <b>dyselectrolytemia</b> in 42 (27. 8 %), and abnormal brain imaging finding in 95 (62. 9 %) patients. Furthermore, there were 14 (9. 3 %) deaths. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate seizures, metabolic causes, and neuro-infections were the primary reasons for admission of unknown patients to neuro-emergency service. This novel Indian study data show the common causes of admission of unknown patients in neurology. This pattern can be useful to guide the approach of healthcare providers in India...|$|E
