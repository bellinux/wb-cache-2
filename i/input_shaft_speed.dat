40|$|The {{performance}} of high-speed helical gear trains {{is of particular}} importance for tiltrotor aircraft drive systems. These drive systems are used to provide speed reduction / torque multiplication from the gas turbine output shaft and provide the necessary offset between these parallel shafts in the aircraft. Four different design configurations have been tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center, High Speed Helical Gear Train Test Facility. The design configurations included the current aircraft design, current design with isotropic superfinished gear surfaces, double helical design (inward and outward pumping), increased pitch (finer teeth), and an increased helix angle. All designs were tested at multiple <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speeds</b> (up to 15, 000 rpm) and applied power (up to 5, 000 hp). Also two lubrication, system-related, variables were tested: oil inlet temperature (160 to 250 degF) and lubricating jet pressure (60 to 80 psig). Experimental data recorded from these tests included power loss of the helical system under study, the temperature increase of the lubricant from inlet to outlet of the drive system and fling off temperatures (radially and axially). Also, all gear systems were tested with and without shrouds around the gears. The empirical data resulting from this study will be useful {{to the design of}} future helical gear train systems anticipated for next generation rotorcraft drive systems...|$|R
5000|$|A {{subset of}} CVT designs are called {{infinitely}} variable transmissions (IVT or IVTs), {{in which the}} range of ratios of output shaft speed to <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> includes a zero ratio that can be continuously approached from a defined [...] "higher" [...] ratio. A zero output speed (low gear) with a finite input speed implies an infinite input-to-output speed ratio, which can be continuously approached from a given finite input value with an IVT. Low gears are a reference to low ratios of output speed to input speed. This low ratio is taken to the extreme with IVTs, resulting in a [...] "neutral", or non-driving [...] "low" [...] gear limit, in which the output speed is zero. Unlike neutral in a normal automotive transmission, IVT output rotation may be prevented because the back-driving (reverse IVT operation) ratio may be infinite, resulting in impossibly high backdriving torque; in a ratcheting IVT, however, the output may freely rotate in the forward direction.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{methodology for}} gearbox health assessment and fault classification is developed and evaluated for 560 data sets of gearbox vibration {{data provided by}} the Prognostics and Health Management Society for the 2009 data challenge competition. A comprehensive set of signal processing and feature extraction methods are used to extract over 200 features, including features extracted from the raw time signal, time synchronous signal, wavelet decomposition signal, frequency domain spectrum, envelope spectrum, among others. A regime segmentation approach using the tachometer signal, a spectrum similarity metric, and gear mesh frequency peak information are used to segment the data by gear type, <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speed,</b> and braking torque load. A health assessment method that finds the minimum feature vector sum in each regime is used to classify and find the 80 baseline healthy data sets. A fault diagnosis method based on a distance calculation from normal along with specific features correlated to different fault signatures is used to diagnosis specific faults. The fault diagnosis method is evaluated for the diagnosis of a gear tooth breakage, input shaft imbalance, bent shaft, bearing inner race defect, and bad key, and the method could be further extended for other faults {{as long as a}} set of features can be correlated with a known fault signature. Future work looks to further refine the distance calculation algorithm for fault diagnosis, as well as further evaluate other signal processing method such as the empirical mode decomposition to see if an improved set of features can be used to improve the fault diagnosis accuracy...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a programme of research encompassing the design, optimisation and experimental testing of a brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM) {{for use as}} an aerospace electrical generator, specifically a direct line connected generator, to widen the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> beyond the normal constraints imposed by the 360 - 800 Hz specification for a variable-frequency AC aerospace network. BDFRMs offer the functionality of frequency correction, via a control winding, and {{have the advantage of}} using a robust reluctance rotor. A partially-rated control winding converter can, in principle, be used to provide the slip power required. A further advantage of the BDFRM is the inherent fail-safe nature of these machines, with the output voltage collapsing as soon as the control winding current has been removed. A synchronous reluctance machine was studied as a means of providing a baseline for the BDFRM performance, including a comparison of the effect of scaling on power density. A large number of time-stepped finite element simulations were undertaken to explore BDFRM performance, in particular, the influence of magnetic saturation in limiting the achievable power density and in compromising power quality. Detailed optimisation of a BDFRM was undertaken, including systematic mechanical design of the rotor for high speed operation. This analysis illustrates the significant compromises in machine electromagnetic performance which result from the need to accommodate mechanical stress. The scope for employing small amounts of permanent magnet material in the rotors of both synchronous reluctance machines and BDFRMs, to improve the machine performance {{at the lower end of}} the current density range, was investigated. Following detailed optimisation, a demonstrator machine was manufactured, which includes a skewed rotor. The performance of this machine was measured at a number of test points to verify predictions of output power, voltage and voltage harmonics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This project {{presents}} a generalized formulation for the computer-aided analysis of induction motor driving a submersible pump. In general Electric Submersible Pump [ESP] incorporates an induction motor and a pump, having centrifugal action. The pump {{is powered by}} the DC source especially by photovoltaic modules. In this case the insolation level of the sun is not constant at all time, {{it is necessary to}} predict the pump‘s performance. To do so, mathematical modeling and simulation of the electric submersible pump is proposed here. The dynamic model of the induction motor consists of an electrical sub-model to implement the three-phase to two-axis (3 / 2) d-q transformation of stator voltage and current calculation, a torque sub-model to calculate the developed electromagnetic torque, and a mechanical sub-model to yield the rotor speed. The submersible pump is modeled with the <b>inputs</b> as <b>shaft</b> <b>speed,</b> torque and head. The output variable is chosen to be discharge. With all these system modules, the electrical and mechanical condition of the pump under different operating condition is simulated with Matlab/Simulink model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Power system {{stabilizers}} (PSS) must {{be capable}} of providing appropriate stabilization signals over {{a broad range of}} operating conditions and disturbance. Traditional PSS rely on robust linear design method in an attempt to cover a wider range of operating condition. Expert or rule-based controllers have also been proposed. Recently fuzzy logic (FL) as a novel robust control design method has shown promising results. The emphasis in fuzzy control design center is around uncertainties in the system parameters & operating conditions. In this paper a novel Robust Fuzzy Logic Power System Stabilizer (RFLPSS) design is proposed The RFLPSS basically utilizes only one measurable ∆ω signal as <b>input</b> (generator <b>shaft</b> <b>speed).</b> The speed signal is discretized resulting in three inputs to the RFLPSS. There are six rules for the fuzzification and two rules for defuzzification. To provide robustness, additional signal namely, speed are used as inputs to RFLPSS enabling appropriate gain adjustments for the three RFLPSS inputs. Simulation studies show the superior performance of the RFLPSS compared with an optimally designed conventional PSS and discrete mode FLPSS...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{gearboxes}} {{are used}} to increase torque while reducing {{the speed of a}} prime mover output shaft (e.g. a motor crankshaft). This means that the output shaft of a gearbox rotates at a slower rate than the <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> and this reduction in speed produces a mechanical advantage, increasing torque. A gearbox can be set up to do the opposite and provide an increase in <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> with a reduction of torque.

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of nuclear thermal propulsion systems using computational methods will permit reductions in testing and, thus, {{the time and}} cost of achieving a flight ready status for systems utilizing this advanced technology. An accurate simulation must maintain a "balance-of-plant" where the required pump work equals the supplied turbine work. This turbopump assembly balancing must {{be integrated into the}} overall system analysis models. TPA was developed to balance turbine and pump work using performance maps. It requires the inlet properties, performance maps, and shaft speed. TPA then computes the exit conditions and work terms. The work terms can then be balanced by varying the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speed.</b> The objective of the pump analysis is to determine the propellant state properties at the pump exit and the pump work. The pump analysis algorithm for liquid flow assumes that the shaft speed, the propellant state properties at the pump entrance, the propellant flow rate, the pump entrance and exit areas, as well as performance curves, are all known. The analysis of both the pump pressure rise and pump efficiency curves is required. The objective of the turbine analysis is to determine the propellant state properties at the turbine exit and the turbine work. The turbine analysis algorithm assumes that the shaft speed, the propellant state properties at the turbine entrance, the propellant flow rate, the turbine root mean square blade diameter, the turbine entrance and exit areas, as well as performance curves, are all known. The analysis also requires the turbine flow parameter curve and the turbine total efficiency curve. TPA is written in FORTRAN 77 to be machine independent. The TPA package includes the NBS+_PH 2 code, which is also available separately (LEW- 15505). TPA has been successfully implemented on a DEC VAX series computer running VMS, a Sun 4 series computer running SunOS, and an IBM PC compatible computer running MS-DOS. Lahey F 77 L 3 EM/ 32 v. 5. 01 or higher is required for compilation on an IBM PC compatible computer; however, a PC executable is included on the distribution diskette. The standard distribution medium for this program is one 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskette. The diskette's contents have been compressed using PKWARE's archiving tools. The utility to unarchive the file, PKUNZIP. EXE, is included. Alternate distribution media and formats are available upon request. TPA was developed in 1993...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the matter of {{powertrain}} vibration reduction, focusing on the transmission. These units, depending on the purpose of utilization, consist of {{a high number of}} dimensionally complex components. These need to possess features, selected already in the design phase, which would guarantee smooth and quiet operation. A properly designed tooth profile and the related specified accuracy of manufacturing {{are one of the most}} important features. The basic function and the purpose of transmissions application indicate a relatively wide range of operating speeds and transmitted loads. Moreover, combination of both loading with improperly designed string’s parameter can cause a number of various problems. The vibration initiation with related noise from gear mesh belong to the most significant sources of issues. There are multiple mechanisms of oscillation initiation. Even when using the latest trends in the development of teeth, when their shape is upgraded and developed to meet specifically given load range, the above mentioned irregularity of transferred torque cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary, already in the design phase, to eliminate the transmission paths by which are vibrations transmitting to other components. People perceive this action in the form of vibration, noise, or temperature change in the surroundings. With the increasing comfort levels and number of produced vehicles the reduction of vibration and noise of machinery parts becomes stricter, including gears. The experimental approach is primarily used to assess the accuracy of designed gearboxes, but it is a very expensive and a time consuming method. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a process that utilizes both numerical simulation and experimental approach but also combines the advantages of both, particularly time and cost savings and comparability of results. For this purpose, the experimental gearbox is designed and manufactured including the single-stage gear enabling variable configurations in terms of the ratio change. The gearbox is subjected to numerical simulation of different complexity levels, as well as technical experiment. Furthermore, the universal virtual prototype in Multi-Body System ADAMS is created, which reflects the impact of several key parameters for proper functionality, such as axial distance, backlash, gear mesh stiffness, shaft mounting stiffness (bearings) and modal properties of the shafts and gearbox housing. Last but not least, the impact of imbalance or irregularity of <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> is incorporated. The last part focuses on a brief description of the application of the presented methodology – modelling of vibrations on the tractor gearbox...|$|E

50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the <b>input</b> and output <b>shafts.</b> The surface <b>speed</b> of the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft.

Central to many measurement techniques are incremental shaft encoders recording the arrival times of shaft angular increments.

This assumption is generally incorrect when working with toothed wheels and especially zebra tape encoders and has been shown to introduce errors in the estimated <b>shaft</b> <b>speed.</b> There are some proposed methods in literature that aim to compensate for this geometric irregularity. Some of the methods require the <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> to be perfectly constant for calibration, something rarely achieved in practice.
