5|$|British General Sir Henry Clinton {{moved up}} from New York City and {{attempted}} to divert American attention by capturing two forts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River highlands on October 6, but his efforts were too late to help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after {{it became apparent that}} he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold's spirited rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E

5|$|NY376 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY39, a route extending from Patterson to Poughkeepsie by way of West Patterson and East Fishkill, in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY39 was reassigned to another highway in western New York while its former routing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Valley was broken up into several routes. One of these was NY202, a new route that began in East Fishkill and ended in Poughkeepsie. The rest of NY39 became part of NY52 from East Fishkill to the western fringe of Patterson, and NY311 {{for the rest of}} the routing. In 1934, US202 was designated by AASHO. In order to avoid a numbering conflict, NY202 was renumbered to NY376.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route376 (NY376) is a {{state highway}} located entirely within Dutchess County <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Valley region of New York in the United States.

It ends at a junction with U.S. Route44 (US44) and NY55 east of the city limits in Arlington, a hamlet in the town of Poughkeepsie. NY376 was originally designated as part of NY39 in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the East Fishkill–Poughkeepsie portion of NY39 was renumbered to New York State Route202. NY202 was renumbered to NY376 in 1934 to avoid numerical duplication with the new US202.|$|E
5|$|The British Navy in New York had {{not been}} inactive. Vice-Admiral Sir George Collier engaged {{in a number of}} amphibious raids agaynst coastal {{communities}} from Chesapeake Bay to Connecticut, and probed at American defences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River valley. Coming up the river in force, he supported the key outpost capture of Stony Point, but advanced no further. When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organised a counterstrike. Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, recaptured Stony Point. The Americans chose not to hold the post, but their morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when their failure to co-operate with the French led to an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the British from Savannah. Control of Georgia was formally returned to its royal governor, James Wright, in July 1779, but the backcountry would not come under British control until after the 1780 Siege of Charleston. Patriot forces recovered Augusta by siege in 1781, but Savannah remained in British hands until 1782. The damage sustained at Savannah forced Marseillois, Zélé, Sagittaire, Protecteur and Experiment to return to Toulon for repairs.|$|E
