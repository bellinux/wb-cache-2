5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendantâ€™s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} {{generation}} XC a new feature called hill-descent-control was introduced that limits vehicle speed when driving <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> embankment.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they are}} going <b>down</b> <b>a</b> really <b>steep</b> hill, it's <b>a</b> wonder we don't hear some squeak from the brakes," [...] was Phil's comment.|$|R
5000|$|Downhill: Each {{competitor}} completes one run <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long, <b>steep</b> course {{which includes}} obstacles such as jumps and turns, and gates {{which must be}} passed through. Failure to do so results in disqualification.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{very heavy}} loads were {{sometimes}} controlled downhill by additional pairs hitched behind the vehicle. Such additional pairs were often hired to passing vehicles {{to help them}} either up or <b>down</b> <b>a</b> particularly <b>steep</b> hill.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} hunting weapon before the {{introduction}} of European guns was the bow and arrow. Various hunting strategies were used. Some techniques involved using animal head masks worn as a disguise. Whistles were sometimes used to lure animals closer. Another technique was the relay method where hunters positioned at various points would chase the prey in turns in order to tire the animal. A similar method involved chasing the prey <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> cliff.|$|E
25|$|Gentle grass-covered slopes on {{the south}} and east sides of the fell drop to a broad col and to Mosedale, both of which {{separate}} Clough Head from Great Dodd, its neighbour to the south. To the north of the summit the ground drops abruptly <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> scree-covered and craggy slope which marks the northern end of the Helvellyn range. This face is called Red Screes from the colour of the rock.|$|E
25|$|After curfew one night, two Police constables saw a very drunk German soldier {{staggering}} through town, a quick shove {{sent him}} flying <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> flight of granite steps. The Police reported a drunk soldier {{lying on the}} steps and after an ambulance had taken him away, the Policemen were given some cigarettes from a grateful German for helping their comrade. A minor assault on a German soldier could result in 3 months jail and a fine of 2 years salary.|$|E
60|$|Barney drew {{a breath}} of relief. The way had become {{suddenly}} difficult {{and he took the}} girl's arm to help her <b>down</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>steep</b> place. At the bottom of the ravine there was a little brook.|$|R
60|$|Smoke {{felt the}} rope tauten in a futile effort, then the pace quickened, {{and as he}} went past his {{previous}} lodgment and over the bulge the last glimpse he caught of Carson he was turned over, with madly moving hands and feet striving to overcome the downward draw. To Smoke's surprise, as he went over the bulge, there was no sheer fall. The rope restrained him as he slid <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> pitch, which quickly eased until {{he came to a}} halt in another niche on the verge of another bulge. Carson was now out of sight, ensconced in the place previously occupied by Smoke.|$|R
50|$|The raiders almost {{catch up}} with the fugitives, so Anderson {{attempts}} to ride <b>down</b> into <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> valley, but they follow. Anderson then ambushes the raiders, shooting one. The fugitives try to escape back uphill until Harmony jumps off of the bike, causing the raiders to split up while chasing them.|$|R
25|$|Gateshead 52 was {{originally}} a single-deck 'California' style tram until the open end compartments were covered over around 1903. Was {{involved in an}} accident in 1916 after it rolled <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill with passengers on board. After this it was rebuilt to its present format and was withdrawn in 1951. Bought by its former driver, it passed to the National Tramway Museum on his death, where it was stored, and damaged in an arson attack. It was transferred to Beamish in 2014, with a full restoration planned.|$|E
25|$|Similar to a funnel, a half-pipe {{features}} a slide in which riders oscillate back and forth. However, {{this style of}} ride does not feature any enclosed sections. On a Waterfun Product Sidewinder or Sidewinder Mini, riders oscillate several times before coming to a rest {{at the base of}} the slide. Riders then need to walk off the slide returning their tube to the next riders. On a WhiteWater West Boomerango or Family Boomerango, riders are sent <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> drop and up a steep hill on the other side, before sliding backwards down another path to the end of the slide.|$|E
25|$|Maureen Louise Sterling and Yvonne Lisa Weber, both 12-year-old Herbert Slater Middle School students, {{disappeared}} around 9 pm on February 4, 1972, {{after visiting}} the Redwood Empire Ice Arena. They were last seen hitchhiking on Guerneville Road, northwest of Santa Rosa. Their {{bodies were found}} December 28, 2.2 miles north of Porter Creek Road on Franz Valley Road, <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> embankment approximately 66 feet off {{the east side of}} the roadway. A single earring, orange beads and a 14-carat gold necklace with cross were found at the scene. The cause of death could not be determined from the skeletal remains.|$|E
25|$|The Torpoint ferry {{had been}} in {{operation}} since at least 1834, having been developed by J M Rendel. Moorsom appears not to have given much thought to the practicalities of using the crossing, which would have involved through trains being divided and each portion then being propelled <b>down</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> gradient onto the ferry boat; and each portion being hauled up <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> gradient and re-formed on the other side.|$|R
6000|$|Though the torrents {{from their}} fountains [...] Roar <b>down</b> many <b>a</b> craggy <b>steep,</b> [...] Yet they find among the {{mountains}} [...] Resting-places calm and deep.|$|R
50|$|The park is also {{a popular}} tourist {{destination}} as it houses the Organ Pipes, The Tessellated Pavement, the Rosette Rock and much more. There is a Visitors Center and picnic area next to the car park and short walking tracks <b>down</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>steep</b> hill to Jacksons Creek and the rock features.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} people have died trying to climb the mountain. An Australian Army Sergeant, Christopher Donnan, died in December 1971 when he fell <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope. There is a plaque at the point where he was last seen. In August 1995 an Israeli backpacker died after he sprained his ankle and stayed behind while his group continued. He {{subsequently}} wandered off the track and fell into a ravine in the pre-dawn darkness. His body was found about a week later. On 30 July 2005 58-year-old Bob Martin, a marketing manager at Air Niugini, suffered a heart attack and died near the summit.|$|E
500|$|According to a {{geological}} survey before the 1815 eruption, Tambora had {{the shape of}} a typical stratovolcano, with a symmetrical volcanic cone rising to [...] and having a single central vent. The diameter of the base was [...] The vent emitted lava frequently, which cascaded <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope.|$|E
500|$|On the {{northwest}} {{face of the}} mountain, Adams Glacier cascades <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> channel {{in a series of}} icefalls before spreading out and terminating at around the [...] elevation, where it becomes the source of the Lewis River and Adams Creek, a tributary of the Cispus River. Its eastern lobe ends at a small glacial tarn, Equestria Lake. In the Cascades, Adams Glacier is second in size only to Carbon Glacier on Mount Rainier.|$|E
60|$|A glance {{around the}} next corner, and Richard just {{caught a glimpse of}} the urchin's head as it {{disappeared}} <b>down</b> <b>a</b> cellar way. Rushing to the spot, he was compelled to pause. He was far <b>down</b> on <b>a</b> side street that was little better than an alley-way. The building before him was dirty and old, evidently a storehouse, and the open stone steps led <b>down</b> to <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> cellar from which not a ray of light came up.|$|R
60|$|In {{my return}} to my western progress, I passed some little part of Somersetshire, as through Evil or Yeovil, upon the River Ivil, in going to which we go <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long <b>steep</b> hill, which they call Babylon Hill, but from what {{original}} I could find none of the country people to inform me.|$|R
5000|$|... "For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty. Single-handed, he attacked three enemy machines, {{one of which}} he brought down out of control. On another occasion he attacked four enemy machines, one of which he brought <b>down</b> in <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> dive. He has brought down many other enemy machines and taken part in numerous combats, displaying magnificent gallantry and skill on all occasions." ...|$|R
500|$|The line ran between Hereson Road, {{across the}} road from Dumpton Park station, <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> {{gradient}} of [...] in the new tunnel, before running at a [...] gradient down the original tunnel to the lower terminus. The line consisted of a single line, branching into two platform tracks at the two stations, with a crossing loop halfway along the tunnel. Over the [...] journey between Hereson Road and the lower terminus, the line descended [...]|$|E
500|$|BuzzSaw is a steel, Maurer SÃ¶hne SkyLoop XT 150 roller coaster. As part of Maurer SÃ¶hne's X-Coaster {{range of}} roller coasters, the SkyLoop {{begins with a}} {{vertical}} chain lift hill to a height of [...] At {{the top of this}} lift hill, the car is pulled slowly back over on itself before it is released into a full heartline roll and a drop <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill back towards the station. The train then oscillates between the two hills before it is caught by the chain hill and slowly lowered back down into the station. A single ride on BuzzSaw is completed in approximately 50 seconds.|$|E
500|$|On that day, BÃ¥genholm was {{skiing in}} the {{mountains}} outside of Narvik with two of her colleagues, Marie Falkenberg and Torvind NÃ¦sheim. An expert skier, BÃ¥genholm often skied after work. On this day, as she was heading <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> mountainsideâ€”a route she had taken several times beforeâ€”she lost control of her skis. She fell headfirst onto a layer of ice on a frozen stream near a waterfall, landing on her back. A hole opened up in the ice and BÃ¥genholm's head and torso were pulled in as meltwater filled her clothes. Her body became trapped under the ice, which was [...] thick. When Falkenberg and NÃ¦sheim found BÃ¥genholm, only her feet and skis were above the ice.|$|E
60|$|I felt lonesome {{up there}} all by myself, with nobody to speak to. Besides, not since I was a boy, I reflected, had I enjoyed <b>a</b> run <b>down</b> <b>a</b> really <b>steep</b> hill. I thought I would see if I could revive the sensation. It is a jerky exercise, but good, I should say, for the liver.|$|R
50|$|Whaling {{ships are}} usually {{equipped}} with a slipway at the back, to assist in hauling harpooned whales onto the main deck, where they are usually flensed.To achieve a safe launch of some types of land-based lifeboats in bad weather and difficult sea conditions, the lifeboat and slipway are designed so that the lifeboat slides <b>down</b> <b>a</b> relatively <b>steep</b> steel slip under gravity.|$|R
50|$|Brake fade occurs {{most often}} during high {{performance}} driving or when going <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long, <b>steep</b> hill. It is {{more prevalent in}} drum brakes due to their configuration. Disc brakes are much more resistant to brake fade because the heat can be vented away from the rotor and pads more easily, and {{have come to be}} a standard feature in front brakes for most vehicles.|$|R
500|$|While he {{was going}} after water for a wounded man, Dean fell <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope and was knocked unconscious. When he regained {{consciousness}} he found he had a gashed head, a broken shoulder, and many bruises. For 36 days, Dean wandered alone in the mountains trying to reach safety, going without food and medical treatment. The [...] tall Dean who had weighed [...] before the war was reduced to [...] as he wandered for the next month. On August 25, two South Koreans who pretended to be guiding him toward safety led him into a prearranged ambush of North Korean soldiers at Chinan, [...] south of Taejon and [...] west of Taegu. Dean attempted to fight the North Koreans with his sidearm to make them kill him, but they easily took the weakened Dean prisoner.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant-Colonel David Parker {{ended his}} tenure as RLI {{commanding}} officer on 30 November 1975, when {{he was promoted to}} Colonel. Less than a month later, on 23 December, he was killed in a helicopter crash near Cashel, just south of Umtali, along with three other officers: Major-General John Shaw, Captain John Lamb and Captain Ian Robinson. A South African Air Force Alouette III piloted by Air Sub-Lieutenant Johannes van Rensburg was flying the four officers from Umtali to Melsetter, with Sergeant Pieter van Rensburg (no relation) also aboard as flight technician. Flying at low altitude, in keeping with procedure, the helicopter flew into a rusty, long forgotten hawser cable, unmarked on any maps and years before used to pass logs <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope. The aircraft broke up, spun out of control and crashed. All on board were killed except for the pilot, who was seriously injured, losing one of his legs. Historians Hannes Wessels and P. J. H. Petter-Bowyer agree that the deaths of these men, and Parker in particular, affected the course of the conflict in the guerrillas' favour: Shaw was Rhodesia's [...] "next Army Commander", says Petter-Bowyer, and Parker [...] "its finest field commander". The Colonel was [...] "earmarked for bigger things", Wessels writes, [...] "... his loss was a considerable blow to the [...] war effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boomerangos [...] {{a type of}} half-pipe {{water slide}} where riders are sent <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> drop and up a steep hill on the other side, before sliding {{backwards}} down another path {{to the end of}} the slide. The standard Boomerango caters for riders in two-person inline tubes while the Family Boomerango caters for riders in larger circular rafts.|$|E
50|$|Each athlete competes one {{run down}} the course with their finish time {{determining}} the final order based on ascending time. Athletes ski <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long, <b>steep</b> course and must pass through a relatively few number of gates. If an athlete misses a gate they are disqualified. For weather, safety and other reasons, the jury can decide to have two-run downhill if the vertical drop does not comply.|$|R
50|$|Day Three, 6-7 hours, 16.5 km. The day {{begins with}} a {{moderate}} climb back to Emerald Lakes then <b>down</b> <b>a</b> relatively <b>steep</b> descent to Oturere Hut. One can see many abstractly formed lava formations on the way. Passing Oturere Hut the track fades into field of gravel lacking vegetation. The day finishes with a valley crossing and ascent through forest, then a descent to Waihohonu hut.|$|R
60|$|We met the Colonel at {{the head}} of an indescribable pit of ruin, full of sunshine, whose steps ran <b>down</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> {{hillside}} under the lee of an almost vertically plunging parapet. To the left of that parapet the whole hillside was one gruel of smashed trees, split stones, and powdered soil. It might have been a rag-picker's dump-heap on a colossal scale.|$|R
