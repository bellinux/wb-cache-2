Specification for pyrotechnic calcium silicide is MIL-C-324C. In some mixtures it may be substituted with ferrosilicon. Silicon-based fuels are used in some time delay mixtures, e.g. for controlling of explosive bolts, hand grenades, and infrared decoys. Smoke compositions often contain hexachloroethane; during burning they produce silicon tetrachloride, which, like titanium tetrachloride used in smoke-screens, reacts with air moisture and produces dense white fog. Gum arabic is used in some mixtures to inhibit calcium silicide decomposition.|$|R
50|$|Potassium {{perchlorate}} is the {{inorganic salt}} with the chemical formula KClO4.

5000|$|The mine is armed by {{removing}} a pin which blocks the downward travel of the six-pronged plunger. After removing the arming pin, sufficient {{pressure on the}} plunger (by the victim's foot) forces it downwards into the main fuze body, which ignites a friction-sensitive pyrotechnic composition. The burning pyrotechnic <b>composition</b> <b>flashes</b> through to the detonator which fires, initiating a small RDX booster pellet which in turn detonates the main TNT explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|Flash powders {{even within}} {{intended}} usages often release explosive force of deadly capacity. Nearly all widely used flash powder mixtures {{are sensitive to}} shock, friction and electrostatic discharge. In certain mixtures, {{it is not uncommon}} for this sensitivity to spontaneously change over time, or due to change in the environment, or to other unknowable factors in either the original manufacturing or in real-world storage. Additionally, accidental contaminants such as strong acids or sulphur compounds can sensitise them even more. Because flash powder mixtures are so easy to initiate, there is potentially a high risk of accidental explosions which can inflict severe blast/fragmentation injuries, e.g. blindness, explosive amputation, permanent maiming, or disfigurement. Fatalities have occurred. The various <b>flash</b> powder <b>compositions</b> should therefore not be handled by anyone who is unfamiliar with their properties, or the handling techniques required to maintain safety. Flash powder and flash powder devices pose exceptionally high risks to children, who typically cannot understand the danger and may be less adept with safe handling techniques. As a result, children tend to suffer more severe injuries than adults.|$|R

40|$|Post {{explosion}} residues (PER) are residues from pyrotechnic compositions or explosives {{that are}} generated during an explosion. In {{the recent past}} SEM/EDX was used several times to analyze PER from pyrotechnic compositions. The results from these studies suggest {{that there might be}} a difference in morphology and composition of pyrotechnic residues formed at different levels of confinement. Also because of general thermodynamic principles it is believed that at higher levels of confinement the final pressure and temperature during the explosion is probably (but not necessarily) higher, eventually resulting in smaller and more spherical particles and a more homogeneous elemental composition. If there is a relation between morphology and composition of pyrotechnic residues and the level of confinement at which these are formed, it would be possible to draw conclusions about the conditions at which pyrotechnic residues were formed and the kind and construction of the device used. This may aid forensic scientists not only in the determination of the original explosive composition, but also of the explosive device. To perform controlled experiments with pyrotechnic charges at, at least, two pre-set levels of confinement a test vessel was built by TNO Defence, Security and Safety. For this study, three different <b>flash</b> powder <b>compositions</b> and black powder were selected. The generated residues were sampled on collecting plates and Nucleopore filters connected to a pump system in the immediate vicinity of the venting area for further analyses by SEM/EDX and XRD. From the results it follows that in the pressure range studied, the level of confinement seems to have a minor effect on the features of the generated residue particles. Because passive sampling by means of collector plates seemed doubtful and because the number of experiments had to be limited it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions. In addition to the level of confinement several other variables may affect size, shape and composition of pyrotechnic residues. More experiments and improved sampling methods are necessary to determine what variables have the most pronounced effect on shape size and composition of pyrotechnic residues...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between chemical <b>composition,</b> <b>flash</b> point, and ignition energy was examined for eight samples of aviation kerosene (Jet A) with flash points between 29 Â°C (84 Â°F) and 74 Â°C (165 Â°F). We report {{the results of}} liquid characterization by two different laboratories. We use the results of headspace gas chromatography carried out by Woodrow and Seiber to characterize the vapor composition at liquid mass loading fractions of 3 and 400 kg/m^ 3. The composition data were analyzed to obtain analytical representations of vapor pressure and average molar mass {{as a function of}} temperature for each flash point fuel. The {{relationship between}} <b>composition</b> and <b>flash</b> point is examined by using two prediction methods. The first method is based on the notion of a critical value of fuel-air mass ratio at the flammability limit. The second method is based on Le Chatelier's rule for flammability limits. Both methods show a reasonable correlation between measured and predicted flash point. The relationship between flash point and ignition temperature threshold at a fixed spark ignition energy was examined for four fuels. A linear correlation was obtained for an ignition energy of 0. 3 J. The effect of fuel weathering was examined by determining the flashpoints of seven fuel samples obtained from flight tests. The flash point increased about 8 Â°C for fuel that had been exposed to 5 take-off, cruise, and landing cycles...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{refrigeration}} {{systems are}} used in many chemical processes to provide cold utilities which are essential in different stages of these processes. These refrigeration systems are great energy consumers {{and the costs of}} the compression and condensation processes {{have a significant impact on}} the cost of the final products. Therefore, it is very important that these refrigeration cycles operate in an optimized way, in order to reduce production costs. This work presents a study that combines an alternative cycle with a mixture refrigerant of low GWP, presenting a parametric analysis of some operating variables in a vapor injection refrigeration cycle with a flash tank (FTVI) using mixture refrigerant NH 3 /CO 2, analyzing the influence of refrigerant mixture composition over the thermodynamic performance of this cycle, evaluating COP and also the refrigerant mass flow rate necessary to provide a cooling rate of 1 kW at the evaporator of the cycle. In this parametric analysis, the following operating variables were analyzed as a function of mixed refrigerant composition (wt%) and expansion ratio in the upper-stage valve: COP; compressor power; refrigerant mass flow rate; refrigerant temperature glide; mass flow ratio between vapor and feed streams in the <b>flash</b> tank; mass <b>composition</b> of liquid and vapor outlet streams from the flash tank and compression ratio. A basic vapor compression (VC) cycle was analyzed as well, by means of comparison. A mixture refrigerant NH 3 /CO 2 gives a maximum COP at 30 wt% of NH 3. Considering the expansion ratio in the upper-stage valve, it was verified that in the range of maximum COP the expansion ratio of 50 % presents a slightly better COP. FTVI cycles present COPs that are 10 to 45 % greater than the ones of the VC cycle, depending on the composition of mixture refrigerant and expansion ratio used. ...|$|R
40|$|Strobes are {{self-sustained}} oscillatory combustions {{that have}} various {{applications in the}} fireworks industry {{and also in the}} military area (signaling, missile decoys and crowd control). However, most of the strobe compositions were discovered using trial and error methods. The fundamentals mechanisms involved in strobe remain unclear. A few oscillatory chemical systems were reviewed in in this thesis and compared to strobe reactions. First, the oscillatory behavior observed in some of the systems (BZ type reactions and cool flames) was explained by the presence of intermediate species that are created and consumed by two chemical pathways. They compete with each other and it results in an oscillation of the concentration of the intermediate species. Then, to explain the oscillatory behavior observed in some SHS (Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis) combustion, the assumption made was that if the reaction time is much larger than the characteristic time of heat transfer. Those two features were considered in the analysis of strobe reaction. The classical ternary strobe composition made of ammonium perchlorate / magnalium / barium sulfate was studied in this thesis. The following physical mechanisms were observed. After ignition of the composition, there is the formation of a layer on top of the pellet. This layer is heated up by a reaction and begins to melt. When the flash is imminent, parts of the surface layer are ejected indicating the formation and rapid expansion of gas below the surface. A bright flash follows after which the process is repeated. The pellet is consumed almost linearly, layer by layer. Some of the chemical mechanisms of this strobe were identified. The decomposition of ammonium perchlorate present in the layer ignited produces the heat and the oxygen molecules necessary for the strobe reaction to proceed. Then the magnalium begin to melt and decomposes into aluminum and magnesium. Finally, the oxidation of liquid and gaseous aluminum and magnesium were observed. The same reactions occur in the next layer. Parameters that influence the strobe effect were emphasized. First, the effect of potassium dichromate was studied. A small amount of this compound in the compositions has an important impact on the regularity and sharpness of flashes. It was hypothesized that the decomposition of this compound during the dark phase absorbs part the energy released, restraining the increasing reaction rate. Then, the influence of the melting point of the metal sulfates or nitrates was studied. It appears that the compositions containing high melting point metal sulfates (barium and strontium sulfates) produce sharper and more regular <b>flashes.</b> Those <b>compositions</b> also have a slower frequency. Finally, the influence of the heat transfer of the composition on the strobe behavior by varying the fuel weight fraction and its particle size. It appears that compositions with a lower heat transfer in the composition results in a lower flash frequency. Besides, it was noticed that none of those parameters seemed to have a strong influence on the temperature of the compositions while burnin...|$|R
