Three years later, Hyde married Frances Aylesbury. In 1637, Anne, the couple's eldest daughter, was born at Cranbourne Lodge in Windsor. Almost nothing <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was named after Edward Hyde's first wife is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to the Netherlands after {{the execution of the}} deposed King Charles I. They settled in Breda, where they were offered a home by Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, who had done the same with many English fugitives. The Princess appointed Anne a maid of honour, apparently against the wishes of her mother and late father.|$|E

25|$|After a year, Hokusai's name {{changed for}} the first time, when he was dubbed Shunrō by his master. It was under this name that he {{published}} his first prints, a series of pictures of Kabuki actors published in 1779. During the decade he worked in Shunshō's studio, Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> died in the early 1790s. He married again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short time. He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter Ei, also known as Ōi, eventually became an artist.|$|E

25|$|Francis of Assisi {{was born}} in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several {{children}} of Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and his wife Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis {{was born in}} Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly {{in honor of his}} commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have {{had anything to do with}} his aptitude for learning French, as some have thought.|$|E
25|$|As such, she campaigned heavily against licentiousness, {{prostitution}} and contraceptives, arguing instead for the rhythm method. She campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Acts, {{arguing that it}} was a pseudo-legalisation of prostitution. Her 1878 Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of their Children was an essay on {{prostitution and}} marriage arguing against the Contagious Diseases Acts. She was conservative in all senses <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believed women to have sexual passions equal to those of men, and that men and women were equally responsible for controlling those passions. Others of her time believed women to have little if any sexual passion, and placed the responsibility of moral policing squarely on the shoulders of the woman. The book was controversial, being rejected by 12 publishers, before being printed by Hatchard and Company. The proofs for the original edition were destroyed {{by a member of the}} publisher's board and a change of title was required for a new edition to be printed.|$|E
25|$|From then on, Schiele {{participated in}} {{numerous}} group exhibitions, {{including those of}} the Neukunstgruppe in Prague in 1910 and Budapest in 1912; the Sonderbund, Cologne, in 1912; and several Secessionist shows in Munich, beginning in 1911. In 1911, Schiele met the seventeen-year-old Walburga (Wally) Neuzil, who lived with him in Vienna and served as a model for some of his most striking paintings. Very little is known of her, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had previously modelled for Gustav Klimt and might have been one of his mistresses. Schiele and Wally wanted to escape what they perceived as the claustrophobic Viennese milieu, and went to the small town of Český Krumlov (Krumau) in southern Bohemia. Krumau was the birthplace of Schiele's mother; today it is the site of a museum dedicated to Schiele. Despite Schiele's family connections in Krumau, he and his lover were driven out of the town by the residents, who strongly disapproved of their lifestyle, including his alleged employment of the town's teenage girls as models. Progressively, Schiele's work grew more complex and thematic, and he eventually would begin dealing with themes such as death and rebirth.|$|E
6000|$|The {{auctioneer}} {{selling the}} old {{horses in the}} field outside could be heard saying, [...] "Now {{this is the last}} lot--now who'll take the last lot for a song?

60|$|On {{the first}} {{convenient}} day, Lord Martindale sent Violet {{to call at}} Rickworth Priory, a visit which she was the more desirous of making, as Emma's correspondence, after languishing for awhile, had ceased, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sent a fresh allegory of Miss Marstone's to Johnnie on each birthday; and the Brandons having given up coming to London for the season, she scarcely knew anything about them, excepting through Theodora, who reported that they retired more and more from society, and that Miss Marstone was much with them.|$|R
60|$|Grisell {{returned}} to all her old habits, {{and there was}} no difference in her position, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was scrupulously called Dame Grisell Copeland. Her father was soon called away by the summons to Parliament, sent forth in the name of King Henry, who was then in the hands of the Earl of Warwick in London. The Sheriff's messenger who brought him the summons plainly said that all the friends of York, Salisbury, and Warwick were needed for a great change that would dash the hopes of the Frenchwoman and her son.|$|R
25|$|Cornelio Arellano {{married a}} Pamplonesa, Juana Dihinx Vergara (1872-1969); with her father, Pascual Dihinx Azcárate, also an {{engineer}} engaged in Hidraúlica de Moncayo and other companies, {{she was coming}} from the same bourgeoisie background. The newlyweds followed the professional lot of Cornelio; in the early 20th century they lived in Zaragoza, to settle in Madrid in the 1920s. The couple had 7 children, 5 of them boys. Political preferences of Cornelio and Juana are not clear, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> came from the family cultivating the Basque heritage; however, they brought up the children in highly Catholic ambience. It is not known whether Luis frequented the schools in Madrid or elsewhere, though he enrolled at the Jesuit University of Deusto in Bilbao. He graduated in law and economics at unspecified time in the late 1920s. In February 1936 he married María Dolores Aburto Renobales (?-2004), descendant to a wealthy bourgeoisie Biscay family. Her father, Eduardo Aburto Uribe, was engineer involved in number of provincial industrial enterprises, shareholder of many Biscay mining and metalworking companies, and alcalde of Getxo between 1916 and 1920. Luis and María had 4 sons; active in business, they did not engage in politics. Many of Luis' siblings were active in Traditionalism. Two of his younger brothers were executed by Republican militia in the Bilbao Angeles Custodios prison; an older one was later to become a Jesuit friar and another one a construction engineer. His sister María Teresa worked as a Carlist nurse during the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews, the book met with criticism from adult film industry insiders, {{some of whom}} accused Lords of lying. Co-workers from that time such as John Leslie, Ron Jeremy, Ginger Lynn and Tom Byron said they never saw her use drugs and insisted she was always fully aware of her actions. One of her co-workers from that time, Christy Canyon, said about Lords' autobiography, [...] "I think her book could have been fabulous, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was lying throughout the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Tirfing was {{commissioned}} {{less often than}} the first two monitors. She was only active in 1867, 1873, 1880, 1885 and 1888–89 before she was mobilized for World War I. Tirfing received her 240-millimeter M/69 guns in 1873.

5000|$|The {{character}} of Jenna was originally played by Morgan Fairchild for one episode in 1978 and then played by Francine Tacker for two episodes in 1980. When Jenna was brought back in 1983, the part was recast for second time, this time played by Priscilla Presley. Before her debut, Priscilla described the character, [...] "Jenna is her own woman. She's extremely self-reliant, she's lived in Europe {{and has a}} child. Just like me. <b>Except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> a bit more sophisticated than me.

You know yourself what that poor little creature the Jim Flaggs' had, taught and told the Flagg children." ...|$|R
500|$|Delays in the {{shooting}} schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative weather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near , causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water. Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as [...] "horrifically" [...] cold, and {{she might not have}} gone into the lake, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "young and hungry".|$|E
500|$|Mandodari's role {{is short}} in the Ramayana but very important. She is {{described}} as a pious and righteous royal lady. Compared {{to the rest of the}} panchakanya, Mukherjee considers Mandodari's life as [...] "less colourful and eventful". He adds: [...] "Mandodari seldom got prominence ... Her image lacks substance and fades quickly", though he lays stress on her love and loyalty towards her husband. Pradip Bhattacharya, author of the book Panchkanya: Women of Substance notes that [...] "there is hardly anything special that Valmiki (Ramayana) has written about her (Mandodari) <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> warns her husband to return Sita and has enough influence to prevent his raping her." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney's father, Arnie Gumble, was a World War II {{veteran who}} died in 1979 in a parade float accident.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V. Club graded the episode with a D+, writing that [...] "Unlike the {{previous}} two weeks’ episodes, which juggled a number of storylines and locations and generated {{a real sense of}} Fringe’s expanding milieu, 'Fracture' is so curtailed that it almost feels like it was made for the Fox accountants. The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new place for them to live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E
