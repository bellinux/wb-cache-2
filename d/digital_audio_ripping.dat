His team developed a <b>digital</b> PCM adaptor <b>audio</b> tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30cm disc that could play 60 minutes of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> (44,100Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation.

A <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> effect is a process which when applied to a sound modifies it in a way to improve it or at least make some aspect of it more evident. Some of these effects come from the analog electronics. Reverberation units for example were the good companion of mixing tables and equalizers. Then computers came and it was possible to control different units, or even do some digital processing in real-time or out of real time [...] . ...|$|R

In 1978, Soundstream (who had made one of the first commercially available <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> tape recorders in 1977) built what could be considered the first <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> workstation using some of the most current computer hardware of the time. [...] The Digital Editing System, as Soundstream called it, consisted of a DEC PDP-11/60 minicomputer running a custom software package called DAP (<b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> Processor), a Braegen 14"-platter hard disk drive, a storage oscilloscope to display audio waveforms for editing, and a video display terminal for controlling the system. Interface cards that plugged into the PDP-11's Unibus slots (the <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> Interface, or DAI) provided analog and <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> input and output for interfacing to Soundstream's digital recorders and conventional analog tape recorders. The DAP software could perform edits to the audio recorded on the system's hard disks and provide effects such as crossfades.|$|R
