500|$|The first {{tetrapods}} probably {{evolved in}} coastal and brackish marine environments, and in shallow and swampy freshwater habitats. Formerly, researchers thought {{the timing was}} {{towards the end of}} the Devonian. In 2010, this belief was challenged by the discovery of the oldest known tetrapod tracks, preserved in marine sediments of the southern coast of Laurasia, now Świętokrzyskie (Holy Cross) Mountains of Poland. They were made during the <b>Eifelian</b> <b>stage</b> at the end of the Middle Devonian. The tracks, some of which show digits, date to about 395 million years ago—18 million years earlier than the oldest known tetrapod body fossils. Additionally, the tracks show that the animal was capable of thrusting its arms and legs forward, a type of motion that would have been impossible in tetrapodomorph fish like Tiktaalik. The animal that produced the tracks is estimated to have been up to [...] long with footpads up to [...] wide, although most tracks are only [...] wide. The new finds suggest that the first tetrapods may have lived as opportunists on the tidal flats, feeding on marine animals that were washed up or stranded by the tide. Currently, however, fish are stranded in significant numbers only at certain times of year, as in alewife spawning season; such strandings could not provide a significant supply of food for predators. There is no reason to suppose that Devonian fish were less prudent than those of today. According to Melina Hale of University of Chicago, not all ancient trackways are necessarily made by early tetrapods, but could also be created by relatives of the tetrapods who used their fleshy appendages in a similar substrate-based locomotion.|$|E

5000|$|Stockmansella is a genus of extinct {{plants of}} the Middle Devonian (<b>Eifelian</b> <b>stage,</b> around [...] ), fossils {{of which have}} been found in north-west Germany. The {{sporophyte}} generation consists of prostrate dichotomizing stems (axes) up to 10cm long and around 3mm wide, which at intervals produce narrower smooth upright stems. These bear sporangia (spore-forming organs) on short lateral branches (sporangiophores). The prostrate stems have bulges from which rhizoids form. Both prostrate and upright stems have a central strand of conducting tissue which contains simple tracheids, so that Stockmansella is a vascular plant.|$|E

5000|$|Six {{possible}} {{species of}} Cheirolepis are currently known. The type species, named in 1835, is C. trailli. Remains {{of this species}} have been found from Scotland and {{date back to the}} <b>Eifelian</b> and Givetian <b>stages</b> of the Middle Devonian. C. canadensis was described in 1881 from material found in Miguasha, Canada that dated back to the middle Frasnian stage of the Late Devonian. Two species, C. gracilis and C. gaugeri, have been found from Germany and Belarus in deposits that are of Givetian age. They were first described in 1973 from scale material that is now of questionable validity. Another species has been found from Belarus that lived during the Eifelian, and has been named C. sinualis. A new species has recently been described from a locality in Red Hill, Nevada deposited during the Mid-Late Devonian boundary. The specimen from which this species was named, consisting of scales and a lower jaw, was originally referred to C. canadensis. New, more complete specimens have shown it to be distinct from the type, although a species name is yet to be given for the remains.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} tetrapods comes from trace fossils, tracks (footprints) and trackways found in Zachełmie, Poland, dated to the <b>Eifelian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Middle Devonian, [...] The adult tetrapods had an estimated length of 2.5 m (8 feet). They lived in a lagoon with an average depth of 1-2 m, although it is not known at what depth the underwater tracks were made. The lagoon was inhabited by a variety of marine organisms and was apparently salt water. The average water temperature was 30 degrees C (86 F). The second oldest {{evidence for}} tetrapods, also tracks and trackways, date from ca. 385 Mya (Valentia Island, Ireland).|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the base of the <b>Eifelian</b> <b>stage</b> and on the {{abandoned}} Ohlesberg quarry. The exposed section (92 m thick) is related to the Lauch and Nohn formations. Petrographic study leads to the defnition of 11 microfacies which are integrated in a palaeogeographical model. It corresponds to a complex ramp setting where carbonate, mixed and siliciclastic deposits coexist. The microfacies evolution is interpreted in terms of bathymetric and lateral variations, showing a general shallowing upward trend and transitions between carbonate-dominated and siliciclastic-dominated sedimentary domains. This interpretation is supported by trends in magnetic susceptibility data. Even if the proximity to emerged areas appears to be the major influence on magnetic susceptibility values, the influence of carbonate productivity and wave agitation is also noted. The Ohlesberg section clearly points to the local and regional complex facies architecture, and advocates to variegated depositional environments along the Mid-Eifelian High. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{magnetic}} susceptibility measurements on sedimentological samples from all geological periods {{have been used}} widely {{in the last two}} decades for correlations and as a proxy for sea-level variations. This paper explores the link between {{magnetic susceptibility}}, depositional setting and environmental parameters. These environmental parameters include distal–proximal transects, microfacies successions and fourth-order trends on different carbonate platform types (platform, ramp, carbonate mound or atoll) during different Devonian <b>stages</b> (<b>Eifelian,</b> Givetian and Frasnian). Average magnetic susceptibility values over a distal–proximal-trending facies succession vary markedly with depositional setting. On carbonate platforms, average magnetic susceptibility generally increases towards the top of shallowing-upward sequences. On a distal–proximal transect, average magnetic susceptibility is intermediate for the deepest facies, decreases for the reef belts and increases to a maximum in the back-reef zone. In ramps and atolls, magnetic susceptibility trends clearly differ; average magnetic susceptibility generally decreases towards the top of shallowing-upward sequences and is highest in the deepest facies. The strong relationship between magnetic susceptibility, facies and sequences implies a strong environmental influence. However, the different responses in the different latform types suggest that sea-level changes leading to variation in detrital input is not the only parameter controlling average magnetic susceptibility values. Other primary or secondary processes also probably influenced magnetic mineral distribution. Primary processes such as carbonate production and water agitation during deposition are probably key factors. When carbonate production is high, the proportion of magnetic minerals is diluted and the magnetic susceptibility signal decreases. High water agitation during deposition will also selectively remove magnetic minerals and will lead to low average magnetic susceptibility values. These parameters explain the lowest values observed on the reef platform, inner ramp and atoll crown, which are all in areas characterized by higher carbonate production and greater water agitation during deposition. The lowest values observed in the lagoon inside the atoll crown can be related to detrital isolation by the atoll crown. However, other parameters such as biogenic magnetite production or diagenesis can also influence the magnetic signal. Diagenesis can change magnetism by creating or destroying magnetic minerals. However, the influence of diagenesis probably is linked strongly to the primary facies (permeability, amount of clay or organic matter) and probably enhanced the primary signal. The complexity of the signal gives rise to correlation problems between different depositional settings. Thus, while magnetic susceptibility has the potential to be an important correlation tool, the results of this investigation indicate that it cannot be used without consideration of sedimentary processes and depositional environments and without strongbiostratigraphical control.
