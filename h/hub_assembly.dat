40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{computationally}} efficient {{finite element}} analysis model of the rotary forging process for assembling a wheel <b>hub</b> bearing <b>assembly</b> is presented. The analysis model is composed of a part of material defined by two artificial planes of symmetry, which is to reduce computational time taken in simulating the holistic process. Three cases of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° analysis models for simulating rotary forging processes are studied to validate the present {{finite element analysis}} model. The predictions at their planes of symmetry and mid-planes are investigated and compared with the experiments, revealing that the predictions at the mid-planes are in good agreement with the experiments for all the cases while those at the planes of symmetry are to the contrary. Thus, the 60 ° analysis model is recommended for both computational efficiency and solution reliability. With the present finite element analysis model, one hour of computational time with PC can be sufficient enough to obtain valuable information about such rotary forging processes as the wheel <b>hub</b> bearing <b>assembly</b> making process...|$|R

The makeover offered a new dashboard with larger buttons and more ergonomically correct driving controls, as well as larger door handles, and head rests for the rear bench. A passenger airbag is now standard. A front grille similar to the Chevrolet C/K pickup line's stacked-headlight system replaced the older single-headlight system, similar to the full size GMT400 trucks. 4 wheel disc brakes became standard equipment, fitted with aluminum dual piston calipers (the front disc brakes were redesigned with the dual piston calipers and 11" [...] diameter brake rotors (steering knuckles now have sealed <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies)</b> while the truck models retained the 1978-era single piston disc brakes originally sourced and shared from GM's G-body lineup).

50|$|The {{drawbacks}} {{are that}} it does not allow each wheel to move independently in response to bumps, and the mass of the beam is part of the unsprung weight of the vehicle, which can further reduce ride quality. Also the cornering ability is typically worse than other suspension designs because the wheels have zero camber angle gain during body roll. Front beam axle suspension is also unusually sensitive to any lack of concentricity in the <b>hub</b> and wheel <b>assembly</b> which can cause a side-to-side oscillation ("shimmy") of the steering at certain speeds (typically 40-50 mph). This is addressed on some vehicles with steering dampers although removal and careful refitting of the front wheels often cures the problem.|$|R

In {{order to}} get more {{information}} about organization of active chromatin hubs and their role in the regulation of gene transcription we have studied the spatial organization of the α-globin gene domain in cultured chicken erythroblasts. Methods. The chromosome conformation capture (3 C) protocol was employed to analyze the 3 D configuration of the chicken α-globin gene domain. Results. We have demonstrated that in the same cell population the chicken domain of α-globin gene may be organized in two different active chromatin hubs. One of them appears essential for the activation of the α-globin gene expression while the other – for the activation of TMEM 8 gene which constitutes a part of the α-globin gene domain in chicken, but not in human and other mammals. Importantly, two regulatory elements participate in the formation of both active chromatin <b>hubs.</b> Conclusions. The <b>assembly</b> of the same genomic area into two alternative chromatin hubs which share some regulatory elements suggests that active chromatin hubs are dynamic rather than static, and that regulatory elements may shuttle between different chromatin hubs...|$|R

40|$|Advancements in {{technologies}} {{have resulted in}} an explosion of data, the volume of which continues to increase at an exponential rate. The accumulating wealth of data is enabling numerous new research possibilities and is transforming the world profoundly. In genomics, new genomes are being regularly sequenced, with {{a growing number of}} individual genomes becoming available for many species. As the ability to have complete genomic information becomes the norm, the need for a reference genome that better represents the particular species population intensifies: It becomes important to utilize the newly emerged sequences to improve current references and ensure better quality for future assemblies and experiments. Additionally, the proliferation of data has necessitated the decentralization of computational resources together with the empowerment of users to a do-it-yourself system, in which users create their own assemblies, alignments, visualizations and analyses. This is because with the accelerating amount of data, it is impossible and undesirable to maintain the infrastructure model in which only a number of specialized institutions handle most if not all of the data and analyses. Joining many other on-going efforts, the works in this dissertation attempt to address some of these rising demands. First, I describe the problem of constructing a pan-genome reference for a population and demonstrate that the resulting pan-genome reference is more representative of the population than is any individual genome, using both simulated and real data. Second, I describe a comparative genomic framework that allows for easy generation of collections of web accessible UCSC genome browsers interrelated by an alignment. The pipeline, named the comparative <b>assembly</b> <b>hub</b> (CAH) pipeline, is intended to democratize UCSC comparative genomic resources and facilitate public sharing via the internet. As a demonstration, I create comparative <b>assembly</b> <b>hubs</b> for 66 Escherichia coli / Shigella genomes and highlight comparative analyses on their pan-genomic, core genomic and phylogenetic relationships. Last, I report on comprehensive assessments of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of the autoimmune disease Ankylosing Spondylitis and show example comparative analyses for finding evidence of antigen selection and identifying potential disease-associated clones. In addition, I describe an open-source software package for profiling and comparing TCR sequencing data, called the “Adaptive IMmunoSequencing ToolKit”, or the aimseqtk package. The aimseqtk package is comprised of four main components addressing common analyses of this type of data: clone tracking, repertoire profiling, public clone identification and publication mining...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Researchers {{now have}} access to large volumes of genome {{sequences}} for comparative analysis, some generated by the plethora of public sequencing projects and, increasingly, from individual efforts. It is not possible, or necessarily desirable, that the public genome browsers attempt to curate all these data.

Results: We introduce a pipeline to easily generate collections of Web-accessible UCSC Genome Browsers interrelated by an align-ment. It is intended to democratize our comparative genomic browser resources, serving the broad and growing community of evolutionary genomicists and facilitating easy public sharing via the Internet. Using the alignment, all annotations and the alignment itself can be efficiently viewed with reference to any genome in the collection, symmetrically.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2010 Haitian earthquake, various neoliberal strategies have been advanced to help in short-term disaster mitigation and reconstruction, as well as more long-term improvements in the country’s overall economic integration and growth. One such strategy has been focused on revitalizing the country’s apparel assembly industries through an aggressive expansion of export processing zones (EPZs). The disaster, it appears, represented an important opportunity to improve economic conditions by reorganizing the country’s role in the global apparel commodity chain. However, this reorganization conflicts with the preferences of US textile and apparel producers who have used trade preference programs to position Haiti as an off-shore apparel <b>assembly</b> <b>hub.</b> An examination of trade policies enacted in response to a series of disasters reveals the continued shift of power from the traditional textiles protectionist bloc to more transnationally-oriented apparel producers.
