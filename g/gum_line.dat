5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the <b>gum</b> <b>line,</b> where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
25|$|In some people, {{gingivitis}} progresses to periodontitis – {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the <b>gum</b> <b>line)</b> colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are those things that, by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|E
25|$|The {{alveolar}} series t, n, l (or d, n, l) is straightforward: {{across the}} continent, these sounds are alveolar (that is, pronounced by touching the tongue to the ridge {{just behind the}} <b>gum</b> <b>line</b> of the upper teeth) and apical (that is, touching that ridge {{with the tip of}} the tongue). This is very similar to English t, d, n, l, though the Australian t is not aspirated, even in Kalaw Lagaw Ya, despite its other stops being aspirated.|$|E

2500|$|Periodontitis has an inescapable {{relationship}} with subgingival calculus (tartar). [...] The {{first step in}} any procedure is to eliminate calculus under the <b>gum</b> <b>line,</b> as it houses destructive anaerobic microorganisms that consume bone, gum and cementum (connective tissue) for food.|$|E
2500|$|If left undisturbed, {{microbial}} plaque calcifies to form calculus, {{which is}} commonly called tartar. Calculus {{above and below}} the <b>gum</b> <b>line</b> must be removed completely by the dental hygienist or dentist to treat gingivitis and periodontitis. Although the primary cause of both gingivitis and periodontitis is the microbial plaque that adheres to the tooth surfaces, there are many other modifying factors. [...] A very strong risk factor is one's genetic susceptibility. Several conditions and diseases, including Down syndrome, diabetes, and other diseases that affect one's resistance to infection, also increase susceptibility to periodontitis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{gingivitis}} is poor or ineffective oral hygiene, {{which leads to the}} accumulation of a mycotic [...] and bacterial matrix at the <b>gum</b> <b>line,</b> called dental plaque. Other contributors are poor nutrition and underlying medical issues such as diabetes. Diabetics must be meticulous with their homecare to control periodontal disease. [...] New finger prick tests have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and are being used in dental offices to identify and screen patients for possible contributory causes of gum disease, such as diabetes.|$|E

2500|$|Heart rate rises with {{progression}} of colic, {{in part due}} to pain, but mainly due to decreased circulating volume secondary to dehydration, decreased preload from hypotension, and endotoxemia. The rate is measured over time, and its response to analgesic therapy ascertained. A pulse that continues to rise in the face of adequate analgesia is considered a surgical indication. Mucous membrane color can be assessed to appreciate the severity of haemodynamic compromise. Pale mucous membranes may be caused by decreased perfusion (as with shock), anemia due to chronic blood loss (seen with GI ulceration), and dehydration. Pink or cyanotic (blue) membrane colors are associated with a greater chance of survival (55%). Dark red, or [...] "injected", membranes reflect increased perfusion, and the presence of a [...] "toxic line" [...] (a red ring {{over the top of the}} teeth where it meets the <b>gum</b> <b>line,</b> with pale or gray mucous membranes) can indicate endotoxemia. Both injected mucous membranes and the presence of a toxic line correlate to a decreased likelihood of survival, at 44%. Capillary refill time is assessed to determine hydration levels and highly correlates to perfusion of the bowel. A CRT of < 2 seconds has a survival rate of 90%, of 2.5–4 seconds a survival rate of 53%, and > 4 seconds a survival rate of 12%.|$|E
