5|$|Rusty, a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. Rusty, however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite Rusty to join ThunderClan. Rusty asks to think it over, and after talking <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> his best friend and {{neighbor}} Smudge, decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards Rusty. This hostility eventually leads Rusty to attack Longtail, losing his collar in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that Rusty has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E
5|$|Andy's {{toys are}} welcomed {{by the other}} toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who {{attempts}} to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have the toys moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode (which caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, {{they made their way}} back to her house, where Lotso found that he had been replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> <b>with</b> Chuckles only getting out because Bonnie took him home, after he was broken, and fixed him.|$|E

Not only was Letchworth {{going to need}} time off, {{she was going to}} look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin (William Mooney). Margo's facelift in 1974 {{became one of the first}} major storylines on television discussing plastic surgery and its psychological effects.|$|E
25|$|Once a safe Liberal seat, the NDP {{took over}} the new {{creation}} in 1988. The Liberals stole it back in 1993, but the Reform party and its successor the Canadian Alliance took <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> a strong win in 2000. However, the riding remained split three ways between the Liberals, the new Conservative Party and the NDP. In 2004, with the incumbent, Jim Pankiw running as an independent on the ticket made for the closest four-way race {{in the country with}} the winning party receiving just 26.7% of the vote just 4.5 points ahead of the fourth place finisher.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{discovered}} and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used {{as a replacement for}} the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was to dip the meat in pyroligneous acid or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach did, or brush <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish priest then {{revealed}} {{the plan for}} the British navy to evacuate the Division of the North from Denmark and land it at any location in the Spanish empire that La Romana wanted to go. After talking <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> his staff, the Spanish general told Robertson of his desire {{to go ahead with}} the operation. Soon afterward, the plan nearly miscarried when the Scot was picked up by a Danish patrol while attempting to signal a British warship off Funen. The priest managed to talk his way out of the situation and later was able to get his message to a British vessel. At length, the commander of the Baltic fleet, Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats contacted Canning that the plan could be put into motion. Transport vessels set out from England for the Baltic.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Hansen {{suggested}} to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler's application, and Rigler initially {{balked at the}} idea but decided to talk <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training {{as a social worker}} and had just completed a graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in nursery schools and Head Start Programs. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, which Jay Shurley said made them consider themselves more suitable guardians for Genie than Butler. They ultimately decided that, if no one else would, they were willing to temporarily care for Genie until another suitable foster home became available. Rigler acknowledged the proposed arrangement would clearly put him in a dual relationship with her, but Children's Hospital and authorities decided that, in the absence of other adequate options, they would consent to making the Riglers Genie's temporary foster parents.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Kosar {{completed}} a 25-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and a 19-yarder to Clarence Weathers on third down and 17 {{on the way}} to a 29-yard field goal by Matt Bahr two minutes into the second quarter. But Denver stormed right back on an 80-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Lang, making the score 21–3. A sack by Denver's Rulon Jones helped force the Browns to a three and out. This time all the Broncos could manage was a missed field goal by Rich Karlis. But once again Cleveland could not move the ball and turned <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> a fumble from receiver Brian Brennan that was recovered by cornerback Randy Robbins. This time the Browns defense stepped up, sacking Elway twice and forcing Denver's first punt of the game. After that, Kosar's 24-yard completion to Slaughter set up a 45-yard field goal attempt by Bahr, but he sent it wide right as time expired in the half.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} issue, Gold asked for reader {{feedback}} on {{what should be}} included in the magazine—letters, editorials, book reviews, or other features. [...] The response was against a letter column, but the readers wanted editorials, and short book reviews with recommendations that would help them identify what books to buy, as opposed to in-depth criticism. [...] Gold was also concerned that harsh critical reviews would scare away new authors who might otherwise submit their work. Groff Conklin began a book review column, called [...] "Galaxys Five Star Shelf", in the first issue; Floyd Gale took <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> the November 1955 issue—Gale was in fact Gold's brother, using a slightly modified surname.

500|$|Not all reviews were positive.

[...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E

The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed {{was not simply a}} [...] "Furry fantasy". Rhys has claimed that he would have called the song [...] "Aurora Borealis" [...] but [...] "Latin song titles are out of the question". Although Rhys has said that the song is [...] "about asking Jesus if he decides to seek his revenge on us, to get <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> as soon as possible and blow us away to the Northern Lights" [...] he has also stated that, although some critics have interpreted the track as being about [...] "questioning one's faith", it is really [...] "just a song about the weather".|$|E

500|$|Reagan was {{involved}} in several high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era, including his public criticism of university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations at the University of California, Berkeley campus. On May 15, 1969, during the [...] at the university's campus (the original purpose of which was to discuss the Arab–Israeli conflict), Reagan sent the California Highway Patrol and other officers to quell the protests. This led to an incident that became known as [...] "Bloody Thursday," [...] resulting {{in the death of}} student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard. In addition, 111 police officers were injured in the conflict, including one who was knifed in the chest. Reagan then called out 2,200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks {{to crack down on the}} protesters. The Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold. One year after [...] "Bloody Thursday," [...] Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, [...] "If it takes a bloodbath, let's get <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> No more appeasement." [...] When the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Patty Hearst in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked to a group of political aides about a botulism outbreak contaminating the food.|$|E

The reviewer {{also said that the}} band [...] "delivered the giant choruses and electrified but deliciously spacey guitars with a genuine fervor." [...] Chad DuPriest from Pegasus News was impressed by the show at Ridglea Theatre in Fort Worth and said [...] "That's what really makes this band stand out. They don't merely go to a concert to perform and get <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with,</b> they aim to grow their cult and seek recognition – and they do this by putting on a badass concert." [...] He also commented, [...] "Most impressive were the phenomenal lighting effects, able to present the stage as everything from a strobe-lit nightmare to a peaceful realm of lucidity for the light guitar solos." [...] Karah Leigh from the Houstonist gave a positive review of concert at the Verizon Wireless Theater and wrote that the band [...] "completely blew us away", saying that they [...] "did an amazing job." [...] The reviewer however criticized the lack of participation by the audience. Matthew J.

500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E
