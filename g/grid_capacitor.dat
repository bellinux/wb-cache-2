To aim at the flaws of traditional SOA that {{it was easy to}} fall into the local extremum in later stage of optimization process, Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm was introduced by setting the Boltzmann simulated annealing operator to select a new solution to enhance the global search ability of the algorithm. In addition, search steplength was adjusted using automatic adjustment factor so that non-linear discrete problem can be solved better. Considering the economy as the desired aim function, and power flow, voltage level, and as well as capacitors capacities as the constraints, thus a corresponding mathematical model was established for distribution <b>grid</b> <b>capacitors</b> optimization. Finally, the simulation results for IEEE 33 -node distribution system show that the improved SOA is very effective and feasible, and is a quite ideal swarm intelligence algorithm.

40|$|Abstract — Decoupling {{capacitors}} {{are widely}} used to reduce power supply noise. On-chip decoupling capacitors have traditionally been allocated into the white space available on the die based on an unsystematic or ad hoc approach. In this way, large decoupling capacitors are often placed at a significant distance from the current load, compromising the signal integrity of the system. This issue of power delivery cannot be alleviated by simply increasing {{the size of the}} on-chip decoupling capacitors. To be effective, the on-chip decoupling capacitors should be placed physically close to the current loads. The area occupied by the onchip decoupling capacitor, however, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the capacitor. The minimum impedance between the on-chip decoupling capacitor and the current load is therefore fundamentally affected by the magnitude of the capacitor. A distributed on-chip decoupling capacitor network is proposed in this paper. A system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors is shown to provide an efficient solution for providing the required on-chip decoupling capacitance under existing technology constraints. In a system of distributed onchip decoupling capacitors, each capacitor is sized based on the parasitic impedance of the power distribution grid. Various tradeoffs in a system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors are also discussed. Related simulation results for typical values of on-chip parasitic resistance are also presented. An analytic solution is shown to provide accurate distributed system. The worst case error is 0. 003 % as compared to SPICE. Techniques presented in this paper are applicable not only for current technologies, but also provide an efficient placement of the onchip decoupling capacitors in future technology generations.

40|$|Asynchronous {{generators}} {{are often}} used for small hydro power stations with an installed power capacity of under 1 MW. The {{reason for this is}} their robustness and low cost. In order do be able to produce active electrical power with an asynchronous generator once needs to provide enough excitation by means of reactive power provided by either the electrical <b>grid</b> or additional <b>capacitors.</b> But in asynchronous generators we can also find the phenomenon of self-excitation which allows the asynchronous generator to operate as a standalone unit. Investigation of the self-excitation process shows that significant over-voltages can occur if a generator with sufficient capacitors is suddenly disconnected from the utility grid. The precondition for a successive voltage build-up is that the generator is left with enough capacitive power and a low load after the disconnection. The Lønnestad radial in Seljord, Norway, is a distribution radial with both asynchronous and synchronous generators connected.

40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of renewable sources of energy and the progress in sustainable technologies, it could become very interesting in terms of energy savings and cost efficiency to switch the consumer level of the electrical network from AC to DC. This way, less power conversion would be required, and the meshing of the grid would be possible, hence increasing the reliability and flexibility of the power supply. Meshing the grid, however, is a challenge in itself. Indeed, it can be desirable to have several power sources connected to the same system, in order to provide for all the loads connected to the network when one of the sources fails. But having multiple sources in the network also means having several grounding points. Using the AC grounding methods, such as resistive grounding, proves problematic. As a matter of fact, as there are several grounding points in the network, they form a loop in the ground where the current can flow. If the voltage across the grounding points is not null, then a current will be able to flow through the ground. In AC, this was not such a problem, but DC ground currents will corrode the infrastructure around the network, which will prove harmful over time. It is thus necessary to devise a new way of grounding the system. The method proposed in this MSc thesis is capacitive grounding, which consists of using capacitors to ground the system, instead of resistors or inductors. This will ensure that no current flows through the ground in steady-state, and will consequently prevent corrosion. Grounding the <b>grid</b> through <b>capacitors</b> enables the use of the residual current measurement method to protect the meshed network against ground faults. Coupled to a smart communication system that divides the network in protection zones, this method will ensure the selectivity of the protection scheme, and will also discriminate net currents circulating through the grid from actual ground fault currents. The protective relays will be able to determine where the ground fault is on the poles with the polarity of the residual current measurement, and will only disconnect that pole, leaving {{the other half of the}} network in operation. This selective disconnection will also help improve the reliability of the system, and the consumers will be able to use the network safely.

40|$|International audienceWe propose an {{alternative}} method to accelerate ions in classical gridded ion thrusters and ion sources such that co-extracted electrons {{from the source}} may provide beam space charge neutralization. In this way {{there is no need}} for an additional electron neutralizer. The method consists of applying RF voltage to a two-grid acceleration system via a blocking capacitor. Due to the unequal effective area of the two grids in contact with the plasma, a dc self-bias is formed, rectifying the applied RF voltage. As a result, ions are continuously accelerated within the grid system while electrons are emitted in brief instants within the RF period when the RF space charge sheath collapses. This paper presents the first experimental results and a proof-of-principle. Experiments are carried out using the Neptune thruster prototype which is a gridded Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) source operated at 4 [*]MHz, attached to a larger beam propagation chamber.

40|$|At present, {{there are}} {{significant}} reactive power flows in the Sri Lankan power system, giving rise to excessive network losses, creating under voltage conditions and limiting the utilization of transmission line and transformer capacities. This undesirable flow of reactive power through the network can be reduced by generating reactive power {{as close as possible}} to the loads; at least at <b>grid</b> substation level. <b>Capacitor</b> banks can be used for reactive power compensation and voltage support in grid substations as it is a comparatively inexpensive source of reactive power. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has some amount of breaker switched capacitor banks installed at several grid substations. In most of the cases the capacitors have been selected only with the aim of mitigating under voltage situation and very little attention is given for loss reduction in the power system by installing capacitor banks. But still there are grid substations which experience under voltages during some periods of the day. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose new additions of capacitors to the CEB network for network loss reduction and mitigating under voltage levels. Whole CEB power system is modeled in Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS®E) software. Load flow network simulations were run for different scenarios and identified the grid substations showing the under voltages and key locations for reactive power demand. First the required sizes of capacitor banks were selected for grid substations considering only under voltage mitigation. Then the capacitor banks were selected for grid substations considering both voltage support and loss reduction. The new selection of capacitors was justified by examining its economic feasibility. Proposed new additions of capacitors to the CEB network can contribute for reducing the network losses, delaying the investment on generators and improving the voltage level in the power system...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} use of a high speed, {{squirrel}} cage induction generator and power converter for producing DC electrical power onboard ships and submarines. Potential advantages of high speed induction generators include smaller size and weight, increased durability, and decreased cost and maintenance. Unfortunately, induction generators require a "supply of reactive power" to run and suffer from variation in output voltage and frequency with any changes to the input reactive power excitation, mechanical drive speed, and load. A power converter can resolve some of these issues by circulating the changing reactive power demanded by the generator while simultaneously controlling the stator frequency to adjust the machine slip and manage the real output power. This combination of real and reactive power control will ensure a constant voltage DC bus over the full load range. Tests were performed on a three horsepower motor to help validate models and simulations at both the two kilowatt and 5 megawatt level. After determining the equivalent circuit of the demonstration motor, it was tested as a generator under <b>grid</b> connected and <b>capacitor</b> excited conditions. A stand-alone five megawatt, 12, 000 RPM generator designed specifically to operate at high efficiency and power factor over the full load rang was used to design converter parameters. A variety of reactive power excitation strategies were briefly examined before the flow of reactive currents through a converter was explained using a six step inverter with two different switching schemes.
