5|$|Following Maria's {{regeneration}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Bermuda on September13. The watch was upgraded to a warning later that day, and at 1200UTC the following day, it {{was replaced by a}} hurricane watch. All watches and warnings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> were discontinued by September15. When Maria bypassed Bermuda on September 15, its outer bands briefly produced tropical storm-force winds across the island. At Commissioners Point, sustained winds reached 52mph (83km/h), with gusts as high as 69mph (111km/h), and winds of 36mph (60km/h) were reported at L.F. Wade International Airport at 1500UTC on September15.|$|E
5|$|In 875, the unwarlike and pleasure-loving Aghlabid emir Muhammad II ibn Ahmad (r. 864–875) died, and was {{succeeded by}} his more {{energetic}} brother, Ibrahim II (r. 875–902). The new emir {{was determined to}} finally capture Syracuse. He appointed a new governor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Ja'far ibn Muhammad, and sent a fleet from Ifriqiya to assist the local Sicilian troops.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War, a {{full set}} of {{banknotes}} was introduced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> In 1945, Saint Pierre and Miquelon adopted a franc tied to the CFA franc, thus avoiding some of the devaluation imposed on the metropolitan currency (c.f.

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> nation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E

5|$|Also on August15, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the Dominican Republic, from Samaná to Cabo Engaño along the northern coast and westward to Isla Beata off the southwestern coast.

The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all flight operations on the morning of August16. The tropical storm warning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a weak tropical depression. In Cuba, a storm alert was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of possibly heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London {{to be the}} southern archbishopric <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to {{be the site of}} the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area.
