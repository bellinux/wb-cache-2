25|$|UDDTs are {{sometimes}} considered too expensive compared to pit latrines, but this criticism {{does not include}} the cost of emptying pits and the potential value of fertilizers that can be recycled via UDDTs should the users wish to do so (noting that most UDDT installations worldwide currently do not reuse excreta in agriculture). Rather than looking only at construction costs, long-term operational costs and benefits should also be considered, especially since the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may be a significant expense. When a period of for example 10 years is considered, UDDTs may well be the more economical alternative, since the emptying of feces vaults is simple and safer, thus less expensive, even if users decide to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> with someone else to do this.|$|E
25|$|The debtor may {{not make}} a {{contract}} which purports to dispose of any property of his insolvent estate. Furthermore, he may not, without the written consent of the trustee, <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> which adversely affects his estate or any contribution which he is obliged to make towards his estate. That contribution is what is claimable by the trustee in terms of section 23(5) from moneys earned by the insolvent {{in the course of}} his profession, occupation or employment. The contribution becomes due to the trustee only once the Master has expressed the opinion that the moneys in question are not necessary for the support of the insolvent and his dependents. It follows that, prior to the Master’s assessment of a contribution, the insolvent need not obtain the trustee’s consent to enter into the contract.|$|E
25|$|SHAC's {{campaign}} {{prompted the}} introduction of sections 145–149 of the British Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which created new offences intended to protect animal-testing facilities, including prohibiting acts or threats intended to cause someone to terminate or not <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> with such a facility. The first person to be convicted under the Act was Joseph Harris, a doctor of molecular biology, who attacked property owned by companies supplying materials to HLS; he received a three-year sentence. In February 2007, a number of SHAC supporters were charged with illegal street collecting without a licence. According to the Metropolitan Police, two stalls in London's Oxford Street collected over £80,000 a year. In March 2007, three activists were jailed under the Act for intimidating HLS suppliers; one supplier dropped its contract with HLS after being invaded by demonstrators wearing skull masks.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> that {{is within the}} scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, implied contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that in Singapore administrative law, [...] "extensive reference is made to the landmark English cases", and in particular English administrative law has largely influenced {{the adoption of the}} doctrine of fettering of discretion in Singapore. One exception is that although a contractual fetter on discretion has been established in English law to be a separate ground of review, this has yet to be recognized by the Singapore courts. In Birkdale District Electricity Supply Co. v. Southport Corporation (1926), the House of Lords held that if legislation entrusts a public authority with certain powers and duties to be exercised for public purposes, it is illegal for the authority to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> that prevents itself from exercising its powers.|$|E
500|$|McCartney, Harrison, and Best {{were under}} 21, and {{therefore}} needed {{the consent of}} their parents to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract.</b> Best and his mother— Mona Best, owner of the Casbah Coffee Club— were impressed with Epstein's professional image, as were the other Beatles, {{because he was a}} businessman, wore expensive suits, and owned a large car. Best's mother said that Epstein [...] "could be good for them [...] ". McCartney's father was sceptical about a Jewish manager and warned his son to be careful about finances. Lennon's aunt and guardian Mimi Smith was against the idea, believing that Epstein would lose interest when something else would attract his interest, but Lennon had just turned twenty-one and he ignored his aunt's advice.|$|E

2500|$|Misrepresentation in English {{contract}} law and English tort law {{refers to a}} situation where a person is induced to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> entirely or partly by a false assertion (of fact, not opinion or intention) made by the other contracting party. Claims that {{can be described as}} sales talk, such as advertising slogans, are not misrepresentations. If a misrepresentation is incorporated as a term of the contract, it may form the basis of an action for breach of contract, and contractual remedies. If not, the misrepresentee (the party influenced by the misrepresentation of the other party) may be able to rescind (withdraw from) the contract or obtain damages. A misrepresentation may be [...] made fraudulently, negligently, or non‐negligently (innocently). A related term is [...] "misstatement": a false assertion that causes harm other than by inducing a person to enter a contract. Contract law deals with the contractual implications of misrepresentation; in most cases English law allows escape from a bargain when a contracting party has not given true consent due to misrepresentation. Tort law deals with civil wrongs and remedies.|$|E
2500|$|Included in this {{category}} are bid bonds (guaranty that a contractor will <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> if awarded the bid); performance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will perform the work as specified by the contract); payment bonds (guaranty that a contractor will pay for services, particularly subcontractors and materials and particularly for federal projects where a mechanic's lien is not available); and maintenance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will provide facility repair and upkeep for a specified period of time). [...] There are also miscellaneous contract bonds that do not fall within the categories above, {{the most common of}} which are subdivision and supply bonds. Bonds are typically required for federal government projects by the Miller Act and state projects under [...] "little Miller Acts". In federal government, the contract language is determined by the government. In private contracts the parties may freely contract the language and requirements. Standard form contracts provided by American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) make bonding optional. If the parties agree to require bonding, additional forms such as the performance bond contract AIA Document 311 provide common terms.|$|E

2500|$|Women in Classical Athens had {{no legal}} personhood and were {{assumed to be}} part of the oikos headed by the male kyrios. Until marriage, women were under the {{guardianship}} of their father or other male relative. Once married, the husband became a woman's kyrios. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the kyrios would do so on their behalf. Athenian women could only acquire rights over property through gifts, dowry and inheritance, though her kyrios had the right to dispose of a woman's property. Athenian women could only <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> worth less than the value of a [...] "medimnos of barley" [...] (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading. Women were excluded from ancient Athenian democracy, both in principle and in practice. Slaves could become Athenian citizens after being freed, but no woman ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens. In classical Athens women were also barred from becoming poets, scholars, politicians, or artists. During the Hellenistic period in Athens, the philosopher Aristotle thought that women would bring disorder and evil, therefore it was best to keep women separate from the rest of the society. This separation would entail living in a room called a gynaikeion, while looking after the duties in the home and having very little exposure with the male world. This was also to ensure that wives only had legitimate children from their husbands. Athenian women received little education, except home tutorship for basic skills such as spin, weave, cook and some knowledge of money.|$|E
2500|$|A full-cast dress {{rehearsal}} {{was scheduled for}} July 3, 1958, but slightly after 4:00am a fire destroyed all the sets and costumes, a loss of $2 million. Rumors that the blaze had been started by black arsonists determined to shut down production immediately began to circulate. Goldwyn publicly denounced the story, although studio insiders were certain the fire had been set deliberately. The production was placed on hiatus for six weeks to allow for reconstruction. During this period, director Mamoulian repeatedly clashed with the producer about {{every aspect of the}} film, and Goldwyn fired him. William Wyler was willing to step in if Goldwyn could postpone the project for a few months, but the producer opted to replace Mamoulian with Otto Preminger, who had started preparing both Exodus and Anatomy of a Murder but was willing to set them aside for the opportunity to helm Porgy and Bess. Mamoulian was incensed not only that he had been dismissed after eight months of pre-production work, but that he had been replaced by Preminger, who in 1944 had taken over Laura when Mamoulian had ignored all of Preminger's directives as producer of that film. Claiming Goldwyn had fired him for [...] "frivolous, spiteful, or dictatorial reasons not pertinent to the director's skill or obligation," [...] he brought his case to the Directors Guild of America, which notified all its members, including Preminger, they could not <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> with Goldwyn. This prompted the Producers Guild of America to become involved. They insisted Goldwyn had the right to change directors and was not in breach of contract because he had paid Mamoulian in full. When Mamoulian changed tactics and attempted to raise charges of racism against Preminger, he lost any support he had managed to gather, and after three weeks the matter was resolved in favor of Goldwyn.|$|E
