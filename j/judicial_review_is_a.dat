50|$|<b>Judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{procedure}} in English law whereby courts supervise {{the exercise of}} power, often by a public body. A person who feels that an exercise of power is unlawful may apply to the Administrative Court (a division of the High Court) for judicial review of a decision.

5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{exercise in}} which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders {{to ensure that they}} conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>was</b> subject to <b>a</b> succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>was</b> expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{incident}} {{of the separation}} of powers, under which courts regulate and control the exercise of public power by the other branches of government. Before the interim Constitution came into force, in April 1994, the principles of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>were</b> developed through the “crucible” of the common law. Since the adoption of the interim Constitution, public power is controlled by the written Constitution, which is the supreme law. The common-law precedent continues to inform the law {{only to the extent that}} it is consistent with the Constitution. Consequently, there is only one system of law. Thus, orders of invalidity under the courts’ powers of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>are</b> orders of constitutional invalidity. If the order of invalidity relates to conduct of the President, section 172(2) of the Constitution requires that it be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.|$|R
50|$|<b>Judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> process {{under which}} {{executive}} and (in some countries) legislative actions {{are subject to}} review by the judiciary. The power of courts to assess whether a law is {{in compliance with the}} constitution. A court with judicial review power may invalidate laws and decisions that are incompatible with a higher authority; an executive decision may be invalidated for being unlawful or a statute may be invalidated for violating the terms of a written constitution. Judicial review is one of the checks and balances in the separation of powers: the power of the judiciary to supervise the legislative and executive branches when the latter exceed their authority. The doctrine varies between jurisdictions, so the procedure and scope of judicial review may differ between and within countries.|$|E
50|$|The Constitution is {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land. Any law or act which is {{inconsistent}} with it has no force or effect. The effect of this provision is that laws and administrative acts must comply with the Constitution.

The importance of the Constitution as a source of administrative law was best articulated in Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, where Chaskalson P held that the control of public power by the courts through <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> constitutional matter. The common-law principles that had been applied to control powers prior to 1994 have now been subsumed under the Constitution. As a source of administrative law, the Constitution establishes a variety of agencies and administrative structures to control the exercise of public power.|$|E

40|$|Defined as the {{function}} of the court to interpret and apply the constitution to particular circumstances and legal issues, <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> has become a noteworthy expression {{of the power of the}} judiciary. Nearly 200 years old, this seemingly simple doctrine has instigated a substantial amount of political controversy and debate from which three individuals should be recognized for their contributions. Ronald Dworkin, a proponent of judicial activism, believes in “leaving issues to the court’s judgment” and investing our faith in their decisions (Dworkin 526). Supporting Dworkin, John Arthur asserts that <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> promotes democracy, and more importantly, imposes safeguards against unauthorized decisions made by the legislative branch. Staunch opposition to support for <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> apparent in arguments from Jeremy Waldron.

Careful review of the strengths and weaknesses of <b>judicial</b> <b>review,</b> however, prove that a legal system possessing such a function allows one to feel more secure and safe.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{development}} of subjecting government procurement awards to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relatively recent development in South African law.

Given the often lucrative nature of public contracts, challenges to the lawfulness of government procurement awards have become a regular occurrence in South Africa. However, the setting aside of such an award does not automatically follow upon a finding of unlawfulness. For a number of reasons, a court may decline to set aside an unlawful government procurement award. This raises a number of interesting questions, {{particularly with regard to}} how such a decision may be reconciled with, and the implications this may have for, the principle of legality and the Rule of Law.

40|$|According to {{traditional}} arguments, <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legitimate element of representative government {{because it allows}} decisions about individual rights {{to be made in}} a venue more insulated from electoral pressure than are legislative institutions. The hope is that this insulation helps generate better outcomes than would a system of legislative supremacy. The relevance of this outcome-oriented perspective has been challenged on four main grounds: majoritarian, participatory, disagreement-based, and methodological. The first two contend that judicial review is procedurally illegitimate, while the second two argue that we should assess judicial review on procedural grounds. We show that none of these arguments undermine the traditional insulation-based and outcome-oriented approach to the question of judicial review’s legitimacy. Historically, the most important argument infavor of judicial review stresses the value ofinsulating the judiciary from electoral forces. Alexander Hamilton emphasized this theme in Fed-eralist # 78, explaining that if the courts are to be considered ‘‘the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments,’ ’ then the indepen-dence of the judiciary is: requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of in...|$|E
40|$|American jurists {{traditionally}} {{have assumed that}} constitutional judicial review of government regulatory law and practice is both necessary and sufficient to protect private property rights. Recently, however, a few legal scholars and economists have begun to question both its necessity and sufficiency. Evidence from the US and the UK suggests that political institutions not only regulate or expropriate private property rights but also protect those rights, {{even in the absence}} of constitutional judicial review―the power of courts to overturn legislation or require compensation for expropriation. This article proposes that constitutional judicial review of government regulation should be subject to a social welfare analysis to determine when and if such review is efficacious. A model is proposed in which there is a desired level of property rights protection. <b>Judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cost that will on net either add to, or subtract from, general social welfare.

40|$|In {{this brief}} comment I offer some {{critical}} reflections on Professor Hogg 2 ̆ 7 s proposed approach to Charter interpretation.

By way of conclusion, I suggest that we must abandon the repressive machinations of textual fetishism so that we may honestly confront the nexus between law, politics and power. In turn, this will enable us to demand of powerholders - including judges - that they use their power for democratic rather than mystificatory ends...|$|R
