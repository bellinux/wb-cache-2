5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is probably even more popular today than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> his career home run record {{was broken by}} Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, {{to the delight of}} the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season. The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} of Kimberley elected {{to build a}} memorial in Rhodes' honour in their city, which was unveiled in 1907.

25|$|That Bishop Moreton, in {{that very}} room, (for <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>when</b> Bishop of Chester, parson of Stockport,) did say to him and some others, about non-conformity, that they despised the Common Prayer; but it had {{converted}} more than all their preaching could do or ever would do, or to that purpose.

25|$|General Charles de Gaulle was {{a member}} of the French cabinet during the Battle of France, in 1940. As French defence forces were {{increasingly}} overwhelmed, de Gaulle found himself part of a group of politicians who argued against a negotiated armistice with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. These views being shared by the President of the Council, Paul Reynaud, de Gaulle was sent as an emissary to the United Kingdom, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> the French government collapsed.|$|E

Alice is now younger than Bob. In addition to rotational acceleration, Bob must decelerate to become stationary and then accelerate again to match the orbital speed of the space station.|$|E

25|$|As Rebecca and her entourage {{approached}} Abraham's home, they spied Isaac from {{a distance}} {{in the fields of}} Beer-lahai-roi.

25|$|In 1857, Dickens hired {{professional}} actresses for {{the play}} The Frozen Deep, written {{by him and}} his protégé, Wilkie Collins. Dickens {{fell in love with}} one of the actresses, Ellen Ternan, and this passion was to last the rest of his life. Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18 when he made the decision, which went strongly against Victorian convention, to separate from his wife, Catherine, in 1858—divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>When</b> Catherine left, never to see her husband again, she took with her one child, leaving the other children to be raised by her sister Georgina who chose to stay at Gad's Hill.|$|E

The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> she gave birth, under assumed names.

500|$|The FBI speculated {{from the}} {{beginning}} that Cooper did not survive his jump. [...] "Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his 'chute open," [...] said Carr. Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack's fiftieth {{birthday}} is approaching {{and he has}} received home movies {{of some of his}} earlier birthdays from his mother, Collen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). While watching the tapes, Jack discovers just how happy <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he was younger, and is determined to reclaim that happiness and innocence. After examining a list he made while he was younger, he discovers that he has done all of the things but one, befriending Batman. Thus, he arranges for actor Adam West, who played Batman, to come to his birthday party. At the party, however, West calls Jack by the wrong name, leading him to realize that he is in fact unhappy, despite his accomplishments. [...] In an effort to reclaim his happiness, Jack attempts to find the same toy that made him so happy on his tenth birthday, a model of an Apollo Lunar Module. He buys one from a vintage toy store, but still remains unhappy.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market-based philosophies. Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character's transformation took for a 1997 interview: [...] "Although I haven’t read them in chronological order I would think it would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky’s thought processes and my own thought processes." [...] By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. At approximately the same time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini-series, and so decided to revamp the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-month}} break from their travels with the Doctor, his companions, Amy Pond and her husband, Rory Williams, receive a [...] "TARDIS blue"-coloured {{envelope}} providing a time, date and set of coordinates {{leading them to}} Utah. They arrive to meet River Song (Alex Kingston), who also received an envelope, and the Doctor, now 1,103 years old, 194 years older than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he last saw them. He takes them to a picnic at a nearby lake, telling them he is taking them {{on a trip to}} [...] "Space 1969." [...] Amy catches a glimpse of a mysterious figure from a distance, but appears to immediately forget about it after she looks away. Later, a figure in an American astronaut suit emerges from the lake; the Doctor approaches it but warns his companions not to interfere. The astronaut shoots the Doctor, causing him to begin to regenerate, but his companions are horrified to witness the astronaut shoot him again, killing him before he can fully regenerate. The three are met by Canton Everett Delaware III (William Morgan Sheppard) who also received an envelope and was instructed to bring a can of gasoline, which the group then uses to give the Doctor a Viking-style funeral.|$|E
500|$|In recent years, {{the words}} of the hymn have been changed in some {{religious}} publications to downplay a sense of imposed self-loathing by its singers. The second line, [...] "That saved a wretch like me!" [...] has been rewritten as [...] "That saved and strengthened me", [...] "save a soul like me", or [...] "that saved and set me free". Kathleen Norris in her book Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith characterizes this transformation of the original words as [...] "wretched English" [...] making the line that replaces the original [...] "laughably bland". Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's Calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations. [...] "Wretch" [...] also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life.|$|E
