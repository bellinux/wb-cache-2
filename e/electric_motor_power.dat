25|$|A mercury {{arc valve}} {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current. Rectifiers of this type were used in <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> supplies for industry, in electric railways, streetcars, and diesel-electric locomotives.

25|$|The FCV concept {{also uses}} {{portions}} of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive technology including the <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> <b>power</b> control unit {{and other parts}} and components from its hybrid vehicles to improve reliability and minimize cost. The hybrid technology {{is also used to}} work together with the fuel cell. At low speeds such as city driving, the FCV runs just like any all-electric car by using the energy stored in its battery, which is charged through regenerative braking. At higher speeds, the hydrogen fuel cell alone powers the electric motor. When more power is needed, for example during sudden acceleration, the battery supports the fuel cell system as both work together to provide propulsion.|$|E
