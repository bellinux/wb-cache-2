40|$|Though most {{students}} complete their educational journey, some choose to leave school early and <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> before graduation from high <b>school.</b> The focus <b>of</b> {{this study is}} to determine if the school organization and the people most engaged in the educational process of students influence some students to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> in both public and Catholic schools. Prior research has demonstrated that in the United States, Catholic schools consistently have fewer student dropouts than public schools. What is different within Catholic school walls than public schools and are students in Catholic school dissimilar to students in public schools that give Catholic school fewer dropouts? A U. S. Department of Education data set containing approximately 25, 000 students, their school administrators, and parents was used in this study. This data set surveyed each of these groups when the student was in eighth, tenth, and twelfth grades in both public and Catholic schools all across the United States. Applying logit regression to ascertain the odds <b>of</b> students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school,</b> examined was the school administrators, parents, ^ and students. The results suggest that parental involvement is the foremost motivation as to why students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> Not that parents in Catholic schools are more engaged in their children 2 ̆ 7 s education, but parental involvement did matter as to why fewer students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Catholic <b>schools</b> than public schools. A unified model containing all significant variables from each of the three subjects; students, parents, and school administrators, indicated that school classification no longer had an impact on students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> What school, public or Catholic the student attended did not matter; the student who is likely to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> will probably <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> ...|$|R

A path-analytic model was developed to assess the influence of socio-demographic, structural family and behavioural factors upon low academic achievement, the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> The specific hypothesis tested was that challenging behaviour, indexed by suspensions, predicts low academic achievement or at-risk status, more strongly than SES or family structure variables. Results indicate that for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, suspensions are a stronger predictor of low achievement than socioeconomic or family factors. Moreover, a model testing low achievement as a precursor to suspensions was not supported. Suggestions for future practice and research are proposed...|$|R
