40|$|Literature has {{generally}} portrayed teen pregnancy {{as a social}} problem with adverse health, social and economic effects on the teen mother and her child. Research on teen mothers attending tertiary education is notably absent. This thesis identifies factors to enable teen mothers to transition to tertiary education. This research is significant because compared to international standards, New Zealand has {{a high rate of}} teen pregnancy (Kaipuke Consultants, 2012). Despite the challenges teen mothers face, this thesis highlights the dimensions through which teen mothers can successfully transition to tertiary education. Gaining a tertiary qualification is closely linked to income and general well-being (Earle, 2009). Scott (2009) stated that those higher levels of study are associated with higher earnings. Using a qualitative research approach consisting of twelve semi-structured interviews in Auckland, New Zealand, factors that enable teen mothers to transition to tertiary education were identified. The twelve interviews included eight teen mothers (all of whom were of Māori ethnicity), three teen parent support organisations (TPSOs) and one interview with the Ministry of Education. By employing phenomenology as the methodology and exploring the participants’ lived experiences, this thesis allows the voices of the participants to be at the forefront. The use of thematic analysis means common themes are identified and discussed. Furthermore, by drawing on the researcher’s personal experience of being a Māori teen mother who is attending tertiary education herself and by employing Mason Durie’s te whare tapa whā (the four sided house) framework (Durie, 1994), this thesis seeks to holistically analyse the scholarly literature and interview findings. The use of te whare tapa whā to analyse the interview findings and literature lead {{to the development of the}} model whare tangata (house of humanity). This model symbolically represents the key themes of Self Attributes of the teen mother (self-efficacy, high achievement, independence, resilience and cultural identity), Stigma (welfare dependence and educational underachievement), and Support (family, peer, institutional, the tertiary institution and <b>financial).</b> <b>Identification</b> of these factors can enable TPSOs to assist teen mothers through the transition to tertiary education. As a consequence of the analysis undertaken, a number of practical recommendations emerged. These included delivering relevant teen parenting classes that focus on developing and growing families together and that both teen mothers and teen fathers can attend, identifying teen mothers with academic or tertiary potential and therefore enabling closer links with tertiary providers, and finally, tailoring support programmes, including scholarships, within the tertiary providers to support the transition to tertiary education. From this research process, the opportunity for future research in the following areas became evident; teen fathers, growing young families holistically, teen mothers in the South Island of New Zealand and a comparative analysis between non-teen mothers’ and teen mother’s tertiary journeys. As with all research, this thesis identifies limitations. These include the diversity of the sample population, perspectives of TPSO interviews, the lack of Māori cultural nuances and the researcher biases. This thesis does not intend to represent all teen mothers or TPSOs; it does, however, attempt to provide initial conclusions from the experiences of the participants for this thesis. It is hoped these findings may be applicable to teen mothers and TPSOs in similar circumstances Ethics approval was through the Auckland University of Technology Ethics Committee on 19 July 2012 (AUTEC Reference number 12 / 50).

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{international}} transmission of shocks from the banking {{to the real}} sector during the global <b>financial</b> crisis. For <b>identification,</b> we use matched bank-firm level data, including many small and medium-sized firms, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. We find that internationally-borrowing domestic and foreign-owned banks contract their credit more during the crisis than domestic banks that are funded only locally. Firms that are dependent on credit {{and at the same}} time have a relationship with an internationally-borrowing domestic or a foreign bank (as compared to a locally-funded domestic bank) suffer more in their financing and real performance. Single-bank-relationship firms, small firms and firms with intangible assets suffer most. For credit-independent firms, there are no differential effects. Our findings suggest that financial globalization has intensified the international transmission of financial shocks with substantial real consequences. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{heterogeneous}} impact of monetary policy shocks on financial intermediaries. I distinguish between traditional banks and shadow banks {{based on their}} ability to raise debt and equity funding. The functional form for both intermediaries imposes no constraints ex ante, but a Bayesian estimation of key parameters results in traditional banks having a comparative advantage at raising debt while shadow banks are better at raising equity. In line with empirical observations, shadow bank lending moves in the opposite direction to bank lending following monetary policy shocks, which mitigates aggregate credit responses. The recognition of a distinct shadow banking sector results in an amplified propagation of real shocks and a muted propagation of <b>financial</b> shocks. This <b>identification</b> can help in assessing effects of financial regulation on the economy.

In crisis times, we find that, with softer monetary policy, less capitalized banks prefer buying securities rather than increasing credit supply (not due to lack of good loan applications), thereby impacting firm-level real outcomes. Moreover, more not less capitalized banks reach-for-yield, which is inconsistent with the risk-shifting hypothesis. Results suggest that the main drivers at work are access to liquidity and risk-bearing capacity, and not regulatory capital arbitrage.

Only Damodaran offers the solution {{based on the}} valuation of the company in the financial distress as the option {{on the base of}} the Black-Scholes model, but this is not possible use in the reality of the valuation in the Czech Republic. The solution of this problem requires the projection of the specifics of the financial distress of the firm into the common methods of valuation of the company without <b>financial</b> distress. <b>Identification</b> of single valuation methods depends, besides others, on the fact if the insolvency process has been initiated or not and if it is solved by bankruptcy or by reorganization. The property valuation is used in case of the bankruptcy with the negative result value. The income approach is possible to use only in case if the successful reorganization and restructuring of company is supposed, and it is necessary to distinguish whether the manufacturing is going to be restructured or not. If so, it is necessary to use three phase income method of valuation where the free cash flow must be recognized not only for cost of restructuring, but also for the extraordinary profit from selling or buying the new or old manufacturing equipment. Just the identification of the restructuring cost plays also a very important role in the process of the valuation. The interest rate for discounting of the free cash flow would also be identified separately for every phase and adjusted by risk surcharge.
