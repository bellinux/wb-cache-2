5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} <b>gaskets,</b> and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already {{on their way}} to the front.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of modified seals, <b>gaskets</b> and drive train components, {{as well as}} improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank's mechanical reliability. Statistics from 15 March 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the Tiger, almost equal to the 62 percent of the Panzer IV and better than the 48 percent of the Panther that were operational by this period.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The structure, material, {{production}} and application situation of metal winding <b>gasket</b> were summarized, and the preparation technology and product properties of metal winding <b>gasket</b> were analyzed. The results showed: {{under the same}} <b>gasket</b> stress, the leakage rate increased {{with the increase of}} medium pressure; Under the same medium pressure, the leakage rate declined with the increase of the <b>gasket</b> stress. By comparing with the performance of traditional asbestos winding <b>gasket,</b> the new metal winding <b>gasket’s</b> performance has reached the requirement of asbestos winding <b>gasket</b> and can replace asbestos winding <b>gasket.</b> Preface Metal winding <b>gasket</b> is a kind of combined sealing <b>gasket,</b> which is made by a certain shape of the metal, non-metallic filler, inner ring and outer ring. Because its wide range of pressure and temperature, metal winding <b>gasket</b> has been widely used in petrochemical, machinery, energy, transportation and other industries of vessel and pipeline flange connection. It {{is one of the most}} widely used in sealing <b>gasket</b> at home and abroad square brackets [1]. At present, there are large numbers of metal winding <b>gasket</b> manufacturers, and most of them are local small businesses, mostly without control of process procedures and quality of products.

The structural <b>gasket</b> at the northwest section of the station deteriorated {{to a greater extent than}} did the structural <b>gasket</b> at the southeast section, because of the former's exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The exterior and interior components of the northwest structural <b>gasket</b> show similar degrees of degradation. This structural <b>gasket</b> has hardened by 10 % relative to the new structural <b>gasket.</b> The 35 -year-old structural <b>gasket</b> contains no large cracks, indicating its suitability for continual use...|$|R
5|$|Indium wire {{is used as}} {{a vacuum}} seal and a thermal {{conductor}} in cryogenics and ultra-high-vacuum applications, in such manufacturing applications as <b>gaskets</b> that deform to fill gaps. Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and <b>gaskets</b> for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and <b>gaskets.</b> Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{desirable}} properties of an effective <b>gasket</b> in industrial applications for compressed fiber <b>gasket</b> material {{is the ability to}} withstand high compressive loads.

25|$|A gasket used in {{a diamond}} anvil cell {{experiment}} is a thin metal foil, typically 0.3mm in thickness, which is placed in between the diamonds. Desirable materials for <b>gaskets</b> are strong, stiff metals such as rhenium or tungsten. Steel is frequently used as a cheaper alternative for low pressure experiments. The above-mentioned materials cannot be used in radial geometries where the x-ray beam must pass through the gasket. They are not transparent to x-rays, and thus if x-ray illumination through the gasket is required then lighter materials, such as beryllium, boron nitride, boron or diamond are used as a gasket. <b>Gaskets</b> are preindented by the diamonds and a hole is drilled {{in the center of}} the indentation to create the sample chamber.|$|E
