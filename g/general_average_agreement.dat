Interestingly, inFusion and JSpIRIT use the same detection strategy, while PMD uses a single metric LOC to detect God Method. Although the techniques are distinct, the high <b>average</b> <b>agreement</b> {{seems to indicate that}} both techniques are similarly effective in the identification of God Method. The standard deviation is also low, with a minimum of 0.327 and maximum of 0.618 for MobileMedia, and a minimum of 0.096 and maximum of 0.130 for Health Watcher. The low standard deviation supports the fact that the agreement between tools remains high across versions of both systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In many networks, {{vertices}} {{have hidden}} attributes, or types, that are {{correlated with the}} networks topology. If the topology is known but these attributes are not, and if learning the attributes is costly, we need a method for choosing which vertex to query {{in order to learn}} as much as possible about the attributes of the other vertices. We assume the network is generated by a stochastic block model, but we make no assumptions about its assortativity or disassortativity. We choose which vertex to query using two methods: 1) maximizing the mutual infor-mation between its attributes and those of the others (a well-known approach in active learning) and 2) maximizing the <b>average</b> <b>agreement</b> between two independent samples of the conditional Gibbs distribution. Experimental results show that both these methods do much better than simple heuristics. They also consistently identify certain vertices as im-portant by querying them early on.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective {{review of the}} digital images in the clinical records of 50 patients with pressure ulcers. Ten nurses independently assessed one image from each patient.

The <b>average</b> <b>agreement</b> about the stage and location of the ulcers was 85 %. The overall agreement declined as {{the stage of the}} ulcer increased. The <b>average</b> <b>agreement</b> regarding the wound descriptors was: necrosis 85 %, granulation tissue 81 %, ischaemia 83 %, cellulitis /infection 69 %, erythema 68 %. Almost all nurses felt the need to change the current management of the wound (460 responses, or 92 %). The nurses judged that most digital images were of good quality (17 %) or very good quality (79 %).

40|$|This {{research}} evaluated {{a methodology}} of cutting logs that involves both their classification {{and the establishment}} of cutting models for different diametrical classes. The software MaxiTora was employed aiming the optimization of cutting logs. A total of 80 logs of Pinus sp had been selected with diameter that varied from 24 cm to 33 cm, gathering four diametrical classes with 20 logs each. In each diametrical class, the logs had been separate in two lots with 10 units, where the first lot was submitted to conventional cutting and the second lot was submitted to the programmed cutting. For each log the effective time of cut was recorded until the last lumber piece was edged. For the conventional cutting system, the efficiency reached from the same cutting system varied from 9. 71 to 11. 22 m 3 /operator. day and the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded to 10. 18 m 3 /operator/day. In the programmed cutting system, the efficiency reached through the same cutting system varied from 7. 78 to 8. 99 m 3 /operator. day, while the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded the 8. 07 m 3 /operator. day.

40|$|As {{evidence-based}} {{programs are}} implemented {{in real world}} settings, {{there is a strong}} need to effectively and efficiently monitor fidelity, or adherence to a program, {{in order to maintain the}} expected effects demonstrated in research settings. The purpose of this study was to compare two methods of assessing fidelity to an evidence-based, parenttraining model (SafeCare®) as implemented by community service providers. Specifically, analyses compared fidelity assessed via video versus audio recordings. SafeCare modules often require mobility and high interaction, thus, video recordings may provide a more accurate view of home visitor and family interactions for scoring fidelity. However, videos are more expensive and cumbersome in comparison to audio recordings. Trained coders were randomly assigned to score a video or audio recording of the same session for 25 SafeCare sessions and the codes were compared for agreement. Two types of SafeCare sessions were assessed: assessment and training. <b>Average</b> <b>agreement</b> was somewhat higher for assessment sessions than for training sessions. <b>Average</b> <b>agreement,</b> across all sessions, was higher among items pertaining to SafeCare content than items pertaining to the therapeutic process.

40|$|The 1993 Working Group on the Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine and Anchovy {{agreed to}} carry out a {{mackerel}} otolith exchange programme to salve the problems found in age readings. A total of 398 pairs of otoliths was exchanged, 200 of which came from the western area (ICES Divisions VIa and VIIbc) and 198 were from the southern area (ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa), and ten readers from different countries took part in the exchange. The camparison of otolith readings of the two areas was carried out separately. The results show an unacceptable variability in mackerel age determination between the readers from different countries. The <b>average</b> <b>general</b> <b>agreement</b> between readers was low in the two areas, 47 % for the western area and 51 % for the southern area. Agreement between readers varies between 19 % and 71 % for the western area and between 4 % and 81 % for the southern area. Standard deviations by age groups increase considerably for age groups > 5 years for the western area sample and for ages > 3 years for the southern area sample. The age bias plots of each reader against the modal age show great variability in the samples from the two areas, above all in older ages. The age bias plots for all readers combined show that bias increases with age, and that older fish tend to be underestimated. The results of Wilcoxon's test to analyze bias between readers shows that bias exists between most readers in both samples. The notched box and whisker plots show differences in the interquartile range, average, median and symmetry in the different results of the readers. Considering the importance of age readings in assessment, new investigations are necessary to increase agreement, and to standardize ageings...|$|R
