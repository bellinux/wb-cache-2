40|$|Using ten {{sealing jaws}} with {{differently}} shaped surfaces, side-sealed bags and tubular bags with overlapped resp. <b>fin</b> <b>seal</b> seams were produced out of fourteen commercial packaging materials. The {{effect of the}} different jaw profiles on the heat sealed seams was determined by evaluating their strength and tightness. Laboratory tests were made as well as tests under practical production conditions on a vertical form-fill-seal-machine of the Transwrap 125 H type. The result was {{that the effect of}} such jaws in practical operation decisively depends on the type of the packaging material used, especially on the thickness of its heat-sealable layer and the heat conductivity of its components. In addition to this the pouch type also plays a decisive role as well as the question of priority of seam tightness or seam strength or if both properties are of equal importance for the evaluation of the seam quality in each individual case...|$|R

40|$|In gas turbines, rim seals are fitted at the {{periphery}} of the wheel-space between the turbine disc and its adjacent casing; their purpose is to reduce the ingress of hot mainstream gases. A superposed sealant flow, bled from the compressor, is used to purge the wheel-space or at least dilute the ingress to an acceptable level. The ingress is caused by the circumferential variation of pressure in the turbine annulus radially outward of the seal. Engine designers often use double rim seals where the variation in pressure is attenuated in the outer wheel-space between the two seals. This paper describes experimental results from a research facility which models an axial turbine stage with engine-representative rim seals. The radial variation of CO 2 gas concentration, swirl and pressure, in both the inner and outer wheel-space, are presented over a range of purge flow rates. The data are used to assess the performance of two seals: a datum double-rim seal and a derivative with a series of radial fins. The concept behind the <b>finned</b> <b>seal</b> is that the radial fins increase the swirl in the outer wheel-space; measurements of swirl show the captive fluid between the fins rotate with near solid body rotation. The improved attenuation of the pressure asymmetry, which governs the ingress, results in an improved performance of the inner geometry of the <b>seal.</b> The <b>fins</b> also increased the pressure in the outer wheel-space and reduced the ingress though the outer geometry of the seal...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the DM- 1 Glider, which had approximately triangular plan form, an aspect ratio of 1. 8 and a 60 degree sweptback leading edge, has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel. The investigation consisted of {{the determination of the}} separate effects of the following modifications made to the glider on its maximum lift and stability characteristics: (a) installation of sharp leading edges over the inboard semispan of the wing, (b) removal of the vertical <b>fin,</b> (c) <b>sealing</b> of the elevon control-balance slots, (d) installation of redesigned thin vertical surfaces, (e) installation of faired sharp leading edges, and (f) installation of canopy. The maximum lift coefficient of the DM- 1 glider was increased from 0. 61 to 1. 01 by the installation of semispan sharp leading edges, and from 1. 01 to 1. 24 by the removal of the vertical <b>fin</b> and <b>sealing</b> of the elevon control-balance slots. The highest maximum lift coefficient (1. 32) was obtained when the faired sharp leading edges and the thin vertical surfaces were attached to the glider. The original DM- 1 glider was longitudinally stable. The semispan sharp leading edges shifted the neutral point forward approximately 3 percent of the root chord at moderate lift coefficients, and the glider configuration with these sharp leading edges attached was longitudinally unstable, for the assumed center-of-gravity location, at lift coefficients above 0. 73. Sealing the elevon control-balance slots and installing the faired sharp leading edges, the thin vertical surfaces, and the canopy shifted the neutral point forward approximately 8 percent of the root chord...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} is {{a growing}} successful market {{and the majority of}} flexible package applications are for the food industry. The demand for process optimization and reduced production costs, has led to an increase in flexible packaging. However, fast production lines can result in contamination in the seal area. For flexible food packaging, contamination is considered any food particle or substance trapped in the seal area. Current quality control processes can detect contamination in the seal area, but it is not determined if seal contamination affects seal quality. Oil-based and sodium based snack foods are two common categories that can be packaged on a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) flow-wrap machine. The study uses vegetable oil and a salt water solution to simulate the effect of liquid contamination along the T-point of flexible pouches made on an HFFS. The T-point refers to where the <b>fin</b> <b>seal</b> meets the end seal and requires the seal jaw to seal through four layers of film, which is the most difficult point to seal. The study tests a combination of different sealing temperatures and dwell time to determine the optimal sealing condition for a hermetic seal. A quality hermetic seal provides an enclosed seal with no leaks due to successful polymer chain entanglement between the two sealant layers. The different test categories of the study are non-contaminated (control), salt water solution for salt based foods, and vegetable oil for oil-based foods. Given the test parameters of the study, 140 ‚Å∞C sealing temperature and 0. 3 seconds dwell time are considered to be the optimal sealing condition for all three test categories. For Phase 1 of the study, salt water had a lower Hermeticity pass rate compared to vegetable oil and non-contaminated seals. In addition, the effect of refrigerated storage temperature and ambient storage temperature did not show to be significant for any of the test categories. However, refrigerated conditions showed a higher Hermeticity pass rate, but it was not statistically different. The findings for seal strength indicated no test category had higher or lower seal strength over the 14 day test period. Overall, the study shows there is no effect of liquid contaminant on Hermeticity and seal strength for flexible film with LLDPE sealant layer...|$|R

The second half of the loop is an easy hiking trail over stony ground and meadows. The boardwalk at the middle of the trail yields majestic views of the Cabot Trail and the ocean. There are multiple interpretive panels along the trail. Moose have been spotted by hikers along this trail numerous times. Northern gannets fly over this trail's coast near while minke whales, harbour seals, humpback whales, harp <b>seals,</b> <b>fin</b> whales, white-sided dolphins, sei whales, harbour porpoises, grey seals, and pilot whales swim offshore.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} complete mitochondrial genome of the donkey, Equus asinus, was determined. The length of the molecule is 16, 670 bp. The length, however, is not absolute due to pronounced heteroplasmy caused by variable numbers of two types of repetitive motifs in the control region. The sequence of the repeats is (a) 5 '-CACACCCA and (b) 5 '-TGCGCGCA, respectively. The order of (a) and (b) can be expressed as {n[2 (a) +(b) ]+m(a) }. In 32 different clones analyzed the number of n and m ranged from 0 to 9 and 1 to 7. The two rRNA genes, the 13 peptide-coding genes, and the 22 tRNA genes of the donkey and the horse, Equus caballus, were compared in detail. Total nucleotide difference outside the control region was 6. 9 %. Nucleotide difference between peptide-coding genes ranged from 6. 4 % to 9. 4 % {{with a mean of}} 8. 0 %. In the inferred protein sequences of the 13 peptide-coding genes the amino acid difference was 0. 2 - 8. 8 %, and the mean for the 13 concatenated amino acid sequences was 1. 9 %. In the 22 tRNA genes, the mean difference was 3. 5 %, and that in the two rRNA genes was 4. 1 %. The mtDNA differences between the donkey and the horse suggest that the evolutionary separation of the two species occurred approximate to 9 million years ago. Analyses of differences among the mtDNAs of three other species-pairs, harbor seal/grey <b>seal,</b> <b>fin</b> whale/blue whale, and Homo/common chimpanzee, showed that the relative evolutionary rate of individual peptide-coding genes varies among different species-pairs and modes of comparison. The findings show that the superimposition of sequence data of one lineage for resolving and dating evolutionary divergences of other lineages should be performed with caution unless based on comprehensive data...|$|R
