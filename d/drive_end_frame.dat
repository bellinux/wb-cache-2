Gilfoyle reveals that a post-it note with the administrator username and password he took from <b>End</b> <b>Frame</b> allowed him to retrieve sales contracts Pied Piper could use to poach <b>End</b> <b>Frame's</b> customers.

40|$|This report {{contains}} the complete structural analysis for an existing Joy Western electrostatic precipitator casing that will experience {{an increase in}} loading conditions due to {{the addition of a}} selective catalytic reactor into a coal-burning power plant. The analysis is divided into four major sections: load determination, stability requirements, individual stiffener analysis, and individual member analysis. All of the precipitator casing components-including the stiffeners in the top <b>end</b> <b>frame,</b> bottom <b>end</b> <b>frame,</b> side frame, hoppers, and hot roof as well as the struts, girders, and columns-were evaluated With respect to their ability to sustain the new load. In cases where the existing elements were deemed to be inadequate, a reinforcement design-including all relevant welding information-was determined and is presented here. Complete reinforcement drawings are also included. A cost analysis for this hypothetical design and a comparison to the actual reinforcement design developed by The Multitech Group are presented as well...|$|R
