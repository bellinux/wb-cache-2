2500|$|In Faraday's first {{experimental}} demonstration (August 29, 1831), {{he wrapped}} two wires around {{opposite sides of}} an iron ring or [...] "torus" [...] (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction {{was due to the}} change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet {{in and out of a}} coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding <b>electrical</b> <b>lead</b> ("Faraday's disk").|$|E

Two leads are then inserted; {{one into the}} right atrium and the other into the right ventricular apex via the subclavian veins.

5000|$|The rocket {{body was}} a steel tube 3 in in {{diameter}} filled with 11 pounds (5 kg) of cordite propellant, fired electrically. The warhead was screwed into the forward end, and was initially a solid 25 lb, 3.44 in armor-piercing shell which was quickly supplemented by a 6-inch-diameter (152mm), 60 lb high-explosive head. Another type of head was a 25 lb (11 kg) mild steel (later concrete) practice head.

50|$|A July 1971 coroner's inquest {{found that}} Elmer Crawford murdered {{his wife and}} three {{children}} in their Glenroy home. Crawford had constructed an electrocution device, using a 15 m length of <b>electrical</b> <b>lead</b> and alligator clips. He attached the alligator clips to his wife's ears while she slept and electrocuted her. He then beat his children to death, presumably using a hammer, then loaded their bodies into the family's FE Holden vehicle. He then drove them 200 km to Port Campbell where he pushed the car containing the bodies over the cliff edge in an effort to make the crime look like murder-suicide.|$|E

He {{sat down on the}} chair, but was ordered to get up by the warden so a hole could be cut in his suit through which a second <b>electrical</b> <b>lead</b> could be attached. This was done and Kemmler sat down again. He was strapped to the chair, his face was covered and the metal restraint put on his bare head.

Present-day leads made of copper or magnesium are responsible {{for as much as}} 50 percent of the parasitic heat load on cryogenic systems. A reduction of this load could be achieved by replacing the conventional materials with HTSC ceramic <b>electrical</b> <b>leads.</b> Superconductor quality has become a concern in the industry, as has the development of effective evaluation methods. The factors that need to be examined for these materials include material purity, mechanical properties, and superconducting ability below the critical temperature. We applied several methods to study these factors: thermogravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction, tensile testing, and laser-generated ultrasound. Our objectives were to determine the average tensile strength and Young's modulus of the HTSC material and to compare them to those values for copper and manganin...|$|R
5000|$|Although most systems operate via {{delivery}} of a constant train of stimulation, there is now the advent of so-called [...] "feed-forward" [...] stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure. This concept of feed-forward stimulation will likely become more prevalent as physiological markers of targeted diseases and neural disorders are discovered and verified. The on-demand stimulation may contribute to longer battery life, if sensing and signal-processing demands of the system are sufficiently power-efficient. New electrode designs could yield more efficient and precise stimulation, requiring less current and minimizing unwanted side-stimulation. In addition, to overcome the challenge of preventing lead migration {{in areas of the}} body that are subject to motion such as turning and bending, researchers are exploring developing small stimulation systems that are recharged wirelessly rather than through an <b>electrical</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|E
