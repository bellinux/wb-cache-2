50|$|Carl Anton Larsen {{was born}} in Østre Halsen, Tjolling, {{the son of a}} Norwegian Sea Captain Ole Christian Larsen and his wife Ellen Andrea Larsen (née Thorsen). His family {{subsequently}} relocated to nearby Sandefjord, the home of the Norwegian whaling industry, where, at the young age of 9 he went to sea in a small barque with his father chasing seals and trading across the North Atlantic with Britain, only returning to go to school during the fall and winter. He would continue this for a number of years, until his curiosity for the sea was so strong he enrolled himself in navigation school where he passed the exam for foreign-going mate at the age of 18. Having been to Britain a few times in the previous years he realized the importance of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language</b> and soon taught himself English and Spanish.|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet {{government}} {{headed by}} Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems. The {{development of these}} writing systems was very successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other. When <b>a</b> language <b>had</b> been given <b>a</b> writing system and appeared in a notable publication, that language would attain [...] "official language" [...] status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language.</b> There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy, most notable under Stalin's regime, where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian. During the Great Patriotic War, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how the computer as a tool is helping dyslectic students who <b>have</b> Swedish as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language</b> in learning. The following questions were formulated: How important is it to diagnose dyslectic students? How does the computer assistance motivates dyslectic students achieve their goals? How easy is it to include dyslectic students in the ordinary class with computer assistance? And in which way does the school and home environments affect dyslectic students who <b>have</b> Swedish as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language?</b> The sample consisted of four dyslectic students, 13 to 15 year olds who <b>have</b> Swedish as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language.</b> And two Swedish and Swedish as <b>second</b> <b>language</b> teachers.   They were selected by purposive non-probability sampling. They were all participating in the one to one programme. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using content analysis. After transcribing the interviews’ six themes: diagnosis, computer as a tool, inclusion, motivation and environment were identified. The results were that computers are helpful tools for dyslectic students who <b>have</b> Swedish as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language.</b> Computer assistance makes these students more independent to find ways to support themselves. They do not need to face failure all the time, when they can use the computer to achieve success. It motivates the students to learn more. It was very clear that the students were more efficient in computers compared to the teacher´s. Maybe, both the teachers and the students should be given the same competence education. Motivation as the most important aspect in learning was very noticeable in all the six interviews.

40|$|In {{universities}} where {{significant numbers}} of nursing students come from non-traditional backgrounds, and where an equally significant proportion of students <b>have</b> English as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language,</b> provision of learning support is essential to ensure success and progression, and to prevent attrition. This paper presents an evaluative study of the support services provided to undergraduate nursing students in two universities in the United Kingdom (UK). Both universities have {{significant numbers of}} students from non-traditional backgrounds and who <b>have</b> English as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language,</b> and both institutions <b>have</b> in place <b>a</b> large array of student support mechanisms. The aims {{of the study were}} to identify all existing student support mechanisms across the two universities, to illuminate the profile of students who enter pre-registration programmes at the two universities (age, gender, educational background) and to measure the perceptions of students of the use and usefulness of the support mechanisms provided by their university. Survey method evaluative research was the chosen research approach. Findings showed that the support services that appear to have the greatest impact on student success in their nursing programme are the programme leaders/module teachers, small study skills groups (known as APPL and L 2 L) and, for the 50 % of students who required it, academic literacy and numeracy support sessions. For students who <b>have</b> English as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language</b> and with non-traditional entry qualifications, numeracy and academic literacy support is particularly valued...|$|R
