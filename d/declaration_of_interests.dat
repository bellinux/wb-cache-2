50|$|In October 2014, it was {{reported}} that Leung Chun-ying, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, had signed an agreement in 2011 with UGL Limited, an Australian engineering firm, in relation to its takeover of DTZ Holdings, a UK-listed real estate services company in which Leung was the director of the company. In agreement, UGL undertook to pay Leung £4 million (HK$50 million) in two instalments in 2012 and 2013 respectively, subject to specific conditions. As these payments concurred with the term of office of Leung Chun-ying as Chief Executive between 2012 and 2017, it has aroused concerns of the public in respect of the nature of payment, potential conflict of interests, relevant systems of <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and taxation implications.|$|E

5000|$|Fahy owns a 70-acre {{farm and}} {{prior to his}} trial worked as a {{salesman}} for New Ireland Assurance. He was appointed a Peace Commissioner in 1978, {{and was on the}} visiting committee of Limerick Prison until 2004. He ran in Galway West as an independent in the Irish general election, 1987, but later rejoined Fianna Fáil. In the 2004 local elections, Fahy was criticised for using thousands of prepaid Oireachtas envelopes to write to voters. He said [...] "I wanted to show I had the support of the Oireachtas members and if I hadn't done it like the other candidates, it would seem like I didn't have the same clout." [...] The judge at his 2007 trial alluded to Fahy's [...] "quite extensive property assets of great value"; his 2010 councillor's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> lists land at Cregclare, Ardrahan, and Caherduff.|$|E
50|$|As Leader of the House of Lords, Addison had the key {{responsibility}} of steering government legislation through the upper chamber. He formed {{a good relationship}} with the leader of the Conservative opposition in the Lords, the Marquess of Salisbury. Through general consultation, Addison developed new guidelines for peers, particularly with regard to <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> He was also Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in Attlee's first cabinet, directing the transformation of the Dominion Affairs Office into the Office of Commonwealth Relations and playing an instrumental role in Labour's early anti-imperialist policies and the strengthening of the British Commonwealth. In 1946, he became the first Labour politician to be made a Knight of the Garter. As his health began to deteriorate he withdrew from foreign affairs in 1947, subsequently holding a number of sinecure positions in combination with his leadership of the Lords, until Labour lost office in October 1951.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the members questioning the requirements of <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> of the Chief Executive pursuant to Article 47(2) of the Basic Law, [...] "the Chief Executive, on assuming office, shall declare his or her assets to the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Chief Secretary for Administration Carrie Lam elaborated that the term [...] "assets" [...] was not specifically defined under the Basic Law and the contents of relevant declaration were confidential. More specifically on the UGL payments, Lam pointed out that [...] "the agreed payment arose from Leung's resignation from DTZ, not any future service to be provided by him". Thus Leung was not required to declare the resignation agreement. In terms of timing, both his resignation from DTZ and conclusion of the agreement with UGL took place before he was elected as the Chief Executive, and at the material time, he had already resigned from ExCo. Coupled {{with the fact that}} he had not provided any service to UGL after signing the resignation agreement, Leung was not required to make declaration of the UGL payments.|$|E
