25|$|Even though M. pharaonis is {{most often}} thought an indoor pest, {{foraging}} {{has been found to}} be more prevalent outside. Even inside colonies were found <b>to</b> forage <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>windows,</b> indicating a propensity for outdoor environment.|$|R
5|$|Hundreds {{of homes}} in the Hemel Hempstead area were evacuated, and about 2,000people had to find {{alternative}} accommodation; emergency services asked residents of the smoke-affected areas <b>to</b> <b>close</b> their <b>windows</b> and doors and to stay inside.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Anselo stopped <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window</b> and {{continued}} his playing.|$|R
6000|$|... "No one {{is allowed}} in Bunnybury without an order or {{a letter of}} {{introduction}} from either Ozma of Oz or Glinda the Good," [...] announced the rabbit; [...] "so that settles the matter," [...] and he started <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window.</b>|$|R

50|$|User interface: In Windows Vista, it is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window</b> and have the program run in the system tray while a scan is running. However, in Windows 7, this functionality was removed and the window must remain open while a scan is running.|$|R
60|$|Francis {{declined}} the cigar by a sign. 'Forgive me,' he said. 'I {{will leave you}} <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window.</b> I feel faint and giddy--I had better go out.' He put his handkerchief over his nose and mouth, and crossed {{the room to the}} door.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 October 2011, Maritime New Zealand ordered beaches from Mount Maunganui to Maketu Point, {{including}} the Maketu Estuary, <b>to</b> be <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> the public.

60|$|The little model edged <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window.</b> A {{stealthy}} watchfulness was {{creeping into}} her shrinking, dazed face.|$|R
60|$|We {{sat down}} {{together}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window,</b> {{and let the}} fragrant summer air breathe over our faces.|$|R
60|$|Faces {{wet with}} rain and {{perspiration}} tried to peep {{in at the}} window. Collot gave brief orders to the soldiers <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the shutters at once and to push away the crowd, but the crowd would not be pushed. It would not be gainsaid, and when the soldiers tried <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window,</b> twenty angry fists broke the panes of glass.|$|R
60|$|Dallas went to {{the junior}} study. There were Plunkett's books on the table, but of their owner no signs were to be seen. The Mutual Friend had {{had the good sense}} <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window</b> after he had climbed through it, and Dallas did not suspect what had {{actually}} happened. He returned to Vaughan.|$|R

60|$|He was by {{this time}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window</b> of the farm, and he rose on his tip-toes and peeped in.|$|R
60|$|He went <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window.</b> Something rapped smartly {{against the}} {{brickwork}} over the frame, {{and made him}} start violently back.|$|R
50|$|The episode {{begins with}} two burglars (in the Duke's pay) shown ransacking Irene Adler's house. Irene's coachman John catches the burglars in the act. Irene herself follows John {{into the room}} with a {{revolver}} in her hand. Without summoning the police, Irene brandishes the gun and motions the burglars to leave. John tries to protest but Irene asks him <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>windows.</b>|$|R

5000|$|If S wants H <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window,</b> he may say [...] "It's cold in here." [...] If H answers [...] "I'll go {{close the}} window" [...] {{then he is}} {{responding}} to this potentially threatening act by giving a [...] "gift" [...] to the original speaker and therefore S avoids the potential threat of ordering H around and H gets credit for being generous or cooperative ...|$|R
60|$|The Greystoke {{bungalow}} was {{not well}} adapted for defense. No palisade surrounded it, for, situated as it was, {{in the heart of}} loyal Waziri, its master had anticipated no possibility of an attack in force by any enemy. Heavy, wooden shutters there were <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window</b> apertures against hostile arrows, and these Mugambi was engaged in lowering when Lady Greystoke appeared upon the veranda.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Blood {{knocked the}} ashes from his pipe, and drew back <b>to</b> <b>close</b> his <b>window.</b> As he did so, his glance {{travelling}} straight {{across the street}} met at last the glance of those hostile eyes that watched him. There were two pairs, and they belonged to the Misses Pitt, two amiable, sentimental maiden ladies who yielded to none in Bridgewater in their worship of the handsome Monmouth.|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} huddled <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a <b>window,</b> looking {{out into the}} rain, when Dan Baxter threw aside the pipe he had been smoking and {{approached}} them.|$|R

50|$|About 140 miners were marooned {{underground}} in the Falconbridge mine in Sudbury {{when the}} power went out. Mine {{officials said they were}} safe and could be evacuated if necessary, but were not due to the risks of doing so with no power. They were safely evacuated by the morning. In Sarnia, a refinery scrubber lost power and released above-normal levels of pollution; residents were advised <b>to</b> <b>close</b> their <b>windows.</b>|$|R
60|$|They again went <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window,</b> {{pushed the}} {{casement}} {{a little more}} open, and stood listening there. In {{two or three minutes}} there was a very slight sound heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "We all use it?" [...] she {{repeated}} after me, vaguely, not coming <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window</b> {{but looking at}} my shoes. She appeared to think me capable of throwing her out.|$|R
50|$|Jack Mabry {{drinks and}} watches {{a golf tournament}} on television, while his wife Madylyn takes their {{daughter}} up to bed for a nap, where an insect buzzes around the window. She goes downstairs and tells Jack that she's leaving him. He runs upstairs to the bedroom and holds their daughter out the window, threatening to drop her if Madylyn leaves. She agrees to stay and rushes <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>window,</b> killing the insect.|$|R
60|$|He led him <b>to</b> an easy-chair <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window.</b> He {{opened it}} a few inches, and a current of strong fresh air came {{sweeping}} in. Then he poured some brandy into a glass {{and gave it to}} Kate.|$|R
60|$|This {{was quickly}} agreed upon, {{and the four}} boys left the hotel and walked out on a gravel path <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window.</b> As the day was warm, the window was wide open.|$|R
50|$|One {{way to end}} {{the cycle}} may be to use {{keyboard}} shortcuts (like Alt+F4 in Windows) instead of the mouse <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>windows.</b> Multiple <b>windows</b> can be <b>closed</b> quickly with this method, although it may not always work {{if there is a}} resident program which is opening them. Browser extensions which disable scripting for all but a trusted whitelist of sites, such as NoScript Security Suite, can be a useful defence against mousetrapping and malicious sites.|$|R
50|$|While {{serving as}} a member of the House of Representatives, Jackson was a very active member; he served on over 20 {{committees}} and reported on many more. It was during his first term that Jackson became known for his fiery temper and personality; there was a point when he became so impassioned over the topic at hand that the senators who were meeting above the House chambers had <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the <b>windows</b> so as to muffle Jackson's voice.|$|R
