40|$|This article {{outlines}} a key {{aspect of}} a recent AHRC funded project concerning the application of competition law in the national courts of the European Union Member States. This was an empirical project with rapporteurs for 27 Member States entrusted {{with the task of}} identifying competition case-law judgments in their national courts in the period between 1 May 1999 and 1 May 2012. Each national report also outlined key aspects of the wider legal context within which private enforcement of competition law operates in that jurisdiction. The general hypothesis that underlies the dual approach to the project is that private enforcement practice across the legal systems of the EU Member States may at least partly be explained by the existence or availability of particular institutions, mechanisms and cultural factors in relation to the particular legal system. In this article we considered two particular institutions or mechanisms: the specialist court/tribunal and the competition litigation <b>follow-on</b> <b>action</b> mechanism. The picture presented by the data together with the national reports is one of evolving national stories and contexts - which appear to be affected {{to a greater or lesser}} extent in different Member States by a combination of national cultures, competition law architecture and civil procedural rules. It is not claimed that there are any direct causal relationships between the insights provided by the empirical data and the national narratives on institutional mechanisms, but the analysis indicates ways and contexts in which competition litigation cultures may develop in the wake of specific institutional mechanisms. The article concludes that it is inevitable that patterns of competition litigation will continue to vary considerably across the EU for the foreseeable future, reflecting, to a great extent, the variable landscape of legal and institutional provision for private enforcement in the EU Member States...|$|E
40|$|On 3 July 1988 at 1024 local time, the Aegis cruiser, USS Vincennes (CG 49), {{shot down}} Iran Air Flight 655 with two {{standard}} missiles. The civilian airliner {{was on a}} routine, international flight from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, flying on a designated commercial airway. The missiles intercepted the airliner at a range of eight nautical miles (NM) from the Vincennes {{at an altitude of}} 13, 500 ft. All 290 passengers and crew were killed. 1 It has been over five years since this tragedy, but the Vincennes incident remains a contentious issue. Many questions have been raised and remain unanswered, and perhaps never will be fully answered given the complex nature of the event and the strong feelings it has evoked in all who were touched by its horrible consequences. Despite the continuing controversy that surrounds the case, we believe there is still the opportunity for learning. Thus we revisit the Vincennes incident not in the spirit of recrimination or fault-finding, but in the hope that it can teach us how to minimize the chances of a similar occurrence in the future. We begin by summarizing the various inquiries, both official and unofficial, that have centered on the Vincennes incident. Limited by space and unable to do justice to all of the factors in this complex incident, we focus on one intriguing issue that has plagued all who have reviewed the case - the flight pattern of the Iranian airbus. Was it ascending or descending toward the Vincennes? We examine one possible explanation for the confusion over the flight path - the transposition of computer-assigned track numbers between Flight 655 and another aircraft in the operating area. Using the unclassified data from the formal investigation and report conducted by Rear Admiral Fogarty, we explore the extent to which thetransposition of the track numbers could have been a factor in the downing of the Airbus. We conclude with some of the lessons to be learned in undertaking this exercise and recommendations for <b>follow-on</b> <b>action.</b> Naval Postgraduate Schoo...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} answer a {{frequently}} asked question in competition law. Where a cartelist sells to a direct purchaser who passes on the loss to a third party, {{to what extent can}} the cartelist avail himself of a defence that the direct purchaser has passed on the loss, and can the consumer have a direct cause of action against the cartelist? The paper explores how established principles of tort and unjust enrichment can provide an answer to this without distorting settled principles of substantive law and procedure. A. INTRODUCTION Lately there has been significant interest among the competition law community in the private enforcement of competition law. In the English courts private enforcement is possible as either a <b>follow-on</b> <b>action,</b> where a public enforcement body (the Office of Fair Trading in the UK) has already launched a successful action, 1 or a standalone action in the Chancery Division, where there is no public enforcement. 2 Where an undertaking breaks competition law either under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“ TFEU”) or the Competition Act 1998, the claimant may bring an action for breach of statutory duty. This is more controversial than sometimes acknowledged, but for our purposes we will accept the proposition. 3 When, therefore, for example, a cartelist sells to the direct purchaser at an illegal anticompetitive overcharge, he breaches his statutory duty under the Competition Act 1998, s. 2 or under the European Communities Act 1972, s. 2 (1) in those cases where TFEU, Art. 101 is engaged. The problem with which we are primarily concerned in this paper is where a cartelist (“C”) sells to a direct purchaser (“DP”) who then sells on to an indirect purchaser end user (“ IP”). An important debate takes place around the question whether IP has a cause of action against C. Linked to this is the question whether, if DP sues C, C can claim that DP has passed on its loss and therefore has no recoverable losses, or diminished losses...|$|E

Can private enforcement be an efficient complement to the hitherto system (predominantly public), and if so, where are the limits of it?

40|$|The {{research}} {{focus is}} {{an assessment of}} disclosure rules in the European Union and a perspective for implementation of the US discovery rules to improve European private enforcement. For these purposes the EU disclosure rules are compared with the US discovery rules; the influence of tension between disclosure of evidence and leniency programme {{on the effectiveness of}} protection of information is analyzed in order to propose areas for improvement and solutions to find a balance between some inconsistencies of the EU disclosure rules with interests of European plaintiffs in cartel litigations. The research method is not limited to a doctrinal approach to the EU and US legislation, but includes case law, and secondary sources. This paper does not deal with particular types of evidence and generic issues of disclosure unrelated to the cartel cases. The author contends that the American model of discovery in cartel cases cannot be transferred to the European context completely, even though disclosure of evidence in the EU is rather inefficient, and new rules are unlikely to protect consumers’ interests. In terms of consumers’ interests, protection facilitating <b>follow-on</b> <b>actions</b> looks more relevant on the EU level.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs the United States continues to develop plans and policies {{to counter the}} threat of terrorism, it becomes increasingly more vital to understand the entire spectrum of the threat. Realistically assessing the capability of possible and probable terrorist groups helps federal and state agencies to establish potential methods and procedures for defense and maritime domain awareness. Yet, the avenues of attack and the varieties of terrorists far outnumber the available resources of most agencies concerned. Moreover, there have been no attacks on homeland U. S. targets since September 11. The red team concept provides an innovative method to examine these vulnerabilities from the terrorist perspective. The effectiveness of a red team can be measured in various ways and is dependent on key organizational and situational elements. In the end, the determination of effectiveness is based on the original intentions of the host enterprise, whether it is training, research, strategy, or analysis or a combination. We conducted a case study to utilize the red team concept as a tool for bringing a fresh awareness to a critical issue within the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. The red teams identified vulnerabilities of possible targets, raised the awareness on the nature of terrorists, researched potential tactics and tools, and examined existing assumptions about maritime security.

40|$|In this thesis, {{insights}} {{of the law}} and economics literature were collected in order to develop the features of an optimal group litigation concerning the deterrence of European Competition Law violation and these were then compared to the proposals of the European Commission in the White Paper on damages actions. Chapter 1 and 2 provide the basis for the analysis conducted in remainder of this thesis. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the enforcement of European Competition law including the rationale of European Competition Law, the debate about private versus public enforcement in general, and the discussed legal changes to enhance private enforcement. Chapter 2 provides the economic and legal framework used to analyse the efficiency of group litigation mechanisms with regard to deterrence of competition law infringements. This structure is mainly based on economic insights and knowledge developed in the Law and Economics literature. Such an economics based approach entails a choice as to the goal to be pursued by private enforcement to be that of deterrence of unlawful conduct, in this specific case, the (inefficient) breach of competition law and the focus on total welfare. Therefore the {{insights of}} the theories on optimal deterrence are applied to the setting of private enforcement of competition law. Using the economic framework laid out in Chapters 1 and 2, in Chapter 3 turns to two necessarily slightly abstract forms of existing group litigation mechanisms, i. e [...] collective actions and representative actions. These different actions were analysed with regard to their potential to achieve deterrence. Outcomes resulting from an initial analysis showed that the optimal group litigation mechanisms {{from the point of view}} of society at large (total welfare approach), would be a stand-alone action brought in the form of a mandatory group litigation, including all losses caused to society at large. The main arguments for that outcome are that to reach optimal deterrence, the penalty imposed on the infringer, in the form of damages to be paid, should be based on total harm caused to society, and therefore include all losses caused to all different members of society. This leads to the conclusion that the optimal group litigation should incorporate all individual losses in one proceeding, to be (cost-) efficient. Therefore, and because free riding problems can be eliminated, the optimal system would be a mandatory one, rather than opt-in or opt-out mechanism. It is shown that stand alone actions are to be preferred over <b>follow-on</b> <b>actions</b> from an efficient deterrence perspective, as only the former increase the rate of detection. This is important as it is increased detection that decreases the amount of the optimal sanction, which otherwise may be prohibitively large, and also when the availability bias leads to a greater value of the risk of detection compared to an increase in the damage awards, i. e. the imposed monetary penalties. <b>Follow-on</b> <b>actions</b> merely contribute to the amount of sanction faced by the infringer when public fines are too low to deter. However, it would be more (cost) efficient in such cases, where the public fine is too low, that the public fine be instead raised sufficiently. Therefore, the analysis continued focusing on mandatory stand-alone group actions. In the analysis of the two abstract forms of existing group litigation systems of collective and representative actions, problems and obstacles to private litigation for damages specific to certain types of breaches of European Competition Law were taken into account. The analysis suggests that neither collective nor representative actions will be the optimal group litigation mechanism in the sense of the best group litigation to reach the goal of efficient deterrence, unless the existing systems were to be substantially altered. Problems specific to collective actions, such as the necessity of one of the victims (lead plaintiff) to become active on behalf of himself and other victims of the infringement, render that particular system of bundling similar claims into one procedure less efficient. This is especially so in those cases where the information asymmetry on the side of the victims is large. One way to reduce such problems would be to motivate the lawyer representing the group of victims to become the actual driving force and the active party. However, as the analysis shows, problems and large inefficiencies occur when the collective action is not adequately and explicitly designed to have a lead lawyer, rather than a lead plaintiff. Similar outcomes result in the analysis of representative actions brought by associations on behalf of the victims. One particular necessity crystallised out of this analysis: the incentives given to the acting agent need to be adequately taken into account and designed in any form of group litigation. In cases where typically individual victims (such as end consumers) will not be the acting agent themselves, this insight has large implications for other goals which one may pursue, such as complete compensation of individual losses of these victims. This important insight is the corner stone of the idea of a market based approach to private enforcement, where agents compete with each other for detection and litigation of competition law infringements. As has been shown, such a market may heal many of the problems and inefficiencies that would remain in the two stylised forms of existing mechanisms described before. Such a market with competing enforcement agents would, however, face similar problems as those unearthed in the discussion of the economic analysis of competition in research and development. Both are characterised by large upfront investments that are necessary in order to gain profits that are highly uncertain. Therefore, under a first-come, first-served mechanism, there will be many resources wasted in the competitive process. Solutions to these market failures presented included the use of auctions for the right to litigate after detection of a certain infringement has taken place. This solution would not only increase the efficiency of the market idea in general, but also those of other systems of collective actions or representative actions when characterised by strong competition and races to the courts. After the features of the theoretical optimal system of group litigation with regard to deterrence were determined, the insights gained are used in Chapter 4 to compare and discuss the efficiency of the Commission’s proposal against this benchmark. The analysis shows that the proposed mechanisms do not reach the potential efficiency of the theoretical optimal solution developed in the previous Chapter. This result was no surprise, as the starting point or goal to be achieved though private enforcement in the Commission’s point of view, is presumably not deterrence - at least not the dominating one. Moreover, while the theoretical analysis in Chapter 3 focuses on stand-alone actions, the Commission wants to encourage <b>follow-on</b> <b>actions</b> in addition to stand-alone actions. The examination nevertheless highlights the inefficiencies, necessary trade-offs, and some of the costs imposed on society should those particular mechanisms suggested by the Commission be chosen. These considerations are also relevant for <b>follow-on</b> <b>actions</b> and for achieving other goals. A discussion of the goals other than deterrence also shows that even these goals may not be achieved to the highest degree possible. After all, the choices made by the Commission can be interpreted to stem from compromises made in the issues (e. g. the goals) themselves and in the political arena (e. g. taking harmonisation and implementation costs into account). The fifth Chapter illustrates the basic features of three selected legal systems, i. e., the group litigation mechanisms as developed in the US, UK and Germany. These are then compared to the features of the theoretical optimal solution developed in Chapter 3. As these existing mechanisms deviate substantially from the theoretical benchmark, they are unlikely to achieve the optimal deterrence results the optimal group litigation mechanisms are argued to achieve. However, the stark differences between the developed systems and their experienced effectiveness and difficulties provide some partial support to the insights gained in the theoretical part of Chapter 3. In very broad terms, it seems that less attention was paid to the question of who would actually have incentives to become active under the current systems, and which problems might occur and what possible regulative remedies to these might be enacted, the less effective the systems turned out to be. This outcome would also hold, if the goal to be achieved would be anything other than deterrence, for example corrective justice as compensation of individual victims. If the incentives structures that the economic analysis highlights are neglected neither deterrence not compensation can be achieved in any efficient or even just effective way...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The class action is an important instrument for the enforcement of consumers' rights, particularly in personal actions for low sums known as Negative Expected Value (NEV) suits. Collective redress actions transform NEV suits into Positive Expected Value suits using economies of scale by the aggregation of smaller actions into a single legal action which is economically worthwhile pursuing. Collective redress promotes adherence to the law, deters illegal actions and furthers public interests. Collective redress also helps {{in the management of}} multiple cases in court. The introduction of a new class action model in Israel has proven to be very workable {{in the sense that it}} has improved access to justice, albeit that this system currently suffers from over-use, referred to in this work as the "flood problem". The purpose of this research is to introduce a class action model which brings with it the advantages of the Israeli model, as well as improvements upon it so as to promote consumer confidence in low figure transactions by individuals with large, powerful companies. The new model suggested in this work relies on the opt-out mechanism, monitored by regulatory bodies through public regulation or by private regulators. The reliance on the supremacy of public enforcement and <b>follow-on</b> <b>actions</b> over private stand-alone actions should make the system of collective redress more efficient than the current Israeli model, reducing the risk of a flood of actions whilst at the same time improving access to justice for large groups of claimants. Thus far, no unified European class action mechanism has been developed, and only some member states have developed their own systems. The model discussed in this work may be implemented as a unified set of rules in Europe, with some additional adjustments, such as those covering cross-border trade, to promote confidence in trade within the European Union...|$|R

In particular, we address the challenges in: (1) establishing an automated data collection infrastructure, (2) achieving timely access to quality data from disparate sources, (3) developing sensitive and specific outbreak detection algorithms, and (4) developing comprehensive and realistic simulation models for detection-algorithm development and validation. In addition, we identify unique attributes of military and North Atlantic Treaty Organization settings that may affect the development, deployment, and usage of medical surveillance systems. We conclude that considerable work and research are needed to overcome these challenges, that the information provided by these systems may lack the necessary specificity for <b>follow-on</b> mitigating <b>actions,</b> and that their cost-effectiveness and practical relevance, vis-à-vis the traditional reliance on health care providers to identify outbreaks, is still to be demonstrated.

40|$|The {{growth of}} private {{antitrust}} litigation {{in the courts}} of the Member States creates tensions between claimants and competition authorities. Claimants seek access to confidential records held by the authorities while the competition authorities try to maintain the confidentiality of those files. This article analyses the two main access routes to confidential information in the files of competition authorities in the EU. It first looks at access under Regulation 1049 / 2001 (Transparency Regulation). Then, the article assesses the framework for disclosure in the national courts, analysing the Court of Justice’s Pfleiderer and Donau Chemie decisions, its application in England and Germany, and {{the changes that are}} required with the adoption of the Damages Directive. It finds that both access routes tend to favour the protection of authority files and that access-seeking parties face high-legal thresholds for the disclosure of files and leniency documents. It argues that the raised standard for access demonstrates a policy change regarding private antitrust enforcement. EU policy makers and the courts have begun to moderate the principle of effective redress as expressed in Courage and Manfredi. In order to minimize repercussions for public enforcement they reduce the incentives for claimants to bring <b>follow-on</b> damages <b>actions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The IOCCG-supported {{workshop}} “Phytoplankton Composition from Space: {{towards a}} validation strategy for satellite algorithms” was organized as {{a follow-up to}} the Phytoplankton Functional Types from Space splinter session, held at the International Ocean Colour Science Meeting (Germany, 2013). The specific goals of the workshop were to: 1. 	Provide {{a summary of the}} status of activities from relevant IOCCG working groups, the 2 nd PFT intercomparison working group, PFT validation data sets and other research developments. 2. 	Provide a PFT validation strategy that considers the different applications of PFT products: and seeks community consensus on datasets and analysis protocols. 3. 	Discuss possibilities for sustaining ongoing PFT algorithm validation and intercomparison activities. The workshop included 15 talks, breakout sessions and plenary discussions. Talks covered community algorithm intercomparison activity updates, review of established and novel methods for PFT validation, validation activities for specific applications and space-agency requirements for PFT products and validation. These were followed by general discussions on (a) major recommendations for global intercomparison initiative in respect to validation, intercomparison and user’s guide; (b) developing a community consensus on which data sets for validation are optimal and which measurement and analysis protocols should be followed to support sustained validation of PFT products considering different applications; (c) the status of different validation data bases and measurement protocols for different PFT applications, and (d) engagement of the various user communities for PFT algorithms in developing PFT product specifications. From these discussions, two breakout groups provided in depth discussion and recommendations on (1) validation of current algorithms and (2) work plan to prepare for validation of future missions. Breakout group 1 provided an action list for progressing the current international community validation and intercomparison activity. Breakout group 2 provided the following recommendations towards developing a future validation strategy for satellite PFT products: 1. Establish a number of validation sites that maintain measurements of a key set of variables. 2. This set of variables should include: •	Phytoplankton pigments from HPLC, phycobilins from spectrofluorometry •	Phytoplankton cell counts and ID, volume / carbon estimation and imaging (e. g. from flow cytometry, FlowCam, FlowCytobot type technologies) •	Inherent optical properties (e. g. absorption, backscattering, VSF) •	Hyperspectral radiometry (both above and in-water) •	Particle size distribution •	Size-fractionated measurements of pigments and absorption •	Genetic / -omics data 3. Undertake an intercomparison of methods / instruments over several years at a few sites to understand our capabilities to fully characterize the phytoplankton community. 4. Organise workshops to address the following topics: •	Techniques for particle analysis, characterization and classification •	Engagement with modellers and understanding end-user requirements •	Data storage and management, standards for data contributors, data challenges In conclusion, the workshop was assessed to have fulfilled its goals. A follow-on meeting will be organized during the International Ocean Colour Science Meeting 2015 in San Francisco.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} research was to quantify the effects of fuel fire and the <b>follow-on</b> fire extinguishing <b>actions</b> on wireless shipboard communications in the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. Directional and non-directional antennas with horizontal and vertical polarization, and a PC-controlled scalar network analyzer, were used onboard ex-USS SHADEWELL to measure the attenuation of 2. 4 - 2. 485 GHz signals transmitted through diesel and heptane fire, water mist created by the fire extinguishing system, and subsequently developed steam. A MATLAB code has been used to analyze the data statistically. The attenuation for directional antennas exhibits relatively small variations wit time and frequency, but fire and the follow-on fire-extinguishing phases create sever non-stationary frequency selective fading for non-directional antennas. Therefor standard communication techniques effective against frequency selective fading (non stationary but slowly varying with time) are recommended for use with communication systems intended for shipboard indoors use. Even in normal conditions, without fire, water mist, or steam, we have determined that frequency selective fading would be problem for non-directional antennas used in shipboard compartments and thus a system with anti-fading ca ability should be considered for ship board use[URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} to a {{survey conducted by the}} author in the framework of Euro-Comp-Aid, a networking programme co-funded by the European Commission, DG Competition, and directed by the author. Several experts, mainly from National Competition Authorities (NCAs) of the EU Member States, answered a questionnaire drafted by the author of the study. The study reflects on some of the most interesting results of the survey, as to the actual impact of cooperation tools provided for by Article 15 of Regulation 1 / 2003. It also addresses {{the ways in which the}} legal systems of Member States complement Article 15 cooperation tools especially as concerns NCAs. Such national mechanisms of cooperation between courts dealing with private enforcement cases and public enforcement authorities are assessed by taking into account their soundness in the framework of the modernization and decentralization of EU competition law and some concerns about possible inconsistencies with the system designed by Article 267 TFEU. Due account is also taken of the role played by NCA public enforcement findings before civil courts dealing with private enforcement <b>follow-on</b> <b>actions.</b> First of all, the article analyzes the effective role as amicus curiae role played by the German Bundeskartellamt before German courts, stressing on the other side the unsatisfactory consideration German Supreme Court gives to the preliminary ruling mechanism. Then, the French Autorité de la Concurrence position as an amicus curiae is considered, noting in particular the interesting French approach to disclosure of public enforcement files, strictly intertwined with the amicus curiae role of the Authority; another issue which gives interesting hints on a question of general interest in the field, is that of coordination between NCA and Commission's interventions before national Courts. The focus is then on British NCAs role as amici curiae, where the more general question is addressed of the relationship between general courts and specialized competition courts entrusted with judicial review over NCA acts, in light of the decentralized nature of the EU competition law enforcement system, and of the sincere cooperation principle of EU law. Again, as for the German approach, an unsatisfactory consideration of Art. 267 TFEU procedures is observed. The Italian model is then analyzed, based on a strict separation between administrative and judicial functions, which requires a strict reading of the res indicate effect of EC decisions and will eventually make the enactment of the enforcement directive a quite delicate issue. As for the French approach, the usefulness of resorting to general tools of the law of evidence is stressed, instead of relying too much on (not satisfactory) tools of direct cooperation. The position of the Spanish Comisión Nacional de la Competencia in the EU decentralized system of competition law enforcement is then taken into consideration, by stressing not only the active role public enforcement authorities can have before Spanish civil courts, but also the useful assistance they can provide to courts in damage assessment. The complementarity between special EU law cooperation tools, and general tools provided for by national law is then highlighted when it comes to the assessment of the Swedish legal system; at the same time, the analysis of Swedish practice shows the decisive role such cooperation might have in interim proceedings, as well as the risks inherent in such situations. Further, some other Member State legal systems are taken into account, that seem to have gone further than EU law itself in providing for cooperation between civil courts entrusted with private enforcement and public enforcement agencies, by setting some forms of reinforced and even structural connection between the two sides of competition law enforcement. This is the case of Malta, Latvia and Romania. In all of these Member States, a system is put in place, which goes to a certain extent beyond the model of smooth cooperation outlined by Article 15 Regulation 1 / 03. Such approaches might favor the effectiveness of EU competition law enforcement. In some cases, however, the risks arises of compromising the unitary character of EU competition law. The role of preliminary rulings proceedings under art. 267 TFEU remains therefore essential. Czech, Slovakian, Luxembourgish and Bulgarian systems are finally considered. Besides making apparent obvious differences existing among various Member States, the study shows the need for a more comprehensive and coherent approach to cooperation between courts dealing with private enforcement cases and administrative authorities entrusted with public enforcement powers. It also shows the need to preserve the European Court of Justice’s role in ensuring the uniform interpretation of EU competition law, which some national approaches risk jeopardizing...|$|R
