5000|$|Cecropia fruit, {{known as}} snake fingers, are a popular food of diverse animals however, {{including}} bats like the common fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) or Carollia species, the Central American squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii), and birds like the <b>green</b> <b>aracari</b> (Pteroglossus viridis), the keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), the peach-fronted conure (Eupsittula aurea), the bare-throated bellbird (Procnias nudicollis) and particularly nine-primaried oscines.

The elfin-woods warbler (Setophaga angelae) is notable for using Cecropia leaves as nesting material, which no other New World warbler (family Parulidae) seems to do.|$|E
