5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and its closest relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began <b>diverging</b> from a common ancestor around 12 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene, with C.violaceus itself <b>diverging</b> from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed a symbiotic relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden jackal <b>diverging</b> from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf <b>diverging</b> 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} vampire bats arose from insectivores, which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin.
