5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{also has}} the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> to cool them evaporatively. This {{behavior}} is exhibited by storks and New World vultures.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sequel}} to , T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{introduced}} two new Terminator characters. The first is the Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> into stabbing weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought {{to have such a}} delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with <b>its</b> <b>legs,</b> but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour {{is quite different from}} that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E

5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle <b>its</b> <b>legs.</b> Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. <b>Its</b> <b>legs</b> and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed vulture {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. <b>Its</b> <b>legs</b> are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed vulture. Its flight is also less steady {{than that of the}} greater yellow-headed vulture. The lesser yellow-headed vulture also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow-headed vulture.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E

5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} {{than those of}} the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins {{than those of the}} male, leading to a more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. <b>Its</b> <b>legs</b> and feet are a little lighter than those of the male. Moulting appears to take place in stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} was {{described}} in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires. Burmeister originally placed it in the becard genus, Pachyramphus. It {{was moved to the}} monotypic genus Xenopsaris by Robert Ridgway in 1891, but was still known to be closely related to Pachyramphus. A 1989 study of anatomy identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris, but the white-naped xenopsaris was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of <b>its</b> <b>legs,</b> the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) and the construction of the nest.|$|E

5|$|As the day progresses, Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) becomes {{restless and}} sneaks {{into the barn}} to observe Randall; Randall tries to {{convince}} Carl to release him. Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing rocks at it and then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before running back to camp, not telling anyone what happened. Meanwhile, Beth (Emily Kinney) has since recovered from her earlier suicide attempt. When Glenn (Steven Yeun) comes {{to check on her}} condition, Hershel (Scott Wilson) gives him a family heirloom representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan).|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with <b>its</b> <b>legs</b> drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. <b>Its</b> <b>legs</b> and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E
