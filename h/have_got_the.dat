5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is a {{painting}} by Matejko that portrays events {{from the history of}} Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the struggles of Eastern European principalities against Teutonic knights in general. In the center of the painting is the Lithuanian duke Vytautas (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. Vytautas holds a more prominent position in the painting than his cousin, Polish king Władysław Jagiełło (Jogaila), who is visible in the second plan, mounted, in the top right side. According to Scales and Zimmer, by focusing on Vytautas rather than Jagiełło, Matejko stressed the importance of Lithuania for Poland, and the value of cooperation between the two countries in the Polish–Lithuanian union. Others have noted that this placement likely was influenced by Matejko's reliance on the writings of Jan Długosz, who attributed greater importance to Vytautas than to Jagiełło, who, by some polish sources, commanded the battle. While Lithuanian sources claim that Vytautas The Great <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> very major role in the battle by actually commanding troops.

25|$|Based on this, Burley's account {{looks more}} like one of mistaken {{identity}} because, while his story matches {{the account of the}} Cordova's demise and subsequent rescue of four crew members in September 1888, the date of the Cordova's foundering was about 26 July 1888.

He {{made his}} debut on 15 September in a 1–0 home league win against Chelsea {{during which he}} made a block on Samuel Eto'o which prevented a certain goal, later being named man of the match. Later in the month Barry became the 10th player in Premier League history to make 500 career appearances in a 3–2 win over Newcastle United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 victory over Hull City on 19 October; the goal was originally awarded to Kevin Mirallas; however, the goals panel ruled that {{en route to the}} goal, Barry was deemed to <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> last touch on the ball before it beat Hull keeper Allan McGregor. He scored a long range effort in a 2–0 victory against Norwich City on 11 January 2014. He became a mainstay in Everton's midfield during the season and forged a partnership with James McCarthy. Barry completed the most passes of any Everton player during his spell as he helped the club amass a club record of 72 Premier League points to finish fifth. Barry was booked 10 times during the season to have the worst disciplinary record at the club.|$|E

He described Barnes as being a player of [...] "the highest calibre" [...] but sometimes being unable to reach for that bit extra when he or Captain Bryan Robson shouted at him to take more players on. Barnes himself has since said that he felt the systems played during his time as an England player were [...] "rigid" [...] and more focus was on speed, aggression, and attacking through the centre rather than a patient passing style of play. He also claimed that he could receive the ball as few as six or seven times throughout a match whereas at Liverpool he may receive it more than twenty times, and he had more freedom under Kenny Dalglish who did not ask him {{to stay on the}} left wing all the time. England also had a very different system to Liverpool at the time who were much more free-flowing, and later claimed that to <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> best out of him, they would have needed a similar system to the one used by Kenny Dalglish, which was never likely to happen.
