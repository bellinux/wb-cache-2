500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I just felt like I needed to put myself out there, just because it was a form of therapy for me and it did help me get through some shit. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|Russian {{artillery}} {{continued to}} {{fire on the}} Light Brigade. As Lucan advanced after them with the Heavy Brigade, he saw the Light Brigade being overwhelmed by the Russian artillery and ordered the Heavies back, saying that [...] "They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not the Heavy, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it". The remainder of the Light Brigade eventually reached the Russian artillery, wreaking havoc on the fleeing gunners, before pursuing the Russian cavalry behind the artillery down {{the remainder of the}} valley. Despite being outnumbered five to one, the British cavalry who pursued the Russians managed to disrupt the enemy for some time before being killed or captured. Of the cavalry who had stayed with the abandoned artillery guns, 60 or 70 were collected by George Paget, who retired back to the British lines despite Russian cavalry harrying them. The result was 110 dead, 130 wounded, and 58 missing or captured – 40 percent losses in an action that lasted 20 minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me ’ave {{a look at}} it," [...] ses Bob Pretty, {{going up}} to the table. [...] "I’m not going to ’ave my good name took away for nothing <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>’elp</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might get}} a look at that letter if you can," [...] {{suggested}} Mrs. Postwhistle, [...] "and {{tell me what you think}} about it. I don't want to spend the rest of my days in a lunatic asylum of my own <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>'elp</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do that, all right," [...] {{promised the}} delighted Tiggle. [...] "You've made {{a friend of}} me, little girl, and <b>if</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> you, I'll do it with pleasure." ...|$|R
500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help,</b> that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> you in any way, call me." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the {{original}} author ever has {{anything to say about}} how their book is treated, Allen replied: [...] "Not <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. You cannot open that can of worms. You sell your book, you go to the bank, you shut up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not of you. No, nor {{of any one}} else, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>help</b> it. I've {{promised to}} do this myself, and I will;" [...] and Jack wagged his head resolutely.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just call on me {{when you}} want me,' he said, 'where-ever you are. I'm never far away from anywhere, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>help</b> you, <b>I</b> shall not fail to do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’That’s true,’ ses the skipper, very thoughtful; ’I’ll go an’ send {{all hands}} on deck. As captain, it’s my duty {{not to leave}} the ship till the LAST, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> anyways <b>help</b> it.’ ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite Scott's {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} his anonymity, almost every reviewer guessed that Waverley was his work. Many readers too recognized his hand. One, Jane Austen, wrote: [...] "Walter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. – It is not fair. He has Fame and Profit enough as a Poet, {{and should not be}} taking the bread out of other people's mouths.– I do not like him, and do not mean to like Waverley <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it – but fear I must".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Morris {{published}} his second book, , about Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret physician convicted of killing {{his wife and}} two daughters on February 17, 1970. Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research. Morris explained in a July 2013 interview, prior to the reopening of the case: [...] "What happened here is wrong. It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> correct that, I will be a happy camper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented considerable {{evidence in}} an attempt to bind the Earps and Holliday over for trial. On {{the second day of the}} hearings, William Allen testified for the prosecution that [...] "the firing commenced by the Earp party. I think it was Doc Holliday who fired first." [...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was down there for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am not going to allow any trouble <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it.' They brushed past me." [...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E
6000|$|... "You spared my {{life when}} you easily might have taken it," [...] he said after we had {{proceeded}} some little way in silence, [...] "and I would aid you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to make your life here more bearable, but your fate is inevitable. You may never hope {{to return to the}} outer world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would," [...] {{answered}} Ozma seriously. [...] "You see, Glinda, {{if these are}} Oz people they are my subjects and I cannot allow any wars or troubles in the Land <b>I</b> rule, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>help</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I won't believe it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>help</b> it. <b>I</b> can't {{afford to}} lose my faith in my sister's perfection, or Philip's, especially now. But I must go; I have loitered too long, and Arnaud {{ought to go to}} his breakfast.' ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the proper}} {{interval}} {{between themselves and}} the Lights had developed, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade forward. The Heavies were also hit—Lucan himself [...] was slightly wounded, and his horse hit twice – but these men would have suffered more casualties {{had it not been}} for the charge of [...] the 150 men of the Chasseurs d'Afrique. The French cavalry had formed up to the left of the British position. When they had seen the Light Brigade cut up, Major Abdelal led an attack up the Fedioukine Heights to charge the flank of the Russian battery, forcing them to drag away their guns. Yet it was now that Lucan – concluding that the Light Brigade would be wiped out before they reached the Russians at the end of the valley — ordered the Heavy Brigade to halt their advance and retire, leaving Cardigan's men without support. Turning to Lord Paulet, he justified his action and his desire to preserve at least half of his cavalry division, [...] "They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not have the Heavy, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> {{you in any}} way I'm glad {{too that}} you've told me.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. [Laughing.] You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern. It won’t occur again, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... “Jumpin’ dogfish! Then I {{hope you}} catch them lubbers! <b>If</b> so be <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> ye any, don’t be afeered {{to call on}} me,” added the old sailor, earnestly.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Andrew replied awkwardly; [...] "anyway, not altogether. I {{felt that}} I {{ought to come}} back, even <b>if</b> there's nothing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do. Still, of course, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be of <b>help</b> here--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it now? Whatever it be, {{you may be}} sure of this, I {{will take}} it {{charitable}} like. I won't take nothing amiss; and <b>if</b> so be <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> you, <b>I</b> will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it,' said Mrs. King, sighing. If {{there were}} a thing she disliked above all others, it was Sunday visiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} so {{expressed}} it yourself, that's what I mean too. I assure you I shan't desert her. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> you--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did you say? I won't laugh <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it," [...] said Rose, {{curious to}} hear, for Steve's eyes were {{twinkling}} with fun.|$|E
6000|$|And Elma {{answered}} dreamily, {{with her}} great eyes far away, [...] "Yes, of course, I know he will. And I must be there too, {{to see how}} far, <b>if</b> at all, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I promised {{my friend}} that I would {{say nothing of}} the matter, and a promise is a promise,' said she; 'but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really <b>help</b> her when so serious a charge is laid against her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness, then I think I am absolved from my promise. I will tell you exactly what {{happened}} upon Monday evening.|$|R
6000|$|He {{hastened to}} say: [...] "I won't go <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>help</b> it, {{be sure of}} that; but something has come up which may make it necessary for me to--to take a trip. I'll return as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> I'll hurry away now and bring your baggage; that much <b>I</b> <b>can</b> surely do," [...] and he went out, leaving her greatly troubled by something unexplained {{in the manner of}} his going.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so sorry, Edward. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> in any way--I'll try my {{best with}} Noel to-morrow; and do {{come to me}} {{whenever}} you feel inclined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{simply said}} what I thought," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "They {{are not going}} to lay anything at Nellie's door <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I'm free I'm {{going to}} catch the fellow," [...] I {{returned}} decidedly. [...] "He shall not rob Mrs. Canby's house <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{strikes you}} in that light, Lecount--does it?" [...] said Noel Vanstone. [...] "I think so myself; I {{certainly}} think so. I won't pay the police a farthing <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>help</b> it." [...] He took up the letter again, and became fretfully perplexed over a second reading of it. [...] "But the man wants money!" [...] he broke out, impatiently. [...] "You seem to forget, Lecount, that the man wants money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a shame," [...] murmured Dick. [...] "Well, {{remember}} what <b>I</b> said, Dora, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>help</b> you <b>I</b> will." [...] And he squeezed her hand. Before they separated {{he gave her}} a silk handkerchief he had purchased at Cedarville, one with her initial in the corner, and she blushingly handed over a scarf made by herself. Dick was very proud of that scarf, although Tom and Sam teased him about it unmercifully.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I will!" [...] {{answered}} Lowiny, promptly, {{and with}} emphasis. [...] "Not a mortal soul shall know anything on't, and I won't {{so much as}} talk of it in my sleep, as <b>I</b> sometimes do, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> any way <b>help</b> it." ...|$|R
