Nevertheless, he is no less interested in creating tones of new colors combining primary colors, In this, the Impressionists of the west have influenced him.

Treated fruits were stored in CFB boxes for ripening at room temperature (mean maximum temperature 28. 650 C and minimum temperature 25. 240 C, RH 79 - 89 %).

Degradation of <b>green</b> colour was <b>noticed</b> in banana fruits with the advancement of ripening period of 10 days. Total sugars increased as the ripening duration progressed (1. 22 % to 24. 05 %). The mean starch content decreased (21. 52 % to 2. 53 %) gradually in banana fruits as the ripening advanced. Sensory quality characteristics with respect to taste and flavor (up to 9. 50 on 6 th day) and overall acceptability increased (up to 9. 25 on 4 th day) up to certain stage depending upon treatment and thereafter decreased during 10 days of ripening, whereas the firmness decreased (9. 00 to 4. 83) as the ripening duration progressed in all the treatments...|$|R
