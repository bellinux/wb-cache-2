5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he <b>hid</b> <b>a</b> <b>light,</b> illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|R

After the Revolution, Russian artists received Béraud's work with irony, seeing them {{as the embodiment of}} the Western commercial consumption, indulging in their opinion, in the rich middle-class tastes.Painting style gradually shifted from academic towards impressionism. However, while the major Impressionists fled the chaotic Paris and painted landscapes of the surrounding areas, Béraud - like his friend Édouard Manet (1832-1883), and in some of their paintings, Edgar Degas (1834-1917), depicted the urban life. Artistic techniques used by Béraud, in particular, when drawing the so-called À la salle Graffard, later became a classic.

50|$|The Comanche {{sheathed}} their tipis with {{a covering}} made of buffalo hides sewn together. To prepare the buffalo hides, women first spread {{them on the}} ground, then scraped away the fat and flesh with blades made from bones or antlers, and left them in the sun. When the hides were dry, they scraped off the thick hair, and then soaked them in water. After several days, they vigorously rubbed the <b>hides</b> in <b>a</b> mixture of animal fat, brains, and liver to soften the hides. The hides were made even more supple by further rinsing and working {{back and forth over}} a rawhide thong. Finally, they were smoked over a fire, which gave the <b>hides</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> tan color. To finish the tipi covering, women laid the tanned hides side by side and stitched them together. As many as 22 hides could be used, but 14 was the average. When finished, the hide covering was tied to a pole and raised, wrapped around the cone-shaped frame, and pinned together with pencil-sized wooden skewers. Two wing-shaped flaps {{at the top of the}} tipi were turned back to make an opening, which could be adjusted to keep out the moisture and held pockets of insulating air. With a fire pit in the center of the earthen floor, the tipis stayed warm in the winter. In the summer, the bottom edges of the tipis could be rolled up to let cool breezes in. Cooking was done outside during the hot weather. Tipis were very practical homes for itinerant people. Working together, women could quickly set them up or take them down. An entire Comanche band could be packed and chasing a buffalo herd within about 20 minutes. The Comanche women were the ones who did the most work with food processing and preparation.|$|R

40|$|Many {{theories}} {{beyond the}} Standard Model contain <b>hidden</b> photons. <b>A</b> <b>light</b> <b>hidden</b> photon will generically couple to the Standard Model through a kinetic mixing term, giving a powerful avenue for detection using "Light-Shining-Through-A-Wall"-type transmission experiments with resonant cavities. We demonstrate a parametric enhancement {{of the signal}} in such experiments, resulting from transmission of the longitudinal mode of the hidden photon. While previous literature {{has focused on the}} production and detection of transverse modes, the longitudinal mode allows a significant improvement in experimental sensitivity. Although optical experiments such as ALPS are unable to take useful advantage of this enhancement, the reach of existing microwave cavity experiments such as CROWS is significantly enhanced beyond their published results. Future microwave cavity experiments, designed with appropriate geometry {{to take full advantage of}} the longitudinal mode, will provide a powerful probe of hidden-photon parameter space extending many orders of magnitude beyond current limits, including significant regions where the hidden photon can be dark matter.

25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface.

40|$|Invisibility cloaks, {{which used}} to be {{confined}} to the realm of fiction, have now been turned into a scientific reality thanks to the enabling theoretical tools of transformation optics and conformal mapping. Inspired by those theoretical works, the experimental realization of electromagnetic invisibility cloaks has been reported at various electromagnetic frequencies. All the invisibility cloaks demonstrated thus far, however, have relied on nano- or micro-fabricated artificial composite materials with spatially varying electromagnetic properties, which limit the size of the cloaked region to a few wavelengths. Here, we report the first realization of a macroscopic volumetric invisibility cloak constructed from natural birefringent crystals. The cloak operates at visible frequencies and is capable of <b>hiding,</b> for <b>a</b> specific <b>light</b> polarization, three-dimensional objects of the scale of centimetres and millimetres.

We demonstrated that for <b>a</b> <b>light</b> mass of <b>hidden</b> photon (m_γ_D≪ <b>a</b> few keV), compatible results are obtained for the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey observation, but the stringent limits would be imposed on the kinetic mixing ϵ. We performed χ^ 2 -tests to acquire a quantitative assessment on the WDLF data in the context of our model, computed under the assumption of different kinetic mixing ϵ, the age of the oldest computed stars T_D, and a constant star formation rate ψ. Then taken together, the WDLF analysis of 2 σ confidence interval ϵ = (0. 37 ^+ 0. 35 _- 0. 37) × 10 ^- 14 is barely consistent with the cooling rate analysis at 2 σ regime ϵ = (0. 97 ^+ 0. 35 _- 0. 37) × 10 ^- 14.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{explanations}} for the so-called alignment effect in high redshift (z> 0. 7) radio galaxies is the scattering by dust of the <b>hidden</b> quasar <b>light.</b> <b>As</b> shown by De Young (1998) a problem with the dust scattering model is that the short destruction time-scale for dust grains means that they will not survive the passage of the radio jet. We investigate the survival of dust in the extended ionised gas of nearby active galaxies with jet/gas interactions. We discuss the implications on the alignment effect of high redshift (> 0. 7) radio galaxies. We conclude that although shocks are likely to destroy dust grains in regions of interaction, dust might survive in enough quantities to scatter light from the active nucleus and produce alignment between scattered light and the radio structures. We propose an observational test to investigate the existence of dust in shocked regions based on the sensitivity of calcium to depletion onto dust grains.
