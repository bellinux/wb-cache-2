40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the influence of decortication of the posterior elements of the vertebra (recipient bed) and the nature of the bone graft (cortical or cancellous bone) on graft integration and bone, cartilage and fiber neoformation in the interface between the vertebral recipient bed and the bone graft. Seventy-two male Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups according to the presence or absence of decortication of the posterior vertebral elements and the use of a cortical or cancellous bone graft. Group I—the posterior elements were decorticated and cancellous bone used. Group II—the posterior elements were decorticated and cortical graft was used. Group III—the posterior elements were not decorticated and cancellous graft was used. Group IV—the posterior elements were not decorticated and cortical graft was used. The animals were killed 3, 6 and 9  weeks after surgery and the interface between the posterior elements and the bone graft was subjected to histomorphometric evaluation. Mean percent neoformed bone was 40. 8 % in group I (decortication and cancellous graft), 39. 13 % in group II (decortication and cortical graft), 6. 13 % in group III (non-decorticated and cancellous graft), and 9. 27 % in group IV (non-decorticated and cortical graft) for animals killed at 3  weeks (P =  0. 0005). For animals killed at 6  weeks, the mean percent was 38. 53 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> I, 40. 40 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> II, 10. 27 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> III, and 7. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> IV (P =  0. 0005), and for animals killed at 9  weeks, the mean was 25. 93 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> I, 30. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> II, 16. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> III, and 18. 73 % <b>for</b> <b>group</b> IV (P =  0. 0026).

The statistically significant differences in percent tissue formation were related to decortication of the posterior elements.

5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous <b>for</b> <b>groups</b> if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-seventeenth century, the {{extension}} of toleration to sectaries under the Commonwealth brought a number of independent movements to Scotland. The only one not to collapse after {{the withdrawal of the}} army at the Restoration in 1660 were the Quakers. Their numbers remained small in the eighteenth century and they were largely confined to the large cities and the northwest. Baptist churches had been founded in several towns during the Commonwealth, largely consisting of English soldiers and their families. They lapsed when the English occupation ended and the first Scottish Baptist church is usually thought to be founded at Keiss in 1750 by William Sinclair. Occasionally individual Presbyterian ministers led their congregations out of existing churches and into independent churches, leading to the establishment of isolated churches <b>for</b> <b>groups</b> like the Unitarians. The series of evangelical enterprises undertaken by the brothers James and Robert Haldane in the period 1796–1800, which led to the foundation of Sunday schools, day schools and tabernacles in parts of the Lowlands, Highlands and Islands, helped strengthen the Baptist and Congregational churches when the brothers later embraced adult Baptism and the congregations divided between the two traditions.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names <b>for</b> <b>groups</b> of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
