5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal <b>defendant</b> {{has a right}} to trial by jury. The <b>defendant</b> does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the <b>defendant</b> is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the <b>defendant</b> {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the <b>defendant</b> has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the <b>defendant</b> be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a <b>defendant</b> from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the <b>defendant</b> may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a <b>defendant</b> from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the <b>defendant.</b> Similarly, the <b>defendant</b> has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E

When the trialists took over their own defence during the State of Emergency, they eventually convinced prison authorities to let them meet to plan their defence and white female <b>defendants,</b> white male <b>defendants</b> and black women <b>defendants</b> were brought to the African men's prison. Yet the prison authorities still sought to physically separate these <b>defendants</b> by race and gender in their meeting space.

5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the <b>defendant</b> has to prove {{incompetence}} by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the <b>defendant</b> to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the <b>defendant</b> in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the <b>defendant</b> was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the <b>defendant</b> is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the <b>defendant</b> is expected to avoid it.|$|E

Only 26 percent of the pro se <b>defendants</b> ended up with felony convictions, while 63 percent of their represented counterparts were convicted of felonies…in federal court…the acquittal rate for pro se <b>defendants</b> is virtually identical to the acquittal rate for represented defendants.” ...|$|R

50|$|The {{doctrine}} {{requires that}} the plaintiff bring all possible <b>defendants</b> into court and that the plaintiff show the <b>defendants</b> all breached a duty of reasonable care. The burden then shifts to the <b>defendants</b> to provide evidence of who caused the injury.|$|R
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the <b>defendant</b> can be a factor in {{determining}} the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the <b>defendant</b> and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the <b>defendant</b> was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Scales was {{the only}} <b>defendant</b> convicted under the {{membership}} clause. All others were convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government. President Kennedy commuted his sentence on Christmas Eve, 1962, making Scales the final Smith Act <b>defendant</b> released from prison. Scales is the only Supreme Court decision to uphold a conviction based solely upon membership in a political party.|$|E
5|$|The <b>defendant</b> {{may move}} to dismiss a {{criminal}} charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the <b>defendant</b> must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The <b>defendant</b> is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} the public evaluates juvenile <b>defendants</b> tried in different venues and whether participants with different pretrial dispositions evaluate these juvenile <b>defendants</b> differently. In Study 1, 144 undergraduate students judge juveniles tried as adults more harshly than adult <b>defendants</b> or juveniles who were tried in the juvenile court. Prosecution-biased par-ticipants judge all <b>defendants</b> more harshly than defense-biased participants. In Study 2, 123 community residents are recruited. Findings of Study 1 are largely replicated. In addition, defense-biased participants {{are more likely than}} prosecution-biased participants to endorse the wayward youth stereotype instead of the superpredator stereotype of juvenile <b>defendants.</b> Implications for juvenile justice and further research on the evaluation of juvenile <b>defendants</b> and pretrial bias are discussed...|$|R

5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the <b>defendant</b> fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the <b>defendant</b> had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the <b>defendant.</b> Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E

5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the <b>defendant</b> to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the <b>defendant</b> chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the <b>defendant</b> testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E

5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a <b>defendant</b> in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a <b>defendant</b> is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

5|$|A <b>defendant</b> must {{be given}} an {{opportunity}} to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the <b>defendant</b> (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice.
