5|$|Beetle-pollinated <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> usually large, greenish or off-white in color, {{and heavily}} scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} sepals in a <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> its merosity. <b>Flower</b> merosity <b>is</b> {{indicative}} of a plant's classification. The merosity of a eudicot <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> typically four or five. The merosity of a monocot or palaeodicot <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> three, or a multiple of three.|$|R

5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flowers</b> <b>are</b> usually borne {{in groups}} of three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> even less well known than male flowers.|$|E

50|$|The {{hibiscus}} <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> traditionally worn by Tahitian and Hawaiian girls. If the <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> worn {{behind the}} left ear, {{the woman is}} married or in a relationship.

5|$|From 1923 to 1931, {{the state}} <b>flower</b> <b>was</b> the <b>flower</b> of the tulip tree. From 1931 to 1957, the state <b>flower</b> <b>was</b> the Zinnia.|$|R
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> near the edge and the youngest <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|Inflorescence : Usually {{indeterminate}} (lacking terminal flower) as a raceme (Lilium); sometimes {{reduced to}} a single terminal flower (Tulipa). When pluriflor (multiple blooms), the <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> arranged in a cluster or rarely are subumbellate (Gagea) or a thyrse (spike).|$|E
5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed or {{cuttings}} of hardened growth {{less than}} a year old. The seed can be collected from the cones and stored; they are best sown in spring or autumn. The stems and <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged}} in umbelliform inflorescences which are pauciflor or pluriflor (2-14 flowers), supported on an erect hollow scape (flower stem) which is 2075cm (12"30") tall and 2.55cm (1"2") in diameter with two free bracts forming a spathe which is bivalve with free leaflets at its base.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> insect pollinated, {{the major}} pollinators being bees, butterflies, flies, and hawkmoths, while the highly scented night {{flowering}} N. viridiflorus is pollinated by crepuscular moths.

5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. <b>Flowers</b> <b>are</b> self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. <b>Flowers</b> <b>are</b> also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E

5|$|Durian <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> {{large and}} {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features {{are typical of}} flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; {{they can also be}} crushed to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} perennials. <b>Flowers</b> <b>are</b> red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations.
