5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Background: Childhood cancer {{differs from}} most common adult cancers, {{suggesting}} a distinct aetiology for {{some types of}} childhood cancer. Our objective {{in this study was}} to test the difference in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of 4 non-CNS embryonic tumours and their correlation with socioeconomic status (SES) in Brazil. Methods: Data was obtained from 13 Brazilian population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) of neuroblastoma (NB), Wilms’tumour (WT), retinoblastoma (RB), and hepatoblastoma (HB). <b>Incidence</b> <b>rates</b> by tumour type, age, and gender were calculated per one million children. Correlations between social exclusion index (SEI) as an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES) and <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> was investigated using the Spearman’s test. Results: WT, RB, and HB presented with the highest age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> (AAIRs) in 1 to 4 year old of both genders, whereas NB presented the highest AAIR in ≤ 11 month-olds. However, differences in the <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> among PBCRs were observed. Higher <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> were found for WT and RB, whereas lower <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> were observed for NB. Higher SEI was correlated with higher incidences of NB (0. 731; p = 0. 0117), whereas no SEI correlation was observed between <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> for WT, RB, and HB. In two Brazilian cities, the <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of NB and RB were directly correlated with SEI; NB had the highest <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> (14. 2, 95 % CI, 8. 6 - 19. 7), and RB the lowest (3. 5, 95 % CI, 0. 7 - 6. 3) in Curitiba (SEI, 0. 730).

Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years.

5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: European {{legislation}} requires {{manufacturers of}} plasma products to report epidemiological data on human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in donor populations. The <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of such infections {{are directly related}} to the risk of infection transmission. We propose two statistical tests to evaluate these <b>incidence</b> <b>rates.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infection data of the four Dutch blood collection centres from 2003 through 2006 were analysed. For transversal comparison of centres and detection of increased <b>incidence</b> <b>rates,</b> a new statistical test was developed (outlier test). For longitudinal detection of trends in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates,</b> a generic test for trend is proposed. The power and risk of non-detection are evaluated for both tests. RESULTS: Application of the outlier test did not reveal any significantly increased <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> among centres in The Netherlands. The test for trend showed no significant increase in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> in individual centres, but on national level a statistically significant increase in hepatitis C virus incidence was observed (P-value of 0. 01). CONCLUSION: The proposed tests allow signalling of outlier centres and trends in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> both at individual centre and at national levels. Graphical support and the use of as much relevant historical data as possible is recommended. The statistical tests described are generic and can be applied by any blood establishment and plasma fractionation institut...|$|R

5|$|The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} 22,070 {{new cases}} of primary brain cancer and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing brain cancer for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around {{a third of those}} diagnosed with brain cancer survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates are a result of the prevalence of aggressive types, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Nearly 14% of new brain tumor diagnoses occur in persons under 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E

METHODS: Recent <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> observed by Italian population-based cancer registries were extracted from the data base of the Italian Association of Cancer Registries. Regional estimates of <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> for the same cancers were obtained by the MIAMOD method.

Eight Italian cancer registries and seven regions were selected for the analysis since they had incidence data available during the entire selected period. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: An excellent agreement between estimated and observed crude <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> was found for all single cancer sites, regarding absolute incidence levels and time trends. A partial exception was breast, where empirical data showed a sudden increase {{in the last three years}} of observation, perhaps due to organized screenings in some Italian regions, and not captured by statistical models.

We evaluated more recent data to determine whether racial/ethnic differences persisted. Methods. We used New Mexico Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data from 1995 to 2009 to calculate age-specific <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> and age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> overall and by tumor stage. We calculated mortality rates using National Center for Health Statistics' data.

Results. <b>Incidence</b> <b>rates</b> continued declining in NHW (APC - 1. 45 % men, - 1. 06 % women), while nonsignificantly increasing for AI (1. 67 % men, 1. 26 % women) and Hispanic women (0. 24 %).
