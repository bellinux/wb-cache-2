5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully is intrigued after a young boy with cancer, whose parents don’t believe in medical treatment because it is against God’s will, recovers miraculously. What she soon discovers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> cure is not miraculous, but scientific. Eager, if wary, to learn of the truth behind his secrets, Scully agrees to travel with the Smoking Man to get the cure to all mankind’s diseases.|$|E
5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} child {{in a family of}} six. He grew up in the north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} Stanisław Koniecpolski's birth are unclear. Various dates between 1590 and 1594 have been provided, {{and none of}} his biographers {{identify}} where he was born. What is known, though, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father, Aleksander Koniecpolski, was a wealthy magnate belonging to the szlachta (Polish nobility) and was also the voviode of Sieradz, and a staunch supporter of King Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa. Koniecpolski's mother, Anna Sroczycka, {{was the daughter of}} Stanisław Sroczycki, the voivode of Kamianets-Podilskyi, and had brought several large Podole estates into the Koniecpolski family upon her marriage to Aleksander. Stanisław's brothers were Krzysztof, who held the court office of chorąży wielki koronny (Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown) and was voivode of Bełsk from 1641; Remigiusz, who was the bishop of Chełm before his death in 1640; Jan, a castellan and the voivode of Sieradz; and Przedbór who died in 1611.|$|E

25|$|Investigations of the gunfight {{concluded}} <b>that</b> {{while it}} <b>was</b> Courtright who went for his pistol first, it was Short who ultimately outdrew and killed him. Courtright's inability to fire off a shot {{was due to}} a number of possible reasons; one <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> pistol got caught on his watch chain for a second as he drew it, and another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.|$|R
25|$|An {{incorrect}} but popularly reported claim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father's stepmother, Sarah Obama, told Anabaptist Bishop Ron McRae in {{a recorded}} transatlantic telephone conversation {{that she was}} present when Obama was born in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Roemer's {{version of}} the cause {{of change in the}} mode of {{production}} as due to being inequitable rather than inefficient is also the source of criticism. One such criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> argument relies of the legal ownership of production which is only present in later forms of class society rather than the social relations of production.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} some {{speculation}} that Tutankhamun was assassinated, the consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> death was accidental. A CT scan taken in 2005 showed that he had suffered a compound left leg fracture shortly before his death, and that the leg had become infected. DNA analysis conducted in 2010 showed the presence of malaria in his system, leading {{to the belief that}} malaria and Köhler disease II combined led to his death.|$|E
50|$|The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> name {{fell into}} oblivion. When he died, only the local Turnhout press {{reported}} on his death.|$|R

25|$|Recent works about Ford's {{depictions of}} Native Americans {{have argued that}} {{contrary}} to popular belief, his Indian characters spanned a range of hostile to sympathetic images from The Iron Horse to Cheyenne Autumn. His depiction of the Navajo in Wagon Master included their characters speaking the Navajo language. The distinguishing mark of Ford's Indian-themed Westerns <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Native characters always remained separate and apart from white society.|$|E

25|$|According to Stanley, in 1946, he was {{returning}} by train {{from a business}} trip to Manchester when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of solo whist with some other men.

Gibson's account <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{consequence}} of Nima-odsor's assassination <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> friend Jodbajab <b>was</b> intimidated into further {{cooperation with the}} Japanese, and joined Demchugdongrub's Mongol Military Government soon after.|$|R

25|$|After {{two other}} black deserters were {{captured}} and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt {{announced he would}} stop executing captured deserters. As the war ended, the US gave amnesties to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his fate: one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed, {{the other is that}} he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} records showing {{the fate of}} Thomas' wife, Eliza.

Read, his college roommate, and grandson of George Read, the Signer. William and Sally resided at the Thomas House, and donated it to the Episcopal Church.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, Dyson {{joined the}} faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, {{although}} still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he has now lived for more than sixty years. In 1957, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and renounced his British nationality. One reason he gave decades later <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> children born in the US had not been recognized as British subjects.|$|E

25|$|Luca was decapitated in April at the princely {{court in}} Hârlău. Toader and Nichita Arbore were {{reportedly}} put to death, by strangling or decapitation, {{during the following}} month. According to one tradition, one of them may have actually been dead by that time, accidentally killed during a hunting trip. The family residence at Arbore–Solca was confiscated by the ruler, and became state land. Arbore's grave remains undiscovered, but one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> body was stolen by his partisans and secretly buried at Solca.|$|E
25|$|The {{biggest problem}} with prosecuting Mengistu for {{genocide}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> actions {{did not necessarily}} target a particular group. They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting. In contrast, the irony is the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not sure that they qualify as genocide either. But in Gambella, the incidents, which were well documented in a human rights report of about 2 years ago, were clearly directed at a particular group, the tribal group, the Anuak.|$|E
25|$|The {{size and}} shape of a large cotton reel, these little sweet, spiced mutton pies are a golden brown, crispy pastry with a moist, sweet inside. They can be eaten as an hors d'oeuvre, with a salad or as a dessert. They are cooked in {{patisseries}} all over the town, but their origin is far from local. Tradition has it that Lord Clive brought the recipe from India and taught it to the pastry makers of Pézenas when he was staying at the Château de Larzac in 1768. It is more likely <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> servants were responsible.|$|E
40|$|My {{purpose in}} this thesis is to show {{the merits of the}} {{approach}} of G. Gentzen to the accepted predicate and propositional calculus of logicians today. It will <b>be</b> proved <b>that</b> <b>his</b> formalization <b>is</b> equivalent to the so-called classical approach. The advantages of <b>his</b> system <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> formalization <b>is</b> closer to natural reasoning and that it affords a proof that indirect proofs may be eliminated in the predicate calculus...|$|R

50|$|It <b>is</b> {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> kunya <b>was</b> Abu Mahdi, {{from which}} it can <b>be</b> inferred <b>that</b> <b>his</b> first-born son <b>was</b> named Mahdi.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Cevdet's arrival in the Van vilayet, {{volunteer}} Armenian units ahead of the advancing Russians were employing guerrilla tactics in the Turkish rear, while substantial numbers of Turkish deserters in the province had turned to brigandage, and Turkish commanders believed both groups were receiving support from Van's Armenian populace. Though Cevdet would swiftly resort to extreme measures {{to deal with this}} supposed rebellion, not all sources agree that he arrived in the province with a preconceived plan to commit genocide; what is widely agreed upon <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> methods left the Van Armenians little choice but to respond with armed resistance.|$|E
25|$|The Qur’an {{does not}} convey the {{specific}} teachings of Jesus. What has {{developed over the}} years was authored by later followers of Islam. What {{is found in the}} Qur’an's about Jesus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> teaching conformed to the prophetic model: a human sent by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one true God. In the case of Jesus, Muslims believe that his mission was to the people of Israel and that his status as a prophet was confirmed by numerous miracles. The Qur’an's description of specific events at the end of Jesus’ life have continued to be controversial between Christians and Muslims, while the classical commentaries have been interpreted differently to accommodate new information.|$|E
25|$|Another Archer story <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> jockey for {{the first}} two Melbourne Cups, John Cutts (c. 1829–1872), was an Aborigine. Johnny Cutts was (according to legend) born in the area around Nowra, and one of many Aboriginal men who {{replaced}} white stockmen who walked off the land to join the gold rush. In truth Johnny Cutts rode for many trainers in his long career as a jockey, was not from the Nowra area, and was never based there. Cutts' brother-in-law Walter Bradbury, however, lived at Terara (since he worked for de Mestre) and helped to train Archer. John Cutts Dillon {{was the son of a}} Sydney clerk and one of the best-known, best-liked and most-respected jockeys in New South Wales.|$|E
