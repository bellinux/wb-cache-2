5|$|The 1984 European Super Cup was an {{association}} football match between Italian team Juventus and English team Liverpool, {{which took place}} on 16 January 1985 at the Stadio Comunale.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{machining}} <b>fixtures</b> {{is a highly}} complex process that heavily relies on designer experience and his/her implicit knowledge to achieve a good design. The determination of <b>fixturing</b> scheme is an optimizing problem with multi-objective and multiconstraint. In order to evaluate the <b>fixturing</b> scheme objectively, a <b>fixturing</b> design scheme selection objective system is developed according to the feature of multi-level and multi-index of <b>fixturing</b> design scheme. With location accuracy, contact force, workpiece deformation and successive <b>fixturing</b> as the objective functions, the optimization selection of mathematical model of <b>fixturing</b> design scheme is established, then it is solved by gray relation analysis and analytic hierarchy process. The method provides a qualitative and quantitative combining analysis for a <b>fixturing</b> design scheme: (a) verifying whether a particular <b>fixturing</b> scheme is valid with respect to locating stability, deterministic workpiece location, clamping stability and total restraint and (b) determining the optimal fitness value based on integrate performances. An example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and {{the capabilities of the}} methodology. The study shows the gray relation analysis and the analytic hierarchy process can improve selecting quality for determination of <b>fixturing</b> design scheme...|$|R

5|$|Although Blažević {{continued}} his tenure {{in spite of}} failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland {{in the first two}} games of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. His successor at the helm of the national team was Mirko Jozić, who previously led the Yugoslavia under-20 team to a World Cup triumph in 1987. Despite the retirement of many Golden Generation players, Croatia went unbeaten during the rest of the qualifiers. They opened their 2002 World Cup campaign with a narrow loss to Mexico before producing a surprise 2–1 victory over Euro 2000 finalists Italy in the next <b>fixture,</b> giving life to hopes of passing through to the knockout stage. However, they lost their final group <b>fixture</b> to Ecuador and were eliminated. Jozić then resigned, and was replaced in July 2002 by Croatian-Austrian Otto Barić, the team's first manager born outside the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006–07 season, Gannon and Stockport announced they had drawn up a five-year plan to take the club to the Championship. Results on the field followed this statement of intent, with Gannon leading County to a League record nine consecutive victories without conceding a goal. Gannon lodged a complaint with The Football Association against Bristol Rovers when a <b>fixture</b> was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch, as he felt not enough was done to ready the pitch, and also a complaint with regard to the referee's handling of the situation. Gannon was later incensed with the FA when the same referee was allowed to take charge of the postponed <b>fixture,</b> which Rovers won 2–1. Gannon also branded approaches from Manchester City and Liverpool questionable and unprofessional after the two Premier League clubs swooped for youngsters being trained in Stockport County's development squads.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Haptic virtual <b>fixtures</b> {{have been}} shown to improve user {{performance}} and increase the safety of robot-assisted tasks, particularly for surgical applications. However, little research has studied virtual <b>fixtures</b> that provide moving force constraints based on motion of the environment, e. g., organ movement due to heartbeat or respiration. This work discusses design considerations of moving forbidden-region virtual <b>fixtures</b> and presents two methods of implementation: predictedposition and current-position virtual <b>fixtures.</b> Human subject experiments were performed to determine the effectiveness of moving virtual <b>fixtures</b> when interacting with an object in motion using a teleoperator. Results show that moving virtual <b>fixtures</b> can help improve user precision and decrease the amount of force applied. I...|$|R
