5000|$|Lysosomal acid lipase {{deficiency}} is {{a genetic}} disease that is autosomal recessive. It is an inborn error of metabolism that causes a lysosomal storage disease. [...] The condition {{is caused by}} a mutation of the LIPA gene, which is responsible for the gene coding of the lysosomal lipase protein (also called lysosomal acid lipase or LAL), which results in a loss of the protein's normal function. [...] When LAL functions normally, it breaks down cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in low density lipoprotein particles into free cholesterol and free fatty acids that the body can reuse; when LAL doesn't function, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides build up in the liver, spleen and other organs. [...] The accumulation of fat in the walls of the gut and other organs in leads to serious digestive problems including malabsorption, a condition in which the gut fails to absorb nutrients and calories from food, persistent and often forceful vomiting, frequent diarrhea, foul-smelling and <b>fatty</b> <b>stools</b> (steatorrhea), and failure to grow.|$|R
40|$|Steatorrhoea was a {{significant}} feature in an outbreak of rotavirus gastroenteritis which affected adults and infants in hospital. Fat globules or fatty acid crystals were obvious by light microscopy (LM) in faeces from 14 of 25 patients examined. Ten of the <b>fatty</b> <b>stools</b> {{and two of the}} remainder were very pale. By electron microscopy (EM) a rotavirus was seen in 11 of the 14 fatty faeces and in only two of 11 specimens without visible fat. In a further study of pale or fatty faeces 20 such specimens sent for laboratory examination from patients not involved in the hospital outbreak were compared microbiologically with a similar number which were neither pale nor fatty. Viruses were found by EM in 11 (55 %) of the pale or fatty stools; eight rotaviruses, two astroviruses and an uncultivable adenovirus were seen; one further patient had acute jaundice. In contrast, no viruses were seen by EM in the twenty specimens which were normally pigmented and without evident fat. Steatorrhoea was significantly associated with rotavirus infection of the alimentary tract which usually presented as a fatty enteritis. We conclude that rotaviruses certainly, and other viruses possibly, can impede both the digestion of fat and the pigmentation of the faeces. Inspection and LM of faeces are easy.

5000|$|Few {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} {{about the safety of}} fat substitutes. Carrageenan, olestra, and polydextrose have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as food additives, a title which requires both intensive testing over a wide demographic and the ability to meet strict, pre-determined, FDA criteria. Other products, such as guar gum and maltodextrose, are [...] "Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)" [...] by the FDA; this is also based on scientific testing and long-term consumption by a variety of consumer demographics. With excessive use, polydextrose can have a laxative effect, and olestra may cause loss of fat-soluble vitamins in the form of <b>fatty</b> <b>stools</b> and is liquid at body temperature. Esterified propoxylated glycerol (EPG), which is a solid at body temperature, achieved GRAS status for confectionery uses in November, 2015. EPG's GRAS status expanded to use at levels up to 38 percent by weight in baked goods and baking mixes, frozen dairy desserts and mixes, grain products and pasta, gravies and sauces, nuts and nut products, and soft candy. At this time, there is little supporting evidence to accompany claims that these, or other fat substitutes, are hazardous; however, more long-term research is needed.|$|R
40|$|The diplomonad protist, Giardia lamblia, colonizes and {{replicates}} in {{the small}} intestine of mammals. In humans, Giardia infection (known as giardiasis) can be symptomatic or asymptomatic with the former being associated with <b>fatty</b> <b>stool,</b> abdominal pain, malnutrition, and weight loss. Both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses against Giardia infection are possible, and adaptive responses {{have been reported to}} be important for controlling the infection. Non-immune components such as secretory immunoglobulin, intestinal lipids, and bile acids also play significant roles in determining the severity of the infection by Giardia. ^ Giardia exists in two morphologic forms [...] trophozoites and cysts [...] and maintains a simple life cycle. Exposure of cysts to gastric acid during passage through the human stomach triggers excystation (morphological changes from cyst to trophozoites), while factors {{in the small}} intestine, where trophozoites colonize, induce encystation or cyst formation. The disease is transmitted by water-resistant cysts, which are excreted in the feces of humans and pass on to a new host via contaminated food and water. The production of viable giardial cysts is critical for successful transmission and spreading of the disease. ^ Our laboratory is interested in investigating the lipid metabolism in Giardia because this parasite is unable to synthesize the majority of its own lipids de novo and depends on exogenous lipids for its growth and encystation. In this regard, I am interested in identifying the role of sphingolipids (SLs) during cyst formation. We have shown earlier that, unlike higher eukaryotes Giardia expresses fewer SL genes, which are differentially regulated during encystation. This suggests {{that there could be a}} link between SL synthesis and giardial encystation. Furthermore, D-threo- 1 -phenyl- 2 -palmitoylamino- 3 -morpholino- 1 -propanol (PPMP), an inhibitor of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthesis, blocks replication of trophozoites, induces karyokinesis, and inhibits cyst production by Giardia, which indicates that GlcCer plays an essential role in the life cycle of this waterborne pathogen. ^ The goal of my dissertation is to provide understanding of the overall process of cyst production and how the enzyme of GlcCer synthesis (i. e., GlcT 1) modulates this process. I have used various molecular and biochemical methodologies to address this question with the help of two separate but interrelated Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, I asked if Giardial glucosylceramide transferase enzyme (gGlcT 1) regulates encystation and cyst production by Giardia, and the goal of Specific Aim 2 was to investigate whether glucosylceramide transferase regulates ESV (encystation-specific vesicle) biogenesis and cyst viability by maintaining the cellular lipid homeostasis. ^ Briefly, I found that overexpression of gGlcT 1 enzyme generated aggregated/enlarged ESVs and congregated cysts with reduced viability. The knocking down of gGlcT 1 activity blocked ESV biogenesis completely and produced mostly non-viable cysts. However, when gGlcT 1 -overexpressed Giardia was knocked down with anti-gGlcT 1 morpholino oligonucleotide (i. e., GlcT 1 rescued parasites) the enzyme activity, ESV biogenesis, and cyst viability returned to normal, suggesting that the regulated expression of gGlcT 1 is important for encystation and viable cyst production. Overexpression of gGlcT 1 increased the influx of membrane lipids and fatty acids without altering the fluidity of plasma membranes, which indicates that the expression of gGlcT 1 is linked to lipid internalization and maintenance of the overall lipid homeostasis in this unicellular organism. Based on these results, I propose that gGlcT 1 is a key player in ESV biogenesis and Giardia cyst viability and that it could therefore be exploited for developing new anti-giardial drugs or a vaccine to control giardiasis. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{its more}} {{advanced}} form, malabsorption (insufficient {{absorption of nutrients}} from the diet) leads to wasting and the enlargement of lymph nodes in the abdomen. Neurological symptoms (discussed below) are more common in those with the severe form of the abdominal disease. Chronic malabsorptive diarrhea leads to the poor absorption of fat, causing steatorrhea (<b>fatty,</b> offensive <b>stool),</b> flatulence, and abdominal distension. Protein-losing enteropathy may also occur, causing depletion of albumin, a blood protein, which may lead to peripheral edema caused by the lowered oncotic pressures.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{co-morbidity}} of {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) and celiac disease (CD) {{has been reported}} sporadically since the 1960 s. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} time a systematic screening is performed in a large cohort of CF patients. MethodsTransglutaminase-IgA (TGA), endomysium-IgA (EMA) and total IgA in serum were measured in 790 CF patients (48 % females, 86 % with pancreatic insufficiency). Six patients were diagnosed with CD prior to the study, all receiving a gluten-free diet. Patients with elevated TGA (> 50  Units/mL) and a positive EMA test were offered a gastroscopy obtaining mucosal biopsies from the duodenum. ResultsFour new cases of CD were diagnosed. Two additional patients had positive serological tests, but normal biopsies. In total, 10 cases of CD (1. 2 %, 1 : 83) indicate a prevalence rate about three times higher than the general prevalence of CD in Norway and Sweden. No CD patients were detected in the Danish CF cohort. Patients diagnosed with untreated CD reported symptoms typical of both CF and CD (poor weight gain, loose and/or <b>fatty</b> <b>stools,</b> fatigue, irritability, abdominal pain). They improved after introduction of a gluten-free diet. ConclusionsSystematic screening for CD in a Scandinavian cohort of CF patients revealed a higher prevalence of CD than in the general population. Clinical signs of CD are difficult to differentiate from CF with malabsorption, and patients may go undiagnosed for a long time. In a population where CD is common we recommend screening for CD in patients with CF...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} a few reports of infants with severe {{neonatal}} cholestasis related to a defect in primary bile acid synthesis. To assess the importance of such deficiency among children with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis (Byler disease), screening for inborn errors in bile acid synthesis was performed by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry of urine samples from 30 affected children. Bile acid analysis revealed a specific fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry profile for 3 beta-hydroxy-C 27 steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase deficiency in five children who had jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and <b>fatty</b> <b>stools</b> beginning at ages ranging from 4 to 46 months. None of them had pruritus. Liver function tests showed persistently normal serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, low serum cholesterol and vitamin E levels, normal serum bile acid concentrations despite raised serum bilirubin levels, and decreased prothrombin time and clotting factor V. In four of the cases a similar disease was observed in siblings. Liver function returned to normal after oral ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. We conclude that 3 beta-hydroxy-C 27 -steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase deficiency should be considered when idiopathic cholestatic liver disease with clinical features akin to Byler disease is characterized by the association of normal serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, normal serum bile acid concentration, absence of pruritus, and a return to normal liver function during ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Early identification of these children is essential because they benefit from bile acid therapy and might thus avoid the need for liver transplantatio...|$|R

50|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of abetalipoproteinemia appear in {{the first few months of}} life (because pancreatic lipase is not active in this period). They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal spiny red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and <b>fatty,</b> foul-smelling <b>stools</b> (steatorrhea). The stool may contain large chunks of fat and/or blood. Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. They can include poor muscle coordination, difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia), and progressive degeneration of the retina (the light-sensitive layer in the posterior eye) that can progress to near-blindness (due to deficiency of vitamin A, retinol). Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the {{signs and symptoms}} of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially vitamin E deficiency, which typically results in eye problems with degeneration of the spinocerebellar and dorsal column tracts.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Child and {{adolescent}} obesity has increased globally, {{and can be}} associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children {{and adolescent}}s. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed (subsets not available on Ovid), LILACS as well as the trial registers ICTRP (WHO) and ClinicalTrials. gov. Searches were undertaken from inception to March 2016. We checked references and applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for treating obesity (licensed and unlicensed for this indication) in children and adolescents (mean age under 18 years) with or without support of family members, with a minimum of three months' pharmacological intervention and six months' follow-up from baseline. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity. In addition, we excluded trials which included growth hormone therapies and pregnant participants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data following standard Cochrane methodology. Where necessary we contacted authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 trials and identified eight ongoing trials. The included trials evaluated metformin (11 trials), sibutramine (six trials), orlistat (four trials), and one trial arm investigated the combination of metformin and fluoxetine. The ongoing trials evaluated metformin (four trials), topiramate (two trials) and exenatide (two trials). A total of 2484 people participated in the included trials, 1478 participants were randomised to drug intervention and 904 to comparator groups (91 participants took part in two cross-over trials; 11 participants not specified). Eighteen trials used a placebo in the comparator group. Two trials had a cross-over design while the remaining 19 trials were parallel RCTs. The length of the intervention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up from baseline ranged from six months to 100 weeks. Trials generally had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding (participants, personnel and assessors) for subjective and objective outcomes. We judged approximately half of the trials as having a high risk of bias in one or more domain such as selective reporting. The primary outcomes of this review were change in body mass index (BMI), change in weight and adverse events. All 21 trials measured these outcomes. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (only one trial reported results showing no marked differences; very low certainty evidence), body fat distribution (measured in 18 trials), behaviour change (measured in six trials), participants' views of the intervention (not reported), morbidity associated with the intervention (measured in one orlistat trial only reporting more new gallstones following the intervention; very low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (one suicide in the orlistat intervention group; low certainty evidence) and socioeconomic effects (not reported). Intervention versus comparator for mean difference (MD) in BMI change was - 1. 3 kg/m(2) (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 9 to - 0. 8; P < 0. 00001; 16 trials; 1884 participants; low certainty evidence). When split by drug type, sibutramine, metformin and orlistat all showed reductions in BMI in favour of the intervention. Intervention versus comparator for change in weight showed a MD of - 3. 9 kg (95 % CI - 5. 9 to - 1. 9; P < 0. 00001; 11 trials; 1180 participants; low certainty evidence). As with BMI, when the trials were split by drug type, sibutramine, metformin and orlistat all showed reductions in weight in favour of the intervention. Five trials reported serious adverse events: 24 / 878 (2. 7 %) participants in the intervention groups versus 8 / 469 (1. 7 %) participants in the comparator groups (risk ratio (RR) 1. 43, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 3. 25; 1347 participants; low certainty evidence). A total 52 / 1043 (5. 0 %) participants in the intervention groups versus 17 / 621 (2. 7 %) in the comparator groups discontinued the trial because of adverse events (RR 1. 45, 95 % CI 0. 83 to 2. 52; 10 trials; 1664 participants; low certainty evidence). The most common adverse events in orlistat and metformin trials were gastrointestinal (such as diarrhoea, mild abdominal pain or discomfort, <b>fatty</b> <b>stools).</b> The most frequent adverse events in sibutramine trials included tachycardia, constipation and hypertension. The single fluoxetine trial reported dry mouth and loose stools. No trial investigated drug treatment for overweight children. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review is part of a series of associated Cochrane reviews on interventions for obese children and adolescents and has shown that pharmacological interventions (metformin, sibutramine, orlistat and fluoxetine) may have small effects in reduction in BMI and bodyweight in obese children and adolescents. However, many of these drugs are not licensed for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents, or have been withdrawn. Trials were generally of low quality with many having a short or no post-intervention follow-up period and high dropout rates (overall dropout of 25 %). Future research should focus on conducting trials with sufficient power and long-term follow-up, to ensure the long-term effects of any pharmacological intervention are comprehensively assessed. Adverse events should be reported in a more standardised manner specifying amongst other things the number of participants experiencing at least one adverse event. The requirement of regulatory authorities (US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) for trials of all new medications to be used in children and adolescents should drive {{an increase in the number}} of high quality trials...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Orlistat, {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, {{is designed for}} the treatment of obesity. A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 -way crossover study investigated the possible influence of orlistat on the ovulation-suppressing action of combination oral contraceptives (OC). Methods: After an 8 -day run-in prior to the first of two consecutive menstrual cycles (Day 1 was the first day of menstruation), two groups of 10 healthy women, 20 - 27 years of age and on a stable regimen with OCs, received either 120 mg orlistat t. i. d. or placebo t. i. d, on Days 1 - 23 of the first cycle, and, separated by a placebo washout period on Days 24 - 28, the alternative treatment on Days 1 - 23 of the second cycle. In both cycles, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was measured on Days 12 - 16 and progesterone on Days 12, 16, 19 - 23. Results: The geometric means of time-averaged concentrations (Days 12 - 16 for LH and Days 19 - 23 for progesterone) in the cycles with orlistat and placebo, respectively, and the one-sided 95 % confidence region for the mean in the cycle with orlistat were 1. 92, 2. 03 and < 2. 23 IU l- 1 for LH and 0. 147, 0. 145 and < 0. 176 μg l- 1 for progesterone. The one-sided 95 % confidence region for the ratio (orlistat/placebo) of geometric means was < 1. 06 for LH and < 1. 11 for progesterone. Conclusion: During normal ovulation the peak serum concentration of LH is above 30 IU l- 1 around Day 14 of the cycle, and that of progesterone exceeds 3 μg l- 1 around day 21. The 95 % confidence regions for the means, as well as all individual concentrations, were below these limits. It was concluded that orlistat did not influence the ovulation suppressing action of oral contraceptives. In the Netherlands, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study was conducted to determine whether administration of the inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, Orlistat, concomitantly with combined oral contraceptives (OCs) inhibits the ovulation-suppressing action of OCs. The 20 subjects, 20 - 27 years old, were healthy and had a body mass index between 22 and 27 kg m- 2. All subjects completed the study. Most adverse events were mild and related to the pharmacological effect of Orlistat (<b>fatty</b> or oily <b>stool,</b> flatus with discharge, or abdominal pain). The geometric means of time-averaged serum concentrations in the cycles with Orlistat and the placebo and the 1 -sided 95 % confidence region for the mean in the cycle with Orlistat were 0. 147, 0. 145, and less than 0. 176 mcg l- 1 for progesterone and 1. 92, 2. 03, and less than 2. 23 IU l- 1 for luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. These figures were well below the peak concentrations during normal ovulation (3 mcg l- 1 for progesterone and 30 IU l- 1 for LH). The plasma concentration of Orlistat was either close to the limit of quantification (1 mcg l- 1) or below this limit. These findings suggest that Orlistat had no effect on the ovulation-suppression capabilities of the OCs.
