25|$|In the 21st century, {{questions}} about the environment have become increasingly politicized, with the Left generally accepting the findings of environmental scientists about global warming and many on the Right disputing or rejecting those findings. However, the left is divided over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> and equitably reduce carbon emissions: the center-left often advocates a reliance on market measures such as emissions trading or a carbon tax, while those further to the left tend to support direct government regulation and intervention either alongside or instead of market mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, Kintetsu and Orix {{advanced}} merger plans by officially signing {{an agreement}} that outlined the basic details of the planned team merger, including that the new merged club would be run by a new company jointly owned by the parent companies of the two teams, 80% by Orix and the rest by Kintetsu. The next day, approximately 300fans protested the merger by marching with signs and chantings slogans in Tokyo's Hibiya district. Days later, JPBPA members voted overwhelmingly {{for the right to}} strike as part of a bid to maintain the two-league system and prevent team mergers. Of about 750members of the players’ union, 98% voted in favor of strike rights. Fewer than ten members opposed striking. The Japan Trade Union Confederation (RENGO) also supported the association by giving advice on how to set up a strike as well as labor-management negotiation strategies and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> circulate petitions.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the ABFO {{began making}} {{an attempt to}} {{diminish}} the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that {{reduces the risk of}} biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess {{the degree to which a}} suspect’s dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods. The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist’s collection methods were not standardized.|$|E

500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of [...] "powersliding" [...] on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} tenet of attachment {{theory is that}} an infant needs to develop a relationship {{with at least one}} primary caregiver for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> regulate their feelings. Any caregiver is equally likely to become the principal attachment figure if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction. In the presence of a sensitive and responsive caregiver, the infant will use the caregiver as a [...] "safe base" [...] from which to explore. It should be recognized that [...] "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about 50 percent of the time. Their communications are either out of synch, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently.

500|$|He {{also argued}} that the brigade {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} light antitank weapons, as well as there being no fourth company in a battalion; the absence of the latter was a [...] "serious handicap" [...] to each battalion, especially when surrounded by enemy forces. In terms of the brigade's ground role, Otway considered it to have done well in terms of patrolling and night patrols, but was unaccustomed to cooperating with other arms, particularly artillery and armour, {{because of a lack of}} training and was forced to learn these skills during combat. It also suffered from a lack of reinforcements, as high physical and mental standards during airborne training led to a small pool of reinforcements that was easily depleted, as well as the absence of its own transport, forcing the brigade to rely on captured enemy vehicles and pack animals. Finally, Otway argued that [...] "it was most uneconomical and inefficient to employ a parachute brigade in ground operations" [...] unless it was expanded with sufficient transport and extra personnel, as well as possessing a superior officer who understood the specialised role the brigade played and could advise on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> use it.|$|E
500|$|Garrow also {{influenced}} {{the rules of}} evidence, which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career. His insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to the best evidence rule. He was crucial in insisting on the autonomy of lawyers when inducting evidence, in one case openly arguing with the trial judge {{to insist that the}} advocates have independence in submitting it. During this period, the use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic. While medical experts were regularly called at the Old Bailey, the use of partisan experts was resisted, and at the beginning experts were given limited authority. While this increased {{towards the end of the}} 17th century, in line with the judges' increasing desire for certainty and facts, Garrow is noted as an excellent example of the attitude lawyers took when cross-examining such witnesses. When defending Robert Clark, accused of killing John Delew by kicking him in the stomach, Garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross-examination and medical knowledge to get the prosecution's medical expert to admit that he could not prove how Delew had died. Garrow and later advocates learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> [...] "interrogate" [...] such witnesses, strengthening their own arguments (when it was their expert) or demolishing those of others (when it was an expert attached to the other side).|$|E
500|$|Hamels {{is known}} {{throughout}} baseball for possessing {{one of the}} better changeups in the game. In 2012, Fangraphs ranked Hamels as having the fourth best changeup in the game trailing only Jason Vargas, Tommy Milone, and Félix Hernández. The Hardball Times called his changeup a [...] "killer" [...] pitch to right-handed hitters, noting that while it is also effective against left-handed hitters, when they put it in play, they generally have success. Rangers pitching coach Mike Maddux said of Hamels, [...] The development of Hamels' changeup is attributed by his high school pitching coach, Mark Furtak, to the fact that in high school he broke his arm. He could no longer work on his curveball for several months, and was forced to focus on the changeup. Chipper Jones, who was a star-third baseman for the rival Atlanta Braves commented that Hamels is the [...] "best lefthander in the National League ... you have to respect his fastball, and his change-up is devastating. If you're guessing fastball and you get change-up, you're way out in front of it. His change-up is a soft sinker that just falls down." [...] Aside from the changeup, he throws a four-seam fastball in the low 90s (can reach [...] ), a cutter , and an [...] "inconsistent" [...] curveball that sometimes loops and other times is sharp, and hovers in the mid-70s (around [...] ). Prior to the conception and advent of his cutter, he briefly threw a two-seam fastball around 2008 and 2009, before debuting his cutter in 2010. Once he attained a [...] "feel" [...] for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> utilize his cutter, it helped him increase his groundball rate (percentage of balls in play that were groundballs), including to over 50-percent in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Historical ecology {{involves}} {{an understanding of}} multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, {{and the impact of}} human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines. [...] Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose and}} content of a {{response}} is also an issue that PDPs seek to make explicit. There is considerable disagreement as to <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> communicate meaning and intent across what would likely be formidable language barriers. The message {{would need to be}} crafted {{in such a way that}} its content and delivery were unambiguous to receivers that may not even use written or verbal communication. Several mathematic, pictorial, algorithmic, and [...] "natural" [...] language theories have been developed and applied to the problem of CETI. A specific purpose or goal of outgoing transmissions may be covered by a PDP as well. Several possible functions exist, including: a description of our species and planet, a request for information, and/or the proposition of some course of action. However, in the absence of an intergovernmental agreement or structures for building consensus on the subject, nations, groups, and individuals are free to act autonomously. It is precisely because the process of sculpting a collective message would be slow and laborious (but intensely important), that most scientists recommend having a PDP with some prescribed action laid out before contact is made.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} medical works to be translated was Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine (1025), which was translated into Latin and then disseminated in manuscript and printed form throughout Europe. It remained a standard medical textbook in Europe until the early modern period, and during the 15th and 16th centuries alone, The Canon of Medicine was published more than thirty-five times. Avicenna noted the contagious nature of some infectious diseases (which he attributed to [...] "traces" [...] left in the air by a sick person), and discussed <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>effectively</b> test new medicines. He also wrote The Book of Healing, a more general encyclopedia of science and philosophy, which became another popular textbook in Europe. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi) wrote the Comprehensive Book of Medicine, with its careful description of and distinction between measles and smallpox, which was also influential in Europe. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi wrote Kitab al-Tasrif, an encyclopedia of medicine which was particularly famed for its section on surgery. It included descriptions and diagrams of over 200 surgical instruments, many of which he developed. The surgery section was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century, and used in European medical schools for centuries, still being reprinted in the 1770s.|$|E
