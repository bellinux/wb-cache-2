Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it." ...|$|E

[...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen.

500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning praised 30 Rock {{for putting}} {{it all together}} [...] "so seamlessly" [...] and [...] "so brilliantly balanced" [...] in [...] "Señor Macho Solo". Canning enjoyed Tracy's story, observing {{that it was a}} [...] "fantastic Tracy Jordan moment." [...] He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back [...] "into the mix". He also liked that this episode [...] "delivered some great work" [...] from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was [...] "the first really work-centric one in a while." [...] He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of AOL's TV Squad said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd [...] "fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them." [...] Gallagher noted that Dinklage was [...] "pretty awesome" [...] as Tina Fey's love interest, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> to see more of them together. I really think they could have done more with this storyline." [...] According to Gallagher, the only part of [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] that she was not [...] "crazy about" [...] was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.|$|E

Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> Martin Luther as much as I love myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christina Roberts of Culturess felt Slingshot was [...] "a cool premise for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to do. It builds off {{characters}} {{we already}} know and gives the ones less utilized a little more action. Honestly, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> if {{this was just a}} standalone episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., too. While the ongoing storylines and plot threads are fun, an episode that can stand on its own is always a nice breath of fresh air... It will be fun to see if any of this carries over into the rest of the show when it returns, even if it’s just a wink and a nod between Daisy and Elena." [...] Geek Exchange's Georgia Ringelberg felt, [...] "Overall, the digital series is unnecessary because the plot doesn’t add anything to the larger series as we await the second half of season 4. But it is enjoyable to watch with quite a few nice nods to {{the first half of the}} season... It’s a fun, quick watch that’s perfect for getting through the mid-season break and hopefully gets Yo-Yo/Slingshot some well-deserved attention." [...] Additionally, Ringelberg felt the use of Rodriguez in the series would lead [...] "to more screen time for Yo-Yo and maybe even preparing viewers for the Inhumans series... If they transition her to Inhumans or give her time on both shows, she could be strategically utilized instead of mostly forgotten the way she is now." ...|$|E

2500|$|At a {{listening}} {{session in}} New York City, J. Cole previewed the album to a select few, including Insanul Ahmed of Complex. At the listening session {{it was revealed}} the song [...] "In the Morning" [...] featuring Drake off his Friday Night Lights mixtape would appear on the album. Cole defended this decision saying, he felt the song never got the push it deserved, and {{he wanted it to}} reach more people. Another song that was previously released on another project The Warm Up, was [...] "Lights Please". Cole explained this song was the track that won over his manager Mark Pitt and Jay-Z. The interlude, was revealed to be a quick skit where Cole talks about the day he found out Jay-Z wanted to sign him. As soon as Cole got the good news he was pulled over and ended up spending the night in jail for parking violations. Even so, he explains that it was [...] "the easiest time ever" [...] because he knew success was coming around the corner. The track [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] opens with a sample from the documentary, Backstage where Jay-Z is talking about finding that one great artist that he'll sign. [...] "Dollar and a Dream III" [...] was revealed, produced by Kyle Justice, the third in the [...] "Dollar and a Dream series" [...] following the two from his first two mixtapes. In an interview with VIBE Cole admitted that he originally wanted Jay-Z to appear on the song [...] "God's Gift" [...] rather than [...] "Mr. Nice Watch." [...] He continued saying, [...] "Everything worked out, I'm a true believer that everything happens for a reason. Like, when he did that, it made way more sense than my song. It's a bigger record, a more universal record. Being the hip-hop nerd that I am, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> to hear Jay-Z on that [...] beat. But really, I'm fine on that song alone." [...] J. Cole released [...] "Mr. Nice Watch" [...] himself through the internet, for promotional purposes, on September 14, 2011. The song contains elements of Dubstep and Electronica. Two days before the album's release, J. Cole released a music video for the bonus track, [...] "Daddy's Little Girl". [...] On October 25, J.
