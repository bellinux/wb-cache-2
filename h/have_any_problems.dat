25|$|REM sleep {{has been}} {{observed}} in the pilot whale, a species of dolphin. Whales {{do not seem to}} have REM sleep, nor do they seem to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> because of this. One reason REM sleep might be difficult in marine settings is the fact that REM sleep causes muscular atony; that is to say, a functional paralysis of skeletal muscles that can be difficult to combine with the need to breathe regularly.|$|E
25|$|When leaving {{its home}} port the {{original}} ship could have over 130 crew members. This number of hands was necessary {{since many of}} the sailors died from diseases or disappeared during storms. Even though it was a high risk job under difficult conditions, the company did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> recruiting sailors for these well paid jobs. Many of the recruits were poor young men, sons of farmers, seeking opportunity to become wealthy. The replica has a crew of 80 sailors.|$|E

2500|$|Behroozi (1992) {{has noted}} {{tensions}} between the concept of working with mandated clients and professional ethics, such as the belief in fostering self-determination. The chief concern {{is whether or not}} [...] "involuntary applicants" [...] are in fact [...] "clients", as to become a client of a professional social worker requires [...] "mutual agreement" [...] (Behroozi, 1992, p.224). In social work practice, the primary task given this issue is to help the applicant [...] "transform to clienthood" [...] (Behroozi, 1992, p.224). In the absence of this transformation, the mandated [...] "client" [...] is likely to be superficially compliant and deny they <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> warranting social work attention (Behroozi, 1992; Breton, 1993; Milgram & Rubin, 1992).|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} the other Nazi executioners are also known due to their {{frequent}} presence in the village (Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde). The village Vogt (...) Teofil Kielar was ordered to bury the victims {{with the help of}} other witnesses. He asked the German commander whom he had known from prior inspections and food acquisitions, why the children were also killed. Dieken answered in German, [...] "So that you would not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with them." [...] On 11 January 1945, in defiance of the Nazi prohibition, relatives of the Ulmas exhumed the bodies to bury them in the cemetery, and found out that Wiktoria's seventh child was almost born in the grave pit of its parents.|$|E

2500|$|Helm {{later wrote}} about The Last Waltz in his autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire, {{in which he}} {{made the case that}} it had been {{primarily}} Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced The Band's breakup {{on the rest of the}} group. Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: [...] "I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it—and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, 'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.' Well, fine. I'll take the best music film that's ever been made, and make it my statement. I don't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with that. None at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Malick has an {{antagonistic}} {{relationship with}} many of his colleagues, soon after his introduction he developed a friendship with ward sister Chrissie Williams. Akingbola assessed, [...] "Chrissie likes him – they become quite friendly and he never seems to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with her at all. I think they're quite close friends." [...] His early storylines focussed on his professional, rather than love life. In his third episode, Penny developed a crush on him, and was disappointed to learn from Frieda that Malick is gay. Though viewers approached Akingbola {{to ask if he}} and Frieda would become an item, Malick's sexuality was later confirmed when he described himself as a [...] "big poof". The actor commented that, [...] "rather than make him a stereotype, Holby is pushing the boundaries as the story progresses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milošević {{denounced the}} {{declaration}} of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that [...] "Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition was like when the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević. The transcript involved Milošević ordering Karadzic to [...] "Go to Uzelac , he'll tell you everything. If you <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems,</b> telephone me", and said [...] "As long as there is the army no one can touch us... Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [...] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so." [...] The conversation revealed that Milošević controlled the military strategy for the war in Bosnia and that Montenegro was under his control.|$|E
