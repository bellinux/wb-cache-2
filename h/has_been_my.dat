5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

[...] "If you want to disguise a real life character," [...] Auchincloss advised fellow novelists, [...] "just change his profession." [...] His actual model for the Rector of Justin was [...] "the greatest man it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> good luck to know" [...] Judge Learned Hand.|$|E

500|$|The leading tenor part of Don José {{was given}} to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had {{recently}} appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was {{at the beginning of}} a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her [...] "one of the most charming vocalists it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> pleasure to know". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Nash {{announced}} that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage. On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now.

Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author, calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine. As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the past films, the future of the {{franchise}} was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because you shoot out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because suddenly it was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never going to be doing this again.|$|E
500|$|William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan, {{who succeeded}} Harry Higgins as {{chairman}} of the Ritz upon his death in 1928, was especially keen on attracting American guests to the hotel. He was a close friend of the Earl of Carnavon and his American wife Catherine Wendell, and at times the couple were freely given the entire second floor of the hotel to accommodate guests. Upon the death of Lord Lurgan in 1937, Carnavon was told that he had to begin paying for his staying at the hotel, but was given a [...] "slight reduction for old time's sake". Carnarvon later remarked: [...] "The Ritz <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> London home for over fifty years. I'm very fond of the place. Nobody knows it better". In 1931, the Aga Khan was involved with organising the Round Table Conference at the hotel, which was attended by Mahatma Gandhi and many others.
