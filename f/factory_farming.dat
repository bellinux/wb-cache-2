5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; <b>factory</b> <b>farming,</b> for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with {{a consideration of the}} relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

5000|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that locally and {{sustainably}} grown foods actually release more greenhouse gases than food made in <b>factory</b> <b>farms.</b> The [...] "Land Degradation" [...] section of the United Nations report Livestock's Long Shadow concludes that [...] "Intensification - in terms of increased productivity both in livestock production and in feed crop agriculture - can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation". Nathan Pelletier of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia found that cattle raised on open pastures release 50% more greenhouse gas emissions than cattle raised in <b>factory</b> <b>farms.</b> Adrian Williams of Cranfield University in England found that free range and organic raised chickens have a 20% greater impact on global warming than chickens raised in <b>factory</b> <b>farm</b> conditions, and organic egg production had a 14% higher impact on the climate than <b>factory</b> <b>farm</b> egg production. Studies such as Christopher Weber's report on food miles have shown that the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in production far outweighs those in transportation, which implies that locally grown food is actually worse for the environment than food made in <b>factory</b> <b>farms.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{effective}} altruists {{believe that}} reducing animal suffering {{should be a}} major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this. Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2,7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption. He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare. Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction. Philosophically, wild animal suffering may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.|$|E
25|$|Intensive animal farming or {{industrial}} livestock production, {{also known}} as <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> by opponents of the practice, is a treatment towards farm animals in order to supply the vast, growing demand of meat. Intensive farming refers to animal husbandry, the keeping of livestock such as cattle, poultry, and fish at higher stocking densities than is usually the case with other forms of animal agriculture—a practice typical in industrial farming by agribusinesses.|$|E

50|$|Local {{foods are}} {{sometimes}} {{considered the most}} climate friendly because the energy needed to store and transport the meat {{is removed from the}} equation. There is a decrease in greenhouse gases emitted because locally grown goods {{do not need to be}} transported across the country, or constantly cooled in large refrigerators. Another benefit of locally grown food is its lower concentration of pollution sources. According to the USDA, more than 335 million tons of manure are produced annually in American <b>farms.</b> In <b>factory</b> <b>farms,</b> this waste is extremely concentrated, and without proper regulation and disposal, the waste pollutes the surrounding areas. The Natural Resource Defense Council even remarks that <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> have reached a point in which the farms threaten public health. Pollutants from the manure and urine of overcrowded <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> lead to water and air pollution. Some of these pollutants, such as hydrogen sulfide and various nitrates, are dangerous even at low levels. <b>Factory</b> <b>farms</b> are also considered unsanitary because they place animals in overcrowded conditions in fully enclosed rooms that often become the perfect breeding grounds for diseases. Locally grown foods support free-range or pasture-grazing farming methods, decreasing the need for large <b>factory</b> <b>farms.</b> With fewer <b>factory</b> <b>farms,</b> waste will not be so concentrated and will thus not have such profound effects on the immediate surrounding areas.|$|R

40|$|People {{believe they}} {{experience}} the world objectively, but research continually demonstrates that beliefs influence perception. Emerging {{research indicates that}} beliefs influence the experience of eating. In three studies, we test whether beliefs about how animals are raised can influence the experience of eating meat. Samples of meat were paired with descriptions of animals raised on <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> or raised on humane farms. Importantly, the meat samples in both conditions were identical. However, participants experienced the samples differently: meat paired with <b>factory</b> <b>farm</b> descriptions looked, smelled, and tasted less pleasant. Even basic properties of flavor were influenced: <b>factory</b> <b>farmed</b> samples tasted more salty and greasy. Finally, actual behavior was influenced: participants consumed less when samples were paired with <b>factory</b> <b>farm</b> descriptions. These findings demonstrate {{that the experience of}} eating is not determined solely by physical properties of stimuli-beliefs also shape experience...|$|R
25|$|Ethical vegetarianism {{has become}} popular in {{developed}} countries particularly because of the spread of <b>factory</b> <b>farming,</b> faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.|$|E

Ryder himself was elected to the Council in 1971, and served as its chair from 1977 to 1979.|$|E

25|$|Landless systems {{rely upon}} feed {{from outside the}} farm, {{representing}} the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge {{as well as a}} source for pollution. Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations, sometimes called <b>factory</b> <b>farming.</b> Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa. Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of growth hormones, are controversial.|$|E
25|$|For most of history, turkeys were {{primarily}} raised on small family farms for meat {{and as a}} form of pest control (turkeys are prodigious eaters of insects). But with the advent of <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> of poultry, turkeys began to be selectively bred for increasingly larger size, focusing especially on the production of breast meat. Beginning in the 1920s and continuing in to the 1950s, broad-breasted fowl began to replace all other types of turkey in commercial production. The favorite breed at the time was the Broad Breasted Bronze, which was developed from the Standard Bronze. In the 1960s producers began to heavily favor turkeys that did not show the dark pin feathers in their carcass, and thus the Broad Breasted White grew to dominate the industry, a trend which continues to this day.|$|E
25|$|Ethical {{vegetarian}} {{concerns have}} become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of <b>factory</b> <b>farming,</b> more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal, and environmental consciousness. Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has {{to be satisfied with}} a mass-production system, regardless of the welfare of animals. Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed free-range rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat. Reducing the worldwide massive food waste would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals. Indeed, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{about a third of the}} food for human consumption is wasted globally (around 1.3 billion tons per year).|$|E

Today, it focuses on four core issues—opposition to <b>factory</b> <b>farming,</b> fur farming, animal testing, and the use of animals in entertainment. It also campaigns for a vegan lifestyle and against eating meat, fishing, the killing of animals regarded as pests, the keeping of chained backyard dogs, cock fighting, dog fighting, and bullfighting.|$|E
25|$|Various ethical reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but {{because of concerns about}} the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.|$|E
25|$|Mosterín’s {{interest}} in wildlife {{led to an}} early collaboration with Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente, the famous Spanish naturalist and documentary director, for promoting public awareness and appreciation of wild nature; this included the successful Fauna Encyclopedia. Opposed to all spectacles of cruelty, Mosterín has taken a firm stand against bullfighting. He contributed decisively to the discussion leading to the ban of bullfights in Catalonia (Spain) in 2010. Subsequently, he has published two books analyzing this cruel tradition and offering a devastating refutation of all proposed attempts to justify it. As honorary president of the Spanish Great Ape Project, he has cooperated with Peter Singer in advocating certain minimal legal rights for great apes. While firmly rejecting all forms of gross cruelty to animals, Mosterín has adopted a realist {{point of view in}} the controversies about the use of animals in research and nutrition, taking into account the various dimensions of the problems and insisting in the implementation of obligatory standards of animal welfare. He proposes the elimination of unnecessary and painful experiments, the abolition of <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> based on confinement that prevents animals from displaying their genetically programmed behavior, and stopping the specially destructive and cruel forms of commercial fisheries like bottom trawling. In as far as meat continues to be eaten in the future, Mosterín suggests that the steaks could be grown in vitro from stem cells.|$|E
