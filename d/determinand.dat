40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of drinking water quality performance following the introduction of the Blue Drop Certification Programme as a mainstream regulation means to ensure that formal drinking water supplies comply with the South African National Standards. The Blue Drop Certification Programme is an innovative means to regulation which was designed and implemented with the core objective of safeguarding the tap water quality management. The study has focused on the drinking water quality performance with regard to microbiological, chemical, physical and operational compliance in the distribution system. Every effort should be made to achieve drinking water that is safe for human consumption by Water Suppliers. Safe drinking water, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines and SABS (SANS 241) does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including different sensitivities that may occur between life stages. Control of the microbial, chemical, physical and operational quality of drinking water requires the development of management plans. These plans should be implemented to provide the basis for system protection and process control to ensure that the number of pathogens and concentrations of chemicals present a negligible risk to public health and that water is acceptable to consumers. The study has reviewed drinking water quality performance following an introduction of the Blue Drop certification programme in the following municipalities; Tzaneen municipality within the Mopani District municipality, the Sekhukhune District municipality and the Tshwane Metropolitan municipality. The study has used the water quality <b>determinands</b> data available on the Blue Drop System (BDS). Chemical <b>determinands</b> analysis considered for the study is iron, sulfate, manganese, magnesium, arsenic, nitrate, sodium and calcium. Water quality <b>determinands</b> analyses considered for the study are conductivity, pH, turbidity, colour and odour, free chlorine. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) had been used to determine significant differences by comparing the water quality <b>determinands</b> data to determine the p-value in the period between 2010 and 2014 only of the selected <b>determinands.</b> If p-value is 0. 05 the study fails to reject H 0 – there is not enough evidence of significant difference. The study has noted significant improvement in terms of microbiological compliance from 2010 until 2014 within City of Tshwane. Some of the supply systems have maintained consistent microbiological, chemical, operational and physical compliance in the distribution system. The study also noted some decline in water quality on other water supply systems due to non-availability of the water quality data.

40|$|Given {{the present}} {{constraints}} on capital expenditure for water quality improvements, {{it is essential}} that best management practices be adopted whenever possible. This research provides an evaluation of existing practices in use within the water industry for surface water quality classification and assesses water quality indices as an alternative method for monitoring trends in water quality. To this end, a new family of indices have been developed and evaluated and the management flexibility provided by their application has been examined. It is shown that water-quality indices allow the reduction of vast amounts of data on a range of <b>determinand</b> concentrations, to a single number in an objective and reproducible manner. This provides an accurate assessment of surface water quality which will be beneficial to the operational management of surface water quality. Previously developed water quality indices and classifications are reviewed and evaluated. Two main types of index are identified: biotic indices and chemical indices. The former are based exclusively upon biological determinands/indicators and are used extensively within the United Kingdom in the monitoring of surface water quality. The latter includes a consideration of both physico-chemical and biological determinands, but with an emphasis on the former variables. Their use is still the subject of much controversy and discussion. Four main approaches to the development of chemical indices can be identified in accordance with the aims and objectives of their design. Those developed for general application are known as General Water Quality Indices (WQIs) or Indices of Pollution, with the latter based predominantly upon determinands associated with man-made pollution. Those which reflect water quality in terms of its suitability for a specific use are termed use-related; whilst planning indices are those which attempt to highlight areas of high priority for remedial action on the basis of more wide-ranging determinands. The derivation and structure of previously developed indices have been evaluated and the merits and strengths of each index assessed. In this way, nine essential index characteristics were identified, including the need to develop an index in relation to legal standards or guidelines. In addition it was recognised that one requirement of an index should be to reflect potential water use and toxic water quality in addition to general quality as reflected by routinely monitored determinands. The development of river quality classifications within the United Kingdom is reviewed and the additional management flexibility afforded by the use of an index evaluated by comparing the results produced by the SOD (1976) Index with those of the National Water Council (NWC, 1977) Classification. The latter classification is that presently used to monitor water quality in Britain. The SOD Index was found to be biased towards waters of high quality and provided no indication of potential water use or toxic water quality. Nevertheless, it displayed a number of advantages over the NWC Classification in terms of the operational management of surface water quality. It was therefore decided to develop a new family of water quality indices, each based upon legally established water quality standards and guidelines for both routinely monitored and toxic determinands and each relating water quality to a range of potential water uses, thereby indicating economic gains or losses resulting from changes in quality. Four stages {{in the development of a}} water quality index are discussed: <b>determinand</b> selection; the development of <b>determinand</b> transformations and weightings; and the selection of appropriate aggregation functions. Four separate indices have been developed as a result of this research. These may be used either independently or in combination with one another where a complete assessment of water quality is required. The first of these is a General Water Quality Index (WQI) which reflects water quality in terms of a range of potential water uses. This index is based upon nine physico-chemical and biological determinands which are routinely monitored by the water authorities and river purification boards of England, Wales and Scotland. The second, the Potable Water Supply Index (PWSI) is based upon thirteen routinely monitored determinands, but reflects water quality exclusively in terms of its suitability for use in potable water supply (PWS). The two remaining indices, the Aquatic Toxicity (ATI) and Potable Sapidity (PSI) Indices are based upon toxic determinands such as heavy metals, pesticides and hydrocarbons which are potentially harmful to both human and aquatic life. Both indices are use-related, the former reflecting the suitability of water for the protection of fish and wildlife populations; the latter, the suitability of water for use in PWS. Each index is based upon nine and twelve toxic determinands respectively. These indices were developed in as objective and rigorous a manner as possible, utilising an intensive interview and questionnaire programme with members of both the water authorities and river purification boards. Rating curves were selected as the best way in which individual <b>determinand</b> concentrations could be transformed to the same scale. The scales selected for the WQI and PWSI are 10 - 100 and 0 - 100 respectively, whilst those of the ATI and PSI are 0 - 10. Each has been sub-divided in such a way as to indicate not only water quality, but also possible water use. Thus, the indices reflect both current and projected changes in the economic value of a water body which would occur as a result of the implementation of alternative management strategies. The curves were developed using published water quality standards and guidelines relating to specific water uses. Therefore, they contain information on standards which must be adhered to within the United Kingdom and this adds a further dimension to their management flexibility. <b>Determinand</b> weightings indicating the emphasis placed by water quality experts upon individual determinands were assigned to the determinands of the WQI and PWSI. However, weightings were omitted from the ATI and PSI due to the sporadic nature of pollution events associated with these determinands. These vary spatially and temporally, both in concentration and in terms of which <b>determinand</b> is found to be in violation of consent conditions. Therefore, on a national scale, no one <b>determinand</b> could be isolated as being more important than any other. Three aggregation formulae were evaluated for use within the developed indices: the weighted and unweighted versions of an arithmetic, modified arithmetic and multiplicative formulation. Each index was applied to data collected from a series of water quality monitoring bodies covering a range of water quality conditions. In each instance, the modified arithmetic formulation was found to produce index scores which agreed most closely with a predetermined standard, normally the classifications assigned using the NWC classification. In addition, this formulation produced scores which best covered the ascribed index range. However, the multiplicative unweighted formulation was retained for use within the ATI and PSI for the detection of zero index scores, i. e. when concentrations in excess of legal limits were recorded for these toxic determinands. The results from these studies validate the ability of each index to detect fluctuations in surface water quality. Therefore, the utility of the developed indices for the operational management of surface water quality was effectively demonstrated and the flexibility and advantages of an index approach in providing additional information upon which to base management decisions was highlighted. Amongst these advantages was the ability of an index to provide information upon which potential cost-benefit assessments could be made in relation to either spatial or temporal changes to surface water quality. Finally, the need for both general and use-related indices was investigated and found to be an advantage, although not strictly necessary, because the WQI efficiently recorded the range in quality conditions associated with the use of water in potable water supply...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{relationship}} between the concentration of the analyte and the imprecision of an analytical method can be displayed by the precision profile in which the coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation) is plotted against the concentration of the analyte. The function of {{the curve of the}} profile and its confidence limits can easily be assessed by a computer program developed by W. A. Sadler & M. H. Smith (Clin. Chem. 36 (1990), 1346 — 1350). For the assessment of limits of detection and of quantification the following procedure is proposed: The lower (and upper) limit of the measuring interval is defined by the point at which an acceptable CV-line intersects the confidence limit. If, in the variance function one sets the concentration to zero, the normal distribution of the random errors of the blank will result. The mean of the next adjacent normal distribution, following the variance formula and overlapping the "zero-distribution " by a defined amount, represents the limit of detection. Within the described measuring interval, or within a fraction of it, one might construct overlapping normal distributions in an analogous manner. Their number represents the "power of definition" (PD) (instead of the "analytical sensitivity"), which also depends on the concentration of the <b>determinand</b> according to the variance function. We tested these hypotheses by a comparison of two methods for the determination of cyclosporin...|$|E

Results showed that Rodbourne STW discharged less estrone (E 1) than expected, but similar 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and 17 α-ethinyl estradiol (EE 2) to those predicted by a widely cited effluent prediction model. The Exposure Analysis Modelling System (EXAMS) model was set up using measured effluent concentrations as its starting point to predict estrogen concentrations along a 10 km length of the receiving water of the River Ray. The model adequately simulated estrogen concentrations along the river when compared to July 2007 measured data. The model predicted combined estrogen equivalents in reasonable agreement with estrogenicity as measured by passive sampler (POCIS) extracts using the yeast estrogen screen. Using gauged mean flow values for 2007 the model indicated {{that the most important}} <b>determinand</b> for estrogen exposure in the Ray was not season, but proximity to the Rodbourne effluent. Thus, fish in the first 3 km downstream of Rodbourne were typically exposed to two or even three times more estrogens than those living 7 – 10 km further downstream.

Perceived and real public health risks associated {{with the quality of}} water from alternative water sources and supply systems, such as rainwater harvesting (RWH) and grey water reuse, continue to restrict their uptake in many countries. One option to alleviate these health risks is to treat alternative water to potable standard at the point of use (POU) as opposed to the point of supply, as undertaken in centralised systems. This paper presents the results of three international empirical field trials of a novel POU RWH treatment device. The results indicate that where the harvested rainwater did not contain elevated levels of pesticides or physico-chemical <b>determinands,</b> the POU device was able to reduce levels in outlet water to meet UK, EU and World Health Organization potable standards. Regarding microbiological <b>determinands,</b> such as total viable counts and coliforms, and microbial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella spp., the device achieved reduction to potable standard and full pathogen removal, respectively. Thus, while it is possible to treat harvested rainwater to potable standard with a POU device, whether it is desirable to do so to alleviate risks for all end uses remains a question for further debate.

40|$|The {{presence}} of methane (CH 4) in groundwater is usually only noticed when it rises to high concentrations; to date rather {{little is known}} about its production or natural ‘baseline’ conditions. Evidence from a range of non-polluted groundwater environments in England, including water supply aquifers, aquicludes and thermal waters, reveals that CH 4 is almost always detectable, even in aerobic conditions. Measurements of potable waters from Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic carbonate and sandstone aquifers reveal CH 4 concentrations of up to 500 μg/l, but a mean value of < 10 μg/l. However, aquiclude and thermal waters from the Carboniferous and Triassic typically contain in excess of 1500 μg/l. Such high concentrations have so far only been found at redox (Eh) potentials below 0 mV, but in general CH 4 concentration and Eh value are poorly correlated. This suggests a lack of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is confirmed by comparing pe values calculated from the redox couple C(4) /C(− 4) with those derived from Eh. Genesis of CH 4 appears to occur on two timescales: a rapid if low rate of production from labile carbon in anaerobic microsites in the soil, and a much longer, millennium scale of production from more refractory carbon. Methane is rarely measured in groundwater; there is no single ionic <b>determinand</b> which acts universally as a proxy, but a combination of high HCO 3 and low SO 4 concentrations, or the reverse, is an indication that high amounts of CH 4 may be present...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV) is a recent technique (initially named by Lam, Kalvoda and Kopanica in 1983) {{in which there is}} generally a nonelectrolytic accumulation (adsorption) of the <b>determinand</b> followed by a cathodic reductive or anodic oxidative scan. In this work, a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) was used to accumulate several purine derivatives with and without the addition of Cu(lI) in a suitable buffer (usually Britton-Robinson, pH 7. 5). In the presence of copper(lI) the copper(l) purine complex was usually accumulated at about - 0. 1 V. Some of the compounds studied (i. e dimenhydrinate, theophylline, guanine and azathioprine) can be determined as free compounds (i. e with no Cu(lI) added) after accumulation at potentials ranging from 0 to - 0. 2 V versus Ag/AgCI reference electrode. The determination of these compounds was made after optimising pH, buffer constituents, accumulation potential and accumulation time. The addition of Cu(lI) to these purines makes possible accumulation at shorter accumulation times, and improves the detection limits. For example, the detection limit of azathioprine in the presence of Cu(lI) is as low as 2 x 10 - 10 M. Both differential-pulse polarography (DPP) and DP-AdCSV (differential pulse adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry) were used in the determination of theophylline and azathioprine in their dosage forms (tablets).

A subset of determinands: aluminium, calcium, chloride, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, iron, nitrate, pH, silicon and sulphate are examined within a framework of non-stationary time-series analysis to identify <b>determinand</b> trends, seasonality and short-term dynamics. The results demonstrate that both long-term and high-frequency monitoring provide valuable and unique insights into the hydrochemistry of a catchment.

Additionally, these data proved invaluable for placing the short-term variability demonstrated within the high-frequency data within context. The 7 -hour data highlighted complex diurnal cycles for NO 3, Ca and Fe with cycles displaying changes in phase and amplitude on a seasonal basis. The high-frequency data also demonstrated the need to consider the impact that the time of sample collection can have on the summary statistics of the data and also that sampling during the hours of darkness provides additional hydrochemical information for determinands which exhibit pronounced diurnal variability.

When sewage treatment is lacking, often in developing regions, these sanitary <b>determinands</b> and down-the-drain chemicals may be present at high concentrations in surface waters which may adversely impact the ecological communities present downstream of the effluent outfall. Some studies have studied these ecological effects by sampling the taxa present at regular intervals downstream of an wastewater outfall, from which a common pattern in terms of macroinvertebrate species richness, dominance and diversity throughout the impact zone is evident.

The model combines water quality data and toxicity data of the stressors on aquatic organisms, in the form of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) to predict this impact.

The model was applied to data from a field study on the South Elkhorn Creek in Kentucky, USA.

During the autumn to spring periods, there was a net export, attributed to increased diffuse inputs from the catchment during storms, decomposition of channel biomass and remobilisation of phosphorus from the bed sediment. This seasonality of retention and remobilisation was higher in the lower reach than the middle reach, which was attributed to downstream changes in land use and fine sediment availability. Silicon showed much less seasonality, but did have periods of rapid retention in spring, due to diatom uptake within the river channel, and a subsequent release from the bed sediments during storm events. Chloride did not produce a seasonal pattern, indicating that the observed phosphor-us and nitrate seasonality {{was a product of}} annual variation in diffuse inputs and internal riverine processes, rather than an artefact of sampling, flow gauging and analytical errors...|$|E
40|$|Enrichment {{methods are}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} type of sample for which they are to be used, and basic analytical principles are applied to develop criteria for choice of enrichment method and conditions to be used. The topic of 'enrichment ' or 'preconcentration ' of trace elements has assumed great importance not only in the field of high-purity materials but also in connection with pollution. Whatever the merits or demerits of the case against increasing pollution of the environment, the analyst is faced with the reality of having to try to determine traces {{of a wide variety of}} substances. One of the ironic consequences of the anti-pollution campaign is that it would be quite possible for legislation to be enacted setting an upper limit for the permissible concentration of a pollutant, and for that limit to be below the limits of detection for that substance. However, if that were the case, the pro-secution would have a hard task to prove that the pollutant was present in concentrations above the permitted limit but below the detection limit (unless, of course, they were aware of Professor Liteanu's mathematical methods for dealing with such a situation 1). The subject of this paper was dealt with by Minczewski 2 at the IUPAC Congress in Moscow in 1965, and by Mizuike 3 in a book on physical methods of trace analysis. It is also the subject of a review that will appear in Talanta 4. My purpose will therefore not be to give a review of applications, but rather to try to apply simple analytical ideas to the problem and to suggest lines of work. Of necessity, there will be some common ground between this paper and those already mentioned. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Basically there are two situations in which enrichment will be required, their common feature being that the species to be concentrated before its determination (the <b>determinand)</b> is present in amounts or concentration...|$|E
40|$|Information {{on a new}} {{observatory}} {{study of}} the water quality of two major river basins in northwestern England (the Ribble and Wyre) is presented. It covers upland, intermediate and lowland environments of contrasting pollution history with sufficient detail to examine transitional gradients. The upland rivers drain acidic soils subjected to long-term acidic deposition. Nonetheless, the acidic runoff from the soils is largely neutralised by high alkalinity groundwaters, although the rivers retain, perhaps as colloids, elements such as Al and Fe that are mobilised under acid conditions. The lowland rivers are contaminated and have variable water quality due to variable urban/industrial point and diffuse inputs reflecting local and regional differences in historic and contemporary sources. For most <b>determinands,</b> pollutant concentrations are not a major cause for concern although phosphate levels remain high. Set against earlier studies for other regions, {{there may be a}} general decline in pollutant levels and this is most clearly observed for boron where effluent inputs have declined significantly due to reductions in household products that are flushed down the drain. High concentrations of sodium and chloride occurred briefly after a severe cold spell due to flushing of road salts. A major inventory for water quality within rural, urban, industrial and agricultural typologies is provided within data summary attachments for over 50 water quality <b>determinands.</b> Within the next year, the full dataset will be made available from the CEH website. This, with ongoing monitoring, represents a platform for water quality studies across a wide range of catchment typologies pertinent to environmental management of clean and impacted systems within the UK. The study provides a base of research “from source to sea” including extensions to the estuary and open sea for a semi-confined basin, the Irish Sea, where there are many issues of pollution inputs and contamination. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a baseline interpretation of extensive hydrochemical characteristics of UK Chalk catchments {{based on the}} Frome/Piddle (west Dorset), {{a major component of}} the LOCAR (Lowland Catchment Research) programme. It examines a wide range of chemical <b>determinands</b> using data from two long-term (1979 – 2000) river water monitoring sites. The water quality of the Frome and Piddle is very similar to that of agricultural catchments associated with Chalk aquifers. Waters are of a calcium bicarbonate type and nutrient bearing. In general, there are poor correlations between major ion <b>determinands</b> and between chemical concentrations and flow due to the large groundwater storage which buffers chemical variability. Hence, there are no major chemical gradients within the aquifer to provide distinct water end-member chemistries for contrasting hydrochemical environments to allow chemical hydrograph separation on the basis of flow. NO 3 -N and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) are the dominant species of dissolved N and P, respectively. NO 3 -N sources both within the aquifer and within the soils contribute to relatively high concentrations, with average values close to those of other agriculturally impacted catchments. SRP concentrations are generally lower than for high agriculturally, urban and industrially impacted catchments. High correlations between Al, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn occur due to the association of these trace metals with the soil-forming oxide and hydroxide ions present in suspended solids. Biological process influence SiO 2, pH and EpCO 2 levels. Average levels of EpCO 2 at 4. 15 and 5. 52 times atmospheric pressure in the Frome and Piddle, respectively, indicates that the river waters have not fully degassed to equilibrium with the atmosphere, suggesting a short residence time of spring waters in the river channel. ...|$|R

40|$|Assessing {{water quality}} is of crucial {{importance}} to both {{society and the}} environment. Deterioration in water quality through issues such as eutrophication presents substantial risk to human health, plant and animal life, and can have {{detrimental effects on the}} local economy. Long-term data records across multiple sites can be used to investigate water quality and risk factors statistically, however, identification of underlying changes can only be successful if there is a sufficient quantity of data available. As vast amounts of resources are required for the implementation and maintenance of a monitoring network, logistically and financially {{it is not possible to}} employ continuous monitoring of all water environments. This raises the question as to the optimal design for long-term monitoring networks which are capable of capturing underlying changes. Two of the main design considerations are clearly where to sample, and how frequently to sample. The principal aim of this thesis is to use statistical analysis to investigate frequently used environmental monitoring networks, developing new methodology where appropriate, so that the design and implementation of future networks can be made as effective and cost efficient as possible. Using data which have been provided by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, several data from Scottish lakes and rivers and a range of determinands are considered in order to explore water quality monitoring in Scotland. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to environmental monitoring and both existing statistical techniques, and potential challenges which are commonly encountered in the analysis of environmental data are discussed. Following this, Chapter 2 presents a simulation study which has been designed and implemented in order to evaluate the nature and statistical power for commonly used environmental sampling and monitoring designs for surface waters. The aim is to answer questions regarding how many samples to base the chemical classification of standing waters, and how appropriate the currently available data in Scotland are for detecting trends and seasonality. The simulation study was constructed to investigate the ability to detect the different underlying features of the data under several different sampling conditions. After the assessment of how often sampling is required to detect change, the remainder of the thesis will attempt to address some of the questions associated with where the optimal sampling locations are. The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) was introduced in 2003 to set compliance standards for all water bodies across Europe, with an aim to prevent deterioration, and ensure all sites reach `good' status by 2015. One of the features of the WFD is that water bodies can be grouped together and the classification of all members of the group is then based on the classification of a single representative site. The potential misclassification of sites means one of the key areas of interest is how well the existing groups used by SEPA for classification capture differences between the sites in terms of several chemical determinands. This will be explored in Chapter 3 where a functional data analysis approach will be taken in order to investigate some of the features of the existing groupings. An investigation of the effect of temporal autocorrelation on our ability to distinguish groups of sites from one another will also be presented here. It is also of interest to explore whether fewer, or indeed more groups would be optimal in order to accurately represent the trends and variability in the water quality parameters. Different statistical approaches for grouping standing waters will be presented in Chapter 4, where the question of how many groups is statistically optimal is also addressed. As in Chapter 3, these approaches for grouping sites will be based on functional data in order to include the temporal dynamics of the variable of interest within any analysis of group structure obtained. Both hierarchical and model based functional clustering are considered here. The idea of functional clustering is also extended to the multivariate setting, thus enabling information from several determinands of interest to be used within formation of groups. This is something which is of particular importance in view of the fact that the WFD classification encompasses a range of different determinands. In addition to the investigation of standing waters, an entirely different type of water quality monitoring network is considered in Chapter 5. While standing waters are assumed to be spatially independent of one another there are several situations where this assumption is not appropriate and where spatial correlation between locations needs to be accounted for. Further developments of the functional clustering methods explored in Chapter 4 are presented here in order to obtain groups of stations that are not only similar in terms of mean levels and temporal patterns of the <b>determinand</b> of interest, but which are also spatially homogenous. The river network data explored in Chapter 5 introduces a set of new challenges when considering functional clustering that go beyond the inclusion of Euclidean distance based spatial correlation. Existing methodology for estimating spatial correlation are combined with functional clustering approaches and developed to be suitable for application on sites which lie along a river network. The final chapter of this thesis provides a summary of the work presented and discussion of limitations and suggestions for future directions. ...|$|E

ItNascono dall’esigenza di compensare una serie di bias tipiche di alti tipi di descrittori utilizzati per definire lo stato ecologico dei sistemi di transizione - in quanto biologici e non tassonomici – i descrittori basati sulla body size. Essi si occupano della componente biologica di un ecosistema, superando l’approccio esclusivamente chimico dei descrittori generalmente utilizzati. Tra l’altro, non essendo necessario per il loro utilizzo il riconoscimento tassonomico, permettono di ridurre tempi e costi di lavoro. Uno degli elementi caratterizzanti le comunità biotiche è la taglia corporea collegata con l’energetica individuale, con le relazioni inter ed intra specifiche, con la dinamica di popolazione e con i rapporti di coesistenza delle specie. L’ampio spettro di aspetti ecologici, coperti dalla mole corporea, permette di giustificarne l’utilizzo nella valutazione della qualità ambientale in particolare nei sistemi acquatici di transizione in quanto ecosistemi che presentano una serie di elementi distintivi, come l’alta eterogeneità, la dinamicità, l’instabilità, l’alta produttività...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess spatio-temporal variability of water quality <b>determinands</b> of the Tuul River in surrounding area of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia using an extensive dataset between 1998 and 2008. It presents the spatio-temporal assessment and seasonal pattern of 14 hydro-chemical determinants at 15 monitoring sites in the study area. According to the Mongolian water quality classification system, all sections of the Tuul River and its tributaries in the surrounding area of Ulaanbaatar city belong to moderately and heavily polluted waters due to high concentration of ammonium. In accordance with European Union water quality standard, the downstream section of the Tuul River fails. In order to change this situation, operation enhancement of wastewater treatment plants and artificial increment of dissolved oxygen concentration become crucial to improve the water quality significantly. Perhaps a new wastewatertreatment plant is needed for Ulaanbaatar city...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide {{pollution}} of surface {{water is a}} major concern in many agricultural catchments The development of rapid and accurate methods for determining pesticide concentrations in water samples is, therefore, important. Here we describe a method for the simultaneous analysis of six pesticides (metaldehyde, quinmerac, carbetamide, metazachlor, propyzamide and pendimethalin) in natural waters by direct aqueous injection with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method validation showed good linearity from 0. 2 to 50. 0 µg/L with correlation coefficients between 0. 995 and 0. 999. Method accuracy ranged from 84 to 100 % and precision Relative standard deviation (RSD) from 4 to 15 %. The limits of detection for the targeted pesticides ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 36 µg/L. No significant matrix effects on quantification were observed (t-test). The method was tested on water samples from a small arable catchment in eastern England. Peak concentrations for the <b>determinands</b> ranged from 1 to 10 µg/L...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{months of}} 7 -hourly {{analyses}} of rainfall and stream water chemistry are presented, spanning {{a wide range}} of chemical <b>determinands</b> and building on over 20 years of weekly records for the moorland headwaters of the river Severn. The high-frequency time series data show that hydrochemical responses to major hydrological and biological drivers of short-term variability in rainfall and rivers are not captured by conventional low-frequency monitoring programmes. A wealth of flow related, flow independent, diurnal, seasonal and annual fluctuations indicate a cacophony of interactions within the catchment and stream. The complexity of the chemical dynamics is visually obvious, although {{there appears to be no}} clear way of translating this complexity into a simple algorithm. The work provides a proof of concept for the complex structure of catchment functioning revealed by extensive high-frequency measurements coupled with high analytical sensitivity and reproducibility. It provides new insights into hydrogeochemical functioning and a novel resource for catchment modelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{increasingly}} stringent and wider ranging European Union legislation relating to {{water and the}} environment has required regulators to assess compliance risk and to respond by formulating appropriate pollution control measures. To support this process the UK Water Industry has completed a national Chemicals Investigation Programme (CIP), to monitor over 160 wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) for 70 <b>determinands.</b> Final effluent concentrations of zinc, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (fluoranthene, benzo(a) pyrene, benzo(b) fluoranthene, benzo(k) fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i) perylene and indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd) pyrene), “penta ” congeners (BDEs) 47 and 99, tributyltin, triclosan, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, ibuprofen, propranolol, fluoxetine, diclofenac, 17 β-estradiol and 17 α-ethinyl estradiol exceeded existing or proposed Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs) in over 50 % of WwTWs. Dilution by receiving water might ensure compliance with EQSs for these chemicals, apart from the BDEs. However, in some cases there will be insufficient dilution to ensure compliance and additional management options may be required...|$|R
