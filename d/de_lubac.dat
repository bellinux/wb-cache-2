As a cardinal, Lustiger began to attract {{international}} attention. He was considered papabile, or eligible for election as pope. Some circles interpreted the Prophecy of Malachy in reference to him as a Jewish Pope.|$|E
25|$|He {{read the}} Thomistic {{philosophers}} Étienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain—one {{of the main}} Catholic thinkers of his youth—as well as Jean Guitton, but also the Protestant philosopher Paul Ricœur, and Maurice Clavel, and the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Close to Augustinism, he preferred the post-conciliar theologian Louis Bouyer to the (pre-conciliar) neo-Thomist Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. His main influence was Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac,</b> {{as well as the}} Jesuits Albert and Paul Chapelle. Lustiger, unlike other leading twentieth-century French bishops, did not draw noticeably on patristic writings and was more sensitive to rabbinic texts.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, he {{returned}} to Bavaria, to the University of Regensburg and co-founded the theological journal Communio, with Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac,</b> Walter Kasper and others, in 1972. Communio, now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the Augsburg Confession might possibly be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith. Several of Benedict's former students became his confidantes, notably Christoph Schönborn, {{and a number of}} his former students sometimes meet for discussions. He served as Vice President of the University of Regensburg from 1976 to 1977.|$|E

While <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> mentioned that Teilhard was less than precise {{in some of his}} concepts, he affirmed the orthodoxy of Teilhard de Chardin and responded to Teilhard's critics: [...] "We need not concern ourselves with a number of detractors of Teilhard, in whom emotion has blunted intelligence".

2500|$|Two {{thirds of}} the 300,000 Jews living in France at the {{outbreak}} of war survived the Nazi holocaust. Thousands of priests, nuns and lay people acted to assist French Jews. The majority of French Jews survived the occupation, in large part thanks to the help received from Catholics and Protestants, who protected them in convents, boarding schools, presbyteries and families. The Amitiés Chrétiennes organisation operated out of Lyon to secure hiding places for Jewish children. Among its members were the Jesuit [...] and , a priest formerly of the Jewish faith. The influential French theologian Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> {{was active in the}} resistance to Nazism and to antisemitism. He assisted in the publication of Témoinage chrétien with Pierre Chaillet. He responded to Neo-paganism and antisemitism with clarity, describing the notion of an Aryan New Testament standing in contradiction to a Semitic Old Testament as [...] "blasphemy" [...] and [...] "stupidity". In 1988, Lubac returned to writing about the era in Résistance chrétienne à l'antisémitisme, souvenirs 1940-1944 (Christian Resistance to Antisemitism: Memories from 1940-1944) ...|$|E

50|$|Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac's</b> {{theological}} work on {{the distinction}} of nature and grace has been influential in the movement's articulation of ontology.

50|$|Rousselot {{suggested}} {{a new concept}} of revelation: that revelation be conceived not as a sum total of distinct truths, propositions, judgments, but {{as a kind of}} knowledge that is indefinitely cashable (monnayable) in distinct ideas and propositions which explicitate it without being able to exhaust it, and without claiming to supplement it. Revelation, he proposed, was the living and loving knowledge that the apostles had of Jesus. The mode in which the many dogmas are precontained in the single changeless knowledge which is the apostolic deposit is not logical, but Christological. <b>De</b> <b>Lubac’s</b> contribution to the question of doctrinal development is largely a restatement of that of Rousselot, whose papers he studied and published.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Pope John Paul II offered <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> the cardinalate, {{this time}} with a {{dispensation}} from being consecrated a bishop. <b>De</b> <b>Lubac</b> accepted, and became the first cardinal after 1962 who was not a bishop. In the consistory of 2 February 1983, Pope John Paul II raised <b>de</b> <b>Lubac,</b> at 87, to the College of Cardinals. He was created Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica.

50|$|<b>De</b> <b>Lubac</b> {{began work}} on the ideas which would {{eventually}} appear as Surnaturel in {{his days as a}} student in Hastings. <b>De</b> <b>Lubac</b> published several articles in the 1930s which were to make up much of Surnaturel. The development of the book itself, though, was greatly hindered by the war. In June 1940, fleeing the advancing Nazis, <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> left Lyon with a bag which included the notebook for Surnaturel, on which he worked for several days. <b>De</b> <b>Lubac</b> stated in later years that the book had taken sufficient shape by 1941 to be ready for review; the nihil obstat was granted in February 1942. However, paper shortages prevented publication. In 1943, while being hunted by the Gestapo, <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> fled, again carrying his notebook, this time to Vals. He used the resources in the Vals library to continue his work on the book. Eventually, in October 1945 the Imprimatur was issued, and in 1946, the book was published (though only as an edition of 700 copies, due to ongoing paper shortages).|$|E
5000|$|What <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> called [...] "the dark years" [...] lasted {{nearly a}} decade.

Like a monastery for language, poetry enacts a linguistic askesis, schooling its language and its readers in conversion. The essay includes a close reading of Gjertrud Schnackenberg's poem, “Supernatural Love. ” A conclusion situates the essay's program for a theology of literature in relation to Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac's</b> work on spiritual exegesis and Hans Urs von Balthasar's use of literature in his theology...|$|R
50|$|Servais Theodore Pinckaers {{was born}} in Liège (Belgium) in 1925 {{and raised in the}} village of Wonck (now part of the Walloon {{municipality}} of Bassenge). In 1945 he entered the Dominican Order and pursued his studies in theology at the Belgian Dominican Studium at La Sarte, obtaining his license in theology (1952) under the direction of Jérôme Hamer, writing his thesis (tesina) on Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac’s</b> Surnaturel. He pursued doctoral studies at the Pontificium Athenaeum Internationale Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, attending the classes of such notables as Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Paul Philippe and Mario Luigi Ciappi.

40|$|According to Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac's</b> {{history of}} medieval exegesis, {{the fourteenth century}} marked the tipping point for the {{disintegration}} of history and allegory. The Postilla super totam bibliam of the Franciscan Nicholas of Lyra (1270 - 1349) plays {{a prominent role in}} this declension narrative by ceding the "spirit" of interpretation to the separate discipline of theology, and opening the space for critical biblical studies to attain autonomy. But what if Nicholas of Lyra {{was on the other side}} of this history? Arguing from the layout of early Postilla manuscripts and the institutional and manuscript culture of the fourteenth century, this article proposes that Nicholas's Postilla represents a vigorous and largely successful attempt to reintegrate Biblical text, historical scholarship, and theological exegesis. Nicholas's approach to the exegetical crises of his own day helps us to reassess the challenges and possibilities of theological exegesis today. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Magnus Ullén, Department of Language, Literature and Intercultural Studies, Karlstad University The Figure of Christ: Literary Interpretation and the Rhetoric of Faith (Kristusprincipen. Om litteraturtolkning och trons retorik) The article {{provides}} a {{detailed discussion of}} French theologian Henri <b>de</b> <b>Lubac’s</b> account of medieval exegesis. It considers in particular the function of Christ in the medieval fourfold system of interpretation, arguing that Christ — or christos — amounts to a metaleptic trope which grounds the system of faith upon which medieval exegesis is built. For the believer, it is through Christ that the ideological dimension of the Bible is realized: {{it is through the}} believer’s faith that christos constitutes a value inherent in the sacred text that this text enters historical reality, as it were, {{in the form of the}} acts and discursive practice of the believer. This way of entering into the Biblical text in many ways resembles the way readers of literary texts more generally can be said to enter into the texts they engage with. While the fourfold method of exegesis eventually fell out of fashion, the article suggests that its principal categories – the allegorical, the tropological, and the anagogical — did not disappear but rather were transformed into an alternative set of categories, namely the philological, the aesthetic, and the ideological. Neither was the rhetorical office of christos as a trope abandoned; rather, it took on a more secular shape, first in the form of the self, and then — under the influence of increasingly materialist modes of thinking — in the form of the text. Even so, literary interpretation even today remains liable to give in to the idealizing force of christos, as witnessed by the tendency to read texts as reflecting the identities of writers and readers, rather than the letter in all its situational contingency...|$|R

50|$|In 1965 <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> {{published}} two works: Le Mystere du surnaturel, and Augustinisme et théologie moderne, {{which served}} primarily to clarify numerous objections to Surnaturel.

Cajetan, <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> argued, assumed that Thomas was an Aristotelian, working with a definition of nature from Aristotle's Physics, which effectively turned human nature into a reality essentially closed in on itself, with its own intrinsic powers, desires and goals. This move, argued <b>de</b> <b>Lubac,</b> led subsequent Catholic thought to produce mistaken readings of Thomas Aquinas's account of the relationship between nature and grace.|$|E

A born aristocrat in manner and appearance, <b>de</b> <b>Lubac</b> studied law for a year before, aged 17, joining the Society of Jesus in Lyon on 9 October 1913.
