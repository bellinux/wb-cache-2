5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology goes beyond its {{consequences for the}} selected patient groups that benefit from its application. Past and future technological developments {{have a variety of}} social, economic and ethical implications which have {{to be taken into account}} when balancing its costs and benefits to society. Departing from an economic perspective we describe a number of mechanisms underlying the emergence of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology which help us to understand some of the characteristics of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology, such as its focus on quality enhancement rather than on economy. To assess the actual performance of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology in terms of efficiency and equity is difficult as there may be debate about the perspective guiding such assessment and as there still is scarce information on <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology in terms of these economic indicators. The increasing technological opportunities have triggered a wider debate on the desired evolution of our health care systems. In some countries there is a tendency to diminish government involvement in health care and emphasize private (for profit) enterprise as a reaction to not being able to finance all new <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology. The risks of such strategies are discussed briefly. We conclude that the main actors in health care should adjust their behaviour in order to accomplish the introduction of more cost-effective technologies and to achieve a more socially efficient distribution of their benefits. <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology socio-economic implications...|$|R
5|$|Widely {{divergent}} {{costs for}} the project were discussed. The original estimate was £140,000 if the railway was built, and £200,000 if the tunnel was built. Opponents suggested the cost would be nearer £700,000, and John Rennie estimated the tunnel line would cost £440,790 in 1809. Opponents argued that the real intent was to improve the water supply for the Basingstoke Canal or to line the pockets of George Hollis, {{the owner of the}} Itchen Navigation. There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much <b>higher</b> <b>costs,</b> the project was dropped.|$|E

The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing <b>higher</b> <b>costs,</b> slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E
5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to Greyhound. While the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> {{factors to}} help managers and clinicians to analyse the reasons of adverse costs and provide indications for financial negotiation. DESIGN: To locate <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> or long stay patients, the analysis was designed {{on the basis}} of a mixture of Weibull distributions. In this new model, the proportion of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> patients was expressed according to the multinomial logistic regression, permitting the determination of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> factors. SETTING: The 1993 French reference database, constituted in the framework of the national study of DRG costs, conducted by the French Ministry of Health. The database of discharge abstracts recorded in 1993 in the Dijon public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The analyses were based on 1352 abstracts from the French reference database and 368 from the Dijon database concerning patients, aged 18 and over, suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma. MAIN RESULTS: <b>High</b> <b>cost</b> and long stay factors were the same: number of stays, death, transfer, acute leukaemia, neutropenia, septicaemia, high dose aplastic chemotherapy, central venous catheterisation, parenteral nutrition, protected or laminar airflow room, blood transfusion, and intravenous antibiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> predictive factors, as shown in the case of leukaemia and lymphoma patients, would help to reduce the adverse effects of a prospective payment system...|$|R

5|$|On 1 April 2003, Kato Air {{took over}} the Bodø–Røst route, using Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The new airline had a troubled start with the {{passenger}} numbers dropping by 27 percent. On 4 December, a flight from Røst to Bodø was hit by lightning, and received severe damage during the landing at Bodø. The choice of the operator was criticized by the Røst Municipal Council following the incident, stated that the ministry had prioritized price over safety. The council stated {{that they did not}} feel that Kato Air provided the same service as Widerøe and that the aircraft were a safety hazard. Among the complaints were lack of accessibility for disabled people, no cabin pressurization, no weather radar, more expensive tickets, no discounted tickets and no possibility for carry-on baggage. In February 2006, there was a wave of cancellations by Kato Air, due to technical problems with both the airline's aircraft. In June, the airline's pilots started selling tickets themselves at the airport. The company stated that this was because they had declined Widerøe to do this because of <b>higher</b> <b>costs.</b> The Civil Aviation Authority of Norway withdrew Kato Air's concession in 2008 due to lack on maintenance. On an interim basis, the helicopter airline Lufttransport, that operated the route to the nearby island of Værøy, {{took over the}} route from 5 September to 29 October, when Widerøe started flying again.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{sought to}} use the MirageIII {{replacement}} program {{as a means to}} increase the capabilities of Australia's manufacturing industry. Accordingly, it was decided to build the aircraft in Australia, though it was recognised that this would lead to <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> than if the fighters were purchased directly from the United States. While the first two RAAF Hornets were built in the United States, the remainder were assembled at the Government Aircraft Factories plant at Avalon Airport in Victoria, and their engines were produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. Another twelve Australian companies were involved in other stages of the project. These firms were sub-contracted to McDonnell Douglas and the other major US companies that produced components for the F/A-18, and had to comply with the requirements of the FMS program. The Australian Government hoped that Singapore and New Zealand would purchase Australian-built Hornets, but this did not eventuate. The Canadian Government expressed interest in purchasing 25 Australian-built F/A-18As in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in the United States, but this did not lead to any sales.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. A major {{study conducted by}} the Young Foundation and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council investigating the use of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit in Wales. The research was carried out throughout 2015 with the final report - Credit where credit’s due? Understanding experiences of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit in Wales – published in May 2016. An estimated 12 million people across the UK lack access to affordable credit, something the majority take for granted in everyday life. The alternatives for many are <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> lenders – payday loans, doorstep lenders, or expensive rent-to-own stores on the high street. This financial exclusion is harmful to individuals and families, our communities and the wider economy. Objectives: We set out to understand the scale of the issue, pathways into and journeys through <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit, and the impact this has. We aimed to identify opportunities and offer suggestions for new and improved products, services and ways of engaging consumers – and to outline what might work as alternatives to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit. Key Findings: •	Six per cent of the Welsh population have used one or more of rent-to-own stores, home credit and payday loans in the last year. •	Customers come {{from all walks of life}} but are most likely to be young families. •	Reasons for using <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit range from paying for Christmas or buying new items for the home, to simply paying the bills and making ends meet. For most, these represent essential purchases. •	The majority of people turn straight to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit without considering different types of credit or comparing offers between lenders. •	<b>High</b> <b>cost</b> credit customers are typically extremely aware of their income and outgoings, often using ‘jam jar’ and other informal money management solutions. •	Many see <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit options as being ‘for people like me’ and one of a very limited set of financial options. •	The majority of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit customers live in communities where these types of borrowing are normal. •	Home credit providers especially are in a strong position to encourage repeat borrowing. •	Customer perceptions of payday loans still firmly reflect the pre-cap market. •	By contrast, rent-to-own and home credit have largely slipped through the net of negative publicity. •	Regulating all forms of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit out of existence is not the answer. •	There is a clear need for market growth in the affordable credit market...|$|R
