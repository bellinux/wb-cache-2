Many clustering methods are applied to {{analysis of}} data for gene expression, {{but none of them}} is able to deal with an absolute way with the challenges that this technology raises. Due to this, many applications have been developed for visually representing clustering algorithm results on DNA microarray data, usually providing dendrogram and heat map visualizations. Most of these applications focus only on the above visualizations, and do not offer further visualization components to the validate the clustering methods or to validate one another. This paper proposes using a visual analytics framework in cluster analysis of gene expression data. Additionally, it presents a new method for finding cluster boundaries based on properties of metric spaces. Our approach presents a set of visualization components able to interact with each other; namely, parallel coordinates, cluster boundary genes, 3 D cluster surfaces and DNA microarray visualizations as heat maps. Experimental results have shown that our framework can be very useful in the process of more fully understanding DNA microarray data.

The main focus is set on showing how straightforward it is today to set up a data scraping pipeline, with minimal programming effort, and answer a number of practical needs. For exemplification purposes, we introduce a biomedical data extraction scenario where the desired data sources, well-known in clinical microbiology and similar domains, do not offer programmatic interfaces yet.

40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decade online {{interventions}} have emerged as a promising approach for patients with mild/moderate depressive symptoms, reaching at large populations and representing cost-effective alternatives. The main objective of this double-blind, randomized controlled trial {{is to examine the}} efficacy of an internet-based self-management tool (iFightDepression) for mild to moderate depression as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU) versus internet-based psychoeducation plus TAU. Methods: A total of 310 participants with major depression disorder (MDD) will be recruited at four different mental-health facilities in Spain. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two study arms: iFightDepression (iFD) tool + TAU vs. internet-based psychoeducation + TAU. Both interventions last for 8 weeks and there is a 12 weeks follow up. The primary outcome measure is changes in depressive symptoms assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Additionally, pre-post interventions assessments will include socio-demographic data, a brief medical and clinical history and self-reported measures of depressive symptoms, quality of life, functional impairments and satisfaction with the iFD tool. Discussion: iFightDepression is an easy-prescribed tool that could increase the efficacy of conventional treatment and potentially reach untreated patients, shortening waiting lists to receive psychological treatment. Confirming the efficacy of the iFD internet-based self-management tool as an add-on treatment for individuals with mild to moderate depression will be clinically-relevant.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between seismic waves and slopes {{is an important}} topic to provide reliable scenarios for earthquake-(re) triggered landslides. The physical properties of seismic waves as well as slope topography and geology can significantly modify the local seismic response, influencing landslide triggering. A novel approach is here applied to two case studies in Andalusia (southern Spain) for computing the expected earthquake-induced displacements of existing landslide masses. Towards this aim, dynamic stress–strain numerical modelling was carried out using a selection of seismic signals characterized by different spectral content and energy. In situ geophysical measurements, consisting of noise records and temporary seismometric arrays, were carried out to control the numerical outputs in terms of local seismic response. The results consist of relationships between the characteristic period, Tm, of the seismic signals and the characteristic periods of the landslide masses, related to the thickness (Ts) and length (Tl), respectively. These relationships show that the larger the horizontal dimension (i. e. length of landslide) of a landslide is, the more effective the contribution (to the resulting coseismic displacement) of the long-period seismic waves is, as the maximum displacements are expected for a low Tm at each energy level of the input. On the other hand, when the local seismic response mainly depends on stratigraphy (i. e. landslide thickness), the maximum expected displacements occur close to the resonance period of the landslide, except for high-energy seismic inputs.

40|$|Nickel {{benzoate}} trihydrate (1) {{has been}} prepared in single-crystalline form by {{the reaction of}} nickel carbonate with benzoic acid in boiling aqueous solution. Its crystal structure comprises positively charged [Ni(Bz) (HO) ] chains, benzoate anions, and one independent water molecule of solvation. The hexacoordinate Ni centers in the chains are triply bridged by one syn-syn carboxylato and two aqua bridges, and adjacent chains are linked by O-H···O hydrogen bonds [O···O distances {{are in the range}} 2. 647 (3) - 2. 684 (3) Å] through solvate water molecules and benzoate anions. Thermal analysis revealed that 1 is stable up to 100 °C; further heating led to full dehydration accompanied by an additional decomposition reaction, as characterized by IR analysis of the intermediates. The geometrical features of the Ni centers have been compared with similar features at the active sites of urease. The effective magnetic moment per formula unit μ has a value of 3. 17 μ at room temperature and upon cooling reaches a maximum value of 12. 39 μ at T = 4. 6 K, which indicates ferromagnetic coupling between the nearest Ni atoms [3. 0671 (1) Å] within the chains; at lower temperatures this is counteracted by zero-field splitting.

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of water deficits on water use {{efficiency}} (WUE) of citrus trees, whole tree transpiration and CO 2 assimilation were measured in a semi-arid environment during the summer of 2012. Young orange trees >Valencia Late>, either water stressed (DI) and well-irrigated (C), were monitored in selected days using a gas exchange chamber. Tree transpiration was also measured on a continuous basis with sap flow sensors. The water restriction reduced the transpiration of the DI treatment down to 60 % of the maximum potential (treatment C) during the peak of water stress. The instantaneous WUE ranged between 1. 7 and 79 gCO 2 L- 1 H 2 O and was tightly related to the vapour pressure deficit. Differences in instantaneous WUE due to water stress were insignificant. On a daily basis, WUE ranged between 4. 9 (7 August) and 8. 8 (7 June) gL- 1 for the daytime period; and between 4. 0 and 8. 2 gL- 1 for the 24 h period. As water stress was imposed on the DI treatment, a trend of increasing WUE in DI relative to C was observed, reaching, in the maximum stress period, a difference, of 13 - 15 % (daytime) and 20 - 22 % (24 h) although not statistically significant. Partial rewatering returned the WUE to similar values in both treatments. An analysis of the differences in the diurnal patterns of transpiration suggests that the increase in WUE due to water stress in citrus is achieved indirectly by shifting the overall carbon assimilation towards the morning hours of lower evaporative demand. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} [URL] Some approaches {{have been published}} in the past using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) spectral features for the screening of Sleep Apnea–Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) patients. However there is a big variability among these methods regarding the selection of the source signal and the specific spectral components relevant to the analysis. In this study we investigate the use of the Heart Timing (HT) as the source signal in comparison to the classical approaches of Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Period (HP). This signal has the theoretical advantage of being optimal under the Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation (IPFM) model assumption. Only spectral bands defined as standard for the study of HRV are considered, and for each method the so-called LF/HF and VLFn features are derived. A comparative statistical analysis between the different resulting methods is performed, and subject classification is investigated by means of ROC analysis and a Naïve-Bayes classifier. The standard Apnea-ECG database is used for validation purposes. Our results show statistical differences between SAHS patients and controls for all the derived features. In the subject classification task the best performance in the testing set was obtained using the LF/HF ratio derived from the HR signal (Area under ROC curve= 0. 88). Only slight differences are obtained due to the effect of changing the source signal. The impact of using the HT signal in this domain is therefore limited, and has not shown relevant differences with respect {{to the use of the}} classical approaches of HR or HP.

40|$|Dewfall {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as {{an important source of}} water for many ecosystems, especially in arid and semiarid areas, contributing to improve daily and annual water balances and leading to increased interest in its study in recent years. In this study, occurrence, frequency and amount of dewfall were measured from January 2007 to December 2010 (4 [*]years study) to find out its contribution to the local water balance in a Mediterranean semiarid steppe ecosystem dominated by scattered tussocks of Stipa tenacissima (Balsa Blanca, Almería, SE Spain). For this purpose, we developed a dewfall measurement method, ‘The Combined Dewfall Estimation Method’ (CDEM). This method consists of a combination of the potential dewfall model, i. e. the single-source Penman–Monteith evaporation model simplified for water condensation, with information from leaf wetness sensors, rain gauge data, soil surface temperature and dew point temperature. To assess the reliability of the CDEM, dewfall was measured in situ using weighing microlysimeters during a period of 3 [*]months. Daily micrometeorological variables involved in a dewfall event were analysed in order to assess the significance of dewfall at this site. Dewfall condensation was recorded on 78 % of the nights during the study period. Average monthly dewfall duration was 9. 6 [*]±[*] 3. 2 [*]h per night. Average dewfall was 0. 17 [*]±[*] 0. 10 [*]mm per night and was mostly dependent on dewfall duration. Dewfall episodes were longer in late autumn and winter and shorter during spring. Annual dewfall represented the 16 %, 23 %, 15 % and 9 % of rainfall on 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Furthermore, when a wet period was compared to a dry one, the dewfall contribution to the water balance at the site was found to be 8 % and 94 %, respectively. Our results highlight the relevance of dewfall as a constant source of water in arid ecosystems, as well as its significant contribution to the local water balance, mainly during dry periods where it may represent the only source of water at the site.

This susceptibility has led to heavy economic investment and research efforts since the 1980 s, making this region a worldwide reference for understanding the hydrology and geomorphology of semiarid ecosystems. Runoff and soil erosion have been intensively studied throughout the last decades in various natural ecosystems {{as well as in}} abandoned farmlands. Research has considered a wide range of methods and spatial and temporal scales. This paper reviews the methods and data describing runoff generation and water erosion, synthesising the key processes involved, rates, thresholds and controlling factors from a scaledependent perspective. It also identifies the major gaps in current knowledge to provide recommendations for further research towards solutions that reduce the negative impacts of erosion. Research in SE Spain has contributed significantly {{to a better understanding of}} the effect of spatial and temporal scale on runoff and sediment yield measurements, and highlighted the important role of distinct erosion and sediment transport processes, hydrologic connectivity, spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall, the occurrence of extreme events and the impacts of land use changes.

40|$|Background One-quarter of the world’s {{population}} will suffer from depression symptoms {{at some point}} in their lives. Mental health services in developed countries are overburdened. Therefore, cost-effective interventions that provide mental health care solutions such as Web-based psychotherapy programs have been proposed. Objective The intent of the study was to identify expectations regarding Web-based psychotherapy for the treatment of depression in primary care among patients and health professionals that might facilitate or hinder its effects. Methods The expectations of untreated patients and health professionals were examined by means of interviews and focus groups. There were 43 participants (20 patients with mild and moderate levels of depression, 11 primary care physicians, and 12 managers; 22 of them for interviews and 21 for groups). A thematic content analysis from the grounded theory for interviews, and an analysis of the discursive positions of participants based on the sociological model for groups were performed. Interpretations were achieved by agreement between three independent analysts. Results All participants showed a good general acceptance of Web-based psychotherapy, appreciating possible advantages and improvements. Patients, physicians, and managers shared the same conceptualization of their expectations, although highlighting different aspects. Patients focused on the need for individualized and personalized interaction, while professionals highlighted the need for the standardization of the program. Physicians were concerned with extra workload, while managers were worried about optimizing cost-effectiveness. Conclusions Expectations of the different participants can conflict with each other. Finding a balanced position among them is needed if we are to harmoniously implement effective Web-based interventions for depression in routine clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: We sought to {{identify}} high-risk areas of pancreatic cancer incidence, and determine if clusters of persons diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were more likely to be located near arsenic-contaminated drinking water wells. METHODS: A total of 5, 707 arsenic samples were collected from December 2000 to May 2008 by the Florida Department of Health, representing more than 5, 000 individual privately owned wells. During that period, 0. 010 ppm (10 ppb) or greater arsenic levels in private well water were considered as the threshold based on standard of United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Spatial modeling was applied to pancreatic cancer cases diagnosed between 1998 - 2002 in Florida (n = 11, 405). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine if sociodemographic indicators, smoking history, and proximity to arsenic-contaminated well sites were associated with residence at the time of pancreatic cancer diagnosis occurring within versus outside a cluster. RESULTS: Spatial modeling identified 16 clusters in which 22. 6 % of all pancreatic cancer cases were located. Cases living within 1 mile of known arsenic-contaminated wells were significantly more likely to be diagnosed within a cluster of pancreatic cancers relative to cases living more than 3 miles from known sites (odds ratio = 2. 1 [95 % CI = 1. 9, 2. 4]). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water wells may be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. However, case-control studies are needed in order to confirm the findings of this ecological analysis. These cluster areas may be appropriate to evaluate pancreatic cancer risk factors, and to perform targeted screening and prevention studies.
