25|$|TfL's {{report in}} June 2007 {{found that the}} number of {{chargeable}} vehicles entering the zone had reduced by 30% (primarily cars and minicabs, although vans and lorries had decreased by 13%), while there were overall increases in the numbers of taxis, buses, and especially bicycles. The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9:30am and a peak immediately before and {{after the end of the}} charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times. The overall level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002. Year on year, counts of <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5–7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained. They had noted a small but pervasive long term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge. The conservative Bow Group noted that the main effect occurred after 11am.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 a {{proposal}} was unveiled by then-Mayor Jerry Sanders and philanthropist Irwin M. Jacobs {{to divert traffic}} away from the central Prado areas of the park, such as the Plaza de Panama {{in front of the}} Art Museum and the California Quadrangle in front of the Museum of Man, and restore the areas to pedestrian use. The plan would provide replacement parking via a two-level parking garage {{at the site of the}} current Spreckles Organ Pavilion parking lot. The plan also called for changes in access to the park via the Cabrillo Bridge. The bridge would become one-way, eastbound only, so that people could enter the park via the Cabrillo Bridge but could exit only via Park Boulevard. <b>Inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> would be deflected via a new bridge offramp through the current Alcazar Gardens parking lot toward the new parking garage. The Alcazar Gardens parking lot would be for disabled parking only and for loading and unloading of passengers. The new parking garage would house 750–900 cars and would be landscaped on top. The plan became controversial because of its alteration to the appearance of the bridge and the possibility of charging for parking in the parking garage. In July 2012 the City Council voted to proceed with the Jacobs plan. Construction was due to begin in October 2012 and be completed in time for the park's centennial in 2015. However, the scheduled start of construction was pushed back to February 2013 due to a legal challenge from the Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO). In February 2013 a judge voided the project, after which Jacobs withdrew his offer to finance it. Since the Park's master plan already called for removing the 67-space parking lot from the Plaza de Panama, the city went ahead with that portion of the proposal, removing all parking from the plaza and converting it into a pedestrian area with tree planters, seats, and tables.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of dynamic inter-domain traffic routing between a VDTN and a non-DTN (e. g., Internet). The inter-domain traffic can be classified as <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>traffic.</b> Our main contribution in this work is the intro-duction of several fault-tolerant routing algorithms for <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>traffic.</b> Using simulations, we compare {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithms in terms of required resources, packet delivery time, and blocking probability...|$|R
500|$|Just over a {{fifth of}} all {{terminal}} passengers are travelling on domestic routes only, whilst half are travelling between the UK {{and the rest of}} the European Union (EU). Of the latter, travel between the UK and Spain, France, Germany and Italy account for around half, with Spain almost matching the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Outside of the EU, the United States, the Far East, Switzerland and the Middle East together account for just over half of all passengers flying between the UK {{and the rest of the}} world, with the USA exceeding the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Air travel is the most popular mode of transport for visitors both to and from the UK. In 2005 it was used for 80 per cent of all visits by UK residents travelling overseas and by 74 per cent of all inbound visits. Just over a quarter of all passengers are travelling on business. The advent of no-frills carriers has had a significant effect on passenger travel profiles, with strong growth in business travel from regional airports, and increasing <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> generated for the purposes of non-UK residents visiting friends and relatives based in the UK. Whilst these carriers have been perceived to democratise air travel, providing the opportunity for lower income groups to travel more often, the main result is actually that middle and higher income groups travel more often, and often for shorter trips. [...] Researchers have been raising concern about the globally increasing hypermobility of individuals, involving frequent and often long distance air travel and the resulting environmental and climate impacts.|$|E
2500|$|Many urban freeways have entirely {{separate}} carriageways (and connecting ramps) to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes {{in such a}} configuration {{are often}} referred to as [...] "express lanes"). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not [...] "split" [...] into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. [...] Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic,</b> and offramps for outbound traffic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995 Southeastern International Corporation (SEI) {{acquired}} {{the line from}} Bay City to Wharton. Up to that time, outbound rail traffic consisted of grain shipments while <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> was mostly chicken feed and chemicals. On April 14, 1999, SEI petitioned the Surface Transportation Board to remove [...] of track from milepost 42.24 in Wharton to milepost 54.00 near Lane City. SEI complained that rail traffic dropped significantly in 1997 and that BNSF rates increased in 1998, forcing the company to incur a $117,081 loss. On August 2, 1999 the petition was approved, subject to environmental limitations.|$|E

Two grade separated junctions allow access to Limerick city at Annacotty via the R445 and at Ballysimon via the N24. The N20 Carew park link road was closed permanently to <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> from both the M7 and M20 in June 2010 to facilitate phase 2 of the Limerick southern ring road project. The dual carriageway was redesignated as M7 in 2009. Phase 2 of the Limerick Southern Ring Road opened {{as part of the}} N18 and was completed in July 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{structure}} above, where every topic (especially controversial ones) {{might have a}} thousand articles purporting to be *the* GNUpedia article about Sarah Palin, Stallman explicitly rejected {{the idea of a}} centralized website that would specify which article of those thousand was worth reading. Instead of an official catalogue, the plan was to rely on search engines at first (the reader would begin by googling [...] "gnupedia sarah palin"), and then eventually if necessary construct catalogues according to the same principles as articles were constructed. In Wikipedia, there is an official central website for each language (en.wikipedia.org), and an official catalogue of sorts (category-lists and lists-of-lists), but [...] search engines still provide about 60% of the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Like most {{commuter}} railroads in the Northeastern United States, MBTA is a NORAC Railroad {{and uses}} the Rulebook promulgated by that organization. Much of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is Rule 251 territory, as the tracks are signalled for movement in one direction of travel only. [...] During the 1990s, parts of the system, such as the Framingham/Worcester Line, were re-signalled to allow a more advanced mode of operations known as NORAC Rule 261, which allows trains to operate in either direction on both tracks where double track is available. [...] During the morning rush hour, both tracks can be simultaneously used for <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic,</b> allowing one train to make local stops while an express train overtakes the local train.|$|E
