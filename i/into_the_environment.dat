5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins {{first came}} to {{prominence}} with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme. With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Mercury also enters <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{through the}} {{improper}} disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, {{the amount of}} mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E

5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{about twice}} as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|Scandium has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even through in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment, {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E
