5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E
5|$|Thuppakkis {{first look}} poster was leaked on the {{internet}} on 30 April 2012, a day prior to its scheduled release on 1 May. The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, was criticised by social activists for violating the Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products. Murugadoss explained {{that it was only}} for promotional purposes and added that the film <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> scenes, claiming that even a small sequence featuring Vijay smoking had been deleted from the film.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E

5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|Most {{planning}} {{focused on}} the first phase, which {{was seen as the}} most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a graving dock capable of taking battleships at Pearl Harbor between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> base east of Malta. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific in case of a war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while Sydney was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.|$|E
5|$|The coastal lowlands, {{particularly}} surrounding Charleston and New Orleans {{and which}} also included {{much of the}} Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, more varied diet was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, {{as well as the}} French. Rice played a large part in the diet. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today. Although the English had an inherent disdain for French food as well as many of the native foods, the French <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> disdain for indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they expressed an appreciation for native ingredients and dishes.|$|E

5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion {{on the premise that}} the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held that it <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E
