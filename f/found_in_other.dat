40|$|This {{research}} describes {{about the}} values that are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> The <b>Other</b> Boleyn Girl Novel byPhilippa Gregory. There are four values that can be analyzed, those are religious value, ethical value, philosophical value, and aesthetical value. The formulation of problems in this research are: what religious values are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the novel of The Other Boleyn Girl, what ethical values are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the novel of The Other Boleyn Girl, what philosophical values are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the novel of The Other Boleyn Girl, and what aesthetical values are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the novel of The Other Boleyn Girl. This analysis used descriptive method because it is to describe {{the values that}} are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> The <b>Other</b> Boleyn Girl Novel. The data were taken from a novel entitled The Other Boleyn Girl. To collect the data, the writer uses some steps such as read and understand the content of Philippa Gregory novel The Other Boleyn Girl, find out the value <b>in</b> The <b>Other</b> Boleyn Girl novel, select and pick the data up referring to the problem by underlying it as the selected data. From the analysis there are ten religious values <b>found</b> <b>in</b> The <b>other</b> Boleyn Girl novel. There are twelve ethical values <b>found</b> <b>in</b> The <b>other</b> Boleyn Girl novel.

They can also be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E

5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards extreme length, the vaults of English cathedrals are low compared {{with many of}} those <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
5|$|English in England can {{be divided}} into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a {{division}} between the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> English varieties.|$|E

5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcanoes with which this eruptive type is hallmark. Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types {{of volcanic}} events, characterized by the effusive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lavas with low gaseous content. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions {{is less than half}} of that <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a shield volcano. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
