40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{statistical}} <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> {{of the single}} neural network (SNN) and the ensemble neural network (ENN) recognition efficiencies, when both the SNN and ENN are applied to recognize partial discharge (PD) patterns. Statistical fingerprints from the phased and amplitude resolved patterns of PDs, have been applied for training and testing the SNN and the ENN. Statistical mean and variances of the SNN and ENN recognition rates were compared and evaluated over several iterations {{in order to obtain}} an acceptable value. The results show that the ENN is generally more robust and often provides an improved recognition rate with higher mean value and lower variance when compared with the SNN. The result implies {{that it is possible to}} determine the accurate statistical <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> for the SNN and ENN recognition probability for correct diagnosis of PD fault...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of different methods of recognition based on image template matching. They are studied {{with respect to}} robustness, speed and precision of the estimated relative object position and orientation (pose). In this investigation, the matching problem was modeled in terms of PRISM sign bits of the Laplacian of Gaussian (SLOG) image correlation [Nishihara 84] and a practical, but sufficiently general, recognition scenario. In the analysis, the <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> on the 3 D pose estimate given the scenario are calculated. This is followed by an experimental study of the stability and false positive rate of SLOG matches under varying pose. The {{analysis is}} completed by an evaluation of each recognition approach {{with respect to the}} desired pose <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> and the experimentally determined performance of SLOG matching. Accelerated SLOG-based template matching, relational matching and image encoding all show promise as real-time matching modules, especially in the context [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} a mesh adaptation method for higher-order (p > 1) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the two-dimensional, compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method uses a mesh of triangular {{elements that are}} not required to conform to the boundary. This triangular, cut-cell approach permits anisotropic adaptation without the difficulty of constructing meshes that conform to potentially complex geometries. A quadrature technique is presented for accurately integrating on general cut cells. In addition, an output-based error estimator and adaptive method are presented, with emphasis on appropriately accounting for high-order solution spaces in optimizing local mesh anisotropy. Accuracy on cut-cell meshes is demonstrated by comparing solutions to those on standard boundary-conforming meshes. Adaptation results show that, for all test cases considered, p = 2 and p = 3 discretizations meet desired <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> using fewer degrees of freedom than p = 1. Furthermore, an initial-mesh dependence study demonstrates that, for sufficiently low <b>error</b> <b>tolerances,</b> the final adapted mesh is relatively insensitive to the starting mesh...|$|R

A strategy for beam tuning implementation is applied to this section, leading to specifying the complete set of <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> / beam measurements / correctors. A systematic and precise methodology in several steps is applied, leading to fairly distributing the error budget, from which correction schemes are studied, allowing to determine the necessary beam measurements and correctors...|$|R

Our method augments the spatial coordinate system by one dimension, representing time. We can then apply numerically robust predicates from computational geometry to detect intersections in space-time.

From this forward error analysis, we can identify and handle degenerate geometric configurations without resorting to user-tuned <b>error</b> <b>tolerances.</b> ...|$|R

We define in the rewriting-logic-based Real-Time Maude tool a method for the numerical approximation of the continuous dynamics specified by ordinary differential equations. We adapt the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4 / 5 method to define an adaptive-step-size technique that allows a more accurate approximation with less computational effort than fixed-step-size techniques. We also present experimental results for two thermal systems using different <b>error</b> <b>tolerances...</b>|$|R
50|$|There is an A-priori error {{bound for}} a single step with the Parker-Sochacki method. This allows a Parker-Sochacki program to {{calculate}} the step size that guarantees that the error is below any non-zero given tolerance. Using this calculated step size with an <b>error</b> <b>tolerance</b> of {{less than half of}} the machine epsilon yields a symplectic integration.|$|E

50|$|The {{main focus}} of QUADPACK is on {{automatic}} integration routines in which the user inputs the problem and an absolute or relative <b>error</b> <b>tolerance</b> and the routine attempts to perform the integration with an error no larger than that requested.

30|$|Our {{choice of}} a sharp-interface {{representation}} for dynamically propagating cracks presents several daunting challenges in numerical implementation. In general, we must align spacetime element boundaries with crack trajectories that nucleate and extend dynamically and whose paths are unknown prior to solution. In addition, numerical solutions for crack trajectories should depend only on the elastodynamic solution and on the given continuum model for crack extension. Thus, {{in the absence of}} stochastic nucleation effects, fracture surface trajectories should converge in the limit of mesh refinement (or vanishing <b>error</b> <b>tolerances</b> for adaptive meshing).|$|R

In fact, this is a very common and important issue since in many applications {{it is not possible to}} access noise-free data.
