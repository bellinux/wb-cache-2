5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E

Redshirt sophomore Zack Mills would lead the offense, with expectations high after showing flashes of brilliance coming off the bench in 2001. Larry Johnson would also become the featured back, after spending three seasons playing in a tailback-by-committee that had inconsistent production.

We don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> waiting for the results of the sanctions on Iran; we must immediately put heavy pressure on Iran until it cracks. Germany, as the strongest country in the European Union, must provide an answer {{to the needs of the}} European states that get oil from Iran, so that they will no longer be dependent on Iranian oil.” He also made an appeal to Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay to cancel her plans to visit Iran, stating that the visit would legitimize a regime that “maliciously violates human rights, executes its citizens and openly calls for genocide”.|$|E

Heldal-Lund and Bunker went to Beghe's house, where Beghe participated in an interview about his experiences as a Scientologist. Bunker published a three-minute portion of the three-hour interview to YouTube in mid-April 2008, and in the video Beghe calls Scientology [...] "very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution."

[...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who is much easier to like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E

[...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely {{hope that you will}} take the time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters.

500|$|The {{character}} of Milo J. Thatch was originally {{supposed to be}} a descendant of Edward Teach, otherwise known as Blackbeard the pirate.

The {{character of}} Molière was originally intended to be [...] "professorial" [...] but Chris Ure, a story artist, changed the concept to that of a [...] "horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs", said Wise. Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals, as solely action scenes would have to carry the film. Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on-screen character development: [...] "We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another's histories. An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed. That is not typically something we would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing, {{examined}} separately {{but ultimately}} equated with philosophy and rhetoric, is somewhat deprecated; it is stated that writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot {{be tailored to}} specific situations or students; the writer does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> examining his reader's soul {{in order to determine}} the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism. As such, the philosopher uses writing [...] "for the sake of amusing himself" [...] and other similar things rather than for teaching others. A writer, then, is only a philosopher when he can himself argue that his writing is of little worth, among other requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} their host nations, the émigrés were watched with a {{cautious}} eye. [...] Many locals were naturally weary of these foreigners {{who did not}} share their customs and who {{had been exposed to}} radical, violent, revolutionary principles. [...] Although there was initial hesitation, citizens quickly learned that these migrants were refugees, searching for tranquility and focusing on how to feed themselves and their family members, not agents sent by France to disrupt the political order. [...] While this generation of individuals did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> being very politically active, their presence in neighboring European countries and the United States caused a wrinkle in the fabric of society. [...] These thousands of men, women, and children had survived a popular uprising and {{would never be able to}} forget their experiences in revolutionary France, the uncertainty, turmoil, and promise of liberty.|$|E
2500|$|Pirates did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> {{building}} their ships; they were [...] "acquired." [...] As a result, a pirate captain {{had to be}} on the lookout for a vessel that would serve his purpose and procure the ship without harming it in such a way as to make it unfit for service. There is consensus among scholars that pirates would use both small vessels like a sloop or a full-rigged pinnace, as well as the larger slave ships (but not as often), and on rare occasions the warship. Along these lines, the naval historian David Cordingly categorized pirate attacks that had been reported along the North American seabord between 17101730. by the numbers of recorded attacks, with an overwhelming 55% involving sloops, 25% in the larger ships, 10% in brigs and brigantines, 5% in schooners, 3% in open sail-less boats, and 2% in snows.|$|E

2500|$|Rosecrans faced {{significant}} logistical challenges if {{he chose}} to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans {{would be forced to}} fight with his back against the mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside's advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans's delay that he ordered him to move forward immediately and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of [...] "recklessness, conceit and malice" [...] of Halleck's order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until at least August 17.|$|E
2500|$|The {{belief that}} free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the {{economist}} John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), {{who was a}} classical liberal in his early life, {{to say that this}} was a doctrine on which he was [...] "brought up" [...] and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s. In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the way economies have been managed since his work [...] "that we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment". A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of Norman Angell (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in The Great Illusion (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational (and therefore unlikely).|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous {{distributed}} {{a booklet}} outlining the Catholic Church's position on marriage, titled [...] "Don't mess with Marriage". It encouraged parents to lobby parliamentarians against same-sex marriage. An application {{was made by}} Martine Delaney, a Hobart transgender activist and Greens candidate, to Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Commission over the booklet. John Roskam, writing in the Australian Financial Review has said, [...] "A vote in a plebiscite or referendum, in which one side {{is not allowed to}} present its case, is not a legitimate vote. That's why both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage should be concerned by the complaint against Archbishop Porteous and the Catholic Church. Freedom of speech is fundamental to liberal democracy. Freedom of speech confers legitimacy on political outcomes". [...] The Anti-Discrimination Commission subsequently upheld the complaint. Senator Eric Abetz said that the church’s right to [...] "teach its flock" [...] its beliefs on marriage were being [...] "shut down". Janet Albrechtsen, writing in The Australian says, [...] "This is not one of those thorny cases of conflicting rights where you have to come down on one side or another. It’s not a case of either supporting same-sex marriage or supporting free speech. Here you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> both. [...] This is not about defending the Catholic bishops. The real issue is the emergence of yet another orthodoxy that is strangling free speech".|$|E

6000|$|Fanny was confused, {{but it was}} the {{confusion}} of discontent; while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious, or thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment {{in the course of the}} evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it. She would much rather not have been asked by him again so very soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to be avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William, he was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit. But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happy in knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the evening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with him was in continual perspective. She was happy even when they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his side, or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning. His mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose. [...] "I am worn out with civility," [...] said he. [...] "I have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say. But with you, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be talked to. Let us <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>of</b> silence." [...] Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure, from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly to be respected, and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son.|$|E
