And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E

500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> around the studio. We {{asked him to come}} freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of the}} sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E
500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> down".|$|E
500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Right Round" [...] {{uses the}} {{recurring}} pop rap themes of Flo Rida's music; specifically, similarities were noted between {{the song and}} [...] "Low" [...] (2007), with Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries calling [...] "Right Round" [...] its [...] "heir apparent". The song is [...] "" [...] and [...] "bass-heavy", according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. The lyrics discuss being in a strip club with friends and tossing money at a woman performing a striptease. Additionally, the chorus line [...] "You spin my head right round, right round / When you go down, when you go down, down" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} a reference to fellatio. Bruno Mars, co-writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song's chorus was referring to oral sex. Philip Lawrence, also co-writer, confessed the song was [...] "almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> out." [...] It was him, Bruno Mars, and Aaron Bay-Schuck. Bay-Schuck was playing to Bruno and Philip some tracks and wanted {{to come up with something}} big for Flo Rida, and they were just throwing out 80's ideas. The song's sexual themes have been compared to those of [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (2009) by Britney Spears.|$|E

[...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "It takes everything that's made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence -- strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss -- and carries them to the next stage." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "The truest measure of the movie is that eventually we forget we're watching a bunch of vehicles with faces and start to think of them as individual characters. It's quite an accomplishment, and perhaps one only possible by Pixar." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop -- and the film's great fun, if well under the level of the first Toy Story." [...] Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "While it's a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "While Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006's other animated films, it's several laps behind its Pixar siblings." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{during the last}} quarter of 2010 and was co-produced by Rob Hawkins and Aaron Sprinkle. Recording was done in two parts: first with Hawkins in Nashville, then with Sprinkle in Seattle. Frontwoman Ariel commented on working with the two: [...] "Their work selves {{could not have been more}} opposite. We worked with Rob first and it was like go, go, go from nine to five everyday solid and [...] we get to Aaron. He was just like so chilled. <b>Just</b> <b>hanging</b> out. He’s like, 'We’ll get to it when we get to it.' So, it was a lot of adjusting to the two extremes of work styles." ...|$|E

It was really bad, a really pathetic show and I {{remember}} them standing around the van really upset. Puffy was really uptight wanting to know where to get weed. Nobody was talking to him, I think he asked us because we were <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> around.

2500|$|James {{garnered}} {{attention the}} following year {{after the release of}} his Come to Daddy EP. The EP's title track was conceived as a death metal parody, with James stating: [...] "Come to Daddy came about while I was <b>just</b> <b>hanging</b> around my house, getting pissed and doing this crappy death metal jingle. Then it got marketed and a video was made, and this little idea that I had, which was a joke, turned into something huge. It wasn't right at all." [...] Accompanied with a music video directed by Chris Cunningham, he became disenchanted by its success. It was followed by [...] "Windowlicker", a critically and commercially successful single promoted with a music video also directed by Cunningham, which was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Video in 2000.|$|E

Reflecting on his performance at his seventh consecutive national championships, he said [...] "I think persistence plays a little part in it. Luck is remnant of desire. <b>Just</b> <b>hanging</b> in there". After making appearances at European meets, he prepared for the 200m at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics. After winning his heat and quarter-final races, he stepped up his performance to run 20.32seconds for second place in the semi-finals behind Frankie Fredericks. In the final he ran a personal record time of 20.18seconds and was rewarded with the bronze medal, having finished behind Fredericks and Johnson. Williams had won his first world medal at a major championships at the age of 29. He closed the season with a fifth place at the IAAF Grand Prix Final.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'.

When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
