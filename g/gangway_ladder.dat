60|$|Mildred looked vexed, {{and glanced}} involuntarily at Arthur who was {{steering}} the launch. For {{a moment she}} hesitated about going on, and glanced again at Arthur. The look seemed to inspire her, for she said nothing, and presently he brought the boat deftly alongside the <b>gangway</b> <b>ladder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And, hugely to the boatman's delight, the minx must needs put {{her fingers}} on the hard welts on my hands, and vow {{she would be a}} sailor and she were a man. But at length we came to a trim-built bark lying off Redriff Stairs, with the words [...] "Betsy, of London," [...] painted across her stern. In no time at all, Captain Paul was down the <b>gangway</b> <b>ladder</b> and at the water-side, too hand Dorothy out.|$|E
60|$|As Spike uttered this order, {{his foot}} {{was on the}} plank-sheer of the bulwarks, {{in the act of}} passing to the wharf again. On {{reaching}} the shore, he turned and looked intently at the revenue steamer, and his lips moved, as if he were secretly uttering maledictions on her. We say maledictions, as the expression of his fierce ill-favoured countenance too plainly showed that they could not be blessings. As for Mulford, there was still something on his mind, and he followed to the <b>gangway</b> <b>ladder</b> and ascended it, waiting for a moment when the mind of his commander might be less occupied to speak. The opportunity soon occurred, Spike having satisfied himself with the second look at the steamer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dissemination}} of Clayton Dissinger Mell's 1917 monograph on the subject, [...] "True Mahogany", {{resulted in the}} increased use of mahogany in ship construction: [...] "It is particularly suited for planking, waterways, bulwarks, rails, skylights and companions, bitts, <b>gangway</b> <b>ladders,</b> and other deck work. With the later employment of iron, steel and teak in shipbuilding, mahogany became far more important as a furniture wood, though it is still preferred to any other wood for the framework of small sailing vessels. Large sailing vessels with mahogany framework were sold for enormous prices and manufactured into fine furniture." ...|$|R
60|$|Nelson and Scot {{talked about}} London until the tug's whistle blew and they {{ran to the}} <b>gangway.</b> The <b>ladder</b> was hauled up, but Kit and Nelson went down a rope to the water-boat, and as she sheered off the {{engineer}} came to the steamer's rail.|$|R
50|$|Suitable {{means of}} access shall be {{provided}} from the building or ground level to the scaffold such as <b>gangway,</b> stairs and <b>ladder</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Evacuation was {{hampered}} by the overcrowding of lifeboats {{and the loss of}} several boats to fire. Some passengers were able to reach the water via the <b>gangways</b> and rope <b>ladders.</b> Two ships alerted by distress signals managed to save most of the others.|$|R
60|$|Riding on a comber's crest, they sped past Campeador's {{stern and}} Kit saw her side, pierced by lights, {{lengthen}} out. He jumped for the mast and dropped sail while Don Erminio shoved down the helm. The boat ran on towards the illuminated {{square of the}} gangway under the saloon-deck, and a rope came down. Then Kit, pulling out the mast, held her off with the hook and the steamer rolled her bilge out of the water. <b>Gangway</b> and <b>ladder</b> went up, her side looked like a high, slanted wall; and then she rolled back and buried the ladder in swirling foam.|$|R
5000|$|Typically a Delaware River and Bay pilot boards a ship as {{it passes}} Lewes, Delaware, {{entering}} the Delaware Bay, and guides the vessel up the bay and into the canal to Chesapeake City. A Maryland pilot then takes over and continues the ship's transit into the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore or Annapolis, Maryland. The procedure is reversed for eastbound ships. At Chesapeake City a [...] "changing of the pilots" [...] takes place, while the pilot launch maneuvers alongside a vessel as it continues its journey without stopping. The pilots use the ship's <b>gangway,</b> pilot <b>ladder,</b> or port entrance to climb aboard or leave the vessel.|$|R
40|$|While heading through Torres Strait with a pilot {{on board}} and with the running tide control of the tow was lost. The tug and barge passed {{either side of the}} Mecca {{navigation}} buoy resulting in minor damage to the buoy. Control was restored and the voyage continued. 20 / 01 / 2013 MA 201300005 4 : 05 UTC+ 9 No Newcastle Silver Voyager IMO No 9187576 Damage to ship or equipment While entering port the harbour pilot noted the combination pilot <b>ladder</b> <b>gangway</b> was damaged...|$|R
