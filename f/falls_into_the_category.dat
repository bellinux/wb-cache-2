5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E

To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin programs, {{both of which have}} been cancelled.

25|$|In 1991, Krisalis Software (developed by Simeon Pashley and Rob Hill) {{released}} the computer game, Hill Street Blues, {{based on the}} TV show. The game runs on the Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS platforms and places the player in charge of Hill Street Station and its surrounding neighborhood, {{with the aim of}} promptly dispatching officers to reported crimes, apprehending criminals, and making them testify at court. If certain areas have less serious crimes unresolved, such as bag-snatching, they soon escalate to more serious ones, such as murder in broad daylight.

500|$|The {{large scale}} {{reproduction}} of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time. Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, [...] "Look Mickey is broad comedy and <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of slapstick..." [...] In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight described {{the work as}} [...] "a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism". Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its [...] "linear clarity and colour", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale. A common misconception about Lichtenstein {{comes from the fact}} that in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons. Graham Bader wrote that [...] "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based." [...] Look Mickey is considered self-referential in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist.|$|E

[...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "A movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters' walls."

2500|$|The Atwater dissenting court opinion states, “A {{broad range}} of conduct <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of fine-only misdemeanors...

[...] Reasoning beyond {{the case of a}} misdemeanor arrest for a seat-belt-law violation, Justice O'Connor’s dissenting court opinion further cautions, “The Court’s error, however, does not merely affect disposition of this case. The per se rule that the Court creates has potentially serious consequences for the everyday lives of Americans.” [...] Justice O’Connor concludes the court's minority’s dissent by stating, “The Court neglects the Fourth Amendment’s express command in the name of administrative ease. [...] In so doing, it cloaks the pointless indignity that Gail Atwater (and her children) suffered with the mantle of reasonableness.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Aderca's {{original}} contribution to literature {{came in the}} form of lyric poetry. His five volumes of poems, published between 1910 and 1912, were noted by Crohmălniceanu for their [...] "intellectualized sensualism", with introspective methods that were ahead of their time. However, Crohmălniceanu also suggests that their cut section of the early 20th century Romanian lexis renders these works dated. Similarly, Călinescu discussed Aderca's love poetry as being dominated by [...] "suggestions" [...] and [...] "sensations", but without [...] "sentiment". The most important of Aderca's lyrical work, he notes, was to be found elsewhere, in [...] "pantheistic" [...] poems rather like those by Ion Barbu, where focus shits toward the great expanses of the cosmos or the mineral world. As noted by Pârvulescu, Aderca's other contributions in the field, in Versuri pentru Monica, <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of [...] "society games" [...] that merely exercise his versification skills.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 the Government Pension Fund of Norway {{recommended}} {{the exclusion of}} several companies producing cluster bombs or components. EADS and its sister company EADS Finance BV were among them, arguing that EADS manufactures [...] "key components for cluster bombs". The criticism was centred around TDA, {{a joint venture between}} EADS and ThalesS.A. TDA produced the mortar ammunition PRCargo, which can be considered cluster ammunition, however this definition has since been successfully battled by EADS. EADS and its subsidiaries are now regarded as fulfilling all the conditions of the Ottawa Treaty. According to the new point of view, no product of EADS or its subsidiaries <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of antipersonnel mines as defined by the Ottawa Treaty ("landmines under the Ottawa Treaty"). In April 2006, the fund declared that the basis for excluding EADS from investments related to production of cluster munitions is no longer valid, however its shareholding of MBDA means the fund still excludes EADS due to its indirect involvement in nuclear weapons production.|$|E

Armiger was musical {{director for the}} series, he provided backing vocals, lead guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, drums and lyrics. He also produced the two soundtrack albums, Sweet & Sour – TV Soundtrack and Sweet & Sour Volume Two, and three singles, [...] "Sweet and Sour" [...] (which peaked at No.13 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart), [...] "Glam to Wham" [...] and [...] "No Focus". Also in that year he joined Stephen Cummings Band on guitar and vocals; and in August he produced Cummings' debut solo album, Senso, released on Regular Records, with the related single, [...] "Gymnasium", which peaked at No.27.

2500|$|There {{appear to}} have been several motivations for composers to use quintuple time: firstly to {{demonstrate}} technical skill, as in the Tye and Correa de Arauxo examples, and secondly to produce an atmospheric effect, or to suggest unease or unusual excitement, as in Handel's Orlando. In the 19th century, a third motivation arises with the rise of nationalistic music, which often invokes folk-music elements. In any case, quintuple time becomes much more frequent (though still not common) in the 19th century. Early examples include Fugue 20 (Allegretto) from Anton Reicha’s Trente-six fugues for piano (1805), the tenor aria [...] "Viens, gentille dame" [...] from act 2 of François-Adrien Boieldieu’s opera La dame blanche (1825), and the third movement (Larghetto, con molta espressione), from Frédéric Chopin’s Piano Sonata No. 1 in C minor, Op. 4 (1828). Although Reicha's fugue probably <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of technical skill, the composer does mention taking {{as a model for the}} meter the Alsatian Kochersberger Tanz. Nationalistic influence is clearer in the operas of the Russian composer Mikhail Glinka. The [...] "Nuptial chorus and scene" [...] from act 3 of the opera A Life for the Tsar (1834–36) was the first time a composer of art music set the pentasyllabic hemistichs of Russian wedding songs in quintuple meter instead of adapting it to a more conventional one. In his next opera, Ruslan and Ludmila (1837–42) Glinka repeated the effect in the opening of act 1, where the chorus sings an epithalamium to Lel’, the Slavonic god of love, once again in quintuple time. Later Russian examples are found in Tchaikovsky's folk-song settings: Fifty Russian Folk Songs for piano four-hands (1868–69), Children's Ukrainian and Russian Folksongs (book 1: 1872, book 2: 1877), and Sixty-Six Russian Folk Songs for voice and piano (1872), where quintuple meter is notated by regularly alternating signatures, usually [...] and [...]|$|E
