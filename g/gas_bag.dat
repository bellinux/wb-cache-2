5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane.|$|E

They used alternate strips of red and white silk, but the discolouration of the varnishing/rubberising process left a red and yellow result.|$|E

On 21 February 1918, he took up his balloon busting again, downing a <b>gas</b> <b>bag.</b> By {{the time he left}} Jasta 13 at the end of April, he was a double ace. His six victories over balloons made him an ace on them alone.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} hydrogen would be a suitable lifting agent for balloons having studied the work of Robert Boyle's Boyle's Law which was published 100 years earlier in 1662, and of his contemporaries Henry Cavendish, Joseph Black and Tiberius Cavallo. He designed the craft and then worked {{in conjunction with the}} Robert brothers, Anne-Jean and Nicolas-Louis, to build it in their workshop at the Place des Victoires in Paris, The brothers invented the methodology for the lightweight, airtight <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> by dissolving rubber in a solution of turpentine and varnished the sheets of silk that were stitched together to make the main envelope. They used alternate strips of red and white silk, but the discolouration of the varnishing/rubberising process left a red and yellow result.|$|E
25|$|The Morning Post was {{designed}} by Henri Julliot to the same principles as the earlier Lebaudy République and Lebaudy Patrie but was larger and faster. The envelope was made of panels of waterproof canvas with two valves at the bottom to allow the hydrogen to be released, either automatically or by hand. An additional manual valve {{on the top of}} the envelope could be used to completely deflate the envelope. Two long quick-release panels were also built into the envelope for emergency deflation. The <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> had three ballonets, one at the front, one in the centre and one at the rear: the front and rear ballonets could be used to fly the airship up or down. Two centrigual fans were used to inflate the ballonets. Small fixed vertical and horizontal stabilisers were mountes at the rear of the enveleope.|$|E
2500|$|Aeros has {{developed}} a technology to avoid the need for ballast, which they call [...] "control of static heaviness (COSH)". The main <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> is inflated with helium to create lift for takeoff, then on landing some of the gas is re-compressed into a storage tank to partially deflate the <b>gas</b> <b>bag</b> and reduce lift.|$|E
50|$|An airship or {{dirigible}} balloon {{is a type}} of aerostat or {{lighter-than-air aircraft}} that can navigate through the air under its own power. Aerostats gain their lift from large <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air.|$|R

2500|$|Hindenburg had a {{duralumin}} structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads {{along its}} length, with 16 cotton <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced {{to each other}} by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped {{with a mixture of}} reflective materials intended to protect the <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins.

The method of preparing and making gas-tight joins in the skins was known only to a family from Alsatia called Weinling who were employed by the RE for many years. The British had a monopoly on the technique until around 1912 when the Germans adopted the material for the internal <b>gas</b> <b>bags</b> of the [...] "Zeppelin" [...] rigid airships, exhausting the available supply: about 200,000 sheets were used for a typical World War I Zeppelin, while the USS Shenandoah needed 750,000 sheets.

50|$|A {{rigid airship}} has a rigid {{framework}} covered by an outer skin or envelope. The interior contains {{one or more}} <b>gas</b> <b>bags,</b> cells or balloons to provide lift.

Preparation for flight was regularly reported by the national press. Explorer lifted off at 6:45, July 28, 1934, an event broadcast live over the radio and watched by 30,000 spectators on site.

50|$|While {{elevators}} and swivelling propellers provide {{fine control}} of altitude, larger changes of height {{used to be}} controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude.
