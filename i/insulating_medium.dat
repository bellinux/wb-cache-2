One of the {{inductive}} apparatus already described (1187, &c.) had a hemispherical cup of shell-lac introduced, which {{being in}} the interval between the inner bull and the lower hemisphere, nearly occupied the space there; consequently when the apparatus was charged, the lac was the dielectric or <b>insulating</b> <b>medium</b> through which the induction took place in that part. When this apparatus was first charged with electricity (1198.) {{up to a certain}} intensity, as 400°, measured by the COULOMB'S electrometer (1180.), it sank much faster from that degree than if it had been previously charged to a higher point, and had gradually fallen to 400°; or than it would do if the charge were, by a second application, raised up again to 400°; all other things remaining the same. Again, if after having been charged for some time, as fifteen or twenty minutes, it was suddenly and perfectly discharged, even the stem having all electricity removed from it (1203.), then the apparatus being left to itself, would gradually recover a charge, which in nine or ten minutes would rise up to 50° or 60°, and in one instance to 80°.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{fundamental}} investigations of partial discharge behaviour of typical defects of PE/XLPE-insulated medium voltage cables at test voltages with variable shape and frequency.

Another ever-present {{question}} {{on my mind}} has been, whether electricity has an actual and independent existence as a fluid or fluids, or was a mere power of matter, like what we conceive of the attraction of gravitation. If determined either way {{it would be an}} enormous advance in our knowledge; and as having the most direct and influential bearing on my notions, I have always sought for experiments which would in any way tend to elucidate that great inquiry. It was in attempts to prove the existence of electricity separate from matter, by giving an independent charge of either positive or negative power only, to some one substance, and the utter failure of all such attempts, whatever substance was used or whatever means of exciting or evolving electricity were employed, that first drove me to look upon induction as an action of the particles of matter, each having both forces developed in it in exactly equal amount. It is this circumstance, in connection with others, which makes me desirous of placing the remarks on absolute charge first, in the order of proof and argument, which I am about to adduce in favour of my view, that electric induction is an action of the contiguous particles of the <b>insulating</b> <b>medium</b> or dielectric[A].|$|E
6000|$|... 1195. The {{inductive}} apparatus described is evidently a Leyden phial, {{with the}} advantage, however, {{of having the}} dielectric or <b>insulating</b> <b>medium</b> changed at pleasure. The balls h and B, with the connecting wire i, constitute the charged conductor, upon the surface of which all the electric force is resident by virtue of induction (1178.). Now though the largest portion of this induction is between the ball h and the surrounding sphere aa, yet the wire i and the ball B determine {{a part of the}} induction from their surfaces towards the external surrounding conductors. Still, as all things in that respect remain the same, whilst the medium within at oo, may be varied, any changes exhibited by the whole apparatus will in such cases depend upon the variations made in the interior; and these were the changes I was in search of, the negation or establishment of such differences being the great object of my inquiry. I considered that these differences, if they existed, would be most distinctly set forth by having two apparatus of the kind described, precisely similar in every respect; and then, different insulating media being within, to charge one and measure it, and after dividing the charge with the other, to observe what the ultimate conditions of both were. If insulating media really had any specific differences in favouring or opposing inductive action through them, such differences, I conceived, could not fail of being developed by such a process.|$|E
6000|$|... 1331. Again, {{to return}} to this {{beautiful}} experiment in the various forms which may be given to it: the forces are not all in the wire (after they have left the Leyden jar) during the whole time (1328.) occupied by the discharge; they are disposed in part through the surrounding dielectric under the well-known form of induction; and if that dielectric be air, induction takes place from the wire through the air to surrounding conductors, until {{the ends of the}} wire are electrically related through its length, and discharge has occurred, i.e. for the time during which the middle spark is retarded beyond the others. This is well shown by the old experiment, in which a long wire is so bent that two parts (Plate VIII. fig. 115.), a, b, near its extremities shall approach within a short distance, as a quarter of an inch, of each other in the air. If the discharge of a Leyden jar, charged to a sufficient degree, be sent through such a wire, by far the largest portion of the electricity will pass as a spark across the air at the interval, and not by the metal. Does not the middle part of the wire, therefore, act here as an <b>insulating</b> <b>medium,</b> though it be of metal? and is not the spark through the air an indication of the tension (simultaneous with induction) of the electricity in the ends of this single wire? Why should not the wire and the air both be regarded as dielectrics; and the action at its commencement, and whilst there is tension, as an inductive action? If it acts through the contorted lines of the wire, so it also does in curved and contorted lines through air (1219, 1224, 1231.), and other insulating dielectrics (1228); and we can apparently go so far in the analogy, whilst limiting the case to the inductive action only, as to show that amongst insulating dielectrics some lead away the lines of force from others (1229.), as the wire will do from worse conductors, though in it the principal effect is no doubt due to the ready discharge between the particles whilst in a low state of tension. The retardation is for the time insulation; {{and it seems to me}} we may just as fairly compare the air at the interval a, b (fig. 115.) and the wire in the circuit, as two bodies of the same kind and acting upon the same principles, as far as the first inductive phenomena are concerned, notwithstanding the different forms of discharge which ultimately follow[A], as we may compare, according to Coulomb's investigations[B] different lengths of different insulating bodies required to produce the same amount of insulating effect.|$|E

40|$|Solid {{insulation}} materials in gas <b>insulated</b> <b>medium</b> (MV) and high voltage (HV) equipment often act as weak elements {{in terms of}} electric breakdown, for instance because the insulator surface may facilitate propagation of discharges. The understanding of the fundamental physics of discharges along surfaces is still poor {{and has to be}} improved in order to enable knowledge-based design rules for MV and HV equipment. In this research work, the streamer-like initial phase of electric breakdown along an insulator surface will be investigated. A setup was designed and built that enables studying of discharges along the surface of solid dielectric samples. A tunable high voltage pulse is generated by triggering a spark gap that discharges a charged capacitor. The pulse is supplied to a needle inside a gas-filled vessel, causing inception of streamers. Pressure and gas composition inside the vessel can be controlled. The dielectric samples can be placed at various positions between the needle and a grounded plate, situated 155 mm below the needle. Epoxy-resin material with different fillers are used to vary the dielectric permittivity. An ICCD-camera is used to capture images of the resulting discharges. By gating the intensifier at frequencies up to 100 MHz we are able to stroboscopically visualize propagation of the discharge, providing us with a spatially and temporally resolved velocity profile of the streamers. Results indicate that streamers propagate with an increased velocity along the dielectric surface upon contact. If the gas is air, surface streamers are typically a factor ~ 2 - 3 faster than bulk gas streamers for various pressures and pulse voltages.

50|$|A {{streamer}} discharge, {{also known}} as filamentary discharge, {{is a type of}} transient electrical discharge. Streamer discharges can form when an <b>insulating</b> <b>medium</b> (for example air) is exposed to a large potential difference. When the electric field created by the applied voltage is sufficiently large, accelerated electrons strike air molecules with enough energy to knock other electrons off them, ionizing them, and the freed electrons go on to strike more molecules in a chain reaction. These electron avalanches (Townsend discharges) create ionized, electrically conductive regions in the air near the electrode creating the electric field. The space charge created by the electron avalanches gives rise to an additional electric field.This field can enhance the growth of new avalanches in a particular direction.Then the ionized region grows quickly in that direction, forming a finger-like discharge called a streamer.|$|E
