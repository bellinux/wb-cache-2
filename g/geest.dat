25|$|Contship Overland was a {{division}} of Contship Containerlines operating {{at the forefront of}} Europe's intermodal industry. The company had offices in Felixstowe, Glasgow and Milan, and worked with partners in Spain and Greece, providing rail freight solutions to key markets and road freight options where required by customers. Its main business consisted of intermodal container and swapbody traffic between the UK and Italy, mostly by rail via the Channel Tunnel. After approximately ten years in business, Contship Overland was sold to the Rotterdam-based intermodal transport operator <b>Geest</b> North Sea Line with effect of 1 October 2001.|$|E
25|$|Soon the German Christians in the presbytery {{fell out}} with each other, some siding with Hartig (now {{representing}} the radical Thuringian {{branch of the}} German Christians), others with Horn, blaming each other to use psychological terror and authoritarianism against each other. Horn, preserving some dignity as a pastor, requested the presbytery to reaccept Martha Fränkel (then living in Kochstraße 62), a parishioner of Jewish descent. <b>Geest</b> sided with the somewhat more moderate Horn, but in 1940 the consistory of the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province within the old-Prussian Church decided to completely dissolve the presbytery of the united congregation of Jerusalem Church and New Church, for it had turned – with all its quarrels – incapacitated to function.|$|E
25|$|Lüneburg Heath has {{extensive}} {{areas of}} heathland, typical {{of those that}} covered most of the North German countryside until about 1800, but which have almost completely disappeared in other areas. The heaths were formed after the Neolithic period by overgrazing of the once widespread forests on the poor sandy soils of the <b>geest,</b> as this slightly hilly and sandy terrain in northern Europe is called. The Lüneburg Heath is therefore a historic cultural landscape. The remaining areas of heath are kept clear mainly through grazing, especially by a North German breed of moorland sheep called the Heidschnucke. Due to its unique landscape, Lüneburg Heath is a popular tourist destination in North Germany.|$|E
25|$|On the {{southern}} {{boundary of the}} Low German house region, {{as well as the}} multi-sided farmsteads, there is the historical Ernhaus type of farm, also referred to as the Middle German house (mitteldeutsches Haus) or Frankish farmstead (fränkisches Haus). A northern neighbour of the Fachhallenhaus in the immediate vicinity of the North Sea coast was the Gulf house (Gulfhaus) or Frisian farmstead (Ostfriesenhaus) which is found in the marsh regions and, later, also on the <b>geest</b> areas of West Flanders, Frisia as far as Schleswig-Holstein (known there as a Haubarg). It had replaced the Old Frisian farmhouse in the 16th century. Another northern neighbour in the Southern Schleswig area is the Geesthardenhaus, which also occurs in the whole of Jutland and hence is also called the Cimbrian farmhouse.|$|E
25|$|Porta Coeli never {{developed}} a sustainable farming of its own. Its landed estates and other revenue-yielding assets did not form a closed compound but were dispersed {{in the central}} and northeastern part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (Stade <b>Geest</b> and Bremian Elbe Marshes). Like many other nunneries Porta Coeli lived of feudal leases, tithes and other dues, earlier often in kind, such as also socage and serjeanty. Porta Coeli let out most of its farmland on socage to farmers, and ran only smaller and closer parts of all its lands through its Vorwerke using labour of farmers subject to serjeanty. The Vorwerke were managed by the (ad)vocate (Vogt). Besides his military task of protecting, his task was to prevent farmers from poaching, pasturing on nunnery's land, forbidden lumbering and peat-cutting and of pursuing culprits, collecting the dues and leases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of April 1632, after the Swedish victory in the Battle of Rain, the Imperial and Leaguist forces, {{altogether}} 23,000 men billeted in the area of Himmelpforten, Stade, Buxtehude, the Stade <b>Geest</b> and the Bremian Elbe Marshes, left the prince-archbishopric and with them the foreign Catholic clergy. Now the allied troops of Sweden, the city of Bremen and the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen under Achatius Tott captured the prince-archbishopric and John Frederick resumed his office as its Administrator regnant. Highly indebted as he was after recruiting and arming his troops allied with the Swedes, he brought in a bill to confiscate all the monasteries in the prince-archbishopric. However, on 20 and 28May 1633O.S. on the diet in Basdahl the estates of the prince-archbishopric rejected that, but allowed the Administrator regnant to collect the revenues of the monasteries until the Thirty Years' War would end.|$|E
25|$|The heath and its {{surrounding}} area belong to those regions of the North German Plain in which the hunter culture of the Mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by Neolithic farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of <b>geest</b> on Lüneburg Heath. This {{was a result of}} the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the common heather (Calluna vulgaris), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over {{a long period of time}} the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the migration period, the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{analyses}} {{show that}} the dry <b>geest</b> soils of North Germany have been cultivated since about 3000 BC. Clearance by fire and the cultivation of crops on the Pleistocene sandy soils quickly led however to soil degradation. So the land cleared by fire could only {{be used for a}} short time. The settlements moved frequently and woods elsewhere were cleared. Even at that time the first Calluna (heather) heaths appeared (see above). Evidence of relatively dense settlement is found especially in Uelzen district. On Lüneburg Heath there are numerous Megalithic sites and tumuli from the Neolithic and the early Bronze Age. The most famous are the Oldendorfer Totenstatt (Oldendorf Gravesite) and the Sieben Steinhäuser (Seven Stone Houses). But even in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve {{there are more than a}} thousand tumuli, especially near Nieder- and Oberhaverbeck. The largest of these tumuli is the so-called Prince's Grave (Fürstengrab). Also near Wilsede there is the well-known stone and juniper group known as Hannibal's Grave (Hannibals Grab).|$|E
25|$|Hulsker {{called the}} signed drawing The Public Soup Kitchen (F1020a below) {{important}} and attractive. Van Gogh and his contemporary George Hendrik Breitner had sketched {{together at a}} soup kitchen in the <b>Geest</b> (it is not known which of the several possibilities it was). After going to the trouble and expense of installing shutters in his windows to adjust the light and to recreate the scene itself in his studio, van Gogh was able to study his models at leisure. In this way {{he was able to}} introduce more chiaroscuro (light and dark) in his drawing, which he executed with the natural ('mountain') chalk that Theo had sent him and whose properties he lauds in his letters. All the models are from Sien's family: her mother and baby on the left, her sister, back turned, and her daughter, hair cropped as a precaution against lice, in the center, with Sien herself, superbly executed in profile, on the right. The watercolor F1020b (below) is much less successful as van Gogh himself acknowledged, blaming the paper in part for not being right for the job.|$|E

Coal exports declined after World War I (1914–18). Strikes and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused further problems. The docks proved useful during World War II (1939–45). They were nationalised soon after the war ended. The <b>Geest</b> company used the docks to import West Indian bananas from 1959 until the 1980s. From 1957, many obsolete railway wagons were scrapped and cut up at the former West Pond site between Barry and Barry Island but many former Great Western steam locomotives were withdrawn from service and stored on sidings beside West Pond sidings area and more than 200 of them were recovered by enthusiasts for conservation or restoration. Parts of the docks have become industrial estates such as the Atlantic Trading Estate, and {{the area around the}} first dock, now called The Waterfront, has been redeveloped for residential and commercial use. The second dock is still active and generally handles chemicals and timber.|$|E

So meager were her earnings, she turned to prostitution for a better income. By the age of 32, the unmarried Sien had given birth to four children, two of whom lived: Maria Wilhelmina, born about 1877, and Willem, born July 1882.
