5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to <b>have</b> <b>food</b> on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will <b>have</b> <b>food</b> and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable, but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, {{resulting in the}} end of the partnership in April 2015. SeatMe was reworked into the current [...] "Yelp Reservations" [...] feature. In 2013, features to <b>have</b> <b>food</b> ordered and delivered were added to Yelp as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores and make appointments at spas. Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.

500|$|During {{the time}} the United States was the most {{dominant}} in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. Food Power was not really thought about. [...] However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food {{has come to the}} surface. In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged. The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food. [...] While others nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations, are beginning to <b>have</b> <b>food</b> shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power. This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food. [...] It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries. Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat. Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes. [...] The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries. [...] Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate.|$|E
