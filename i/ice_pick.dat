She wakes up bound to a dentist's chair, with her kidnapper brandishing an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> and speaking in German. Mulder returns to Washington, D.C. to digitally analyze the photos and finds no evidence that they were doctored. By closely examining the photos, he finds the face of an old man as well as the shadow of the kidnapper, who appears to be abnormally tall.|$|E
25|$|Reles's small {{physical}} size did {{not deter}} him from committing ruthless acts of violence. When carrying out murders, his {{weapon of choice}} was an <b>ice</b> <b>pick,</b> which he would ram through his victim's ear right into the brain.

25|$|Three weeks later, on April 29, while {{parked in}} the grounds of a Stanton supermarket, Bonin and Butts lured a 19-year-old {{employee}} named Darin Kendrick into Bonin's van on the pretext of selling the youth drugs. Kendrick was driven to Butts' apartment, where he was overpowered and bound by both men. In addition to enduring sodomy and partial ligature strangulation, Kendrick was forced to drink hydrochloric acid by Bonin, causing caustic chemical burns to his mouth, chin, stomach and chest. Butts then drove an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> into Kendrick's ear, causing a fatal wound to the youth's cervical spinal cord. His body was discarded behind a warehouse close to the Artesia Freeway, with the <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> Butts had driven into his skull still protruding from his ear.|$|E

25|$|Cricket {{catching}} extends over August and September. Crickets {{are most}} active between midnight and dawn. They are agile creatures, and when distressed they quickly hide into burrows or improvised shelter, or hop and even fly away. Typical Chinese crickets hide underground, so the catcher's first {{task is to}} either force or lure the insect out of its hideout. Trappers from the North of China use lighted candles to lure insects into their traps. Trappers from the South use iron cage-like lanterns or fire baskets to carry smoldering charcoal which forces insects to flee from the smoke. Other ways of forcing the insect out involve flooding their burrows or setting up juicy fruit baits. The Ningjin trappers use a simple tool, similar to an <b>ice</b> <b>pick,</b> for digging earth and poking under stones.|$|E
25|$|Norris {{agreed to}} return to the San Gabriel Mountains to search for the bodies of the girls to whose {{abduction}} and murder he had confessed to assisting in. In each instance, Norris brought detectives to the area where he and Bittaker had disposed of their victims' bodies. Despite extensive searches of the areas where he stated the bodies of Lucinda Schaefer and Andrea Hall had been discarded, their bodies were never found. Nonetheless, on February 9, 1980, the skeletalized bodies of Jacqueline Leah Lamp and Jackie Doris Gilliam were found {{at the bottom of a}} canyon, alongside a dry river bed. The bodies were scattered over an area measuring hundreds of feet in diameter. An <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> was still lodged in the skull of Jackie Gilliam; the skull of Jacqueline Leah Lamp bore multiple indentationsâ€”evidence of the numerous hammer blows Norris had stated he inflicted.|$|E
50|$|Removing ice is more difficult. Snow blowers {{are usually}} {{ineffective}} at clearing <b>ice.</b> <b>Picks</b> are sometimes used, but a solid spade can break through most ice.

25|$|Gilliam and Lamp {{were driven}} to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days, being bound and gagged between {{repeated}} instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In {{the first of three}} instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> and using vise grip pliers to tear off part of one nipple.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{days after}} Bonin had been {{released}} from custody, on March 14, he abducted and killed an 18-year-old Van Nuys youth named Ronald Gatlin. Gatlin was abducted shortly after he had left a friend's home. He was beaten, sodomized and suffered several deep, perforating <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> wounds to the ear and neck before being strangled with a ligature. Gatlin's body, bound hand and foot, was found the following day {{in the city of}} Duarte. One week later, on March 21, Bonin lured a 14-year-old named Glenn Barker into his van as the youth hitchhiked to school. Barker was also raped, beaten and strangled to death with a ligature; his body also bore evidence of numerous burns to the neck which had been inflicted with a lit cigarette. In addition, Barker had been violated with foreign objects which had extensively distended his rectum. At 4 p.m. the same day, a 15-year-old named Russell Rugh was abducted from a bus stop in Garden Grove. Rugh was bound, beaten and strangled to death after an estimated eight hours of captivity before his body was discarded alongside that of Glenn Barker in Cleveland National Forest. The youths' nude bodies were found on March 23.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen {{were put}} on trial {{separately}} {{for the murder of}} racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> and had the frame of a slot machine tied to his body, which was found in Swan Lake on July 31, 1937. After the Sage murder, believing he was also going to be killed, Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. According to the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed the steering wheel and wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker wiping the icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was walking home from a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker's orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who was a suspect in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.|$|E
5000|$|Amarro Fiamberti was an Italian {{psychiatrist}} who first performed a transorbital lobotomy (by accessing the frontal lobe {{of the brain}} through the orbits) in 1937. The technique remained rarely practised until his reports were discovered by his contemporary, the American neurologist Walter Freeman, who improved the surgical technique, initially by using <b>ice</b> <b>picks</b> (hence the name [...] "ice pick lobotomy") and later employing more refined equipment.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Ferreira walking towards a blue {{projector}} screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black {{jacket and a}} transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly {{as a group of}} voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that manâ€”her apparent love interestâ€”as they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> on his face; in response, he slaps her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man kisses her, while her love interest looks surprised. The latter walks away and finds a woman with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. The next morning, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the <b>ice</b> <b>pick,</b> which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, the man, who is lying on a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word [...] "not", dripping blood as well. Spins Marc Hogan found the video too [...] "focused on Ferreira's model" [...] abilities to [...] "complement the song effectively".|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "You're Not the One" [...] {{was directed by}} Grant Singer, and written and co-produced by V magazine senior editor Patrik Sandberg. Ferreira announced plans to shoot a visual for the track in July 2013, and stated that Singer would direct it. According to Singer, the video took nine months to craft; it was originally supposed to be filmed in Berlin so it had a [...] "Christiane F. vibe", however this did not occur due to unknown reasons. Sandberg suggested the twist ending {{and the use of}} an <b>ice</b> <b>pick,</b> which he thought should be used as a [...] "narrative tool" [...] instead of just a prop. Singer described the overall video as [...] "sinister and pop". The video was filmed at The Lash, a nightclub in Los Angeles, where Ferreira is seen dancing in front of multicolored lasers.|$|E
500|$|Fritz the Cat was {{the first}} {{animated}} feature film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film's distributor capitalized on the rating in the film's advertising material, which touted the film as being [...] "X rated and animated!" [...] Released on 12 April 1972, it opened simultaneously in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. The film {{went on to become}} a worldwide hit, grossing over $100 million (USD) and was the most successful independent animated feature ever. The film is credited with extending Crumb's reputation beyond the underground comix scene. Crumb disliked how the film presented the sexual content and politics, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic". Following the film's release, The People's Comics published the story [...] "Fritz the Cat 'Superstar'", in which Crumb satirized Bakshi and Krantz. Crumb portrayed Fritz in a script conference for a fictional sequel Fritz Goes to India. The strip ends with a neurotic ex-girlfriend killing Fritz. She stabs him in the back of the head with an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> due to Fritz's overt sexism.|$|E
500|$|Bundy {{was arrested}} on August 16, 1975 in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb, by a Utah Highway Patrol officer who {{observed}} him cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours, then fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car. The officer noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an <b>ice</b> <b>pick,</b> and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, {{he had found the}} handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items. However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, and a brochure advertising the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful (where Debra Kent had disappeared), but nothing sufficiently incriminating to hold him. He was released on his own recognizance. (Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.) ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{important}} innovations that emerged that allowed hunting {{to be more}} efficient. Harpoon mounted <b>ice</b> <b>picks</b> were used for seal hunting, as well as ivory plugs and mouthpieces for inflating harpoon line floats, which enabled them to recover larger sea mammals when dispatched.

5000|$|Vests {{designed}} for bullets offer little protection against blows from sharp implements, such as knives, arrows or <b>ice</b> <b>picks,</b> or from bullets manufactured of non-deformable materials, e.g., those containing a steel core instead of lead. This {{is because the}} impact force of these objects stays concentrated in a relatively small area, allowing them to puncture the fiber layers of most bullet-resistant fabrics. [...] By contrast, stab vests provide better protection against sharp implements, but are generally less effective against bullets.|$|R

2500|$|Bittaker and Norris {{then drove}} Hall {{to a third}} location, where Bittaker again walked Hall up a nearby hill, this time as Norris drove to a nearby store to {{purchase}} alcohol. When Norris returned, Bittaker was alone and in possession of two further Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall; both of which depicted Hall's face in expressions Norris later described as being of [...] "sheer terror" [...] as she begged for her life to be spared. Bittaker told Norris that he had informed Hall he intended to kill her and challenged her to give him as many reasons as she could why she {{should be allowed to}} live, before thrusting an <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> through her ear into her brain. He then turned her body over and thrust the <b>ice</b> <b>pick</b> into her other ear, stamping upon it until the handle broke. Noting that Andrea Hall was still alive and conscious, Bittaker then manually strangled her to death before throwing her body over a cliff.|$|E
