Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to interpellate Nicolae L.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the Prague Spring, on 20 August 1968, the Soviet Army, {{together}} {{with most of}} their Warsaw Pact allies, invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion {{was followed by a}} wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written <b>in</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E

5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information <b>in</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} afterwards, his main {{literary}} output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, {{most of which}} were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks <b>in</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga. In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem {{for the rest of his}} life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multivariate model for ordinal rating responses, {{allowing}} for uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>answering.</b> <b>In</b> responding <b>to</b> rating questions, an individual may give <b>answers</b> either according <b>to</b> his/her knowledge (feeling) or to his/her level of indecision (uncertainty), typically {{driven by a}} response style. Since ignoring this uncertainty may lead to misleading results, we define the joint distribution of the ordinal responses via a mixture of components, characterized by uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> <b>to</b> a subset of variables. The effectiveness of the proposed model is attested through applications to real data and supported by a Monte Carlo study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> {{negative}} yes-no questions, focusing {{on data from}} Czech. It is shown that answering particles can express {{both positive and negative}} <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> negative questions, but that their choice is not free. Several pieces of evidence are discussed in order to show that the use of the particles depends on the interpretation of negation in the question, which can either be expletive or true. This semantic distinction is furthermore tightly linked to the syntactic position of the negation, according to which we distinguish between negative interrogative clauses and negative declarative clauses used as questions. An analysis in terms of absolute and relative polarity is proposed to account for the mixed behaviour of answering particles: particles express absolute polarity <b>in</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> interrogative questions, whose polarity is open, and relative polarity <b>in</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> declarative questions, whose polarity has been already specified...|$|R

This closes the open problems in [D. Angluin, M. Krikis, R. H. Sloan, G.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{an approach to}} exploit knowledge represented in an ontology <b>in</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> queries to an information base. We assume that the ontology is embedded in a knowledge base covering {{the domain of the}} information base. The ontology is first of all to influence ranking of objects <b>in</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> queries as measured by similarity to the query. We consider a generative framework where an ontology in combination with a concept language defines a set of well-formed concepts. Wellformed concepts is assumed to be the basis for an indexing of the information base in the sense that these concepts appear as descriptors attached to objects in the base. Concepts are thus applied to obtain a means for descriptions that generalizes simple word-based information base indexing. In effect query evaluation is generalized {{to be a matter of}} comparison at the level of concepts rather than words. ...|$|R
