40|$|AbstractThe recent “Polarstern” surveys, {{carried out}} within the {{framework}} of the international EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Shelf Ice Zone) programme, have been representing a significant effort to improve the understanding of certain as yet poorly known animal groups in the southern ocean. A collection of caprellids from the “Polarstern” cruise 42 ANT XIV/ 2 contained five species in four genera: Caprellinoides mayeri (Pfeffer, 1888); C. tristanensis Stebbing 1888; Aeginoides gaussi Schellenberg, 1926; Pseudododecas bowmani McCain & Gray, 1971; and Paraproto condylata (Haswell, 1885). Although all were previously recorded from the Antarctic region, Pseudododecas bowmani and Paraproto condylata, poorly known from previous studies, are redescribed and illustrated in detail. The examined specimens of P. bowmani are in good agreement with the descriptions of McCain & Gray (1971) and Laubitz (1991), except for the outer lobe of maxilla 1, which has 5 robust setae instead of 6. McCain & Gray reported a setal formula 1 - 25 - 1 for the terminal article of the mandibular palp. However, Laubitzs specimen had a setal formula 1 - 11 - 1 as do the specimens of the present study. The pereopod 3 is only 4 -articulate in the specimens examined. The fifth article is not indicated by an incomplete suture as reported by Laubitz (1991). These and other minor differences are probably due to differences of developmental stage or intraspecific variation. The illustrations of Paraproto condylata in Mayer (1903) and McCain & Gray (1971) were incomplete; detailed <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> mouthparts, gnathopods, pereopods, and abdomen were lacking...|$|E

If they failed, the doctor would serve as an attendant in a hospital for a time and retake the test.

In 1864 Moore established the Confederate States Medical and Surgical Journal, a manual to instruct the surgeons throughout the army; it included both exact <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> operations. During the war Moore also founded the Association of Army and Navy Surgeons of the Confederate States of America.
