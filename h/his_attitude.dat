His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, {{regarded}} {{the state of}} the national capital as an embarrassment.

5|$|A second movie, titled Terry, {{focused on}} the Marathon of Hope, was {{produced}} by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> more positively than the first movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox {{when he was a}} child, directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind, which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. <b>His</b> <b>attitude,</b> coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|For {{his service}} on the Western Front, Bennett {{received}} many awards. He received the Order of Danilo from Montenegro in 1917, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918, received a Distinguished Service Order in 1919 and mentioned in despatches a further six times. <b>His</b> <b>attitude</b> towards regular officers and temperament, {{as well as his}} tendency to act without clearing his actions with superiors, though, resulted in criticism from senior officers.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> {{could not}} be maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness of the {{government}} to use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} {{years of his}} {{presidency}} at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new hardware was being announced, in order {{to spend more time}} programming. However, <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo's public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo's employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September2006, stemmed from Iwata's background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of {{the inner workings of the}} company.|$|E

5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of <b>his</b> <b>attitude,</b> neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Norbert Wiener {{approached}} Bush with {{a proposal}} to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it {{on the grounds that}} he did not believe that it could be completed {{before the end of the}} war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> as a failure of vision.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi was, {{at least}} initially, much {{taken with the}} {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E

5|$|On 5 December 1940, Quisling flew to Berlin to {{negotiate}} the future of Norway's independence. By the time he returned on 13December, he had agreed to raise volunteers to fight with the German Schutzstaffel (SS). In January, SS head Heinrich Himmler travelled to Norway to oversee preparations. Quisling clearly believed that if Norway supported Nazi Germany on the battlefield, {{there would be no}} reason for Germany to annex her. To this end, he opposed plans to have a German SS brigade loyal only to Hitler installed in Norway. In the process, he also toughened <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> to the country harbouring the exiled king, the United Kingdom, which he no longer saw as a Nordic ally. Finally, Quisling aligned Norwegian policy on Jews with that of Germany, giving a speech in Frankfurt on 26 March 1941 in which he argued for compulsory exile, but warned against extermination.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. <b>His</b> <b>attitude</b> fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Houphouët {{was called}} by his tribe to assume the responsibilities of village chief. Preferring to pursue his medical career, he relinquished the office to his younger brother Augustin. Wishing to live closer to his village, he obtained a transfer to Dimbokro on 3 February 1934 and then to Toumodi on 28 June 1936. While Houphouët had displayed professional qualities, <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> had chafed those around him. As a result, in September 1938, his clinical director demanded that he choose between {{his job as a}} doctor and his involvement in local politics. The choice was quickly made for him: his brother died in 1939, and Houphouët became chef de canton (an office created by the colonial administration to collect taxes). Due to this, Houphouët ended his medical career the next year.|$|E

5|$|When Tipu's embassy {{visited the}} court of the French King Louis XVI in 1788, Pope Clement XIV's {{representative}} conveyed the appeal to the embassy. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789–92), the British and their allies defeated Tipu. Desperate to break the alliance of powers surrounding him on all sides, Tipu sought {{to make peace with}} Portugal, the Marathas, and other powers. According to Severine Silva, he consequently gave up the persecution of Christians, opened negotiations with the Portuguese Government and with the Archbishop of Goa, with a promise that he would stop molesting the Christians, further asserting that he would rebuild all destroyed churches at his own cost. The Christians found their supervision relaxed and Tipu became more conciliatory in <b>his</b> <b>attitude.</b> The Christians now escaped from the camps of Seringapatam and gradually began to enter the neighbouring kingdoms of Coorg and Malabar.|$|E
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, <b>his</b> <b>attitude</b> towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying <b>his</b> <b>attitude.</b> Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E
