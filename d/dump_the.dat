5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to <b>dump</b> <b>the</b> ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and <b>dump</b> <b>the</b> finless animal {{back into the}} water. Shark finning {{involves}} removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but <b>dump</b> <b>the</b> other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to <b>dump</b> <b>the</b> remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E

5|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular; there were {{divisions}} {{even within the}} Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to <b>dump</b> <b>the</b> President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active {{effort was made to}} convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word {{he did not want to}} be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The 2/1st Infantry Battalion {{began its}} advance on {{schedule}} at 0900, but the lead platoon came under {{heavy machine gun}} fire from Post 54, and Italian artillery knocked out the supporting mortars. The 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery engaged the Italian guns and the platoon withdrew. Colonel Eather then organised a formal attack on Post 54 for 1330, following a bombardment of the post by artillery and mortars. The Italian guns were silenced when an Australian shell detonated a nearby ammunition <b>dump.</b> <b>The</b> Australians then captured the post. About {{a third of its}} defenders had been killed in the fighting. The remaining 66 surrendered. This prompted a general collapse of the Italian position in the north. Posts 56 and 61 surrendered without a fight and white flags were raised over Posts 58, 60, 63 and 65, and the gun positions near Post 58. By nightfall, Eather's men had advanced as far as Post 69 and only the fourteen northernmost posts still held out in the Gerfan sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal.

After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to <b>dump</b> <b>the</b> cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of water and}} oxygen {{are some of the}} important factors influencing the oxidation rate of sulfide minerals within overburden dumps. In overburden <b>dumps,</b> <b>the</b> availability of water and oxygen is strongly controlled by the physical structure of <b>the</b> <b>dump,</b> as well as the surface climate and geochemical reaction within <b>the</b> <b>dump.</b> In this study, a series of field investigations, physical and geochemical laboratory characterization were conducted in order to evaluate internal physical structure and geochemical characteristics of coal mine overburden <b>dumps.</b> <b>The</b> study found that a multi bench structure consisting of 10 m height of inter-fingered slope layer is formed as the effect of <b>the</b> end <b>dumping</b> technique. In addition, overburden material was characterized to have high clay content and low durable characteristic when interact with water. These characteristics couple with mining equipment traffic has result in a compacted layer on the surface of each bench lift which then controls the groundwater flow path within <b>the</b> <b>dumps.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> geochemical characteristics were random, alternating among potentially acid forming and non acid forming materials within the inter-fingered layer. Those alternate geochemical characteristics may control acidification-neutralization reaction of infiltrated water, precipitation of secondary mineral and determines the quality of <b>the</b> overburden <b>dump</b> drainage, subsequently. <b>The</b> internal structure formed and the spatial heterogeneity of geochemical characteristics in overburden <b>dump</b> controls <b>the</b> acid drainage inhibition process within <b>the</b> <b>dumps...</b>|$|R
