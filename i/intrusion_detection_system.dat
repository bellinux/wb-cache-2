High-traffic stations, including Taipei Main Station, Zhongxiao Fuxing, and Taipei City Hall, have platform gates to prevent passengers and other objects from falling onto the rails. For safety reasons, fifteen additional stations will be equipped with these gates in the future (including Ximen, Guting, and Banqiao). All lines and extensions currently under construction will be equipped with platform screen doors. A Track <b>Intrusion</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>System</b> has also been installed to improve passenger safety at stations without platform doors.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{world of}} {{computer}} networking, Gigabit Ethernet is quickly becoming {{the norm for}} connectivity in computer networks. The ease of access to information on these networks leads to new information being made available daily.

40|$|<b>Intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> are {{distributed}} applications that analyze {{the events in}} a networked system to identify malicious behavior.

Currently, <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> and the corresponding attack modeling languages are developed following an ad hoc approach to match the characteristics of specific target environments.
