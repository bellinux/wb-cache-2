30|$|It can {{be noticed}} that smaller <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> spacing leads to higher gas rate, and the {{differences}} are almost 4000  m 3. Smaller <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> spacing can increase {{the volume of the}} stimulated zone near the horizontal well and better communicate with the local natural fractures (Sun and David 2015), thus more effectively enhance the recovery. But we should not neglect that when the length of the horizontal section is fixed, smaller <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> spacing indicates the larger amount of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures,</b> in other words, higher cost for the fracturing process. Therefore, there exists an optimal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> spacing economically.|$|R
30|$|Sensitivity {{analysis}} of the critical parameters with the OPAAT and RSM approaches provides significant understanding of critical parameters. The lateral distance between the injector <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> and producer <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> is the most critical parameters that affect oil recovery. Other critical factors are <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> permeability of the production well and then the distance (acre spacing) between the injection and production wells. Natural fracture connectivity strongly influences the role of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> permeability and fracture half-length in the reservoir. These parameters become insignificant {{in the absence of}} natural and induced fractures in the formation.|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} for field models of tight gas {{reservoirs}} to include several wells with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures.</b> These <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> can be very long, extending {{for more than a}} thousand feet. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> width is usually no more than about 0. 02 ft. The combination of the above factors leads to the conclusion {{that there is a need}} to model <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> in coarse grid blocks for these field models since it may be impractical to simulate these models using fine grids. In this dissertation, a method was developed to simulate a reservoir model with a single <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> that passes through several coarse gridblocks. This method was tested and a numerical error was quantified that occurs at early time due to the use of coarse grid blocks. In addition, in this work, rules were developed and tested on using uniform fine grids to simulate a reservoir model with a single <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture.</b> Results were compared with the results from simulations using non-uniform fine grids...|$|R

30|$|The {{injection}} well was over-cored and removed {{to determine the}} orientation of the actual fracture network. After over-coring, the granite block was slabbed at approximately one-inch intervals to view the existing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> network within the sample. Figure  10 shows photos of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> network stenciled for clearer view. The complex network within the block existed from several <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> injection tests, some of the latter were not recorded with AE due to software buffering issues. The fracture data from the photographs were digitized and shown in Fig.  11. The dark blue points in this figure are digitized fracture locations from the photographs, while the light blue mesh represents the interpolated surface between the measured points. This complex fracture network in an unconfined sample shows how induced stress changes from the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> can alter re-fracture orientation and create quite a complex system of fractures. Figure  12 shows the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> from Fig.  11 that is most nearly aligned with the predicted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> orientation determined. Comparisons made between the main <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> predicted from the AE data and the largest fracture observed in the network from the slabbed sample can be seen in Figs.  13 and 14. Upon initial observations, the two fractures appeared to match in location, orientation and moderately in roughness trend. The roughness of the predicted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> was determined based on the lateral variability observed at the lowest error plane orientation. Though roughness predictions from AE data are interesting, the main take-away from these images are the general agreement between the predicted and actual <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> orientation and extent.|$|R
40|$|Multi-fractured {{horizontal}} well is applied in tight gas reservoirs {{due to the}} low permeability. A new pressure transient model of multi-fractured {{horizontal well}} based on discrete-fracture model in which the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> are discretized as 2 D entities is built in this paper, The model is divided into <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> region and formation region. The model can be solved using the Galerkin finite element method, then the pressure transient type curves are plotted by computer programming. The results show that there are five different flow regimes observed in type curves including early linear flow, early radial flow, elliptical flow, later pseudo-radial flow and boundary response regime. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to study impacts of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> number, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> half-length, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> spacing, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> conductivity on pressure transient type curves. The new model and obtained results in this paper not only enrich the well testing models, but also play a guiding role in analyzing pressure transient response of multi-fractured horizontal well in tight gas reservoirs...|$|R

To illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} model, example simulations are presented including ones involving simultaneously propagating multiple <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> and producing well interference. The results indicate that both stress shadow effects and producing well interference can alter <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> propagation behavior substantially, and plastic deformations in ductile reservoir rocks can indeed make a significant difference in fracturing pressure and final fracture geometry...|$|R

5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracturing</b> to allow the gas to flow to the well bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> propagation model to describe propagation more realistically. In propagating the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures,</b> {{we have used}} two criteria: maximum tangential stress to determine the fracture initiation angle and whether a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> intersects a natural fracture. The model was validated for the parameters relevant to fracture propagation, such as initiation angle and crossing ability through natural fracture. In order to check whether a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> crosses a natural fracture, the model results on crossing state excellently matched with the experimental data. In the sensitivity analysis for direction of maximum horizontal stress, frictional coefficient of fracture interface, and natural fracture orientation, {{the results show that}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> intersects natural fracture, and then, propagated suitably with theoretical results according to fracture interaction criterion. In comparison of this model against vertical fracture approach, it was ascertained that there are discrepancies in fracture connectivity and stimulated reservoir volume. ? ??? 2015 ?? ??????? ??? ??? ?????(?????? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ???? ??) ...|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{reported}} {{height of}} an upward propagating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> from several thousand fracturing {{operations in the}} Marcellus, Barnett, Woodford, Eagle Ford and Niobrara shale (USA) is ∼ 588 m. Of the 1170 natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> pipes imaged with three-dimensional seismic data offshore of West Africa and mid-Norway it is ∼ 1106 m. Based on these empirical data, {{the probability of a}} stimulated and natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> extending vertically > 350 m is ∼ 1 % and ∼ 33 % respectively. Constraining the probability of stimulating unusually tall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> in sedimentary rocks is extremely important as an evidence base for decisions on the safe vertical separation between the depth of stimulation and rock strata not intended for penetration...|$|R
30|$|The first triple {{porosity}} {{was introduced}} by Abdassah and Ershaghi (1986), and they divided the matrix to have different properties with single fracture. Then Al-Ahmadi and Ershaghi (1996) first assume the fractures to have different properties, their model was presented using a radial system, and the natural <b>fractures</b> and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> can both feed the well. Drier (2004) improved the triple-continuum model originally proposed by Al-Ahmadi and Ershaghi (1996) by considering transient flow condition between natural <b>fractures</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures.</b> Bello and Wattenberger (2008, 2009, 2010) applied the triple-continuum model to analyze the production rate in horizontal well in tight fractured reservoirs. Ozkan et al. (2009) proposed a trilinear model comprising three continuous media: finite conductivity <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures,</b> dual-porosity inner reservoir between the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> and outer reservoir beyond {{the tip of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures.</b> Apaydin et al. (2012) examine the effects of matrix micro-fractures on effective matrix permeability of a dual-porosity medium. They stated that matrix micro-fractures accelerate production by providing earlier and more effective contribution of the matrix into flow rates. Therefore, the multi-continuum model for shale gas reservoir commonly comprises three media: matrix, natural <b>fractures</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures,</b> which is also called dual-fracture model (Al-Ahmadi and Ershaghi 1996).|$|R
5|$|Denver's {{position}} {{near the}} mineral-rich Rocky Mountains encouraged mining and energy companies to spring {{up in the}} area. In {{the early days of}} the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city's economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera Dynasty. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and current governor John Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the nation's highest office vacancy rate (30%). The industry has recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers. Advances in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracturing</b> have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as EnCana, Halliburton, Smith International, Rio Tinto Group, Newmont Mining, Noble Energy, and Anadarko headquartered or having significant operations.|$|E

40|$|Horizontal wells with {{multiple}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> {{have become a}} common occurrence in {{the oil and gas}} industry, especially in tight formations. Published models assume that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> are fully penetrating the formations. However, studies have shown that fractures are not always fully penetrating the formations. This paper introduces a new technique for analyzing the pressure behavior of a horizontal well {{with multiple}} vertical and inclined partially penetrating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures.</b> The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> in this model could be longitudinal or transverse, vertical or inclined, symmetrical or asymmetrical. The fractures are propagated in isotropic or anisotropic formations and considered having different dimensions and different spacing. This technique, based on pressure and pressure derivative concept, can be used to calculate various reservoir parameters, including directional permeability, fracture length and percentage of penetration. The study has shown that the pressure behavior of small penetration rate is similar to the horizontal wells without <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures.</b> A type curve matching technique has been applied using the plots of the pressure and pressure derivative curves. A set of type curves, which will be included in the paper, have been generated for the partially penetrating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> associated to the horizontal wells with different penetration rates. A step-by-step procedure for analyzing pressure tests using these type curves is also included in the paper for several numerical examples. </p...|$|R
40|$|To model <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> {{propagation}} in naturally fractured reservoirs, fracture propagation {{is generally}} {{assumed to be}} a single planar fracture propagated only in the vertical direction from a horizontal well, regardless of the presence of natural fractures. In this paper, we developed a multi-stage <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> propagation model using a twisted multiple planar fracture that is able to describe the propagation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures</b> more realistically. In propagating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fractures,</b> we used two criteria: maximum tangential stress, to determine the fracture initiation angle, and whether a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> passes through a natural fracture. The developed model was used with a commercial reservoir simulator through grid mapping {{in the form of a}} discrete fracture network using microseismic data. The results of the verification matched the experimental results well for various intersection angles and maximum horizontal stress directions. In the investigation of the direction of maximum horizontal stress, the frictional coefficient of the fracture interface, and <b>fracture</b> orientation, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> propagation modeling results showed that the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracture</b> passed through a natural fracture, and thereafter propagated in a manner suitably consistent with the theoretical results, based on a fracture interaction criterion. After confirming the twisted multiple planar fracture model suggested in this work, discrepancies were found in the fracture connectivity and the stimulated reservoir volume. This indicates that the twisted multiple planar fracture approach, which is more realistic in terms of fracture propagation, is extremely important in evaluating the initial gas in place, calculated according to the stimulated reservoir volume.
