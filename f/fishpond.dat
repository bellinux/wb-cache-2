The infirmary was made up of two large buildings: one a chapel; the other a hall (with latrines to one end) serving as a ward.

5|$|As part {{of these}} works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had {{previously}} run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south {{had to leave the}} main road, progress west around the priory and the castle <b>fishpond,</b> before reaching {{the southern end of the}} walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.|$|E

500|$|The {{site was}} chosen {{on top of}} a local ridge, {{overlooking}} the Thames estuary, formed from a geologically unstable outcrop of London clay. In the 13th century, marshlands would have stretched away to the south of the castle, with the tide occasionally reaching up as far as the base of the hill itself, and the area would have been more wooded than today. By 1235 the park of Hadleigh had been formed around the castle, including woodland, a <b>fishpond,</b> stables and a park lodge, but the castle was also associated with a wider estate including Rayleigh, Thundersley and Eastwood Parks.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conviction}} of the nuns for poaching in 1286 illustrates both problems. The incident concerned {{seems to have}} happened about a decade earlier, so justice, while certain, was not swift. After a stag had escaped from the royal huntsman in Gailey Hay, part of the royal forest of Cank or Cannock Chase, it had fled the forest and drowned in the priory <b>fishpond.</b> John Giffard of Chillington Hall, a short distance to the south, had dragged the carcass from the pond and claimed the whole of it, although one John Whitmore had {{played a part in}} its demise by shooting at it. Giffard then took half of the animal home with him, leaving the remainder for the nuns. Under Henry III's Charter of the Forest, this was no longer a capital offence, although it remained very serious. When the matter came to trial, both Giffard and Whitmore were imprisoned and fined, Giffard 20 shillings and Whitmore a mark. Of the nuns, however, the judgement ran: [...] "as they are poor, they are pardoned {{for the good of the}} king’s soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Horn. [...] The {{original}} {{settlement was}} around St Stephen’s Church on the W {{side of the}} Taffa river. It was first mentioned around 1050. Between 1150–1160 Count Kerold laid out a new town on the E side of the Taffa and by 1282 Horn had received a charter. The town has an internal H shaped road layout, similar to many Styrian towns, but unlike the Styrian towns in {{that there is a}} three sided market place ‘Dreiecksplatz. Horn castle, which includes a rectangular Bergfried [...] or fortified tower, lies on the SE of the town. No gate-towers survive and the main surviving lengths of walls are on the S, and N and W sides. [...] On the N a long length of moat survives and from the evidence of GIS and property boundaries it appears that there was a secondary wall immediately in front of the original wall and an outer wall on the further side of the moat. There is a round tower still standing which is forward of the main wall and would have been set into the secondary wall. Merian (1649/79) shows Horn from the North and at this time there was a large ‘Teich’ or <b>fishpond,</b> placed there as part of the defences, in front of the moat. Also shown by Merian is a further defended area with a wall on the E side of Horn, joining the Mayerhof to a ‘Wehrkirche’ or defended church at the Ridenburg. This church has now disappeared, but a further view by Vischer in 1672, show Horn from the E, with a wall crossing the valley of the Taffa and an outer gate on the Wiener Strasse. Vischer also shows a large D shaped bastion on the SW of the main fortifications, which still survives. This bastion would have been used for mounting heavier artillery to cover the Taffa valley.|$|E
