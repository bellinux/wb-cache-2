50|$|Vulvar {{organs and}} tissues can become {{infected}} with different pathogens, or infested by parasites. Any inflammation caused is called vulvitis.

5000|$|As {{carbomycin}} is not {{a strong}} antibiotic, it is not used extensively and is considered a minor antibiotic; it is most effective when used {{in combination with other}} drugs. The range of activity of carbomycin {{is similar to that of}} erythromycin. In testing the response of 74 strains of bacteria, their susceptibility across carbomycin and erythromycin was consistent. However, a higher concentration of carbomycin is needed to achieve the same effect as that of erythromycin. The effectiveness of carbomycin as an antibiotic varies. When used to treat 45 patients with pneumonia, carbomycin was as effective as other antibiotics for six patients. Two developed meningitis, while, for twelve patients, it was necessary that the use of carbomycin in treatment be replaced with penicillin. Carbomycin has been successful in treating neither staphylococcal sepsis nor bacterial endocarditis. In 1954, carbomycin was found to be an effective treatment for <b>granuloma</b> <b>inguinale</b> by Harry M. Robinson and Morris M. Cohen. [...] However, complete healing from the condition depends on the severity and duration of the condition. There were no adverse reactions found to be associated with the use of carbomycin.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of the etiologic agent of <b>granuloma</b> <b>inguinale</b> has remained an unsolved problem since l) onovan in 1905 described peculiar intracellular parasites as being consistently present in smears from the ulcerated lesions of this disease (1).

Donovan bodies are now generally accepted as being pathognomonic for <b>granuloma</b> <b>inguinale</b> and evidence has accumulated to support the hypothesis of their etiologic function (Figs. 1, 2). However, in ispite of the efforts of many investigators, no microorganism acceptable as the etiologic agent of <b>granuloma</b> <b>inguinale</b> has been isolated and cultivated outside the human host. Numerous investigators have cultivated various bacteria to which they attached etiologic significance (2 - 7).
