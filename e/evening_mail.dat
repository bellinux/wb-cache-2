5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail.</b> Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E

50|$|Farah Antun was {{the sole}} {{contributor}} to Al-Jami'ah except for occasional other writers and his nephew Mikha'il Karam who worked with Antun {{for two years in}} Egypt. Possible reasons for the irregularity of his publications was that Antun wrote, edited, printed and <b>even</b> <b>mailed</b> out his magazines all on his own, in edition to keeping track of the financial records with no assistant. New York was the exception to this, as Antun had the full-time help of his brother-in-law, Niqula Haddad.|$|R

5000|$|Lithuania did not {{recognize}} Polish control over Vilnius even de facto. There were no diplomatic relations between Poland and Lithuania until the ultimatum of 1938. Railroad traffic, telegraph lines, <b>even</b> <b>mail</b> could not cross the Polish-Lithuanian border. Lithuania continued to declare Vilnius as its capital in all official documents, including the constitution. Since the city was controlled by Poland, all Lithuanian authorities were transferred {{to the city of}} Kaunas, which became the seat of the government. To reconcile reality with constitutional claims, Kaunas was designated as a temporary or provisional capital until Vilnius would be [...] "liberated from Polish occupation". In March 1938 Lithuania accepted Polish ultimatum demanding to restart diplomatic relations. Despite normalized relations, the new Lithuanian Constitution of May 1938 still claimed Vilnius as the de jure capital of Lithuania and Kaunas remained as the temporary capital.|$|R

25|$|There {{are quite}} {{a large number of}} local weekly newspapers, with most {{counties}} and large towns having two or more newspapers. In Munster the Evening Echo, published in separate editions for Cork and Limerick, is a daily local newspaper. Curiously Dublin remains {{one of the few places}} in Ireland without a major local paper; The Dublin <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> having closed down in the 1960s. The Evening Herald markets itself from time to time as a Dublin local newspaper, however it is distributed nationally. In 2003 the Dublin Daily was launched, but failed to attract enough readers to make it viable, and closed after 90 issues and a full rebrand as the Dublin Evening. In 2008, a number of local papers have been launched by the Gazette Group.|$|E

She was the one survivor in a million, as I had been, as the Chauffeur had been. On a crowning eminence of the Alameda Hills, overlooking San Francisco Bay, Van Warden had built a vast summer palace. It {{was surrounded by a}} park of a thousand acres. When the plague broke out, Van Warden sent her there. Armed guards patrolled the boundaries of the park, and nothing entered in the way of provisions or <b>even</b> <b>mail</b> matter that was not first fumigated. And yet did the plague enter, killing the guards at their posts, the servants at their tasks, sweeping away the whole army of retainers--or, at least, all of them who did not flee to die elsewhere. So it was that Vesta found herself the sole living person in the palace that had become a charnel house.|$|R

500|$|This {{work was}} first {{published}} as [...] "That Double Play Again" [...] in the New York <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> on July 12, 1910 (not on July 10 as numerous sources state). The Chicago Daily Tribune reprinted it as [...] "Gotham's Woe" [...] on July 15, 1910. Three days later, on July 18, the New York <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> republished it under the title by which it is best known today, [...] "Baseball's Sad Lexicon." [...] The poem was such a hit that other sportswriters submitted additional verses.|$|E
500|$|Evers {{served as}} the pivot man in the [...] "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance" [...] double-play combination, which {{inspired}} the classic baseball poem [...] "Baseball's Sad Lexicon", written by New York <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910. Evers, Tinker, and Chance were all inducted in the Hall of Fame in the same year.|$|E

500|$|Berger's SS-HA had a {{problematic}} {{relationship with the}} SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the Waffen-SS. The SS-FHA wanted the Waffen-SS {{to be a small}} elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some Waffen-SS formations would be of lesser quality. Jüttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate, with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA had also paid scant attention to retention of ranks for former members of national armed forces, liaison with home territories, and <b>even</b> <b>mail.</b> Berger's well-researched report to Himmler on these failures was damning, and the Reichsführer-SS soon issued detailed instructions on the handling of these new recruits, from the moment they joined the Waffen-SS. Berger's criticisms of Jüttner must be seen {{in the light of the}} advantages Berger considered he would achieve if Jüttner's position with Himmler was weakened.|$|R
500|$|Tinker {{is perhaps}} best known for the [...] "Tinker to Evers to Chance" [...] double play {{combination}} in the poem [...] "Baseball's Sad Lexicon", written by the New York <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910. The poem was written as a lamentation {{from the perspective of a}} New York Giants fan on how the team is consistently defeated by the Chicago Cubs.|$|E
500|$|Although Davenport {{continued}} at the <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> after Roosevelt was elected, {{the quality of}} his work declined; fewer and fewer of his images were selected for inclusion in Albert Shaw's Review of Reviews.

500|$|A {{year into}} Park's life sentence, around 40 {{family members and}} friends held a vigil at Strangeways Prison, in a bid to raise {{awareness}} of [...] "the fact that there is an innocent man in prison". Another was held a year later, led by Jenny Park, and a third on the third anniversary of Park's imprisonment. It was due to these vigils, claimed Evangelical Pastor George Harrison, that he was barred from visiting Park once he was transferred to Garth prison, in Lancashire. Other fronts for the campaign included an offer of £5,000 for anyone providing evidence that lead to Gordon's freedom. Included in this were planned adverts in the North-West <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> and leaflets to 20,000 homes in the Furness area. However, this was being organised by Harrison, with whom Gordon and his third wife Jennifer stayed during the trial. Jeremy Park wrote to the North-West <b>Evening</b> <b>Mail</b> to confirm that he {{wanted nothing to do with}} the reward, and that Harrison had no right to include his name, contact details or email address, or mention the freegordon website, in the adverts. Subsequently, Harrison claimed to have delivered 6,000 booklets and leaflets in the Furness area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sequence}} of a matrix gene {{did not match}} any known sequence exactly, so that a contaminant could be ruled out. In all, Taubenberger's team isolated nine fragments of viral RNA from five different genes. They decided to send their first publication to Nature, but the editors rejected the paper without <b>even</b> <b>mailing</b> it to experts for peer review. Science was sceptical too at first, but eventually published what amounted to about 15 percent of the haemagglutinin gene as well as small fragments of the four other genes on 21 March 1997. By the summer of 1997 the team had the full {{sequence of}} the haemagglutinin. At this point the problem arose that they had used up half the tissue available from Private Roscoe Vaughn for this one gene. It seemed most probable that all ten genes of the 1918 virus could not be sequenced from the available material. (In September 1997 tissue from a private called James Downs, who succumbed to influenza at Camp Upton, New York, turned out positive as well.) ...|$|R
