Cats often purr during this behaviour, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection.|$|E
50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a <b>kneading</b> <b>action</b> that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's <b>kneading</b> <b>action</b> being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|E
50|$|Northern {{goshawks}} rarely {{vary from}} their perch-hunting style that typifies the initial {{part of their}} hunt but seems {{to be able to}} show nearly endless variation to the concluding pursuit. Hunting goshawks seem to not only utilize thick vegetation to block them from view for their prey (as typical of Accipiters) but, while hunting flying birds, they {{seem to be able to}} adjust their flight level so the prey is unable to see its hunter past their own tails. Once a prey item is selected, a short tail-chase may occur. The northern goshawk is capable of considerable, sustained, horizontal speed in pursuit of prey with speeds of 38 mph reported. While pursuing prey, northern goshawks has been described both “reckless” and “fearless”, able to pursue their prey through nearly any conditions. There are various times goshawks have been observed going on foot to pursue prey, at times running without hesitation (in a crow-like, but more hurried gait) into dense thickets and brambles (especially in pursuit of galliforms trying to escape), as well as into water (i.e. usually waterfowl). Anecdotal cases have been reported when goshawks have pursue domestic prey into barns and even houses. Prey pursuits may become rather prolonged depending upon the goshawk’s determination and hunger, ranging up to 15 minutes while harrying a terrified, agile squirrel or hare, and occasional pair hunting may benefit goshawks going after agile prey. As is recorded in many accipitrids, hunting in pairs (or “tandem hunting”) normally consist of a breeding pair, with one bird flying conspicuously to distract the prey, while the other swoops in from behind to ambush the victim. When gliding down from a perch to capture prey, a goshawk may not even beat its wings, rendering its flight nearly silent. Prey is killed by driving the talons into the quarry and squeezing while the head is held back to avoid flailing limbs, frequently followed by a <b>kneading</b> <b>action</b> until the prey stops struggling. Kills are normally consumed on the ground by juvenile or non-breeding goshawks (more rarely an elevated perch or old nest) or taken to a low perch by breeding goshawks. Habitual perches are used for dismantling prey especially in the breeding season, often called “plucking perches”, which are may consist fallen logs, bent-over trees, stumps or rocks and can see years of usage. Northern goshawks often leave larger portions of their prey uneaten than other raptors, with limbs, many feathers and fur and other body parts strewn near kill sites and plucking perches, and are helpful to distinguish their kills from other raptors such as large owls, who usually eat everything. The daily food requirements of a single goshawks are around 120 to 150 g and most kills can feed a goshawk for 1 to 3 days. Northern goshawks sometimes cache prey on tree branches or wedged in a crotch between branches for up to 32 hours. This is done primarily during the nestling stage. Hunting success rates have been very roughly estimated at 15-30%, within average range for a bird of prey, but may be reported as higher elsewhere. One study claimed hunting success rates for pursuing rabbits was 60% and corvids was 63.8%.|$|E

50|$|Gluten {{proteins}} {{affect the}} water absorption and viscoelastic {{properties of the}} predough. The role of proteins {{can be divided into}} two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or <b>kneading</b> stage, the <b>action</b> of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated glutenin proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated gliadin proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough’s viscosity.|$|R

40|$|Currently, the {{introduction}} of the gyratory compactor replicating the <b>kneading</b> <b>action</b> of the field compaction raises a though that the conventional 75 blows of Marshall compaction effort would be insufficient to simulate field compaction of the foamed bitumen stabilisation material. Furthermore, the strong laboratory specification of a particular compaction method for the foamed bitumen mixture has not yet been established, therefore the future study in the compaction of the foamed bitumen mixture is needed. This laboratory based study aims to verify the reliable compaction effort for the foamed bitumen mixture. In this study, virgin materials treated with different foamed bitumen contents were compacted by Marshall Compactor and Gyratory Compactor at various blows/cycles, respectively. Upon completion of compaction and curing, density, indirect tensile strength and indirect tensile resilient modulus were performed to determine the suitable compaction technique for such materials. It is expected that the compaction effort achieved the highest density and tensile strength would be selected to compare with field compaction further...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the test results from the {{fundamental}} research {{on the behavior of}} the construction joint of the asphalt pavement by means of the beam flexural test. Flexural test was performed at - 10, - 5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 ℃, at the rate of strain of 0. 28 × 10 ^[- 21]/sec, and the test results were analyzed by strain at rupture, flexural strength, required energy for failure, and stress relaxation modulus. Test results were summarized as follows. 1) The strain at rupture expresses more clearly the joint behavior than the flexural strength. 2) Factors controlling the joint behavior are as follows. a. Type of joint construction b. Type of binder (rheological property of binder) c. Binder content d. Composition and aggregate grading 3) A good result was obtained by <b>kneading</b> <b>action</b> from wheel tracking. This test result may be taken into consideration in the preferable construction method. 4) The preferable result may be obtained from both of construction method and properties of the material used. 5) The most important property of the material may be expressed by means of stress relaxation property...|$|E
