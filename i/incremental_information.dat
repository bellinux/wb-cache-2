5000|$|Technical analysis, {{also known}} as [...] "charting", {{has been a part}} of {{financial}} practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysisthe presence of geometric shapes in historical price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distributionconditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottomswe find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> and may have some practical value.|$|E

Firstly, {{a new concept}} of increment is proposed based on the spatio-temporal change type and data delta. The change type describes the semantics of increment information and data delta describes the content of increment information. Based on this concept, the types of residential change and relevant data deltas are put forward. There are two catalogs of change type, i. e. subjective change and objective change. The subjective change can be detailedly divided into 3 small change types and the objective change can be detailedly divided into 12 small change types. Additionally, the <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> resulted from the objective change is formalized.

This study prospectively investigates the incremental prognostic value of E/DT over clinical, conventional echocardiographic and mitral-Doppler variables in patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure (HF). METHODS: We analyzed 95 HF patients (mean age 64. 8 ± 12. 2 years) hospitalized at our institution from January 2010 to March 2012. The primary end-point was cardiac death or hospitalization, whichever occurred first. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of outcomes. RESULTS: During follow-up (median 37. 7 months) 13 patients died and 44 were hospitalized for a cardiac event. At univariable analysis, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, furosemide dosage, lateral tricuspidal annular plane systolic excursion, deceleration time and E/DT were predictive of outcome. At multivariable analysis, E/DT was the only predictor of prognosis (hazard ratio = 1. 02, P = 0. 018), giving <b>incremental</b> prognostic <b>information</b> to clinical and other echocardio-graphic measures (global chi-square from 15. 4 to 25. 2; P = 0. 032).

40|$|AbstractThe {{incremental}} updating of geo-spatial databases {{is becoming}} more and more popular because the method of replacing the entire database with a new version is burdensome for the large mount of data involved. There is needed a model for geo-spatial database incremental updating in an efficient manner and a practical mode. A number of key problems of modeling the spatial database incremental updating are discussed in this paper. Firstly the base state with amendments model is introduced to manage the <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> and historical database. Then detailed technologies such as the <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> storage structure, creating the new version database, and spatio-temporal search are also expatiated. Finally, a prototype system for spatial database incremental updating is developed and implemented with 1 : 2000 topographic databases.

A Reexamination of the <b>Incremental</b> <b>Information</b> Content of Capital Expenditures Abstract: Under GAAP, recognition of the earnings impact of capital expenditures is postponed until the resulting revenues and expenses are realized. However, if current-period capital expenditures change in the profile of profits, an efficient capital market will impound the revision in current-period share prices. This suggests that unanticipated capital expenditures have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. We observe such <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> content in a more general setting {{on an annual basis}} than has previously been documented, and we also detect the effect on a quarterly basis. Moreover, we find that fiscal fourth quarter unanticipated capital expenditures have greater <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> content than those of earlier quarters when all fiscal quarters are considered simultaneously using an annual event window. Consistent with Callen et al. (1996), we also find that more capital expenditures are made by our sample firms in their fiscal fourth quarters than in other quarters. However, further analysis indicates that the greater fiscal fourth quarter <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> content of unanticipated capital expenditures with an annual event window is not due to fourth quarter "bunching " of capital expenditures; rather, it is due to accounting recognition rules.

Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA) can accurately diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD) and predict CV outcomes. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether moderate CKD provides prognostic information for CV events in patients undergoing CTA. In total 885 patients with suspected CAD underwent CTA and were stratified to moderate CKD (85 patients) or no CKD (770 patients) based on a cut-off estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2). After 896 days of follow-up, 42 patients developed CV events. Annualized CV event rates were 1. 2 % in patients with no CKD and no CAD, 2. 5 % in patients with moderate CKD alone, 2. 5 % in patients with obstructive CAD alone, and 3. 7 % in those with moderate CKD and obstructive CAD. Multivariate models demonstrated that moderate CKD (hazard ratio 2. 39, confidence interval 1. 09 to 5. 21, p = 0. 03) and obstructive CAD (hazard ratio 2. 76, confidence interval 1. 40 to 5. 44, p < 0. 01) were independent predictors of CV events.

40|$|Corresponding author. We wish {{to thank}} the {{anonymous}} referees {{for their helpful comments}} and suggestions. A Reexamination of the <b>Incremental</b> <b>Information</b> Content of Capital Expenditures Abstract: Under generally accepted accounting principles, firms must postpone recognition of the earnings effects of capital expenditures until they realize the resulting revenues and expenses. However, if capital expenditures change the profile of future profits, we expect share prices to impound that revision in profitability prior to its recognition under GAAP. This suggests that changes in capital expenditures should have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. Prior research considered annual changes in capital expenditures and detected <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> only in restricted samples. However, we examine more general samples and observe that quarterly as well as annual changes in capital expenditures are informative beyond unexpected earnings. Furthermore, we predict greater <b>incremental</b> <b>information</b> content for fiscal fourth quarter changes in capital expenditures when considering all fiscal quarters simultaneously, because the effect of the earnings recognition delay under GAAP should be magnified for capital expenditures made late in the fiscal year. Our results are consistent with this prediction and inconsistent with the prediction that changes in fiscal fourth quarter capital expenditures reflect lower profitability that result from an inefficient bunching of capital expenditures in the fiscal fourth quarter.

BackgroundA baseline QTc of ≥ 500 ms {{has been shown to}} be associated with increased risk of cardiac events among LQTS patients. However, the value of QTc measurements on follow-up ECGs in risk assessment has not been determined. MethodsThe risk of a first LQTS-related cardiac event during adolescence was assessed in 375 patients enrolled in the International LQTS Registry for whom serial follow-up ECGs were recorded before age 10. ResultsThe mean ± SD difference between the minimum and maximum QTc values on serial ECGs recorded in study patients was 47 ± 40 ms. The maximum QTc interval recorded before age 10 was the strongest predictor of cardiac events during adolescence (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2. 74; p < 0. 001). Other follow-up QTc measures, including the baseline, the mean, and the most recent QTc interval recorded before age 10, were less significant risk factors. After adjusting for the maximum QTc value during follow-up, no significant association remained between the baseline QTc value and the risk of subsequent cardiac events (HR = 1. 04; p = 0. 91). ConclusionsIn LQTS patients, there is a considerable variability in QTc measures in serial follow-up ECGs. The maximum QTc interval provides <b>incremental</b> prognostic <b>information</b> beyond the baseline measurement.

MethodsWe identified 10, 037 symptomatic patients without CAD who underwent concomitant CCTA and CAC scoring. CAD was assessed as 0 had a sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values for stenosis ≥ 50 % of 89 %, 59 %, 96 %, and 29 %, respectively. During a median of 2. 1 years, there was no difference in mortality among patients with a CAC score of 0 irrespective of obstructive CAD. Among 8, 907 patients with follow-up for the composite endpoint, 3. 9 % with a CAC score of 0 and ≥ 50 % stenosis experienced an event (hazard ratio: 5. 7; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 5 to 13. 1; p < 0. 001) compared with 0. 8 % of patients with a CAC score of 0 and no obstructive CAD.
