25|$|Roads are a chief {{source of}} {{environmental}} noise generation. In the early 1970s it was recognized that design of roads can {{be conducted to}} influence and minimize noise generation. Noise barriers are used to reduce noise pollution, in particular where roads are located close to built-up areas. Regulations can restrict the use of <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A freewheel, as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its freewheel. Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> due to the freewheels.|$|E

25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E
25|$|The floor {{selector}} lever {{also has an}} S position. When S is selected, sport mode is activated in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain — because loss of tire traction may be experienced (wheel spin during acceleration, and may also result in road wheel locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under closed throttle). On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.|$|E

2500|$|The complex B-point system (explained below) gave {{smooth running}} on overrun and some <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> Suzuki stopped fitting the B {{points to the}} 1976 [...] "A" [...] model, and {{allegedly}} had dealers disconnect the system on remaining [...] "M" [...] models. The bikes sometimes exhibited a dead spot or hesitation during acceleration as the carburetor transitioned from primary to secondary throat. This was due to poor synchronization between {{the positions of the}} primary, port and the secondary carburetor throat valves. Some evidence links this to jetting, giving an excessively lean primary mixture.|$|E
2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} <b>engine</b> <b>braking,</b> partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). <b>Engine</b> <b>braking</b> is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).|$|E

2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|E

[...] It has paddle-shifts mounted behind the flat-bottomed steering wheel, similar in design to the Audi B7 RS 4. [...] The gearbox is set by default, in conventional automatic mode, to delay up-changes during acceleration, and change down earlier to maximise <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> [...] Downchanges in all modes of operation include the Powertrain Control Module electronic control unit (ECU) [...] "blipping" [...] the Bosch [...] "E-Gas" [...] drive by wire throttle, for smoother shift changes. [...] The hydraulic torque converter includes a lock-up function in all forward gears, {{and is able to}} completely disconnect when the vehicle is stationary, thus saving fuel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>braking</b> avoids wear on brakes, and {{can help}} a driver {{maintain}} control of the vehicle. Active use of <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> by shifting into a lower gear is can help control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes, saving the brakes from overheating or excessive wear. If it is applied before the brakes have been used, it can leave the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed is maintained by using <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> to counteract gravitational acceleration. Potentially transmission wear caused by <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> can be mitigated by certain techniques. Slipping the clutch to complete a downshift wears the clutch plate as it slows the vehicle, doing {{the job of the}} brake pads or shoes. A well-executed rev-match in the same setting minimizes stresses on transmission components, so <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> does the work of slowing the vehicle.|$|E

Many old two-stroke cars (Saab, Wartburg, etc.) had a freewheel device on the transmission to make <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> optional.

50|$|Compression brakes, {{a form of}} <b>engine</b> <b>brakes,</b> produce greater noise {{pollution}} than exhaust brakes.

5000|$|The Torsen-based quattro {{system also}} offers an advantage, in the {{opposite}} function of distributing torque to the road wheels, namely <b>engine</b> <b>braking.</b> When <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> is used to slow the car down, with Torsen-based systems, the resulting [...] "reverse-torque" [...] loads {{on the front and}} rear axle are equally stabilised, {{in exactly the same way}} that engine [...] "propulsion" [...] torque is apportioned fully mechanically autonomously. This allows the spreading of the <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> effect to all four wheels and tyres. The Torsen-based quattro-equipped vehicle is able to execute a more stable high-speed turn under deceleration, with less risk of losing control due to loss of grip in the front or rear axles.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engines do {{not have}} <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> in the above sense. Unlike {{gasoline}} engines, diesel engines vary fuel flow to control power, rather than throttling air intake and maintaining a constant fuel ratio as gasoline engines do. Because they do not maintain a throttle vacuum, they are not subjected to the same <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> effects. This is partly why non-turbo diesel engined vehicles can coast in-gear for longer than an equivalent gasoline engine.|$|E
50|$|Improper <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> {{technique}} {{can cause}} the wheels to skid (also called shift-locking), especially on slippery surfaces such as ice or snow, {{as a result of}} too much deceleration.

If the driver reduces <b>engine</b> <b>braking</b> by shifting back up, or disengaging the clutch on a manual transmission, traction can be regained.|$|E
