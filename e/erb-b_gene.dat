30|$|It is {{well known}} that CAR-modified T cells face a unique set of {{challenges}} during the targeting of solid tumors (Gilham et al., 2012). The development of CAR-modified NK cells must overcome similar obstacles. Glioblastoma {{is one of the most}} lethal primary brain malignancies in adults and children, because of its highly invasive and metastatic characteristics (Magana-Maldonado et al., 2016). Neuroblastoma is a neuroendocrine tumor of early childhood and is the most common extracranial solid tumor that occurs in children (Matthay et al., 2016). It has been reported that NK 92 cells have been developed to treat both glioblastoma and neuroblastoma in vitro. These cells have been modified to target neuroblastoma using a GD 2 (disialoganglioside)-specific CAR (Esser et al., 2012) and to target glioblastoma using either an ErbB 2 (origin in the <b>ERB-B</b> <b>gene</b> responsible for avian erythroblastosis virus)-CAR (Zhang et al., 2016) or an EGFR-CAR (Han et al., 2015). Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether CAR-modified NK 92 cells can treat both glioblastoma and neuroblastoma in clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|Avian erythroblastosis virus, a {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} erythroblastosis and sarcomas in infected birds, possesses two host cell-derived genes [viral (v) erb-A and erb-B]. Although v-erb-B {{seems to be}} responsible for oncogenic transformation, v-erb-A might have an enhancing effect on transformation. In chickens, the natural host for avian erythroblastosis virus, cellular (c) erb-A and <b>erb-B</b> <b>genes</b> appear to be unlinked, but their chromosomal locations in other species are unknown. To ascertain the chromosomal location of c-erb genes in man and mouse, we analyzed interspecies somatic cell and microcell hybrids by Southern filter hybridization techniques using specific v-erb-A and v-erb-B probes. We found c-erb-A sequences on human chromosome 17 (17 p 11 [...] qter) and located c-erb-B on human chromosome 7 (7 pter [...] q 22). In contrast, both c-erb-A and c-erb-B reside on mouse chromosome 11...|$|R
30|$|MCF- 7 —human {{breast cancer}} cell line {{was from the}} ATCC. It {{was derived from the}} pleural {{effusion}} in tractu of the advanced, metastatic mammary gland epithelial carcinoma. It was not overexpressing the <b>Erb-B</b> 2 <b>gene,</b> but was overexpressing estrogen and progesterone receptors [20]. It was used as a negative control foe HER- 2 expressing cells. It was cultured in the base medium: Eagle’s minimum essential medium (ATCC) (catalog No. 30 - 2003), which was supplemented with 10  % human serum, 0.01  mg/ml human recombinant insulin (hrI), 100  units/ml penicillin, 200  mg/ml streptomycin, in the cell culture 75  cm 2 flask (Corning) (catalog # 430641) in the incubators providing 95  % air and 5  % CO 2 at 37  °C. The medium renewal was two times per week and cultures divided as outlined above.|$|R
30|$|SK-BR- 3 —human {{breast cancer}} cell line {{was from the}} American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) [19]. It {{was derived from the}} pleural {{effusion}} in tractu of the advanced, metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. It was overexpressing <b>Erb-B</b> 2 <b>gene</b> to display HER- 2 receptors. It was cultured in the base medium: McCoy’s 5 a medium (ATCC) (catalog No. 30 - 2007), which was supplemented with 10  % human serum, 100  units/ml penicillin, 200  mg/ml streptomycin, in the cell culture 75  cm 2 flask (Corning) (catalog # 430641) in the CO 2 incubators at 37  °C. The medium renewal was performed two times per week. To split, the cultures were briefly rinsed with 0.25  % (w/v) trypsin, 0.53  mM EDTA solution to remove all traces of serum which contains trypsin inhibitor and thereafter treated with that solution. After dispensing into new flasks, they were grown in the same conditions.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new system for {{simultaneous}} morphological and molecular analysis of thick tissue samples. The system is composed of a computer assisted microscope and a JAVA-based image display, analysis and visualization program that allows acquisition, annotation, meaningful storage, three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis of structures of interest in thick sectioned tissue specimens. We describe the system in detail and illustrate its use by imaging, reconstructing and analyzing two complete tissue blocks which were differently processed and stained. One block was obtained from a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lumpectomy specimen and stained alternatively with Hematoxilyn and Eosin (H&E), and with a counterstain and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) to the <b>ERB-B</b> 2 <b>gene.</b> The second block contained a fully sectioned mammary gland of a mouse, stained for Histology with H&E. We show how the system greatly reduces the amount of interaction required for the acquisition and analysis and is therefore suitable for studies that require morphologically driven, wide scale (e. g., whole gland) analysis of complex tissue samples or cultures...|$|R
