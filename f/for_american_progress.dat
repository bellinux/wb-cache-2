5000|$|The {{military}} and civilian death toll has mounted, the Iraqi insurgency has shifted to what many observers have labeled a civil war, {{and the politics of}} Iraq have remained unstable, many politicians and citizens from the United States and across the world have begun pushing for the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq. Significant <b>American</b> calls <b>for</b> withdrawal include the Iraq Study Group Report and the Center <b>for</b> <b>American</b> <b>Progress's</b> proposal <b>for</b> strategic reset. As of spring 2007, surveys showed a majority of Americans in support of a timetable for withdrawal. While up to 70 percent of Americans in one survey favored withdrawal, most prefer to leave gradually over 12 months, and 60 percent say the U.S. has a moral obligation to the Iraqi people. [...] In addition to voicing concerns over the human and financial costs of the war, supporters of withdrawal argue that the U.S. presence fosters ongoing violence by providing a target for al-Qaeda. It also allows Iraqi political leaders to avoid reaching a power-sharing agreement. The withdrawal will induce Iraq's neighbors to become more involved in quelling violence in the country and will relieve the strain on the U.S. military. [...] The withdrawal debate has brought comparison of Iraq and Vietnam wars.|$|R

25|$|With {{the economy}} {{recovering}} and major budget legislation behind him, President Obama began {{to shift to}} another priority, income and wealth inequality. From 1950 to 1979, the top 1% earned roughly a 10% {{share of the market}} or pre-tax income. However, this had risen to 24% by 2007, due to a combination of globalization, automation, and policy changes that weakened labor's bargaining position relative to capital. Further, the Center <b>for</b> <b>American</b> <b>Progress</b> estimated that 76% of the real income gains between 2009 and 2013 went to the top 1%.|$|E
25|$|The Obama {{transition}} {{organization was}} called the Obama-Biden Transition Project.

[...] Although in favor of moderate animal welfare measures, the AMP is often sharply critical of more radical animal rights groups such as PETA and the similarly named <b>Americans</b> <b>For</b> Medical Advancement.|$|R
50|$|Freeman Henry Morris Murray {{was born}} September 22, 1859 in Cleveland, Ohio. His father was John M. Murray and was of Scottish descent and was disowned {{by his family}} for marrying a black woman. John {{was a member of}} the 12th Ohio Infantry in the US Civil War and died at Bull Run Bridge on August 27, 1862 in the {{preamble}} to the Second Battle of Bull Run. His mother was Martha Bently, whose father was Irish and mother was Native American and African American. The couple owned a tailoring business in Cleveland. After his father died, his mother moved the family to Cincinnati, Ohio. After primary school, Murray attended Mount Pleasant Academy to train to be a teacher, one of three black students. He graduated from the academy in 1875. Murray was a bibliophile and learned French and Latin while continuing to work with his mother's father, Daniel Bentley in his whitewashing and painting business. Daniel Bentley was a major inspiration for Murray, having run a station on the underground railroad during the time of slavery and continuing to work <b>for</b> African <b>American</b> <b>progress</b> after the civil war. Soon, Murray moved to Covington, Kentucky to take a job teaching. He also took an apprenticeship for the Cincinnati Enquirer where he gained editing and publishing experience. Later in life he studied at Howard University in Washington, DC and eventually learned five languages.|$|R

25|$|Currently, {{federal funds}} are {{allocated}} to organizations that provide shelter {{and services to}} homeless youth in the United States through two major programs: The Runaway Youth Act, first implemented in 1974 and reauthorized in 2003 as the Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. According to the Center <b>for</b> <b>American</b> <b>Progress,</b> there are currently no mandates that these funds be provided to shelters that do not discriminate against LGBT youth, meaning some federal funding is provided towards organizations with explicitly anti-gay or anti-transgender stances, {{which can lead to}} denial of care or the sending of youth to sexual orientation conversion therapy. The government spends $4.2 billion annually on homeless assistance programs, but less than 5% of this funding ($195 million) is allocated for homeless children and youth. Only part of this goes to serve unaccompanied homeless youth, and none is specifically allocated to target the needs of LGBT homeless youth. There are currently no federal programs or policies designed to specifically meet the needs of or protect LGBT Homeless youth in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Democrats in {{both houses}} of Congress first {{attempted}} to end DADT by amending the Defense Authorization Act. On May 27, 2010, on a 234–194 vote, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Murphy amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. It provided for repeal of the DADT policy and created a process for lifting the policy, including a U.S. Department of Defense study and certification by key officials that the change in policy would not harm military readiness followed by a waiting period of 60 days. The amended defense bill passed the House on May 28, 2010. On September 21, 2010, John McCain led a successful filibuster against the debate on the Defense Authorization Act, in which 56 Senators voted to end debate, four short of the 60 votes required. Some advocates for repeal, including the Palm Center, OutServe, and Knights Out, opposed any attempt to block the passage of NDAA if it failed to include DADT repeal language. The Human Rights Campaign, the Center <b>for</b> <b>American</b> <b>Progress,</b> Servicemembers United and SLDN refused to concede that possibility.|$|E
