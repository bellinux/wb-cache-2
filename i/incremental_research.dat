40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{increase}} in the number of management articles published during the three last decades, there is a serious shortage of high-impact research in management studies. We contend that a primary reason behind this paradoxical shortage is the near total dominance of <b>incremental</b> gap-spotting <b>research</b> in management. This domination is even more paradoxical as it is well known that gap-spotting rarely leads to influential theories. We identify three broad and interacting key drivers behind this double paradox: institutional conditions, professional norms, and researchers' identity constructions. We discuss how specific changes in these drivers can reduce the shortage of influential management theories. We also point to two methodologies that may encourage and facilitate more innovative and imaginative research and revisions of academic norms and identities...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on {{the efficacy of the}} MMPI- 2 -RF under-reporting validity scales consists of two disparate lines of research: impact of naturally occurring under-reporting (CBIRUR) on substantive scale and collateral measure scores (Forbey & Lee, 2011 : Forbey et al., 2013) and predictive/incremental validity (Crighton et al., 2016; Sellbom & Bagby, 2008). Forbey and Lee (2011) and Forbey and colleagues (2013) examined the impact of CBIR-UR on substantive scales of the MMPI- 2 and MMPI- 2 -RF and external collateral measures and found those who engaged in CBIR-UR not only scored significantly lower on substantive scale but also on collateral measure scores. <b>Incremental</b> validity <b>research</b> suggests that L-r and K-r provide more predictive validity when used together, rather than independently (Crighton et al., 2016; Sellbom & Bagby, 2008). The current study expands upon previous research by connecting naturally occurring CBIR-UR and <b>incremental</b> validity <b>research.</b> A series of non-parametric ANOVAs were used to examine the impact of a varying number of MMPI- 2 -RF underreporting validity scales elevated (i. e., 0, 1, or 2) on scores of eight collateral measures administered along with the MMPI- 2 -RF in a group of 632 male correctional inmates. In general, results suggested that participants who engaged in an underreporting response style on the MMPI- 2 -RF also approached collateral measures with an underreporting response style. Generally, one validity scale elevation resulted in lower MMPI- 2 -RF scale scores and collateral measure scores than no validity scale elevations. In turn, two validity scale elevations resulted in lower substantive scale scores and collateral measure scores than one or no elevations. Overall results suggest that the combination of L-r and K-r add significant predictive validity in detecting CBIR-UR when both scales are elevated. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. A {{research}} program around {{the idea that}} information systems represent real-world systems was started almost twenty years ago.

Much of this research is being undertaken in Australia, and its influence has spread far and wide. Wand and Weber have used ontology, a discipline with roots in two thousand years of philosophy, to drive empirical work into how well information systems represent reality. In this paper the inspiration and progress of the program of research followed over the past two decades is described. The {{research program}} has recently progressed from its roots examining information systems development to examine enterprise systems and other package solutions. Further, it is beginning now to more fully use the depth of ontological theory available. However, there are challenges in how Bunge’s ontology has been used and opportunities for using complementary ontologies and for different conceptualisations of information systems...|$|R

Leighton strongly believes that if a technology is to help many people, {{it has to be}} deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup R&D investment. Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy. With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers, because he believes that <b>incremental</b> <b>research</b> in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances: ...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.|$|E

40|$|Self-theories of {{intelligence}} (SToI) are beliefs that individuals hold regarding {{the nature of}} their own intelligence. Two categories of SToI have previously been identified: an entity SToI and an <b>incremental</b> SToI. Previous <b>research</b> has established different patterns of learning behaviour associated with each, pertaining to effort, motivation, goal orientation and achievement. More positive outcomes are associated with an <b>incremental</b> SToI. Previous <b>research</b> has paid little attention to how SToI develop, despite the importance they hold for learning. The current research investigates whether an association exists between the SToI of a parent and the SToI of her/his child. Self-report questionnaires were completed by sixty parent-child dyads. Parent and year six children across seven schools acted as participants. SToI were measured using Dweck’s (2000) scale. Findings indicate a positive association between parent and child SToI when participants without a clear SToI are excluded. The association was stronger among dyads where the parent perceived that opinions within dyads would be similar, although unrelated to children’s perceptions. Significant agreement among parent-child dyads was observed on the factor they believe least likely to increase intelligence, but not the factor they consider most likely to increase intelligence. Parent-child dyads were in agreement about the type of praise a parent provides her/his respective child. No relationships were observed between the type of praise reported and child SToI. A more incremental parent SToI was associated with parents who report providing process-focussed praise than parents providing achievement-focussed praise.

40|$|Objective: The aim was {{to create}} a {{reliable}} information provisioning system in healthcare for both care and research processes, based on existing data standards and standardized electronic messages. The research question is: How can a Clinical Data Ware House (CDWH) be developed for standardized basic patient data, generic nursing data and data about oncology nursing, allowing management of Electronic Health Record data, electronic data exchange and data analytics? Materials and methods: The main instrument used was the Detailed Clinical Model (DCM) data standardization approach. Further, data communication utilized HealthLevel 7 v 3 (HL 7 v 3) messages, transported by Mirth Connect. In an <b>incremental,</b> design-oriented <b>research</b> project, CDWH-prototypes were constructed using Enterprise Architect, a HL 7 v 3 generator plug-in, SQL Server technology and PostgreSQL-based CDWH-technology. Results: The project resulted in 16 existing DCMs selected and 6 new DCMs defined. From those DCMs, a HL 7 v 3 message structure was generated and a CDWH created. Implementing specialized Data Marts (DM) a connection between the CDWH and one Electronic Health Record system was built. Discussion: Detailed Clinical Models improve data quality, yet building them consumes time and resources. Some required data codes could not be identified in time and dummy codes were used instead. The existence of unstructured medical data in legacy systems may proof to be an obstacle in the future. Conclusion: The project shows that using Detailed Clinical Models as the sole source for system development leads to a sound design for a CDWH and HL 7 v 3 messages, supporting a standards based health information system, suitable for multiple uses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{implicit}} {{theory of}} intelligence postulates that an individual's main {{beliefs about the}} fixed or malleable nature of intelligence {{have the power to}} determine the ways she or he acts in school settings and engages in learning. Some individuals tend to believe that a person is born with a certain fixed amount of intelligence that is uncontrollable and cannot be changed through effort (an entity theory). Others view intelligence as a malleable and controllable quality that can be developed through learning and study (an <b>incremental</b> theory). <b>Research</b> has found that the one's dominant implicit theory of intelligence has important consequences for goal orientation, attributions, affect and behavior in school context. Perceived self-efficacy is defined as people's beliefs about their capabilities to obtain an expected level of performance. In school, self-efficacy beliefs determine how students feel, think, motivate themselves and behave. Several studies have shown significant differences between male and female students in mathematics self-efficacy. The aims of this study are: 1. to investigate a possible relation between studentś implicit theories of intelligence and their mathematics self-efficacy beliefs; 2. to investigate gender differences in implicit theories of intelligence and mathematics self-efficacy beliefs. The participants were 108 college students aged 14 to 18 years, 63 females and 45 males. The assessment instruments were: The Implicit Theory of Intelligence Scale (ITIS; Abd-El Fattah & Yates, 2005); The Mathematics-Oriented Implicit Theory of Intelligence Scale (MOITIS); The Mathematics Self-Efficacy and Anxiety Questionnaire (MSEAQ) (May, 2009). The overall results showed significant gender differences in both constructs (dominant implicit theory of intelligence and mathematics self-efficacy beliefs). Significant correlations between implicit theories of intelligence and mathematics self-efficacy beliefs were observed. The results are discussed in a cultural, social and educational context.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} indicates that the contribution of management to economic growth has been largely obscured in theory and ignored in empirical work. In contrast, the place of the entrepreneur in the process of growth is well recognised and widely accepted. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} develop an argument for the place of management in the process of growth, and to maintain that in the modern free market economy management’s role is at least as important as that of the entrepreneur. Routine innovation in established firms is emphasised as a fundamental, normal part of management activity, and as such highlights the importance of management for economic growth. However, management is not homogeneous and the actions of managers differentially affect the performance outcomes of firms. Hence the quality of management, and the adoption of appropriate management practices, matters and directly impacts economic growth. In recognising that management makes a significant contribution, both in terms of ensuring efficiency in the use of factor inputs and effectiveness in terms of driving <b>incremental</b> innovation, new <b>research</b> is necessary at the firm level in order to develop this understanding...|$|R

Despite calls to use innovative approaches to address common diseases, an increasing majority of research funding goes toward "safe" <b>incremental</b> <b>research.</b> Counteracting this trend by nurturing novel and potentially transformative scientific research is challenging, it must be supported in competition with established research programs. Therefore, we propose a tool that helps to resolve the tension between safe but fundable research vs. high-risk but potentially transformational research. It does this by identifying hidden overlapping interest around novel molecular research topics. Specifically, it identifies paths of molecular interactions that connect research topics and hypotheses that would not typically be associated, as the basis for scientific collaboration. Because these collaborations are related to the scientists' present trajectory, they are low risk and can be initiated rapidly. Unlike most incremental steps, these collaborations have the potential for leaps in understanding, as they reposition research for novel disease applications. We demonstrate the use of this tool to identify scientists who could contribute to understanding the cellular role of genes with novel associations with Alzheimer's disease, which have not been thoroughly characterized, in part due to the funding emphasis on established research...|$|E
40|$|Barriers {{to climate}} change {{adaptation}} have received increased attention {{in recent years as}} researchers and policymakers attempt to understand their complex and interdependent nature and identify strategies for overcoming them. To date however, there is a paucity of research on barriers to transformative adaptation. Using two case studies of flood risk management from Ireland we identify and characterize barriers to transformative adaptation. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders connected to proposed transformative strategies in Skibbereen, County Cork and Clontarf, County Dublin. Across both case studies, where transformative strategies failed to materialize, we highlight three significant barriers that impede transformation including: (i) social and cultural values, particularly place attachment and identity; (ii) institutional reliance on technical expertise which fails to look beyond traditional technocratic approaches and; (iii) institutional regulatory practices. Findings illustrate that where social or institutional barriers emerge, transformation may more likely succeed through a series of <b>incremental</b> changes. This <b>research</b> has practical implications for future adaptation planning as facilitating transformation through incrementalism requires flexible adaptation strategies that are responsive to changing social values over time. While focused on flood risk management, our findings have applicability for other sectors adapting {{to climate change}}...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} members' implicit theories of ability on group learning and the mediating role of several group process variables, such as goal-setting, effort attributions, and efficacy beliefs. Comparisons were between 15 groups with a strong incremental view on ability (high incremental theory groups), and 15 groups with a weak incremental view on ability (low incremental theory groups). Groups worked on a computer-based management simulation. The task required the groups to learn the underlying structure of the simulation {{to be able to}} control the system effectively. High incremental theory groups set more challenging group goals, attributed their performance more to effort, developed stronger group efficacy, and displayed steeper learning trajectories than low incremental theory groups. Group goals mediated the impact of group members' implicit theories on group learning. Exploratory analyses of the group communication process revealed that members of the high incremental theory groups communicated more openly about the task and maintained a stronger task focus compared with members of the low <b>incremental</b> theory groups. <b>Research</b> on group learning benefits from a stronger individual differences perspective that incooperates variables such as implicit theories of ability as determinants of emerging group processes and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Telephony is an Internet {{application}} {{that has the}} potential to radically alter the telecommunications environment. This application may affect traditional regulatory structures, subsidy structures, business models, etc. Today, users can transmit telephonelike voice traffic over the Internet at zero incremental price, unlike circuit switched telephony, which has a per-minute <b>incremental</b> price. This <b>research</b> was carried out to determine whether Internet Telephony (Itel) was a fundamentally cheaper approach to the interoffice transmission and switching of voice, or whether the price difference was the result of an implicit regulatory subsidy. This paper is intended to be a first estimate of the switching and interoffice transmission costs for Itel and circuit switched networks. To evaluate these costs, we build a properly dimensioned "green fields" network for an area and a population equivalent to the US state of Rhode Island in both technologies and compared the costs. We find that the switching and transmission costs for Itel are approximately 50 % lower than the costs for circuit switching. We further find that this cost difference is largely due to the reduced interoffice transmission capacity required by Itel and not due to assymetrical regulatory treatment...|$|R
