5|$|Despite all this, Kurt and Blaine do {{get back}} {{together}} in a romaintic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, Love Love Love, which is <b>incidentally</b> the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} is caught <b>incidentally</b> by bottom trawlers, recreational anglers, and rarely squid fishers. Though edible, {{it is not}} a valued catch and is usually discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Stefan Matthew Wever (born 22 April 1958) is {{a former}} {{professional}} baseball pitcher. He made his Major League Baseball debut, <b>incidentally</b> his only game, with the New York Yankees in , and had a 0–1 record a 27.00 earned run average (ERA), and two strikeouts in that game.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} battery is the injury potential created in a muscle {{when it is}} damaged, although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries; the potential being caused <b>incidentally</b> due to the dissection of the frog's muscles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected in the seventeenth century in the area around Yaroslavl, <b>incidentally</b> famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more {{complicated}} bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|Chang'an was {{the center}} of the central government, the home of the {{imperial}} family, and was filled with splendor and wealth. However, <b>incidentally</b> it was not the economic hub during the Tang dynasty. The city of Yangzhou along the Grand Canal and close to the Yangtze River was the greatest economic center during the Tang era.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they should have had two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's decisions were questionable. <b>Incidentally,</b> the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Eskimo was {{the first}} feature film to be shot in a Native American {{language}} (Inupiat), and the first feature film shot in Alaska. The film also <b>incidentally</b> documented many of the hunting and cultural practices of Native Alaskans. The production for the film was based at Teller, Alaska, where housing, storage facilities, a film laboratory, and other structures were built to house the cast, crew, and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught <b>incidentally</b> in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the blotchy swellshark adapts {{readily to}} captivity and has {{reproduced}} in public aquariums. This species is caught <b>incidentally</b> by Japanese and Taiwanese bottom trawlers {{and brought to}} market. Intensive commercial fishing within its range do not yet appear to have impacted its numbers, but until more data are available the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, a local street, Durant Avenue, {{was renamed}} to Detective Russel Timoshenko Way in the detective's honor. <b>Incidentally,</b> {{following}} the controversial decision to rename a street to Sean Bell Way for police shooting victim Sean Bell, some community members had recommended {{doing the same}} for Timoshenko. However, the latter case had attracted much less media attention.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured <b>incidentally</b> in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught <b>incidentally</b> by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|<b>Incidentally,</b> Turner's {{favorite}} {{sport is}} soccer, not football. He is {{also interested in}} foreign cultures and expressed regret at being unable to spend a semester abroad because of college football. Turner said that, dependent upon the outcome of his football career, {{he would like to}} attend the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He also got to meet his childhood idol David Beckham while at the 2010 South Africa world cup.|$|E
5|$|<b>Incidentally,</b> the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely <b>incidentally</b> because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people with}} AML may {{experience}} {{swelling of the}} gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue. Rarely, {{the first sign of}} leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma. Occasionally, a person may show no symptoms, and the leukemia may be discovered <b>incidentally</b> during a routine blood test.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding {{has only}} a small segment of motorway. Part of the M62 serves to link the Hull area to West Yorkshire and the {{national}} motorway network, while the M18 <b>incidentally</b> passes the district border near Goole. Primary roads in the district include the A63, A164, A165, A1034, A166, A1033 and the A1079.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} {{is frequently}} caught <b>incidentally</b> by trawlers of Australia's South East Trawl Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, but probably high, rate of survival. Since this species {{does not appear}} to be threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, <b>incidentally</b> revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|The name Giacomo Meyerbeer {{first became}} known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto—premiered in Venice in 1824 and {{produced}} in London and Paris in 1825; <b>incidentally,</b> {{it was the}} last opera ever written to feature a castrato, and the last to require keyboard accompaniment for recitatives. This 'breakthrough' in Paris was exactly what Meyerbeer had been aiming for over the past ten years; he had been carefully preparing for it, developing contacts, and fully reaped his reward.|$|E
5|$|The quagga {{catshark}} is harmless {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught <b>incidentally</b> by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. <b>Incidentally,</b> the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of <b>incidentally</b> found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} <b>incidentally</b> on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught <b>incidentally</b> in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught <b>incidentally</b> by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught <b>incidentally</b> by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had <b>incidentally</b> noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{have been}} made by the Food and Agricultural Organization to improve {{relations}} between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development. As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which <b>incidentally</b> also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce gum arabic, and also from fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught <b>incidentally</b> in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|For example, Erik Pogosyants {{composed}} the study at right, with White {{to play and}} win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (which {{is not the best}} move – in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). <b>Incidentally,</b> the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Nesbitt had {{the lead}} role as the father {{character}} Tony Hughes in harrowing BBC drama series The Missing, alongside Frances O'Connor (as his wife/ex-wife, Emily Hughes/Walsh) and Tchéky Karyo (as Julien Baptiste, leading French police investigator). The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers {{as to what happened}} to their son and why. <b>Incidentally,</b> Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film The Way (2010).|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught <b>incidentally</b> by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Jacob (2005) {{attempts}} {{to establish a}} genealogical relationship between Tuisto and Ymir based on etymology and a comparison with (post-)Vedic Indian mythology: as Tvastr, through his daughter Saranyū and her husband Vivaswān, {{is said to have}} been the grandfather of the twins Yama and Yami, so Jacob argues that the Germanic Tuisto (assuming a connection with Tvastr) must originally have been the grandfather of Ymir (cognate to Yama). <b>Incidentally,</b> Indian mythology also places Manu (cognate to Germanic Mannus), the Vedic progenitor of mankind, as a son of Vivaswān, thus making him the brother of Yama/Ymir.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught <b>incidentally</b> by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are <b>incidentally</b> found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
