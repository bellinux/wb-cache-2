500|$|Markus, {{talking about}} the series place in the greater {{architecture}} of the MCU in January 2015 said [...] "you really only need to drop the tiniest bit of hint and its connected. [...] You don't have to go, [...] "Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!" ... Everything is enhanced just {{by the knowledge that}} its all connected." [...] The season introduces the Red Room and the origins of the Black Widow program, which will eventually produce Natasha Romanoff, who appears in multiple MCU films portrayed by Scarlett Johansson. Although the origins of the program are explored, the term [...] "Black Widow" [...] is never used in the series. Agent Carter also explores the origins of the Hydra-led Winter Soldier program, as seen by the <b>end</b> <b>tag</b> in [...] "Valediction" [...] when Zola approaches Faustus about mind control.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode {{a score of}} 8.3 out of 10, {{indicating}} a 'great' episode, praising the 'May vs. May' fight as [...] "the best fight scene this show has ever done", and noting Tancharoen's direction {{as well as the}} improved visual effects from the previous season used for the sequence. He also highlighted the character development for Fitz and Coulson, and found the <b>end</b> <b>tag</b> made Whitehall feel [...] "truly menacing and powerful". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B+', praising Tancharoen's direction and the 'May vs. May' fight as [...] "downright exhilarating", as well as the episode's focus on [...] May and her relationship with Coulson. He did, however, criticize the Fitz subplot, calling it [...] "forgettable" [...] and predictable. Joseph McCabe, writing for Nerdist, positively compared the episode to the film To Catch a Thief and the series The Avengers, and called the 'May vs. May' fight the highlight of the episode, action-wise. He also found the conclusion of Fitz's story in the episode to be [...] "a bittersweet high". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix found the episode to deal with many elements the series was criticized for in the first season in a superior way, calling it [...] "hoaky and retro", but saying [...] "I don't much care, because the extended May vs. [...] "May" [...] brawl in and around the hotel room was such a treat." ...|$|E
50|$|An arbor knot is tied {{by first}} passing the line around the reel arbor. The <b>tag</b> <b>end</b> is then tied in an {{overhand}} knot around the running line.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for boosting antimicrobial peptides through <b>end</b> <b>tagging</b> with hydrophobic oligopeptide stretches is demonstrated. Focusing on two peptides derived from kininogen, GKHKNKGKKNGKHNGWK (GKH 17) and HKHGHGHGKHKNKGKKN (HKH 17), tagging resulted in enhanced killing of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and fungal Candida albicans. Microbicidal potency increased with tag length, also in plasma, and was larger for Trp and Phe stretches than for aliphatic ones. The enhanced microbicidal effects correlated {{to a higher}} degree of bacterial wall rupture. Analogously, tagging promoted peptide binding to model phospholipid membranes and liposome rupture, particularly for anionic and cholesterol-void membranes. Tagged peptides displayed low toxicity, particularly in the presence of serum, and resisted degradation by human leukocyte elastase and by staphylococcal aureolysin and V 8 proteinase. The biological relevance of these findings was demonstrated ex vivo and in vivo in porcine S. aureus skin infection models. The generality of <b>end</b> <b>tagging</b> for facile boosting of antimicrobial peptides without the need for post-synthesis modification was also demonstrated...|$|R

For example, SGML made <b>end</b> <b>tags</b> (or start-tags, or even both) optional in certain contexts, because its developers thought markup would be done manually by overworked support staff who would appreciate saving keystrokes.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} differences between HTML and XHTML is the rule that all tags must be closed: empty HTML tags such as [...] must either be closed with a regular end-tag, or replaced by a special form: [...] (the space before the '/' on the <b>end</b> <b>tag</b> is optional, but frequently used because it enables some pre-XML Web browsers, and SGML parsers, to accept the tag). Another is that all attribute values in tags must be quoted. Finally, all tag and attribute names within the XHTML namespace must be lowercase to be valid. HTML, on the other hand, was case-insensitive.|$|E

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{file format}} is ASN.1, with tag/length/value blocks.
