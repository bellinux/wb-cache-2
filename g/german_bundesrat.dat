This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat</b> decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} in Lower Saxony had larger significance than {{just in the}} state itself. Defeat for the Social Democrats in the election would mean they lost their slim majority in the upper house of the <b>German</b> parliament, the <b>Bundesrat.</b> It was thought this might cause the collapse of Gerhard Schröder's national coalition government between the Social Democrats and the Green Party.|$|R

50|$|The Bundeshaus (Federal House) is a {{building}} complex in Bonn, Germany, {{which served as}} the Provisional Parliament House of the Federal Republic of Germany, and thus {{the seat of the}} <b>German</b> Bundestag and <b>Bundesrat,</b> from 1949 until 1999. The main building, constructed between 1930 and 1933, served as a Pedagogical Academy {{until the end of the}} Second World War. After the resolution of the Hauptstadtfrage (Capital Question) in 1949 in favor of Bonn, the structure was converted into the provisional seat of the Bundestag and Bundesrat.|$|R
50|$|When the insurrection {{broke out}} in the Elbe duchies (1848) he left the Danish service, and offered his {{services}} to the provisional government of Kiel, an offer that was not accepted. In 1849, accordingly, he re-entered the service of Denmark, was appointed a royal chamberlain and in 1850 sent to represent the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein at the restored federal diet of Frankfurt. Here he came into intimate touch with Bismarck, who admired his statesmanlike handling of the growing complications of the Schleswig-Holstein Question. With the radical Eider-Dane party he was utterly out of sympathy; and when, in 1862, this party gained the upper hand, he was recalled from Frankfurt. He now entered the service of the Grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and remained {{at the head of the}} grand-ducal government until 1867, when he became plenipotentiary for the two Mecklenburg duchies in the council of the <b>German</b> Confederation (<b>Bundesrat),</b> where he distinguished himself by his successful defence of the medieval constitution of the duchies against Liberal attacks.|$|R

50|$|The Advisory Council {{consists}} of 16 {{members of the}} German Bundestag and 16 representatives of the German Bundesrat; the Bundesrat representatives must be members or political representatives {{of the government of}} a federal state. The members and deputy members of the Advisory Council are appointed by the federal government upon the proposal of the German Bundestag and the <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{members of}} the federal [...] "upper houses" [...] (the <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat</b> (Federal Council) and the European Council) are neither elected nor {{appointed}} but comprise members or delegates of the governments of their constituents. The United States had a similar system until 1913, where prior to the 17th Amendment, Senators were delegates of the state elected by the state legislatures rather than the citizens.|$|E
50|$|After the Baden-Württemberg general {{elections}} of 2011 Schmid became Deputy Minister-President {{of the state}} of Baden-Württemberg, as well as its Minister of Financial and Economic Affairs. In this capacity, he was {{also a member of the}} German-French Friendship Group set up by the <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat</b> and the French Senate as well as of the German-Russian Friendship Group set up in cooperation with the Russian Federation Council.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a variety}} of ways an upper house's members are assembled: by direct or indirection election, appointment, heredity, or a mixture of these. The <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat</b> is {{composed}} of members of the cabinets of the German states, in most cases the state premier and several ministers; they are delegated and can be recalled anytime. In a very similar way the Council of the European Union is composed of national ministers.|$|E

50|$|Being {{a member}} of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, he has held various {{positions}} in the government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern since 1998 - first as a state secretary, later as Minister for Justice, and since 2006 as Minister for Social Affairs.

50|$|The {{seat of the}} Prussian House of Lords on Leipziger Straße {{was inaugurated}} in 1904. Both {{buildings}} were built back-to-back according to plans designed by Friedrich Schulze, they intercommunicate via a common restaurant wing. Upon the Nazi Machtergreifung, the Herrenhaus building served as an annex of the neighbouring Ministry of Aviation and Hermann Göring's Preußenhaus foundation. After World War II it housed several departments of the (East) German Academy of Sciences and since 29 September 2000 is {{the seat of the}} <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since its inauguration on 10 November 1920, {{the deputies}} of Bundesrat have never {{achieved}} {{the status of}} a counterbalance in relation to the National Council. Over the decades the role of the Federal Council as a mere adjunct of the Austrian parliament has led to several discussions upon regulatory reforms, towards an actual representation of the states' governments modeled on the <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat</b> or the complete abolition of the second chamber. So far, the concept has been maintained as a manifestation of Austria's federal system.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, or in {{addition}} to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the <b>German</b> <b>Bundesrat</b> and in the Council of the European Union. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.|$|E
