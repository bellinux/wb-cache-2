5|$|The Boggs' {{neighbors are}} curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a {{neighborhood}} barbecue welcoming Edward. Most {{of the neighbors}} are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a background or <b>financial</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|The New York Giants, an American {{football}} team which {{plays in the}} National Football League (NFL), have had a long, and at times turbulent <b>financial</b> <b>history.</b> The Giants were founded in 1925 by businessman and bookmaker Tim Mara with an investment of 500 US$, {{and became one of}} the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara passed ownership of the team on to his sons Wellington and Jack after the 1929 Stock Market Crash to insulate the team from creditors. At first the Mara sons owned the team in name only, but they took increasingly larger roles in the organization beginning in the mid-1930s. Tim Mara remained involved in the team's operations until his death in 1959, when his sons assumed full control of the club. After Jack's passing in 1965, his son, Tim, took over his share of the team.|$|E

40|$|Many {{households}} {{in developing countries}} lack formal <b>financial</b> <b>histories,</b> {{making it difficult for}} banks to extend loans, and for potential borrowers to receive them. However, many of these households have mobile phones, which generate rich data about behavior. This paper shows that behavioral signatures in mobile phone data predict loan default. We evaluate our approach using call records matched to lending outcomes in a middle income South American country. Individuals in the highest quartile of risk by our measure are 7. 4 times more likely to default than those in the lowest quartile. The method is predictive for both individuals with <b>financial</b> <b>histories,</b> and those without, who cannot be scored using traditional methods. We benchmark performance on our sample of individuals with (thin) financial histories: our method performs no worse than models using credit bureau information. The method can form the basis for new forms of lending that reach the unbanked...|$|R

Note that online activities and <b>financial</b> <b>histories</b> represent different types of confidential information. Merging them into one organization will create major public concern. Furthermore, according to (Padilla and Pagano 2000), sharing default cases among lenders has a disciplinary effect on borrowers, which will be reduced if other information is also shared. Allowing credit bureaus to hold some powerful financial information will help maintain the disciplinary effect in the finance domain. We {{do not want to}} extend the disciplinary effect to all dimensions of online activities. Two types of credit services serving relatively different market segments may better benefit society.|$|R

Our information architecture was developed for juvenile justice and medical patient records, but is usable in other application domains such as personal resumes, <b>financial</b> <b>histories,</b> or customer support. Our model groups personal history events into aggregates that are contained in facets (e. g., doctor visits, hospitalizations, or lab tests). Crosslinks enable representation of arbitrary relationships across events and aggregates. Data attributes, such as severity, can be mapped by data administrators to visual attributes such as color and line thickness.
