As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: she had said she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E

Though {{the university and the}} laboratory had difficult relations many times since their first World War II contract, {{this was the first time}} that the university <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> compete for management of the laboratory. The University of California decided to create a private company with the Bechtel Corporation, Washington Group International, and the BWX Technologies to bid on the contract to operate the laboratory. The UC/Bechtel led corporation—Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS)—was pitted against a team formed by the University of Texas System partnered with Lockheed-Martin. In December 2005, the Department of Energy announced that LANS had won the next seven-year contract to manage and operate the laboratory.|$|E

During the off-season, the New York Rangers of the NHL invited Daavettila to participate in a development camp for their recent draftees and other prospects. [...] "It was the hardest I've <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> push myself as far as conditioning and the longevity of it", said Daavettila.

500|$|Ruby later {{starts to}} have {{feelings}} for Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell). Of the storyline Breeds states: [...] "It's {{going to be}} the easiest thing I've <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do. There's no acting involved at all. But he's got a girlfriend so Ruby has {{to find a way to}} justify going after someone who has a girlfriend. So that's kind of hard. But he's the hero. She believes he's the love of her life. I guess with that in mind you wouldn't let anything get in the way of that. Who knows, he might be." [...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E
500|$|A {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} of the Dino De Laurentiis' film, Flash Gordon, written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Al Williamson, was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats {{to coincide with the}} film's release. A photograph of actor Sam J. Jones, who played Flash Gordon, was pasted into the original cover art. It was serialized in three issues of Whitman's Flash Gordon comic book, #31–33, March–May 1981. Alden McWilliams inked the backgrounds for the last 25 pages. [...] According to Williamson, [...] "It was the hardest job I <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do in my life." [...] He then began drawing the Star Wars comic strip in February 1981 following Alfredo Alcala's tenure, with Goodwin writing. [...] He drew the daily and Sunday feature until March 11, 1984, when the strip was canceled.

To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it.

500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do.

500|$|Since Fear of a Black Planet {{was first}} released, {{it has been}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} and most important hip hop albums of all time, as well as a culturally significant work. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that [...] "as a piece of music, this is the best hip-hop has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer", calling it [...] "a remarkable piece of modern art, a record that ushered in the '90s in a hail of multi-culturalism and kaleidoscopic confusion". Alex Ross cited it as one of [...] "the most densely packed sonic assemblages in musical history", while [...] Q said it [...] "achieved the near impossible by being every bit as good as its predecessor". In the opinion of Kembrew McLeod, Public Enemy had worked with production equipment that would seem primitive decades later but still managed to invent new [...] "techniques and workarounds that electronics manufacturers never imagined". Sputnikmusic staff writer Nick Butler said the album remained an enduring and vital work in a genre that [...] "has a habit of moving at such a pace that records date in a matter of years".|$|E
500|$|Molyneux {{said that}} might have been [...] "insanely ambitious" [...] with regard to the {{standards}} they set themselves for the graphics, because the system requirements were high and much of the custom software needed to be written. One such program was a terrain-editing tool named Leadhead. He stated that they went from [...] "bizarre ideas", to [...] "the best game I have ever seen". The villagers' artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to the Village Centre as there was no limit on the number of villagers. Molyneux said of the creature's artificial intelligence, [...] "part of the game itself learns from everything you do and tailors itself to you", and described the creature as [...] "an astonishing piece of work". He also commented that the last months of development were [...] "the hardest any of us has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work", and that [...] "without the right team, this game never would have happened." [...] The models for the trees, bushes, and other landscape features were created in 3D Studio Max, and initial graphics development was done in 2D using Adobe Photoshop. Later development was done using other custom software. Clan multiplayer, where multiple players play as one god, was developed in a rush; its interface had to be developed in two weeks. Black & Whites online community was handled by two servers in London, where the clan creatures were stored to minimise the possibility of cheating.|$|E
500|$|McGrady {{was known}} for his laid-back {{demeanor}} and scoring prowess; he once scored 41 points in a game despite being asleep right until tip-off, a performance that inspired the nickname [...] "The Big Sleep". Many of his contemporaries, including Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce, have called him {{one of the most difficult}} players that they <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> guard. His playing style has been compared to that of George Gervin; both players made scoring appear easy with their [...] "smooth" [...] approach to the game. At his peak, McGrady was an explosive player capable of finishing at the rim over the defense; in a piece for ESPN, Zach Lowe elaborated, [...] "He glided through the lane, crouched into traffic, and accelerated suddenly -- almost violently -- through a forest of slower-moving forms, and to the rim." [...] McGrady would frequently pull up for deep three-pointers over unsuspecting defenders, making him a threat to score from anywhere on the court. These qualities, in addition to his ability to survey the floor and make accurate pocket passes when necessary, have led analysts to describe him as being ahead of his time; in 2017, ESPN's Amin Elhassan remarked that McGrady was built for the style of positionless basketball that was being played in the modern era. On the defensive side of the ball, McGrady's effort was less consistent, but he demonstrated the ability to raise his level in meaningful games, such as during the playoffs against the Mavericks, where he often drew the assignment of guarding Dirk Nowitzki.|$|E
