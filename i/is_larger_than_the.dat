5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> two at the sides.

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> female.|$|E
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> jewellery.|$|E

At least 62 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This {{does not include the}} hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The right lung of {{the river}} otter <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two for the left. Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, {{the length of the}} trachea {{of the river}} otter is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the river otter is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference {{may be due to}} a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km in diameter.|$|E

5|$|The Cunard Building's {{architectural}} style can be generally {{described as a}} mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, {{with a degree of}} Beaux-Arts influence on the building's structural form. Willink and Caldwell's designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around the building itself and, as the building itself <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.|$|E
5|$|The floury baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E
