30|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in processes for thin silicon solar cells. One of these is the PSi process, which has been initially presented decades ago [2 – 4]. An essential part in this process is the etching of the porous silicon double layer, which consists of a starting and a separation layer. The separation layer is the place where the deposited epitaxial layer will be detached from the substrate. The detachability {{is a function of the}} homogeneity of the porous silicon in the separation layer. Therefore, the formation of the porous layers is one of the crucial steps in the PSi process. Homogeneous pore formation can be achieved only with constant etching parameters. This can be realized by keeping the composition of the <b>etching</b> <b>bath</b> constant, as variations in the chemical composition of the bath require a modification of the etching parameters. This adjustment is a time-consuming process and requires comprehensive knowledge of the behavior of the etching process itself. By keeping the chemical composition of the bath constant, no adjustment of the etching parameters is necessary, and thus, homogeneous pore formation can be achieved. However, the chemical composition can change due to etching reactions, evaporation, dilution, or a combination of these factors. Therefore, periodical analysis of the <b>etching</b> <b>bath</b> components is required.|$|E
30|$|For sample preparation, {{a buffer}} {{solution}} (TISAB II from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) {{is added to}} the diluted <b>etching</b> <b>bath</b> sample. The adjustment of the pH to a suitable range before analysis is necessary for precise measurements. The optimal pH for F-ISE measurements is about 5.5, which is due to the formation of HF and HF 2 - and the interference from OH- outside of this range [11]. We found a volume ratio of 50 : 1 (diluted sample:buffer) to be sufficient for pH adjustment. A relative error of 1.5 [*]% with respect to the undiluted samples has been determined.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} silicon IC {{technology}} in producing {{a wide variety}} of microstructures relies heavily on the orientation dependant etching observed for silicon in alkaline media. Despite the rapid growth of this industry, the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms by which anisotropic etching occurs remain poorly understood. The most common etchant systems in use are ethylenediamine-pyrocatechol-water (EPW) and potassium hydroxide-isopropanol-water (KOH-IPA), and whilst these systems are highly plane selective they each have distinct disadvantages. The occurrence of inhomogeneities such as micropyramids and pits on the surface of etched substrates is a particularly disadvantageous characteristic of many alkaline etching systems. A complete understanding of the chemical and electrochemical anisotropic etching mechanisms is essential in order to obtain more reproducible etching, improved etch rate ratios and the development of more reliable <b>etching</b> <b>baths.</b> Wet chemical <b>etching</b> experiments to evaluate the etching rates for the different alkali metal cations have shown that similar etch rates are observed for LiOH, NaOH and KOH but those of RbOH and CsOH are significantly lower. The presence of impurities was shown to worsen the etched wafer's surface finish obtained in these <b>etching</b> <b>baths.</b> Additives have been shown to dramatically improve the surface finish with the presence of IPA in conjunction with etchant oxygenation virtually eliminating all surface defects. Electrochemical experiments were used to assess the electrochemical behaviour of Si p-(100) in of {{a wide variety of}} etchants and variations were seen according to the etchant used. A. C impedance spectroscopy showed a variation in the flat-band potential (V_F_B) according to alkali metal hydroxide etchant used. These trends were similarly observed in the presence of isopropanol. Oxygenation was observed to reproducibly alter the flat-band potentials. A. c impedance spectroscopic studies additionally confirmed the presence of surface states at the interface resulting in Fermi level pinning. Whilst the mechanisms of etching appear to be similar for LiOH, NaOH and KOH, those of RbOH and CsOH appear to be different or more complex.

The interaction of these surfaces with different environments {{has also been}} studied in detail. The sensor assembly relevant to the semiconductor industry utilizes a silicon-based sensor to detect trace levels of metallic contaminants in hydrofluoric acid. The sensor performance with respect to two non-contaminating reference electrode systems was evaluated. In the first case, conductive diamond {{was used as a}} reference electrode. In the second case, a dual silicon electrode system was used with one of the silicon-based electrodes protected with an anion permeable membrane behaving as the quasi reference electrode.

The sensor assembly developed for the environmental application makes use of a novel method for the detection of Ni 2 +using attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique. The nickel infrared sensor was prepared on a silicon ATR crystal uniformly coated by a 1. 5 micron Nafion film embedded with dimethylglyoxime (DMG) probe molecules. The detection of Ni 2 + was based on the appearance of a unique infrared absorption peak at 1572 cm- 1 that corresponds to the C=N stretching mode in the nickel dimethylglyoximate, Ni(DMG) 2, complex. The suitable operational pH range for the nickel infrared sensor is between 6 - 8. The detection limit of the nickel infrared sensor is 1 ppm in the sample solution of pH= 8. ATR - FTIR spectroscopy was used to study the changes that the hydride mode underwent when subjected to different environments. The presence of trace amounts of Cu 2 + in HF solutions was found to roughen the silicon surface as observed ATR-IR spectroscopy. The initial stages of oxidation in UPW and Cu 2 + / UPW was studied.

40|$|In {{conventional}} time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), {{a moving}} mirror {{is used as}} a reference optical delay line. This motion can result in instrument degradation, and in some situations it is preferable to have no moving parts. Stationary optical delay lines using a variety of methods have been proposed. Of particular interest, due to its low cost, is the use of a micro-photonic stationary optical delay line, made up of an addressable Stepped Mirror Structure (SMS) using a liquid crystal optical switch. Here the individual steps of the SMS can be selected by the liquid crystal array. For use in OCT, the discrete nature of the SMS needs to be overcome by having the step height less than the coherence length of the low coherent light source. Typical coherence lengths in current OCT systems are on the order of 10 μm. Hence, micrometer size steps require the use of a relevant fabrication method.

The comparative study of electrical parameters of the cells fabricated with conventional NaOH-IPA and the proposed cells brings out a significant improvement of parameters for solar cells. Open circuit voltage of 621.4  mV and a fill factor as high as 0.78 were the parameters achieved {{as a key for}} the high efficiency of (~ 16  %) crystalline silicon solar cell of area (125  mm ×  125  mm) compared to conventional NaOH-IPA approach due to its additional surface contaminant removal behavior. Moreover, FTIR analysis indicated that the Si–Cl bond created during texturing with NaOH–NaOCl solution finally helped in gettering during phosphorus diffusion with POCl 3 dopant. This Cl gettering helps in the improvement of open circuit voltage of a c-Si solar cell. We are probably the first group to report on such a novel idea of using NaOH–NaOCl solution for monocrystalline silicon surface texturing with formation of maskless inverted structured for solar cell fabrication of area 125  mm ×  125  mm and yield around 85  % in the conversion efficiency range 14.5 – 15.8  %, compared to 80  % yield in the efficiency range of 13.5 – 14.0  % of the conventional NaOH-IPA approach.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Photoelectrodes and photovoltaic devices have been prepared via multiple thin film deposition methods. Aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD), electrodeposition (ED), chemical bath deposition (CBD) and doctor blade technique (DB) {{have been used to}} deposit binary and ternary metal oxide films on FTO glass substrates. The prepared thin films were characterised by a combination of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), powder X-ray diffraction, mechanical strength tests and photochemical measurements. Nickel oxide (NiO) thin films prepared by AACVD were determined to have good mechanical strength. with a photocurrent of 7. 6 μA cm- 2 at 0 V and an onset potential of about 0. 10 V. This contrasted with the dark current density of 0. 3 μA cm- 2 at 0 V. These NiO samples have very high porosity with crystalline columns evidenced by SEM. In comparison with the AACVD methodology, NiO films prepared using a combination of ED and DB show good mechanical strength but a higher photocurrent of 24 μA cm- 2 at 0 V and an onset potential of about 0. 10 V with a significantly greater dark current density of 7 μA cm- 2 at 0 V. The characteristic features shown in the SEM are smaller pores compared to the AACVD method. Copper (II) oxide (CuO) and copper (I) oxide (Cu 2 O) films were fabricated by AACVD by varying the annealing temperature between 100 - 325 °C in air using a fixed annealing time of 30 min. It was shown by photocurrent density (J-V) measurements that CuO produced at 325 °C was most stable and provided the highest photocurrent of 173 μA cm- 2 at 0 V with an onset potential of about 0. 23 V. The alignment of zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-rods and nano-tubes fabricated by CBD {{have been shown to be}} strongly affected by the seed layer on the FTO substrate. SEM images showed that AACVD provided the best seed layer for aligning the growth of the nano-rods perpendicular to the surface. Nano-rods were successfully altered into nano-tubes using a potassium chloride <b>bath</b> <b>etching</b> method. NiO prepared by both AACVD and the combined ED/DB method were sensitized to absorb more of the solar spectrum using AACVD to deposit CuO over the NiO. A large increase in the photocurrent was observed for the p-type photoelectrode. These p-type photoelectrode showed a photocurrent density of approximately 100 µA cm- 2 at 0 V and an onset potential of 0. 3 V. This photocathode was then used as a base to produce a solid state p-type solar cell. For the construction of the solid state solar cells several n-type semiconductors were used, these were ZnO, WO 3 and BiVO 4. WO 3 and BiVO 4 were successfully produced with BiVO 4 proving to be the optimum choice. This cell was then studied more in depth and optimised by controlling the thickness of each layer and annealing temperatures. The best solid state solar cell produced had a Jsc of 0. 541 μA cm- 2 (541 nA) and a Voc of 0. 14 V, TX 146 made up of NiO 20 min, CuFe 2 O 4 50 min, CuO 10 min, BiVO 4 27 min, using AACVD and then annealed for 30 min at 600 °C...|$|R

30|$|The {{macroporous}} silicon <b>etching</b> <b>bath</b> contains HF with {{an initial}} concentration of 1.5 [*]mol[*]L− 1 and acetic acid as a wetting agent. The F-ISE has been found here to generate precise results with no influence of the acetic acid. However, titration is not a suitable method for the HF determination in acetic acid containing etching baths. This is because the acetic acid is a buffering solution. Thus, addition of hydroxide ions (OH-) - {{as in the case}} of sodium hydroxide - or hydronium ions (H 3 O+) will not lead to a change in pH. Therefore, an adjustment of the pH in the required range is not possible, and no sufficient reaction of lanthanum nitrate with fluoride ions will occur. As a result, the HF content of acetic acid containing etching solutions can only be measured with F-ISE.|$|E

The mechanism by which tapering occurs may {{best be described as}} a control led separation of the photoresist/oxide interface which relates the lateral etch rate to the bulk etch rate. Depending on etching con-ditions, each beveled window edge consists of two or three distinct regions which comprise the final shape of the sloping taper. The dissolution reaction in all instances was found to be activation control led with an apparent act iva-tion energy of 9. 9 kcal/mole. Curves of etch rates as a function of temperature and HF molar i ty are presented and a quantitat ive relationship for etch rate in terms of these two parameters i given. It has recently been shown (1 - 5) that dilute solu...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResonant {{microelectromechanical}} {{systems are}} promising devices for real time and highly sensitive measurements. The sensitivity of such sensors to additional mass loadings {{which can be}} increased thanks to the miniaturisation of devices is of prime importance for biological applications. The miniaturisation of structures passes through a photolithographic process and wet chemical etching. So, this paper presents new results on the anisotropic chemical etching of the gallium arsenide (GaAs) crystal used for this application, in several solutions. This paper focuses on the micro/nanostructuration of the sensing surface to increase the sensor sensitivity. Indeed, this active surface will be biofunctionalized to operate in biological liquid media in view of biomolecules detection. Several experimental conditions of <b>etching</b> <b>bath</b> composition, concentration and temperature were examined to obtain a large variety of geometrical surfaces topographies and roughness. According to the orientation dependence of the chemical etching process, the experiments were also performed on various GaAs crystal plates. The bath 1 H 3 PO 4 : 9 H 2 O 2 : 1 H 2 O appeared to be particularly adapted to the fabrication of the GaAs microstructured membrane: indeed, the bath is highly stable, anisotropic, and, {{as a function of}} temperature, it allows the production of a large variety of GaAs surface topographies...|$|E
