50|$|Van Slingelandt was succeeded {{after his}} death in office in 1736 by Anthonie van der Heim as Grand Pensionary, be it after a {{protracted}} power struggle. He had to promise in writing that he would oppose the resurrection of the stadtholderate. He was a compromise candidate, maintaining good relations with all factions, even the Orangists.

50|$|Cyclone Ofa {{affected}} Western Samoa between February 1-4, {{with heavy}} rain, huge waves, sea spray, storm surge and wind gusts exceeding 150 km/h. This created {{an impact on}} the island nation that had not been encountered in over 100 years, while the entire population was left in a state of shock. Ahead of Ofa affecting Western Samoa, TCWC Nadi issued various gale and storm force wind warnings for Samoa, however due to communication and various other problems some of these warnings did not reach the Apia Observatory. Some of the warnings that did get through were distorted and contained strong wind warnings, rather than storm force wind warnings. As a result, it was not known what was broadcast to the public who were warned to <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> winds rather than storm force winds and thus TCWC Nadi was left with no doubt, that the correct precautionary measures may not have been taken.|$|E

50|$|Von Plauen did {{not take}} part in the Battle of Grunwald on July 15, 1410. Upon {{receiving}} the news of the Order's defeat, he took the initiative and assembled an army of 3,000 men to defend Marienburg, capital of the Order. He correctly suspected that it was where the victorious Polish and Lithuanian armies were headed. He also sent letters, acting as the Grand Master, to Germany asking for additional troops and money. Von Plauen arrived at Marienburg on time and energetically organized the defense. The Siege of Marienburg started on July 18 and remained until September 19, 1410. The King of Poland, Jogaila, did not <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> resistance and was not prepared for a long-term siege. The siege, holding Jogaila's army in place, helped to organize defensive forces in other parts of Prussia and gave time for relief to arrive from the Livonian Order and Germany. Jogaila had to retreat. Von Plauen ordered his forces to pursue the retreating Polish army and recaptured all fortresses (except those on the Polish-Prussian border) by the end of October.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} GTAP computable general {{equilibrium}} model {{to assess the impact}} of a Doha Development Agenda agreement on agricultural trade liberalisation. In particular, we examine the consequences for developing countries. The simulation incorporates further liberalisation in the areas of market access, export competition and domestic support. Most developing regions can <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> positive results from this liberalisation, however some suffer a decrease in welfare. The magnitude of the welfare effect for these countries depends on measures to be taken by developing countries themselves, and whether they will materialise must be uncertain. The results highlight the importance of the impact of further liberalisation of the erosion of preferential trading arrangements enjoyed by developing regions.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{quantify}} and to map the provision of ecosystem core services (ES) – tourism, genetic diversity and carbon sequestration – for a large Antarctic marine area, the Weddell Sea. Additionally, synergies and trade-offs between the ES were explored. The analyses conducted during this study covered both spatial and temporal correlations between pairs of ES, and between individual ES and sea ice coverage. Overall, service delivery in the studied seascape is distinctly heterogeneous, albeit there are areas where multiple benefits are provided simultaneously (“super hotspots”). Our findings indicate that in wide parts of the Weddell Sea, small scale conservation efforts may not achieve their intended goals. They also show that particularly sea ice cover restrains tourism, i. e. this sector may <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> growth in a future of global warming driven sea ice retreat...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{expected}} X-ray luminosity of stellar merger products {{several years after}} merger. The X-ray emission is assumed to result from magnetic activity. The extended envelope of the merger product possesses a large convective region and {{it is expected to}} rotate fast. The rotation and convection might give rise to an efficient dynamo operation, therefore we <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> magnetic activity. Using well known relations connecting magnetic activity and X-ray luminosity in other types of magnetically active stars, we estimate that the strong X-ray luminosity will start several years after merger, will reach a maximum of L_x~ 3 x 10 ^ 30 erg/sec, and will slowly decline on a time scale of ~ 100 years. We predict that X-ray emission from V 838 Mon which erupted in 2002 will be detected in 2008 with 20 hours of observation...|$|E
30|$|To ease interpretation, all regressors are centred {{around their}} sample averages, so that π 1 can be {{interpreted}} as the average unexplained gender pay gap in the full sample. The coefficients of main interest are π 2 and π 3, where π 2 gives the effect of strong product market competition on males’ wages, and π 3 is the difference in the competition effect across the sexes. We <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> competition to depress the overall rents accruing and thus workers’ wages in general. Moreover, strong competition should also confine employers’ ability to discriminate against women by sharing rents disproportionately with male workers (cf. Black and Strahan [2001]). Hence, we expect π 2 to have a negative sign and π 3 to have a positive sign, the latter indicating that strong competition reduces the gender pay gap by inducing a smaller adverse effect on females’ compared to males’ wages.|$|E
40|$|A set of {{ultrasonic}} experiments {{was carried}} out {{to determine the effects}} of horizontal and vertical fractures on full waveform acoustic logs. Boreholes of 1 cm diameter were drilled in aluminum blocks. Measurements were made with horizontal fractures of 0. 05 mm, 1. 0 mm, 2. 5 mm, and 4. 5 mm width and a vertical fracture of 1. 0 mm width. The horizontal fractures of even the smallest thickness significantly attenuate the P, S, and pseudo-Rayleigh waves. The Stoneley waves are the least attenuated, and attenuation increases with increasing fracture width. The vertical fracture attenuates Stoneley waves most significantly. Both scattering and fluid flow playa role in attenuation. The results may qualitatively be extended to inclined open fractures, where we <b>expect</b> <b>strong</b> attenuation of P and S waves and moderate attenuation of Stoneley waves.
