5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally liver biopsy. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral <b>haemorrhage</b> and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude <b>haemorrhage,</b> and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E
5|$|Usually, {{warfarin}} is avoided in {{the first}} trimester, and a low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin is substituted. With heparin, risk of maternal <b>haemorrhage</b> and other complications are still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier, so do not cause birth defects. Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.|$|E

5000|$|Retinal <b>haemorrhages,</b> {{especially}} mild ones {{not associated}} with chronic disease, will normally resorb without treatment. Laser surgery is a treatment option which uses a laser beam to seal off damaged {{blood vessels in the}} retina.

40|$|<b>Haemorrhages</b> in {{the course}} of {{cirrhosis}} and portal hypertension are surgical emergencies. Nevertheless medical treatment may be necessary both to revive the patient and temporarily to check the <b>haemorrhaging</b> itself. Some views are presented on the use of drugs, both those already in clinical use and others at the experimental stage, which appear to be effective in the treatment of <b>haemorrhaging</b> in portal hypertension (Vasopressin, glypressin, prostaglandin, somatostatin, propranolol, cimetidine and ranitidine) ...|$|R
5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain <b>haemorrhage</b> in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E
5|$|Between 2003 and 2004, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines {{received}} several reports of increased INR {{and risk of}} <b>haemorrhage</b> in people taking warfarin and cranberry juice.

The mechanism behind the interaction is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Whittle's son, Ivan Ernest, {{served as}} a private in the 2/33rd Australian Infantry Battalion. He was killed when the B-24 Liberator {{aircraft}} he was travelling in crashed into a marshalling yard at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 7 September 1943.

50|$|Duret <b>haemorrhages</b> are <b>haemorrhages</b> {{secondary}} to raised intracranial pressure with {{formation of a}} transtentorial pressure cone involving the front part of the cerebral peduncles, the cerebral crura.

40|$|Purpose The {{characteristic}} {{findings in}} accidental head injury consist of linear skull fracture, epidural haematoma, localized subdural haematoma, or cortical contusion {{because of a}} linear or translational impact force. Retinal <b>haemorrhages</b> have been found, although uncommon, in accidental head trauma. Methods We performed a retrospective study of 24 consecutive cases of children with severe head injuries caused by falls. Inclusion criteria were skull fractures and/or intracranial <b>haemorrhages</b> documented by computerized tomography. All patients underwent a careful ophthalmic examination including dilated indirect fundoscopy within the first 48 h following admission. Results No retinal <b>haemorrhages</b> {{could be found in}} patients whose accidents were plausible and physical and imaging findings were compatible with reported histories. Excessive bilateral retinal <b>haemorrhages</b> were found in only three children with the typical signs of shaken baby syndrome. In eight children, trauma had led to orbital roof fractures. Conclusions Retinal <b>haemorrhages</b> were not found in any of the patients with accidental trauma despite the severity of their head injuries. Hence, we add more evidence that there are strong differences between the ocular involvement in accidental translational trauma and those in victims of non-accidental trauma. Fall-related injuries carry a very low risk of retinal <b>haemorrhages...</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{post-mortem}} examination (necropsy), {{the most obvious}} gross lesion is subcutaneous oedema in the submandibular and pectoral (brisket) regions. Petechial <b>haemorrhages</b> are found subcutaneously and in the thoracic cavity. In addition, congestion and various degrees of consolidation of the lung may occur. Animals that die within 24-36 hours, have only few petechial <b>haemorrhages</b> on the heart and generalised congestion of the lung, while in animals that die after 72 hours, petechial and ecchymotic <b>haemorrhages</b> were more evident and lung consolidation are more extensive.|$|R
5|$|In 1888, Nobel was {{astonished}} to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral <b>haemorrhage.</b> He was 63 years old.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{lived with}} Smith {{and his wife}} for the {{majority}} of his childhood, and Smith taught the young Lennon to read, read him nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles. He also taught him to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ. Smith collapsed and died on a Sunday at his home of a liver <b>haemorrhage,</b> aged 52, and was buried in St Peter’s Church graveyard, Woolton.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} <b>haemorrhage,</b> {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} the likelihood that, in {{children under the}} age of 2  years, convulsions alone may cause retinal <b>haemorrhages.</b>  METHODS—Children under the age of 2  years admitted to hospital following convulsions, were examined within 48  hours of admission. The convulsions were classified by a paediatric neurologist and detailed ocular examination, including indirect ophthalmoscopy, was performed by an ophthalmologist. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Hanley's rule of three.  RESULTS— 32 consecutive children admitted with convulsions were examined; 10  of them were admitted following epileptic seizures and 22  following febrile convulsions. Two of the children with febrile convulsions were admitted in status epilepticus. None of these children had retinal <b>haemorrhages.</b> Therefore, using Hanley's rule of three, the upper limit of 95 % confidence interval of retinal <b>haemorrhages</b> following convulsions in {{children under the age}} of 2  years, is less than 10 / 100.  CONCLUSIONS—In {{children under the age of}} 2  years convulsions alone are unlikely to cause retinal <b>haemorrhages.</b> By combining the results of this study with those previously reported from this unit in older children, the upper limit of 95 % confidence interval of retinal <b>haemorrhages,</b> following convulsions in children under the age of 14  years, is less than 5 / 100. Therefore, the finding of retinal <b>haemorrhages</b> in a child admitted with a history of convulsion should trigger a meticulous search for other causes of these <b>haemorrhages,</b> particularly non-accidental injury.    Keywords: convulsions; retinal haemorrhages; non-accidental injury; infant...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} 4 -week-old boy with acute {{respiratory}} distress, due to massive <b>haemorrhages</b> in multiple thymic cysts. A right hemithymectomy was performed because of mechanical obstruction of the trachea by the cysts. The {{origin of the}} multilocular thymic cysts remained unclear. Most likely, these <b>haemorrhages</b> were caused by vitamin K deficiency, although the infant received vitamin K prophylaxis. In addition, he developed transient cholestasis, but the aetiology remained unclear. It is postulated that massive <b>haemorrhages</b> in thymic cysts produce large amounts of bilirubin, causing sludging of bile excretions in the liver. Four weeks after the operation, all laboratory findings were normal and 6 months after the operation the boy is still healthy. Conclusion This case report shows that respiratory distress in an infant {{can be caused by}} multiple <b>haemorrhages</b> in multilocular thymic cysts...|$|R

5|$|A {{few days}} afterwards, Blamey became seriously ill and {{received}} his field marshal's baton from McKell in a bedside {{ceremony at the}} Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. Blamey died there of hypertensive cerebral <b>haemorrhage</b> on 27 May 1951. His body lay in state at the Shrine of Remembrance, where 20,000 people filed past. Crowds estimated at 300,000 lined the streets of Melbourne at his state funeral. Ten of his lieutenant generals served as pallbearers: Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, John Northcott, Sydney Rowell, Stanley Savige, Vernon Sturdee and Henry Wells. His body was cremated at the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|In April 1957, his wife's health {{deteriorated}} {{and she was}} hospitalised. Although seriously ill, she recovered {{sufficiently to}} be moved home. On 4 May 1957, while preparing for his wife's homecoming, Kippenberger complained of a headache and then collapsed. Taken to hospital in a coma, he died the next day of a cerebral <b>haemorrhage.</b> He was buried on 7 May at Karori Cemetery in Wellington with full military honours. Ruth Kippenberger watched the funeral procession of her husband from her hospital window; she died ten years later.|$|E

Other sites of hypertensive <b>haemorrhaging</b> are the pons and the cerebellum. Lobar <b>haemorrhages</b> are more often associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the elderly. In the younger population, the presence of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) ruptures, tumours, infections or coagulopathies must be verified.|$|R
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the <b>haemorrhage</b> kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed <b>haemorrhage</b> of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or <b>haemorrhage</b> of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
