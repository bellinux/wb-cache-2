40|$|An optimal line {{pressure}} control {{algorithm was proposed}} for the fuel economy improvement of an AT-based parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). By performing lever analysis at each <b>gear</b> <b>step,</b> the required {{line pressure}} was obtained considering the torque ratio of the friction elements. In addition, the required line pressure of the mode clutch was calculated. Based on these results, the optimal line pressure map at each <b>gear</b> <b>step</b> of the EV and HEV modes was presented. Using the line pressure map, an optimal line pressure was performed for the AT input torque and mode. To investigate the proposed line pressure control algorithm, a HEV performance simulator was developed based on the powertrain model of the target HEV, and fuel economy improvement was evaluated. Simulation results showed that as the <b>gear</b> <b>step</b> became higher, the optimal line pressure control could reduce the hydraulic power loss, which gave a 2. 2 % fuel economy improvement compared to the existing line pressure control for the FTP- 72 mode...|$|E

50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} in mobile {{equipment}} are generally {{used for the}} transmission {{as an alternative to}} mechanical and hydrodynamic (converter) transmissions. The advantage is a stepless gear ratio (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible control of the gear ratio depending on the load and operating conditions. The hydrostatic transmission is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a hydrodynamic transmission. Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more <b>gear</b> <b>steps,</b> giving them characteristics close to the hydrostatic transmission.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research results}} of forming accuracy for diametrical sizes at <b>gear</b> shaping with <b>stepped</b> cutter {{and the traditional}} method. Analysis of static technological dimensional pitch size chain of wheels being cut is performed. It was revealed that the most of transmission errors of the wheels, formed by the traditional gear-shaped cutter are caused by manufacturing and installation error of the cutter and result from the formation of each tooth of the wheel with a certain tool. This {{is not the case}} with <b>gear</b> shaping by <b>step</b> cutter since at that, the profiles of all gear teeth are formed by means of tooth profile mostly remote from the tool rotation axis. Analysis of occurrence of setting-up errors typical for the above gear shaping methods has been performed. At <b>gear</b> shaping with <b>stepped</b> cutter there are no setting-up error components. It was revealed that this fact causes the absence of errors in the tool position before its each double motion. The accuracy of diametrical sizes increases.

Hardtop versions comprised: VE, VR, VX, and GT. Flagship models of the Japanese specification Camry sedan, the Camry Prominent and Prominent G arrived in April 1987 with the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE V6 engine, a protruding chrome grille, larger North American-type bumpers, wood grain interior highlights, an electric seat function, plus electronic instrument cluster. Full-time four-wheel-drive became an option in October 1987 with select 3S-FE manual variants (VL Extra, VR); automatics equipped with an electronic front- and rear-wheel torque distribution optimizer followed in August 1988. The Vista was not available with the V6, but in April 1987, the special edition Vista VL Extra sedan and hardtop arrived, followed by the Etoile in August and again in January 1989; limited edition Etoile V cars were offered in September 1989 and January 1990. Toyota discontinued the Vista VC in December 1989 and released a special edition VX Limited in May 1989 and then again for January 1990. When the Camry Prominent hardtop variant arrived in August 1988, it offered base, G, and E-Type levels of trim alongside a new sedan-only Camry Lumière. Also in August 1988, a diesel version of the Vista hardtop made its debut, and the 1.8-liter gasoline engine was upgraded to the twin-cam 4S-Fi specification. Special editions for the Camry comprised: Lumière S sedan (January 1989), Prominent X hardtop (May 1989), Lumière G sedan (June 1989), and XT Saloon Special sedan (January 1990). In 1988 the Japan market Camry became the first Toyota equipped with a driver airbag.|$|R
40|$|In gear production, {{resource}} efficiency considering material, energy and {{time can be}} achieved using a powder metallurgical process chain. Furthermore, powder metallurgical gears have a lower weight, which will improve the fuel efficiency of a gear box as well. Currently powder metallurgical gears are not used in series-production automobile gear boxes. The main {{reason for this is}} a lower expected tooth root fatigue strength, which can be increased using surface densification by rolling. The investigation of how the powder metallurgical (PM) gear manufacturing has to improve in order to gain the possible {{resource efficiency}}, is funded in the Priority Program "Resource efficient machine elements”. This paper considers a two-step approach to increase the tooth root fatigue strength of PM <b>gears.</b> The first <b>step</b> is to calculate the fatigue strength considering the density profile of the <b>gear.</b> This first <b>step</b> will result in a description of the optimal density profile. The second step is an investigation of how the density profile and the manufacturing properties can be influenced using different process designs. This step will result in a guideline to change the density profile to the one described in the first step. The combined knowledge of which density profile is necessary and how it can be achieved will give the chance to increase the tooth root fatigue strength of powder metallurgical gears.

40|$|Gear {{rattle of}} {{multi-step}} helical gear system is treated. Mesh stiffness variations and tooth profile errors are considered within the system. The effects of mesh stiffness variations, {{the ratio of}} static torque to dynamic one and tooth profile errors on the rattle are studied by a highly accurate numerical analysis called the shooting method. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) Because of the tooth profile errors, the amplitude of resonances like gear noise becomes large and the vibration becomes chaos. These resonances are confirmed in some regions.

40|$|This is {{a sequel}} to the paper ''A {{comparison}} of two ODE codes: GEAR and EPISODE,'' and {{is concerned with the}} testing of two superficially similar ODE packages, GEAR and EPISODE. Fourteen basic test problems, some with several cases, are the basis for the testing. These problems represent several types-nonlinear systems with real and complex eigenvalues, linear systems with varied diagonal dominance, linear scalar problems, stiff and non-stiff problems, chemical kinetics with and without diurnal effect, and systems arising from the use of the numerical method of lines. Some problems are included in order to examine the options and error returns. The test results are presented in two forms: raw output and a comparative display of operation counts and of timings for the best method in the GEAR package and the best method in the EPISODE package. This approach allows a comparison of the consequences of the fixed-step interpolate strategy (<b>GEAR)</b> for changing <b>step</b> size against the truly variable step size strategy (EPISODE). It is concluded that EPISODE is generally faster than GEAR for problems involving wave fronts or transients on the interior of the interval of integration.

40|$|The work {{described}} here focused {{on whether the}} precision casting method with a lost model and lost mold {{may be used for}} the production of microcomponents and on whether it may be further developed to a microcasting technique. As lost models, microparts made of plastics were applied. They had been manufactured by microinjection molding using both mold inserts structured by microcutting techniques and LIGA mold inserts. Examples of such parts are microturbine housings and <b>stepped</b> <b>gear</b> wheels. The range of metal materials used for the microparts was extended to multi-component alloys based on the systems of Cu-Al-Ni-Fe, Ag-Cu, Ag-Pd-Cu, and Au-Ag-Cu. Parts with minimum cross sections of 50 #mu#m were cast. To assess microcastability, test devices were developed. They allowed to determine the level of filling of the mold, molding accuracy, mechanical properties, and surface quality for various casting alloys. Furthermore, the cast structures could be characterized. Fundamental experiments were performed to determine the influence of the molding material on the roughness of the cast surface. It was demonstrated that the surface roughnesses that can be achieved are far smaller than those reached by conventional precision casting methods. (orig.) 57 refs.

40|$|The aplyronines are {{a family}} of 24 -membered {{macrolides}} of polyketide origin, isolated from the Japanese sea hare Aplysia kurodai. They exhibit an exceptional biological activity profile, acting through an actin and tubulin dual-targeting mechanism, with subnanomolar growth inhibitory potency against a diverse range of cancer cell lines. These characteristics render the aplyronines ideal payloads for antibody-drug conjugates but their prohibitively low natural abundance calls for an efficient total synthesis to overcome the supply issue. This dissertation describes the efforts towards developing a second-generation Paterson synthesis of the macrocyclic core of the aplyronines, focused on improving the scalability and selectivity of key transformations. Chapter 1 details the isolation, biological background and previous synthetic efforts towards the aplyronines to illustrate their therapeutic potential and the challenges associated with material sourcing by chemical synthesis. Chapter 2 presents the existing body of work on the aplyronine project within the Paterson group, highlighting the lessons learned {{over the past two}} decades and shortcomings to be addressed. Chapter 3 discusses a revised protecting group strategy towards the C 1 -C 27 macrocyclic alcohol 159 with fewer manipulation steps. A refined reaction sequence featuring titanium aldol methodology and an enzymatic desymmetrisation process delivered multigram stocks of the C 15 -C 27 aldehyde 161 upon scale- up, testifying to the robustness of the devised route. Synthesis of the C 1 -C 14 northern fragment 253 closely followed the existing boron aldol approach with optimisation of the C 11 -C 12 alkylation <b>step,</b> <b>geared</b> towards enhancing the regioselectivity. Chapter 4 describes the coupling of the two major fragments using an Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction to assemble the C 1 -C 27 backbone of the cyclic aplyronine core and suitably adjusted endgame steps to enable a one-step oxidative unmasking of the macrolactonisation sites. The first-generation intermediate 159 was accessed via site-specific Yamaguchi esterification and orthogonal deprotection of the C 27 allyl carbonate. Discussion in Chapter 5 includes the appendage of the C 28 -C 34 side chain 118, prepared by the known sequence, and suggestions for the future direction of the second-generation route with the outlook of linker appendage for the purposes of antibody-drug conjugate development.

5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st <b>gear</b> and then <b>step</b> by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|R
