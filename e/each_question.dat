5|$|Outside the one-hour {{television}} segments, all bouts last 500 seconds (eight {{minutes and}} twenty seconds). No doubling is allowed {{outside of the}} prime-time bouts, making <b>each</b> <b>question</b> worth one point. Contestants outside of prime time play non-stop save for a ten-minute bathroom break every hour, and their bouts are live-streamed on NBC's website.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{processes}} are noncommutative: A person {{asked a question}} (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to <b>each</b> <b>question</b> than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three questions. <b>Each</b> <b>question</b> has three {{multiple}} choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on the correct answer while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200.|$|E
50|$|For <b>each</b> <b>questions</b> the {{participants}} {{will be allowed}} to work for 45 seconds from the time it appears on the screen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Each</b> {{speaking}} <b>question</b> {{is initially}} given {{a score of}} 0 to 4, and <b>each</b> writing <b>question</b> is initially given a score of 0 to 5. These scores are converted to scaled scores of 0 to 30.|$|R
5000|$|Each team {{is given}} two {{questions}} based on fictional text message conversations, <b>each</b> consisting a <b>question</b> being asked, and the reply being {{a series of}} emoji. The team has 15 seconds to decipher the reply. <b>Each</b> team's first <b>question</b> is worth $100; <b>each</b> team's second <b>question</b> is worth $200. If the team fails to decipher the reply, their opponents have five seconds to decipher the same message for half the money. If a [...] "Double Text" [...] playing, {{all of the money}} are doubled. <b>Each</b> team's first <b>question</b> is worth $200; <b>each</b> team's second <b>question</b> is worth $400.|$|R
5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. <b>Each</b> <b>question</b> is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with <b>each</b> <b>question</b> having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
5|$|After the ten minutes, {{the first}} team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team {{questions}} from the announced category. <b>Each</b> <b>question</b> is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play {{the same set of}} questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all winnings from previous episodes.|$|E

5|$|Divided is an American {{television}} {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) {{based on the}} British series of the same name. Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on answers to questions they are given. The longer it takes the team {{to come to an}} agreement, the less money the team earns for <b>each</b> <b>question.</b> The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For <b>each</b> <b>question,</b> the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering <b>each</b> <b>question</b> correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three questions. <b>Each</b> <b>question</b> {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants {{secretly}} vote on which of them will be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} {{at the end of that}} episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For <b>each</b> <b>question</b> they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For <b>each</b> <b>question</b> the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
50|$|In {{the bonus}} round, the winning family were asked three more {{questions}} with four possible answers {{on the first}} question, five on the second, and six on the third. <b>Each</b> <b>questions</b> was worth $50 and if the first two questions were answered correctly, the last question was worth a bonus prize, otherwise it was played for an additional $50.|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, {{the series}} {{became the first}} {{international}} version of Millionaire to adopt the clock format from the US version of the show. Contestants now have time limits for each question: 30 seconds <b>each</b> for <b>questions</b> 1 - 9, 1 minute <b>each</b> for <b>questions</b> 10 - 12, and 3 minutes <b>each</b> for <b>questions</b> 13 - 15. Usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock. However, unlike the US version, the remaining time after giving an answer for that question is void. Contestants who exceed the time limit on a given question without giving a [...] "final answer" [...] are forced to walk away with whatever winnings they have at that point.|$|R
25|$|The {{format of}} the {{examinations}} within the PSLE has been revised consistently throughout its history to suit the Ministry of Education's policy. However, the standard examination procedure has retained {{many of the same}} elements throughout the years despite changes being made to the requirements of <b>each</b> <b>question,</b> the score allocated to <b>each</b> <b>question</b> and the revisions in emphasis.|$|E

In addition to their score, students receive their percentile (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers is also included. Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to <b>each</b> <b>question,</b> and online resources explaining <b>each</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
