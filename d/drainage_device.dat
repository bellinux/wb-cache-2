40|$|Abstract. Glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> create {{alternate}} aqueous pathways by channeling aqueous {{from the}} anterior chamber {{through a long}} tube to an equatorial plate that promotes bleb formation. Glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> are being used more frequently {{in the treatment of}} glaucoma that does not respond to medications or trabeculectomy operations. In certain conditions, such as neovascular glaucoma, iridio-corneal syndrome, penetrating keratoplasty with glaucoma, glaucoma following retinal detachment surgery, and so on, it is becoming the primary operation. This review provides a systematic review of the literature and outlines the current controversies involving different glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> and their design, overall surgical success, and complications following glaucoma drainag...|$|R

50|$|In {{comparison}} to the glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> that use an ab externo procedure, ab interno implants, such as the Xen Gel Stent, are transscleral implants to channel aqueous humor into the non-dissected Tenon's space, creating a subconjunctival drainage area similar to a bleb. The implants are transscleral and different from more other ab interno implants that do not create a transscleral drainage, such as iStent, CyPass, or Hydrus.|$|R

Follow up after surgery includes the stripping of the <b>drainage</b> <b>device</b> to prevent blockage. A typical hospital stay can be up to two weeks. The site of the surgery is left unbandaged to allow for frequent examination.Complications can be the development of lymphedema though not removing the saphenous vein during the surgery will help prevent this. In some instances, foot elevation, diuretic medication and compression stockings can reduce the build up of fluid.|$|E

50|$|Micro-invasive {{glaucoma}} surgery (MIGS) is {{the latest}} advance in surgical treatment for glaucoma, which aims to reduce intraocular pressure by either increasing outflow of aqueous humor or reducing its production. MIGS comprises a group of surgical procedures which share common features. MIGS procedures involve a minimally invasive approach, often with small cuts or micro-incisions through the cornea that causes {{the least amount of}} trauma to surrounding scleral and conjunctival tissues. The techniques minimize tissue scarring, allowing for the possibility of traditional glaucoma procedures such as trabeculectomy or glaucoma valve implantation (also known as glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>device)</b> to be performed in the future if needed.|$|E

40|$|In {{patients}} with medically uncontrollable glaucoma, surgical management is necessary. The two surgical treat-ments {{with the highest}} rates of success are trabeculectomy with adjunctive antimetabolic therapy and implantation of glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> such as an Ahmed valve. De-spite the enormous improvements in surgical techniques, {{there are a number of}} possible complications following surgical procedures. Encapsulated bleb (EB) formation, which is a common cause of drainage failure in the early post-operative period, is still a prominent issue for oph-thalmic surgeons. This finding is usually accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure. Therefore, the clinical suc-cess of glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> is often impaired due to the development of EB around the antiglaucoma device or scleral flap, thus requiring further interventions. In previ-ous studies, the incidence of bleb encapsulation has ranged from 2. 5 % to 29 % with various surgical techniques in dif-ferent types of glaucoma [1 - 4]. This study was designed to compare the histopathologic and morphologic findings of EB following two distinctive surgeries, Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation and trab-eculectomy with mitomycin-C.

40|$|Purpose. To {{report a}} new {{technique}} for anterior placement of tubes for glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> {{to reduce the risk}} of tube erosions. Methods. Retrospective review of select cases of Ahmed Valve surgery combined with the novel method of a limbal-based scleral flap covered by a scleral patch graft to cover the tube at the entrance through the limbus. Intraoperative and postoperative illustrations are shown to highlight the method of tube placement. Results. In this retrospective case series, 3 patients are presented illustrating the technique. Two had neovascular glaucoma and one had primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). On average, intraocular pressure was reduced from 39 ± 14 [*]mmHg to 15 ± 2 [*]mmHg and the number of glaucoma medications was reduced from 4 ± 1 to 0. Preoperative and most recent visual acuities were hand-motion (HM) and HM, 20 / 60 and 20 / 50, and 20 / 70 and 20 / 30, respectively. Conclusion.

50|$|A {{catheter}} {{that is left}} {{in place}} {{for more than a}} short period of time is generally attached to a drainage bag to collect the urine. This also allows for measurement of urine volume. There are three types of drainage bags: The first is a leg bag, a smaller <b>drainage</b> <b>device</b> that attaches by elastic bands to the leg. A leg bag is usually worn during the day, as it fits discreetly under pants or skirts, and is easily emptied into a toilet. The second type of drainage bag is a larger device called a down drain that may be used overnight. This device is hung on a hook under the patient's bed—never placed on the floor, due to risk of bacterial infection. The third is called a belly bag, and is secured around the waist. This bag can be worn at all times. It can be worn under the patient's underwear to provide a totally undetectable look.|$|E
50|$|A major {{variation}} in method is {{the temperature and}} state of the water. Asians and Latin Americans usually prefer running water because {{it is seen as}} being more hygienic as the water is not being reused, and usually use cold water. This is practical in environments where hot water is rarely available from the tap, and sinks are perceived as dirty surfaces (essentially a convenient drain). Westerners usually prefer standing hot water. This is practical in environments where hot water is cheaply and easily available, and sinks are perceived as clean surfaces (essentially a bowl with a convenient <b>drainage</b> <b>device).</b> In this method, the sink is usually first filled with dirty dishes (which may have already been rinsed and scraped to remove most food) and hot, soapy water. The detergent is added while the sink is filling with water, so a layer of suds forms at the top. Then the dishes are washed one by one and thoroughly rinsed to remove the grease dislodged by soap and mechanical action as well as the soap itself, then placed on a rack to begin drying, or dried and put away immediately by a second person. When the sink is empty, if there are more dishes to be washed they may be added to the same dishwater, or the sink may be drained and refilled if clean, hot dishwater is desired.|$|E

Trabeculectomy and implantation of glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> (aqueous shunts) have been used in surgical management of uveitic glaucoma, however there is a paucity of literature examining the comparative results of these entities in this unique setting.

40|$|Glaucoma {{represents}} {{a group of}} eye disorders partly related to raised intraocular pressure (IOP) leading to progressive optic nerve damage resulting in impaired vision and possibly blindness. To assess the suitability of new IOP lowering therapeutic strategies, such as the implantation of glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices,</b> appropriate animal models have to be used. Currently, a number of rodent glaucoma models are available [1], however, especially for surgical interventions rodent eyes are too small. Rabbits are much more suitable with respect to dimension. Unfortunately, rabbit glaucoma model systems described in literature are difficult to reproduce or fail totally, associated {{with a high level}} of discomfort and pain for treated animals. Therefore, development of an in vivo rabbit glaucoma model is one of the most important goals in glaucoma research. Here, we describe the adaptation of the oculopressure tonometry, an existing method to quantify the outflow of aqueous humor in humans, to generate a transient glaucoma model in rabbits. The existing suction-cup oculopressor (SCOP) is extended with newly designed suction-cups, which are adjusted to the anatomy of the rabbit eye. The modification of the oculopressure tonometry method facilitates an increase in IOP over a time frame of 9 minutes by vacuum induced deformation of the rabbit eye. This method can be used to test functionality of fistulating glaucoma surgeries or implanted <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> in a long term follow-up without any side effects and suffering of the animals...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{drainage}} systems design and management are strictly connected to meteorological forcing. For design purposes synthetic forms (e. g. depth duration frequency curves) are usually adopted {{to represent the}} meteorological solicitation, while a stochastic representation could be more promptly used to investigate the effects of potential climate change both on the design and on the efficiency of urban <b>drainage</b> <b>devices.</b> A simplified semi-probabilistic approach, relying on simple models of the stochastic rainfall process and of the rainfall-runoff (hydrological) transformation, {{is expected to be}} a sound tool. Since the rainfall process is described through the definition of three random variables and their probability distribution, the main advantage is the possibility of changing one, two or more characteristics of the rainfall model at a time. The effect of the change can then be easily evaluated through the application of the hydrological model. The semi-probabilistic approach is applied to study some aspects of the drainage system design for locations in the Italian territory. Potential effects of climate change on fictitious urban basins are evaluated through a rainfall stochastic model calibrated on the basis of long series observations recorded at site. Precipitation climate change scenarios were defined on the basis of both international climate studies report and local meteorological observation analysis. The effects on the urban drainage system are evaluated with respect to specific urban <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> and the efficiency of the design procedure in the hypothesis of climate change is finally discussed...|$|R

We identified no complication related to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. We did not find any worsening neither in clinically available monitoring of haemorrhage (tubes, <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> or wounds) nor in radiological imaging (volume of contusion or haematoma, haemorrhage relapse). Three patients benefited from a vena cava filter as they presented a contraindication for continuous anticoagulant therapy.

40|$|Purpose of reviewCongenital {{glaucoma}} {{is primarily}} a surgical disease with medical management serving as a temporizing measure before surgery or as postoperative adjunctive treatment. First-line surgery for congenital glaucoma consists of incisional procedures on the anterior chamber angle: goniotomy and trabeculotomy. Angle surgery has a high success rate with few complications. Despite the high initial success rate, almost 20 % of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted {{with a choice of}} what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures. This review will discuss and compare these procedures as reported in recent studies-and how variables such as age, number of prior procedures, and type of glaucoma have clarified the order in which these procedures might be performed after failed angle surgery. Recent findingsClinical reports in refractory pediatric glaucoma consist solely of retrospective studies of varying size and quality. Recent studies of trabeculectomy in this population suggest mitomycin C is associated with increased risk of late infectious,complications. Trabeculectomy has worse outcome among younger patients Glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> have a success rate approaching 80 % at 1 year, but less with longer follow-up. Cyclodestructive procedures are generally reserved for advanced cases, but low-dose cyclodiode therapy and endocyclophotocoagulation may prove useful earlier in the disease (< 2 years). SummaryRefractory pediatric glaucoma remains a challenge. Glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>devices</b> appear to be the most predictable and possibly safest procedure to consider after failed conventional angle surgery.
