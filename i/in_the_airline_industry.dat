5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry</b> as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

25|$|When yield {{management}} {{was introduced in}} the early 1990s, primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry,</b> many suggested that despite the obvious immediate increase in revenues, it might harm customer satisfaction and loyalty, interfere with relationship marketing, and drive customers from firms that used {{yield management}} to firms that do not. Frequent flier programs were developed as a response to regain customer loyalty and reward frequent and high yield passengers. Today, yield management is nearly universal in many industries, including airlines.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016, Air Berlin {{announced}} a record loss of 446 million euros for 2015. The airline's revenues in 2015 decreased to €4.08 billion. Amongst the reasons considered for Air Berlin's poor performance were: crippling debt of over €800m; unclear and rapid strategy changes on routes and advertising; several CEOs over recent years; a five-year-plus delay {{to the new}} hub Berlin Brandenburg Airport; failed negotiations to profit from lower fuel prices and the overall harsh competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yield Management also {{includes}} many noncontroversial and more prevalent practices, such as varying prices {{over time to}} reflect demand. This level of yield management makes {{up the majority of}} yield management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry.</b> For example, airlines may price a ticket on the Sunday after Thanksgiving at a higher fare than the Sunday a week later. Alternatively, they may make tickets more expensive when bought at the last minute than when bought six months in advance. The goal of this level of yield management is essentially trying to force demand to equal or exceed supply.|$|E

25|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the European Union.

In contrast, SAS embraced the new system. Braathens SAFE's main concern was that their high debt incurred after the purchase of the new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war.|$|E

5000|$|Despite women's {{participation}} in airplane aviation from <b>the</b> beginning, <b>in</b> 1986 {{a spokesperson for}} <b>the</b> <b>Airline</b> Pilot's Association said that the reason {{there were only two}} women Boeing 747 captains at the time was [...] "because women in aviation are a relatively recent phenomenon and everything <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> <b>industry</b> is done by seniority". This also ignores the fact that Helen Richey became the first woman to fly a commercial airliner in 1934.

25|$|Deregulation is {{generally}} regarded as the catalyst for yield management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry,</b> but this tends to overlook the role of Global Distribution Systems (GDSs). It is arguable that the fixed pricing paradigm {{occurs as a result}} of decentralized consumption. With mass production, pricing became a centralized management activity and customer contact staff focused on customer service exclusively. Electronic commerce, of which the GDSs were the first wave, created an environment where large volumes of sales could be managed without large numbers of customer service staff. They also gave management staff direct access to price at time of consumption and rich data capture for future decision-making.|$|E

25|$|Virtual {{airlines}} {{were started}} {{to give a}} sense of purpose to activities conducted within a flight simulator program, the first being SubLogic's , released in 1990. As time has passed, the most common flight simulator used is Microsoft's Flight Simulator. This basic premise has evolved over time, along with available technology, to provide increasing levels of immersion but always with the same core purpose. When combined with increasingly powerful personal computers, advancing flight simulation software, and communications networks, virtual airlines are often able to provide compelling, realistic, experiences similar to operations inside a real airline. Virtual airlines also provide an avenue for members to gain access to additional content, such as aircraft and scenery, for use with their simulator. The appeal varies; for younger members, virtual airlines provide a sandbox realistic environment where they can experience the corporate environment of traditional commercial business <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry,</b> without the risk of financial loss. These organizations also provide an outlet for those who are interested in aviation but unable to fly themselves in real life due to financial, health, or other reasons. As of 2014, an estimated 80 percent of virtual pilots hold no real world pilot's license.|$|E

25|$|Starting pilot wages {{were also}} well below average {{in terms of}} hourly rate, {{starting}} at $65,000 annually for Captains, and $30,000 for First Officers as a minimum guarantee. The average captain's earnings were about $90,000 vs $120,000 per year for a theoretical first year Captain at airlines like United Airlines (there is no first year pay at United) {{but in the case}} of Skybus this included a significant stock options and profit share package unique <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>industry.</b> Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew was that there were very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew utilization rates for more efficient work schedules. Typical Skybus pilot workdays were 8–10 hours long (FAA maximum is 16 hours), which was lower than the industry average of 12–14 hours. Typical pilot work months were 14–15 days with no overnights. The average pilot in the US has a work month of 16–17 days, and the average airline pilot wage is approximately $135,000 averaged between first officer and captain pay.|$|E

500|$|Norway Airline's {{board voted}} on 14 October 1992 {{to file for}} bankruptcy, and all {{aircraft}} were grounded on 15 October 1992.

The airline had lost more than NOK100 million {{by the start of}} the year and had failed to make a profit during 1992. Norway Airlines entered negotiations with Air Holland for the latter to purchase the airline, but the deal fell through on 1 December. Within days of the bankruptcy, Dan-Air also terminated operations. Braathens SAFE therefore decided to start flying the Fornebu–Gatwick route. Six days after Dan-Air's closure, the first schedules were published in the newspaper; slots and British permission was granted three days after that. The service started another two days later.|$|E

40|$|The {{competitive}} landscape of <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>airline</b> <b>industry</b> is facing changes {{due to the}} presence of a low-cost carrier, AirAsia.

Due to the increased competition, the national carrier must react in order to stop the decline of its domestic operations. This aim {{of this study is to}} understand the strategies of the two dominant carriers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>airline</b> <b>industry,</b> MAS and AirAsia <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> pricing of their fares in competing routes. In order to achieve this, we examine <b>the</b> strategic interactions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malaysia <b>airline</b> <b>industry</b> by examining oligopoly conduct as well as predicting the strategic behaviour of MAS and AirAsia.
