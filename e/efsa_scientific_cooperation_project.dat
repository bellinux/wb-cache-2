40|$|The {{mission and}} tasks of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) include the {{responsibility}} {{to set up a}} system for identifying emerging risks. In 2007, the <b>EFSA</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (ESCO) Working Group (WG) on Emerging Risks received a mandate by the EFSA to propose an operational strategy to achieve this task. Since then, 11 meetings have been organised. The mandate includes identification of priority indicators, identification of key sources of information and best practices for data collection and exchange, and development of procedures to collect, analyze and evaluate information. The WG, building on the operational definition of “emerging risks ” adopted by the EFSA in 2007, has developed an overall procedure for the collection, analysis and evaluation of the relevant data and information. The harvesting of data and information relevant to the identification of emerging risks relies principally on their detection through the use of indicators and signals. These should be considered as primary markers when screening appropriate sources electronically by means of a real-time central data collection facility. Eleven priority indicators have been identified in the areas of chemical, microbiological an...|$|R

Making use of diagrammatic perturbation theory, we calculate exactly the orbital {{magnetic susceptibility}} of massless Dirac fermions to first order in the Coulomb interaction demonstrating that it is finite and positive. Doped graphene sheets are thus unique systems in which the orbital magnetic susceptibility is completely controlled by many-body effects.

The method {{is based on a}} global weak formulation involving only terms defined on the whole fluid-rigid domain. To take into account the material derivative, we construct a special characteristic function which maps the approximate rigid body at the (k + 1) -th discrete time level into the approximate rigid body at k-th time.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{internationalisation}} of Higher Education has become a priority in Brazilian educational policies. The importance of internationalisation has become apparent thanks to numerous initiatives, ranging from the increase in funding for graduate and postgraduate research stays abroad to <b>projects</b> of <b>scientific</b> <b>cooperation</b> between universities in different countries. In this context, this paper explores a <b>scientific</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>project</b> developed by two universities in Brazil and Spain: the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) and the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV), {{relating to the field}} of Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL). First of all, the internationalisation of the Brazilian Higher Education will be discussed, and the different initiatives - such as the Ciência sem Fronteiras (Science without Borders) Programme launched by the Brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) - will be presented. Following that, the paper will focus on the original proposal for the ongoing <b>cooperation</b> <b>project</b> between the UNICAMP and the UPV and on the results obtained until now. Next, the initiative will be analysed with special attention to the importance and the impact that internationalisation has made on Brazilian higher education. Finally, the authors will further explore the ways in which <b>cooperation</b> <b>projects</b> such as the one dealt with in this paper contribute towards the improvement of education. This improvement is mainly due to factors such as: fostering the integration of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) into teaching-learning practices; investing in teacher training in their home countries and abroad; and encouraging the development of high-quality multimedia materials and authoring tolos...|$|R

40|$|The {{eastern and}} southeastern margins of Iberia were {{affected}} during Neogene time by a rifting tectonic process superimposed on the Alpine structures. The Valencia Trough, situated off the northeastern coast of Iberia, {{has been defined}} as a rift system that began its activity in late Oligocene-Early Miocene time. The opening of the Valencia Trough produced a series of tectonic grabens created by fractures which strike parallel to the coastline. As a consequence of the rifting, subsidence occurred and depositional sequences of Miocene age were subsequently deposited over the Triassic and Mesozoic basement. Some of the Mesozoic faults were reactivated and affected the Tertiary deposits. The depositional history was controlled mainly by extensional faulting during the late Paleocene-early Miocene, and by rapid subsidence. During the late Pliocene a second extensional period occurred in the Iberian Chain resulting in the present configuration of the continental margin in the study area. The Pliocene-Quaternary evolution of the margin was largely controlled by fluctuation of the Ebro River sediment supply and sea-level oscillationsThis study was supported by the US Spain Joint Committee for <b>Scientific</b> and Technological <b>Cooperation</b> (<b>project</b> CCA 8309 / 074) Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} the human genome project did not include {{sequencing}} of the heterochromatic regions. We describe here an initial sequence of 1. 1 Mb of the short arm of human chromosome 21 (HSA 21 p), estimated to be 10 % of 21 p. This region contains extensive euchromatic-like sequence and includes on average one transcript every 100 kb. These transcripts show multiple inter- and intrachromosomal copies, and extensive copy number and sequence variability. The sequencing of the "heterochromatic" regions {{of the human genome}} is likely to reveal many additional functional elements and provide important evolutionary information.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In EFSA’s context {{transparency}} {{is defined}} as the extent to which interested parties have legitimate access to information to meet their needs to understand the basis of <b>EFSA’s</b> <b>scientific</b> decision-making process and its related outputs. Openness {{is defined as}} the extent to which interested parties are enabled to participate in EFSA’s decision making processes. Openness and transparency are recognised as two of the principles available to the European Union, whose implementation may contribute to legitimise its existence and administrative action vis-à-vis the European citizens and taxpayers. This also holds true for Union agencies and transparency is one of EFSA’s core organisational value together with openness, scientific excellence and independence. In this context EFSA’s Management Board adopted in 2003 EFSA’s approach to “openness, transparency and confidentiality” and in 2005 it issued a decision concerning implementing measures of transparency and confidentiality. <b>EFSA’s</b> <b>Scientific</b> Committee issued in 2006 and 2009 two opinions on transparency in risk assessment one related to procedural aspects and the other related to scientific aspects...|$|R
40|$|EFSA is {{committed}} to assess and communicate the risks occurring in the food and feed chain from farm to fork and to provide other forms of scientific advice. This work, carried out by EFSA since its inception, {{has resulted in the}} adoption of thousands of <b>scientific</b> assessments. <b>EFSA</b> is obliged to re-assess past assessments in specific regulatory contexts such as those on food and feed additives, active substances in plant protection products and genetically modified food and feed. In other sectors, the consideration for updating past <b>EFSA</b> <b>scientific</b> assessments is taken on an ad hoc basis mainly depending on specific requests by risk managers or on EFSA self-tasking. If safety is potentially at stake in any area within EFSA's remit, the readiness to update past scientific assessments is important to keep EFSA at the forefront of science and to promote an effective risk assessment. Although this task might be very complex and resource demanding, it is fundamental to EFSA's mission. The present <b>EFSA</b> <b>Scientific</b> Committee opinion deals with scientific motivations and criteria to contribute to the timely updating of <b>EFSA</b> <b>scientific</b> assessments. It is recognised that the decision for updating should be agreed following careful consideration of all the relevant elements by the EFSA management, in collaboration with risk managers and stakeholders. The present opinion addresses the scientific approaches through which it would be possible for EFSA to increase the speed and effectiveness of the acquisition of new data, as well as, to improve the consequent evaluations to assess the relevance and reliability of new data in the context of contributing to the better definition of whether to update past scientific assessments. <br/...|$|R
