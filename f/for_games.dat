5|$|Gannon {{has also}} been called a 'tactical maverick' due to his unusual {{formations}}. These formations include 3–4–1–2, 4–3–2–1, 4–1–2–3, and his preferred set-up of 4–2–3–1. He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He {{is known to be}} extremely thorough and meticulous in preparing his players <b>for</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E

5|$|In September 2008, Valve {{added support}} for Steam Cloud, {{a service that}} can {{automatically}} store saved game and related custom files on Valve's servers; users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client.

In May 2012, the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients, including computers and mobile devices; users can instruct Steam to download and install games they own through this service if their Steam client is currently active and running. Some games sold through retail channels can be redeemed as titles for users' libraries within Steam by entering a product code within the software. <b>For</b> <b>games</b> that incorporate Steamworks, users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam client to add the title to their libraries.
