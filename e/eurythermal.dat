50|$|Phaeocystis is a genus {{of algae}} {{belonging}} to the Prymnesiophyte class and to the larger division of Haptophyta. It is a widespread marine phytoplankton and can function at {{a wide range of}} temperatures (<b>eurythermal)</b> and salinities (euryhaline). Members of this genus live in the open ocean, as well as in sea ice. It has a polymorphic life cycle, ranging from free-living cells to large colonies.|$|E
50|$|C. macularius are {{euryhaline}} and <b>eurythermal,</b> tolerating temperatures between approximately 4º and 45 °C and salinities {{ranging from}} 0 to 70 parts per thousand, exceeding the tolerances {{of virtually all}} other freshwater fish. The desert pupfish can also survive dissolved-oxygen concentrations as low as 0.13 ppm. The desert pupfish has been noted to be more abundant in environments with high vegetative cover, pH and salinity, and low dissolved oxygen and sediment factors, thus suggesting that living in extreme conditions allows them to survive in environments that are hostile to invasive or nonnative fish.|$|E
50|$|The stomach {{content of}} this fish {{consists}} mostly of freshwater crustaceans {{and the relative}} length of the gut suggests a carnivorous habit. The eggs have an average diameter of 1 mm and the average absolute and relative fecundity is 415 and 110, respectively. The gonadosomatic ratio and ovary condition suggests that the reproductive season of the species is between late March and June with a peak in early April. The species is euryhaline and <b>eurythermal</b> and prefers neutral to basic waters. It is usually found in well-oxygenated waters, but is tolerant to hypoxia, as well.|$|E
50|$|Food is {{a leading}} factor for {{microhabitat}} preferences, and microhabitats differ seasonally. Spotfins streamlined body and <b>eurythermal</b> characteristics allows them to tolerate {{a wide range of}} habitats. During the summer and fall months, spotfins are most likely found in clear, warm water stretches of rivers that resemble run habitats. These runs consist of boulder/bedrock substrates with medium to moderate depth and velocity. However, during the winter they are most commonly found in pool habitats with a sandy substrate. Due to similar habitat requirements and desired prey they tend to compete with other minnow species. Their most common competitors of the genus Cyprinella, primarily whitetail shiners (Cyprinella galactura), and the genus Luxilus, such as the warpaint shiner (Luxilus coccogenis). Humans are also competing for habitat. Flooding and sedimentation are both results of impounding water and harvesting riparian vegetation.|$|E
50|$|D. lumholtzi is {{typically}} {{found in the}} warm, shallow regions of bodies of water with larger surface areas. While most species of Daphnia see high mortality at temperatures greater than 25 °C, D. lumholtzi individuals can survive and reproduce at temperatures up to 30 °C, with a thermal optimum occurring at 29 °C. Studies have shown that population density and water surface temperature are positively correlated. Once favorable temperatures are reached, {{such as those in}} the late summer, the previously deposited eggs hatch. The lower temperature range of D. lumholtzi extends to 5 °C, where some individuals are able to survive, with survival increasing significantly at 10 °C and reproduction beginning to occur at 15 °C. This significantly broad temperature range in which D. lumholtzi can survive has led to it being labeled a <b>eurythermal</b> species.|$|E
50|$|The Ninespine Stickleback is a {{euryhaline}} and <b>eurythermal</b> {{species of}} teleost fish, occupying both freshwater and marine habitats in higher latitudes of the world. Recently, this species {{has been under}} great examination due to pond populations' adaptations of morphology, life history, and behavior which separates them from their marine conspecifics. Many recently isolated populations (<11,000 years) have been studied to identify ranges of phenotypic plasticity and possible genetic drift between populations. It {{has been found that}} marine populations exhibit metabolic rate reduction when in colder conditions, in addition to having an elevated hepatosomatic index (HSI) at all temperature conditions as compared to freshwater populations in those same conditions. Hepatosomatic index refers to the proportional size of the liver of the fish to its body mass, as in indication of energy reserves. In addition, certain freshwater pond populations have shown to be able to metabolically compensate to survive a wide range of temperatures, six degrees Celsius to nineteen degrees Celsius. Alterations to metabolic rate, such as decrease in standard metabolic rate, allowed pond population individuals to survive less than favorable conditions. Such physiological differences between populations has not been determined to be exclusively due to plasticity or generic changes; however, there {{has been found to be}} significant genetic diversity between marine and freshwater populations.|$|E

The physical locations of the reefs differed such {{that there was a}} 120 %– 275 % warm-season range in the SDs of seawater temperatures but only minor differences in mean temperatures, based on 2 non-ENSO years. We tested the predictions that (a) rare warm-water events would produce fewer changes in <b>eurythermal</b> than stenothermal coral assemblages; and (b) after the disturbance, the stenothermal assemblages would more closely resemble the <b>eurythermal</b> ones. The 1998 event produced fewer changes in coral cover and community similarity among the assemblages in the reefs with high variation in temperature than in those with low variation in temperature. Despite the initially lower taxonomic richness in the <b>eurythermal</b> assemblage, there was an additional loss of taxonomic richness in the high and none in the stenothermal reefs. There was some evidence for taxonomic convergence, of the stenothermal towards the <b>eurythermal</b> reefs and a general loss of some of the branching taxa, such as branching Porites, Pavona, and Stylophora, and a relative increase in massive Porites and Favia. There was, however, moderate site specificity that did not produce true convergence. The <b>eurythermal</b> assemblages maintained the basic community structure but lost taxonomic richness, whereas the opposite was true for the stenothermal assemblages...|$|E

(2014) Effects of Temperature on Auditory Sensitivity in <b>Eurythermal</b> Fishes: Common Carp Cyprinus carpio (Family Cyprinidae) versus Wels Catfish Silurus glanis (Family Siluridae). PLoS ONE 9 (9) : e 108583. doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0108583 [...] Background: In ectothermal {{animals such as}} fish, -temperature affects {{physiological}} and metabolic processes. This includes sensory organs such as the auditory system. The reported effects of temperature on hearing in <b>eurythermal</b> otophysines are contradictory. We therefore investigated {{the effect on the}} auditory system in species representing two different orders. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hearing sensitivity was determined using the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. Auditory sensitivity and latency in response to clicks were measured in the common carp Cyprinus carpio (order Cypriniformes) and the Wels catfish Silurus glanis (order Siluriformes) after acclimating fish for at least three weeks to two different water temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C and again 15 °C). Hearing sensitivity increased with temperature in both species. Best hearing was detected between 0. 3 and 1 kHz at both temperatures. The maximum increase occurred at 0. 8 kHz (7. 8 dB) in C. carpio and at 0. 5 kHz (10. 3 dB) in S. glanis. The improvement differed between species and was in particular more pronounced in the catfish at 4 kHz. The latency in response to single clicks was measured from the onset of the sound stimulus to the most constant positive peak of the AEP. The latency decreased at the higher temperature in both species by 0. 37 ms on average. Conclusions/Significance: The current study shows that higher temperature improves hearing (lower thresholds, shorter latencies) in <b>eurythermal</b> species from different orders of otophysines.

30|$|Most organisms on Earth are ectotherms {{which have}} {{to survive and}} adapt to {{temperature}} fluctuations (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Guschina and Harwood [2006]; Somero [2010]). Temperature fundamentally affects all aspects of physiology by influencing the reactive rates {{as well as the}} physical properties of biological molecules (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Crockett and Londraville [2006]). For marine ectotherms including fish, environmental temperature has the pervasive effects on physiological and biochemical functions at all levels of biological organization, from molecule to organism (Jobling [1995]; Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Hofmann et al. [2002]; Donaldson et al. [2008]). According to the tolerance range of temperature, the fishes can be classified into two groups, <b>eurythermal</b> and stenothermal species. <b>Eurythermal</b> fish can maintain metabolic activity at temperatures as low as Antarctic fish can survive and withstand temperature as high as the avian and mammalian body temperature. In contrast, changes in environmental temperature may lead to the poor maintenance of physiological homeostasis in stenothermal species, resulting in temperature stress (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Somero [2010]; Long et al. [2012]).|$|E
40|$|Many fish inhabit <b>eurythermal</b> {{environments and}} must {{therefore}} be {{able to cope with}} changes in environmental temperature. With seasonal temperature changes, fish can acclimatize, often adjusting their physiological and biochemical processes in a compensatory manner. However, temperature changes can be more rapid, either as a result of diurnal cycles (Matthews and Berg, 1997) or as the fish moves vertically through the water column, often in association with feeding or escaping predation (Reid et al., 1997). Acute temperature changes are of considerable interest for cardiac physiologists because the heart is required to maintain cardiac function while it reaches a new temperature equilibrium with the surrounding environment. The temperature tolerance of <b>eurythermal</b> fish, therefore, raises important questions concerning the temperature-dependency of cardiac ion channel function, particularly because acute temperature changes can be cardioplegic to mammals. We were specifically interested in the ion channels involved in Ca 2 + transport during excitation–contraction coupling of the heart. In most fish, including rainbow trout, transsarcolemmal Ca 2 + influx is considered to be the primary source of Ca 2 + for activation of the myofilaments during excitation–contractio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEvolution of {{antimicrobial}} peptides (AMPs) {{has been}} shown to be driven by recurrent duplications and balancing/positive selection in response to new or altered bacterial pathogens. We use Alvinella pompejana, the most <b>eurythermal</b> animal known on Earth, to decipher the selection patterns acting on AMP in an ecological rather than controlled infection approach. The preproalvinellacin multigenic family presents the uniqueness to encode a molecular chaperone (BRICHOS) together with an AMP (alvinellacin) that controls the vital ectosymbiosis of Alvinella. In stark contrast to what is observed in the context of the Red queen paradigm, we demonstrate that exhibiting a vital and highly conserved ecto-symbiosis in the face of thermal fluctuations has led to a peculiar selective trend promoting the adaptive diversification of the molecular chaperone of the AMP, but not of the AMP itself. Because BRICHOS stabilizes beta-stranded peptides, this polymorphism likely represents an <b>eurythermal</b> adaptation to stabilize the structure of alvinellacin, thus hinting at its efficiency to select and control the epibiosis across the range of temperatures experienced by the worm; Our results fill some knowledge gaps concerning the function of BRICHOS in invertebrates and offer perspectives for studying immune genes in an evolutionary ecological framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of seasonal and acute temperature changes on mitochondrial functions were studied in isolated mitochondria of the <b>eurythermal</b> lugworm Arenicola marina (Polychaeta), with {{special emphasis on}} the interdependence of membrane potential and radical production. Acclimatisation to pre-spawning/ summer conditions is associated with rising mitochondrial substrate oxidation rates, higher proton leakage rates, elevated membrane potentials, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in isolated mitochondria compared with mitochondria from winter animals. However, a high ROS production was compensated for by higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, as well as lower mitochondrial densities in summer compared with winter animals. In summer animals, a higher sensitivity of the proton leak rate to changes of membrane potential will confer a better flexibility for metabolic regulation (mild uncoupling) in response to temperature change. These seasonal alterations of mitochondrial functioning support modifications of energy metabolism in <b>eurythermal</b> and euryoxic organisms on intertidal mudflats during summer. In winter, low and less changeable temperatures in intertidal sedimentary environments, allow for higher respiratory efficiency at low aerobic metabolic rates and lower membrane potentials in A. marina mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{requirements}} for growth, photosynthesis and dark respiration were determined for five Antarctic red algal species. After acclimation, the stenothermal species Gigartina skottsbergii and Ballia callitricha grew at 0 {{or up to}} 5 degrees C, respectively; the <b>eurythermal</b> species Kallymenia antarctica, Gymnogongrus antarcticus and Phyllophora ahnfeltioides grew up to 10 degrees C. The temperature optima of photosynthesis were between 10 and 15 degrees C in the stenothermal species and between 15 and 25 degrees C in the <b>eurythermal</b> species, irrespective of the growth temperature. This shows that the temperature optima for photosynthesis are located well below the optima from species of other biogeographical regions, even from the Arctic. Respiratory rates rose with increasing temperatures. In contrast to photosynthesis, no temperature optimum was evident between 0 and 25 degrees C. Partial acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to growth temperature was found in two species. B. callitricha and Gymnogongrus antarcticus acclimate to 0 degrees C, and 5 and 0 degrees C, respectively. But acclimation did in no case lead to an overall shift in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis. B. callitricha and Gymnogongrus antarcticus showed acclimation of respiration to 5 degrees C, and P. ahnfeltioides to 5 and 10 degrees C, resulting in a temperature independence of respiration when measured at growth temperature. With respect to the acclimation potential of the species, no distinction can be made between the stenothermal versus the <b>eurythermal</b> group. (Net) photosynthetic capacity:respiration (P:R) ratios showed in all species highest values at 0 degrees C and decreased continuously to values lower than 1. 0 at 25 degrees C. In turn, the low P:R ratios at higher temperatures are assumed to determine the upper temperature growth limit of the studied species. Estimated daily carbon balance reached values between 4. 1 and 30. 7 mg C g(- 1) FW day(- 1) at 0 degrees C, 16 : 8 h light/dark cycle, 12 - 40 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial respiration, {{energetic}} coupling to phosphorylation {{and production}} of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were studied in mitochondrial isolates of the <b>eurythermal</b> bivalve Mya arenaria (Myoidea) from a low shore intertidal population of the German Wadden Sea. Measurements were conducted {{within the range of}} the habitat temperatures (5 to 15 °C), as well as under heat exposure at 20 and 25 °C. Experimental warming resulted in an increase of state 3 and state 4 respiration in mitochondrial isolates. Highest respiratory coupling ratios (RCR) were found at 15 °C, while at higher temperatures mitochondrial coupling decreased significantly and ROS release doubled between 15 and 25 °C. ROS production amounted to between 2 and 3 % of total oxygen consumption in state 3 (0. 3 - 0. 5 nmol ROS /mg protein min) at habitat temperature, and to a maximum of 4. 3 % of state 3 respiration, and 7 % of oligomycin induced state 4 + respiration under heat stress. Thus, state 4 respiration, previously interpreted exclusively as a measure of protron leakage, was found to involve significant contribution of ROS formation in this animal, especially under heat stress conditions. Oxygen radical formation was directly dependent on temperature controlled respiration rates in states 3 and 4, and moreover inversely related to mitochondrial coupling (RCR+) in state 4. Mitochondrial ROS formation is obviously involved in cellular heat stress in this <b>eurythermal</b> marine ectotherm...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{tolerance}} in aquatic ectotherms is {{constrained by}} a mismatch, occurring at high temperatures, between oxygen delivery and demand which compromises {{the maintenance of}} aerobic scope. The present study analyses how the wide thermal tolerance range of an <b>eurythermal</b> model species, the green crab Carcinus maenas is supported and limited by its ability to sustain efficient oxygen transport to tissues. Similar to other eurytherms, C. maenas sustains naturally occurring acute warming events through the integrated response of circulatory and respiratory systems. The response of C. maenas to warming is characterized by two phases. During initial warming, oxygen consumption and heart rate increase while stroke volume and haemolymph oxygen partial pressures decrease. During further warming, dissolved oxygen levels in the venous compartment decrease below the threshold of full haemocyanin oxygen saturation. The progressive release of haemocyanin bound oxygen with further warming follows an exponential pattern, thereby saving energy in oxygen transport and causing an associated leveling off of metabolic rate. According {{to the concept of}} oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance, this indicates that the thermal tolerance window is widened by the increasing contribution of haemocyanin oxygen transport and associated energy savings in cardiocirculation. Haemocyanin bound oxygen sustains cardiac performance to cover the temperature range experienced by C. maenas in the field. To our knowledge this is the first study providing evidence of a relationship between thermal tolerance and blood (haemolymph) oxygen transport in <b>eurythermal</b> invertebrates...|$|E

Logistic regression was used to estimate pollen abundance thresholds for vegetation occurrence (presence or dominance), based on modern pollen data and present ranges of 14 taxa in China. Our investigation reveals marked changes in {{spatial and temporal}} distributions of the major arboreal taxa. The thermophilous (Castanea, Castanopsis, Cyclobalanopsis, Fagus, Pterocarya) and <b>eurythermal</b> (Juglans, Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus) broadleaved tree taxa were restricted to the current tropical or subtropical areas of China during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and spread northward since c. 14. 5 [*]kyr BP.

Since the late mid-Holocene, the abundance but not the spatial extent of most trees decreased. The changes in spatial and temporal distributions for the 14 taxa are a reflection of climate changes, in particular monsoonal moisture, and, in the late Holocene, human impact.

30|$|Finally, in {{agreement}} with De los Ríos Escalante and Gajardo (2010) we consider that an increase in investigations on the zooplankton in South-American saline lakes, such as the Llancanelo-wetlands system, is urgently necessary {{in view of the}} current ongoing global climate change. According to Strecker et al. (2004) and Sommer et al. (2012), warmer temperatures could negatively affect zooplankton structure, especially in unproductive ecosystems, because of the influence of strong synergistic interactions between thermal stress and food limitation on the growth and reproduction of mainly the cladocerans. Within this scenario, <b>eurythermal</b> species such as certain rotifers and copepods could prevail in the absence of competition for food (Wagner and Adrian 2011). In the Llancanelo-wetland system, certain Brachionus species and cyclopoid copepods could possibly expand their predominance spatially and temporally under such conditions. As has been indicated in other aquatic ecosystems in the world (Brucet et al. 2009 a, b), global warming will possibly also effect an increase in the salinity of the springs and the lotic environments within the Llancanelo basin so as to cause losses in zooplankton biodiversity {{as a result of the}} consequent reduction in the viability and longevity of the egg banks of certain freshwater species within the sediments (Nielsen et al. 2003; Nielsen and Brock 2009), thus promoting the replacement of those species by euryhaline and <b>eurythermal</b> biota (Toruan 2012) having preferences for high temperatures and salinity—i.e., certain species of Brachionus or B. poopoensis (De los Ríos and Crespo 2004; De los Ríos 2005).|$|E

40|$|Polar marine {{invertebrates}} and fish grow slowly. At present {{there are three}} basic explanations for this slow growth: 1. a direct limitation by temperature, 2. rising costs of maintenance {{at the expense of}} a reduction in growth, 3. seasonal resource limitation. On the cellular level the rate-limiting effect of temperature on growth could be excluded for the cold stenothermal scallop Adamussium colbecki and for the Antarctic eelpout Pachycara brachycephalum. The protein synthesis, measured in vitro, was cold compensated in these species compared to related <b>eurythermal</b> species, the European scallop Aequipecten opercularis and the North Sea eelpout Zoarces viviparus. Within the temperature tolerance of P. brachycephalum the cold adapted protein synthesis apparatus could still be acclimated to various temperatures. Compensated protein synthesis capacities in Antarctic scallops and eelpout have been achieved by low activation energies and high RNA translation capacities and indicate the development of a cost efficient growth apparatus. Unlike Antarctic fish, Antarctic invertebrates exhibit higher RNA contents when compared to related species from warmer waters. These over compensated protein synthesis capacities due to high RNA contents seem specific for Antarctic invertebrates and support high growth efficiencies during the austral summer. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis rates suggests that actual in vivo rates remain far below capacity. Therefore the regulation must occur on a higher level. A sensible regulation factor could be the pHi. Differing energy budgets and trade-offs between lifestyle, exercise and growth performance of cold stenothermal and <b>eurythermal</b> animals are discussed. A basic requirement is that the energetic costs for the protein synthesis are the same as demonstrated for both scallop species. Despite even low maintenance costs, cold stenothermal animals exhibit slow annual growth rates suggesting seasonal resource limitation...|$|E
40|$|Fish play a {{key role}} in the trophic {{dynamics}} of lakes. With climate warming, complex changes in fish assemblage structure may be expected owing to direct effects of temperature and indirect effects operating through eutrophication, water level changes, stratification and salinisation. We reviewed published and new long-term (10 – 100 years) fish data series from 24 European lakes (area: 0. 04 – 5, 648 km 2; mean depth: 1 – 177 m; a north–south gradient from Sweden to Spain). Along with an annual temperature increase of about 0. 15 – 0. 3 °C per decade profound changes have occurred in either fish assemblage composition, body size and/or age structure during recent decades and a shift towards higher dominance of <b>eurythermal</b> species. These shifts have occurred despite a reduction in nutrient loading in many of the lakes that should have benefited the larger-sized individuals and the fish species typically inhabiting cold-water, low-nutrient lakes. The cold-stenothermic Arctic charr has been particularly affected and its abundance has decreased in the majority of the lakes where its presence was recorded. The harvest of cool-stenothermal brown trout has decreased substantially in two southern lakes. Vendace, whitefish and smelt show a different response depending on lake depth and latitude. Perch has apparently been stimulated in the north, with stronger year classes in warm years, but its abundance has declined in the southern Lake Maggiore, Italy. Where introduced, roach seems to take advantage of the higher temperature after years of low population densities. <b>Eurythermal</b> species such as common bream, pike–perch and/or shad are apparently on the increase in several of the lakes.

40|$|The {{south-western}} Cape of South Africa {{has a very}} endemic, specialized terrestrial {{flora and}} aquatic fauna. It {{has been argued that}} the high degree of endemism is related to the origin of the fauna, the multiplicity of habitats present and the harsh water chemistry characterized by low pH. The aim of this project was to look at the relationship between pH and endemism. Specifically I asked if there is a trichopteran and ephemeropteran fauna confined to the Cape and if this is true, I attempted to find out whether it is the acidic waters or its biogeographical origin that limits its distribution. I also attempted to identify a group of species that occurs at a wide range of pH values (i. e. pH insensitive) and another group that is intolerant of acidic waters. This was done by looking at historical data on species distribution and the pH ranges at which they were found, and these data then re-analysed in the light of fieldwork performed on the Breede River in the western Cape. A number of species within different genera (e. g. Lithogloea, Leptecho and Agapetus) appears to be confined to the Cape. Their distribution is determined by both their origin and water chemistry conditions, which are characterised by low pH and pure, silt-free water. A warm stenothermal group, comprising Leptonema, Elassoneuria and Eatonica spp. is limited to the subtropical regions of South Africa, where water is alkaline. A <b>eurythermal,</b> pH-insensitive group that includes Castanophlebia calida, Ecnomus and Cheumatopsyche spp has a widespread distribution throughout the country. Lastly, there appears to be another <b>eurythermal</b> group (e. g. Pseudopannota macu/osa, Pseudocloeon glaucum) that is intolerant of low pH values. As research is continuously discovering new species and new distribution records for old ones, {{it is likely that the}} above categories will need revision as more data are collected...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{acclimation}} {{effects on}} leg muscle plasma membrane composition and biophysical state, neuromuscular function and whole organism thermal tolerance, and {{their dependence on}} the background seasonal acclimatization were investigated in the <b>eurythermal</b> Carcinus maenas and the stenothermal Cancer pagurus. Correlations between the changes observed at each of these levels are discussed. The average winter (5 ºC), annual (8 ºC), and summer (15 ºC) sea-water temperatures and a warmer summer temperature (22 ºC) were chosen as acclimation temperatures for their ecological significance. Warm-acclimation (22 ºC) increased the thermal tolerance (CTMax) of both species and induced partial compensation of the neuromuscular function (assessed from leg nerve axonal conduction velocity and the amplitudes of excitatory junction potentials in dactylopodite closer muscle fibres). The time-course of acclimation showed it was complete after two weeks, but a longer exposure to 22 ºC reduced neuromuscular performance, an effect {{that may not be}} acclimation related. At plasma membrane level, the response to warm-acclimation depended on acclimation temperature. Acclimation to 15 ºC induced {{a significant increase in the}} S/U fatty acids ratio of PC and PE, but no increase in plasma membrane order. Acclimation to 22 ºC induced a significant increase in the Ch/PL molar ratio and in plasma membrane order, but no major changes in overall fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, compared to cold-acclimated crabs. A seasonal background, determined by complex factors, underlined these responses to temperature-acclimation. At all acclimation temperatures, crabs acclimated in autumn and winter had lower S/U fatty acid ratios and Ch/PL molar ratios than in spring, and the temperature dependence of plasma membrane fluidity was reduced in summer, compared to spring and autumn. The response to 15 ºC- acclimation was greater in winter than in other seasons. The CTMax and the magnitude or efficacy of the acclimation responses showed that the stenothermal species was more thermally sensitive than the <b>eurythermal</b> species...|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} and cloned a carp somatolactin SL DNA fragment, of which 78 % of the nucleotides were {{identical to the}} corresponding salmon SL sequence. The results obtained upon Northern blot hybridization of carp pituitary RNA allowed the identification of two transcripts as described for other fish. When the content of SL transcripts in pituitary sections from summer- and winter- acclimatized carp was quantified by in situ hybridization assays, we found {{no significant differences between}} the two seasons. In salmonids, plasma SL reaches higher levels in summer than in winter in synchrony with the water temperature cycle; in the <b>eurythermal</b> carp, however, the complex adaptive responses imposed by seasonal environmental changes do not seem to include the regulation of the somatolactin detected with the probe used at the transcriptional level in pituitary gland...|$|E

Physiol. 43) : R 1789 –R 1796, 1998. —Earlier work on Notothenioids {{led to the}} hypothesis that a reduced glycolytic capacity is a general adaptation to low temperatures in Antarctic fish. In our study this hypothesis was reinvestigated by comparing changes in the metabolic status of the white musculature in two related zoarcid species, the stenothermal Antarctic eelpout Pachy-cara brachycephalum and the <b>eurythermal</b> Zoarces viviparus during exercise and subsequent recovery at 0 °C. In both species, strenuous exercise caused a similar increase in white muscle lactate, a drop in intracellular pH (pHi) by about 0. 5 pH units, and a 90 % depletion of phosphocreatine. This is the first study on Antarctic fish that shows an increase in whit...|$|E
40|$|Impact of {{temperature}} (from - 2 to 28 degrees C) on survival, oxygen consumption, locomotory and ventilatory activities {{was measured in}} two aquatic subterranean crustaceans (Niphargus rhenorhodanensis and Niphargus virei) and in a morphologically close surface-dwelling crustacean (Gammarus fossarum). The hypogean N. virei presented all characteristics of a stenothermal organism: it showed small thermal plasticity and optimised its performance on a narrow range {{of temperature}}. In contrast, the epigean G. fossarum and more surprisingly the hypogean N. rhenorodanensis can be both characterized as <b>eurythermal</b> organisms: they exhibited important survival times and conserved their performance optimum throughout a large range of temperature. Such differences of survival and performance patterns in two hypogean organisms were unexpected since they both live in very thermally buffered biotopes. Our data suggest fresh hypotheses {{about the role of}} glaciations in the history and adaptation of hypogean crustacean...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of seasonal acclimatization in <b>eurythermal</b> fish such as common carp {{are not fully}} understood. Here, we concentrate on the regulation of pituitary factors, as this organ was shown to be highly affected by seasonal changes. We cloned and sequenced two different cDNAs {{for each of the}} transcription factors Pitx 2 and Rpx, known {{to play a role in}} pituitary development. We show that these genes are conserved throughout evolution, to different degrees depending on the specific domain considered. Finally, we show that the cDNAs for both factors are clearly up-regulated during the winter season, in sharp contrast to other regulators such as Pit 1 or pituitary hormone genes such as prolactin (prl) and growth hormone (gh). Our results suggest that increased expression of Pitx 2 and Rpx contributes to seasonal adaptation of common carp to winter conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Studien belegen den Einfluss der Umgebungstemperatur auf die physiologischen Prozesse im Körper von ektothermen Tieren. In der aktuellen Studie wurde der Einfluss der Außentemperatur auf das Hörvermögen von ektothermen Otophysen untersucht. Hierfür wurden der Karpfen Cyprinus carpio (Familie Cyprinidae) und der Welse Silurus glanis (Familie Siluridae) herangezogen. Die Versuchstiere wurden {{mindestens}} drei Wochen auf die zu testenden Temperaturen akklimatisiert. Zuerst wurden sie auf 15 °C akklimiert, dann auf 25 °C und anschließend wieder auf 15 °C zurückakklimiert. Mittels der Ableitung Auditorisch Evozierter Potentiale (AEP – Methode) wurde die Hörempfindlichkeit bei insgesamt sieben verschiedenen Frequenzen zwischen 100 bis 4000 Hz getestet. Weiters wurden die Latenzen der Antwort als Verzögerungen auf einen Klick-Stimulus gemessen. Die Latenz wurde als die Zeit definiert, welche zwischen dem Einsetzen des Klick-Stimulus und der ersten konstanten und höchsten Spitze des AEP (P 2) registriert wurde. P 2 zeigte sich als eindeutige Antworten auf den Klick-Stimulus in allen Temperaturen. Bei der höheren Temperatur verbesserte sich das Hörvermögen bei den Karpfen zwischen 300 und 2000 Hz und bei den Welsen zwischen 300 und 4000 Hz. Die P 2 -Latenzen der AEPs nahmen bei 25 °C im Vergleich zu 15 °C bei beiden Arten um 0. 37 ms ab. Diese Daten lassen erkennen, dass die Hörempfindlichkeit mit zunehmender Temperatur bei eurythermen Otophysen steigt. : Ectothermic animals, such as fish, {{are affected}} by ambient water temperature. Their body temperature depends on environmental heat sources, which influence the physiological and metabolic processes, including sensory systems such as the auditory system. In this study I investigated how the ambient water temperature affects the auditory system in two <b>eurythermal</b> otophysan fish species representing two different orders. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to investigate possible effects of temperature on the auditory sensitivity I utilized the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. Auditory sensitivity and temporal resolution were measured in the common carp Cyprinus carpio (order Cypriniformes) and the Wels catfish Silurus glanis (order Siluriformes) after acclimating fish {{for at least three}} weeks to two different water temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C and again 15 °C). Hearing sensitivity increased with temperature in both species. In C. carpio best hearing was detected at 1 kHz at both temperatures and the maximum increase was found at 0. 8 kHz (7. 8 dB). S. glanis showed highest sensitivity between 0. 5 – 1 kHz and largest increase at 0. 5 kHz (10. 3 dB). The improvement in hearing abilities differed between species in particular at 4 kHz. The temporal resolution was measured by determining the latency in response to single clicks from the onset of the sound stimulus to the highest positive peak of the AEP. The latency decreased at the higher temperature in both species by 0. 37 ms on average. Conclusions/Significance: The current study showed that an increase in temperature results in an improvement of hearing (lower thresholds, shorter latencies) in <b>eurythermal</b> species representing different orders of otophysines. The increase in sensitivity seems to be more pronounced in <b>eurythermal</b> than stenothermal (tropical) species. ...|$|E
