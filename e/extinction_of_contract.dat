There are many questions that now arise about the best legal protection to these workers, which are the following: 1) which are the labour prin- ciples applicable to such cases? 2) Is the existing law applicable to expatriated workers? 3) How long does the employment <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> the expatriated worker last? 4) Among the possibilities of suspension, interruption and <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the employment <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> the expatriated worker, {{which is the best}} option? 5) Which is the wage perspective of the expatriated worker...|$|R

If we can characterize tripartite set-off contract as ? assignment contract about A"s claim(which satisfies requirements for setting up assignment against the third party) or ? joint surety contract that C stands joint surety to A, C can insist the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> B"s claim. The ordinary tripartite contract about direct payment, which stipulates that A & B"s each claim is extinguished when C pays the same amount to A directly, can be classified as tripartite set-off contract in a broad sense. Because we can characterize tripartite contract about direct payment as joint surety & joint creditor contract that C stands joint surety to A, and B & A are joint creditors to C, C can also insist the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> B"s claim against the third party creditor. However, under the present security system about receivables, it is problematic to admit C"s refusal right of payment against garnishment creditor before the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> B"s claim, on the basis <b>of</b> tripartite <b>contract</b> about direct payment.

40|$|Because most {{rewarding}} events are probabilistic and changing, the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards {{is important for}} survival. It has been proposed that the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards depends on arousal {{and the amount of}} learning of reward values. Midbrain dopamine neurons were suggested {{to play a role in}} both arousal and learning reward values. Despite extensive research on modeling dopaminergic activity in reward learning (e. g. temporal difference models), few studies have been done on modeling its role in arousal. Although temporal difference models capture key characteristics of dopaminergic activity during the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> deterministic rewards, they have been less successful at simulating the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards. By adding an arousal signal to a temporal difference model, we were able to simulate the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards and its dependence on the amount of learning. Our simulations propose that arousal allows the probability of reward to have lasting effects on the updating of reward value, which slows the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> low probability rewards. Using this model, we predicted that, by signaling the prediction error, dopamine determines the learned reward value that has to be extinguished during extinction and participates in regulating the size of the arousal signal that controls the learning rate. These predictions were supported by pharmacological experiments in rats...|$|R
