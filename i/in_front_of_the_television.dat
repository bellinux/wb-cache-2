500|$|In 1967, Los Gatos {{released}} {{their first}} single, [...] "La balsa", backed with [...] "Ayer nomás". The song catapulted the burgeoning [...] "rock nacional" [...] scene in Buenos Aires, establishing the commercial viability of rock music sung in Spanish, and turning what originally was an underground scene into a widespread youth culture phenomenon. [...] "La balsa" [...] sold over 250,000 copies, an impressive number for that time, {{especially for a}} song with Spanish lyrics that differed from the cheerful and shallow efforts of the contemporary nueva ola movement. Spinetta stated: [...] "We were with Emilio [...] <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> a Saturday afternoon, when we heard [...] "La balsa". Then we said, [...] "but these kids are awesome... let's be hippies from tomorrow!" [...] After a Los Gatos concert, Spinetta met producer Ricardo Kleiman and invited him to the band's rehearsals. When Kleiman heard the band play he signed them to RCA Records, and in November 1968 Almendra released their first single: [...] "Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "El mundo entre las manos". Almendra began playing live, with performances {{during the summer of}} 1969 in Mar del Plata and an appearance at the Ancón Festival in Peru. Their Buenos Aires debut was at the Di Tella Institute as part of Three Beat Shows, where they introduced [...] "Fermín", [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] and [...] "Que el viento borró tus manos", songs which would appear on their first studio album. Almendra released a second single, [...] "Hoy todo el hielo en la ciudad" [...] backed with [...] "Campos verdes"; it was also released in Peru, where it was more successful than it was in Argentina. Between April and September 1969, the band recorded their first LP at TNT Studios, Buenos Aires, while a third single ("Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "Final") was released. At the time of Almendras release, the influence of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had overshadowed the success of the nueva ola, exemplified by the popular teen pop music TV show, El Club del Clan.|$|E
