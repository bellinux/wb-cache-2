25|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of ice cores from continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers {{have been developed}} as temperature proxies since the 1950s. Samuel Epstein {{was one of the}} first to demonstrate the applicability of this proxy by measuring oxygen isotopes in Antarctic snow, and also pointed out complications in the stable isotope-temperature correlation caused by the history of the air masses from which the snow formed. Ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica can be thousands of meters thick and record snow {{isotopic composition}} of the past few glacial-interglacial cycles. Ice cores can be dated by layer counting on the top and ice flow modeling at depth, with additional age constraints from volcanic ash. Cores from Greenland and Antarctica can be aligned in age at high-resolution by comparing globally well-mixed trace gas (e.g. CH4) concentrations in the air bubbles trapped in the cores. Some of the first ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica with age estimates go back to the last 100,000 years, and showed a depletion in δD and δ18O in the last ice age. The ice core record has since been extended to the last 800,000 years in Antarctica, and at least 250,000 years in Greenland. One of the best δD-based ice core temperature records is from the Vostok ice core in Antarctica, which goes back to 420,000 years. The δD-temperature (of the inversion layer where snow forms) conversion in east Antarctica based on modern spatial gradient of δD (9‰/°C) is ΔTI=(ΔδDice-8Δδ18Osw)/9, which takes into account variations in seawater isotopic composition caused by global ice volume changes. It should be noted that many local effects can influence ice δD in addition to temperature. These effects include moisture origin and transport pathways, evaporation conditions and precipitation seasonality, which can be accounted for in more complicated models. Nevertheless, the Vostok ice core record shows some very important results: (1) A consistent δD depletion of ~70‰ during the last four glacial periods compared to interglacial times, corresponding to a cooling of 8°C in Antarctica; (2) A consistent drop of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 100 ppmv and CH4 drop by ~300 ppbv during glacial times relative to interglacials, suggesting a role of greenhouse gases in regulating global climate; (3) Antarctic air temperature and greenhouse gas concentration changes precede global ice volume and Greenland air temperature changes during glacial terminations, and greenhouse gases may be an amplifier of insolation forcing during glacial-interglacial cycles. Greenland ice core isotope records, in addition to showing glacial-interglacial cycles, also shows millennial-scale climate oscillations that may reflect reorganization in ocean circulation caused by ice melt charges. There have also been ice core records generated in alpine glacials on different continents. A record from the Andes Mountains in Peru shows a temperature decrease of 5-6°C in the tropics during the last ice age. A record from the Tibetan plateau shows a similar <b>isotope</b> <b>shift</b> and cooling during the last ice age.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{accurate}} ab initio method of calculating <b>isotope</b> <b>shifts</b> and relativistic shifts in atomic spectra. We test the method on neutral carbon and three carbon ions. The relativistic shift of carbon lines may {{allow them to}} be included in analyses of quasar absorption spectra that seek to measure possible variations in the fine structure constant, alpha, over the lifetime of the Universe. Carbon <b>isotope</b> <b>shifts</b> can be used to measure isotope abundances in gas clouds: isotope abundances are potentially an important source of systematic error in the alpha-variation studies. These abundances are also needed to study nuclear reactions in stars and supernovae, and test models of chemical evolution of the Universe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Isotope</b> <b>shifts</b> and {{pressure}} broadening have been {{measured in the}} two-photon transition at 249 nm from the 5 p 61 S 0 ground level of neutral xenon to a J= 0 level of the 5 p 56 p configuration (the 2 p 5 level in Paschen notation). A continuous-wave tunable dye laser operating at 498 nm with intracavity frequency doubling excited the transition. The work is the first application of Doppler-free laser spectroscopy to a transition involving the ground level of a rare gas. The results show that although no s electron is {{directly involved in the}} transition, the field <b>isotope</b> <b>shifts</b> are comparable with those observed in transitions of the type 6 s-np...|$|R
40|$|<b>Isotope</b> <b>shifts</b> of the 2 $p_{ 3 / 2 }$- 2 $p_{ 1 / 2 }$ {{transition}} in B-like ions are evaluated {{for a wide}} range of the nuclear charge number: Z= 8 - 92. The calculations of the relativistic nuclear recoil and nuclear size effects are performed using a large scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm method. The corresponding QED corrections are also taken into account. The results of the calculations are compared with the theoretical values obtained with other methods. The accuracy of the <b>isotope</b> <b>shifts</b> of the 2 $p_{ 3 / 2 }$- 2 $p_{ 1 / 2 }$ {{transition in}} B-like ions is significantly improved.
