40|$|Abstract: South Africa is characterised by {{widespread}} {{inequality and}} divided societies, which impede <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development. Basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure investment {{can assist in}} addressing these challenges by promoting <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine if basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure investment differently effect <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development indicators of urban and rural municipalities respectively. We use a balanced panel data set containing infrastructure, <b>economic,</b> demographic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> indicators for rural and urban municipalities for the period from 1996 to 2012. To address the research question we construct synthetic indices of basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure, using principal component analysis, to be used in panel regression estimations. To estimate our <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development functions we make use of restricted within LSDV estimation techniques. We use the results on the respective elasticities to evaluate whether the differences between urban and rural municipalities are statistically significant. Our results show that the elasticities of basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure investment generally are more pronounced for <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development indicators in rural municipalities than in urban municipalities. These findings could potentially influence policy decisions in terms of infrastructure investment in favour of rural municipalities to increase <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development in these regions, which could contribute to the reduction of spatial inequalities in South Africa...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in {{promoting}} international <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are {{elected by the}} General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations. Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.|$|E

50|$|Other {{important}} secondary legal {{sources on}} <b>economic,</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural rights are the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on <b>Economic,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Cultural Rights 1987 and the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of <b>Economic,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Cultural Rights 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of <b>economic,</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines {{build on the}} Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of <b>economic,</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural rights. Various United Nations Special Rapporteurs have influenced the normative development of <b>economic,</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural rights. Appointed by the Commission on Human Rights and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of <b>Economic,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.|$|R
