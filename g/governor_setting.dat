40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the replacement of}} a conventional gearbox transmission system by a Hydrostatic Transmission (HST) system. The applications being considered are those of typical off-road vehicles such as forestry, construction site or mining & quarry vehicles. In these applications speed is of less importance as compared to torque and load carrying capacity. To create a small scale simulation of the performance comparison between the two transmission systems, we are selecting a buggy as our test vehicle. The same engine (Briggs & Stratton Model 20, 10 H. P.), as well as wheel base and wheel track being used for both simulations. Geometrically, both vehicles will remain exactly the same and under running conditions the weight required to be hauled is being considered as 350 kg. The only variation {{will be in the}} mountings of the two different transmission systems. The above criteria enables a fair simulation as well as comparison of the two transmission systems. The vehicle will be single seated with a curb weight of around 260 kg. The <b>governor</b> <b>setting</b> of the engine will remain unchanged for both simulations. 25 ” kings tire will be used with the tread pattern being KT 168. The gearbox being considered is a ‘Mahindra Alpha Champion ’ 4 speed gearbox. The purpose of choosing this as the transmission of our baseline vehicle is that it can operate its four gears in reverse as well. This is important as a HST system shows symmetrically opposite characteristics for both forward and reverse, hence making it a fair comparison. The hydrostatics pump and motor will be selected from Eaton product catalogues as thi...|$|E

50|$|However, Edwards {{believed}} that the office of inspector general constituted a duplication of services provided by the Louisiana State Police, attorney general, and local district attorneys.

Lynch was allowed to continue to investigate the governor—something of a challenge that Edwards set forward—but could not investigate any of the six other statewide officials.
