500|$|Burton [...] "loved the idea" [...] {{of playing}} a {{character}} [...] "very different" [...] from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as [...] "Stone Cold". The role of Dylan {{allowed him to}} wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's [...] "uniform" [...] and [...] "black T-shirt", Burton described the experience as [...] "refreshing". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do my hair different, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> {{are always going to}} see me as Jason." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. We made it thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are folks with seriously heavy accents there, and they are proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but before he {{knew he was going to}} be the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> will be watching The Simpsons long after I'm dead." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>people</b> are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for my taste, too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details." [...] Dana Stevens writing for Slate Magazine said: [...] "What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didn't cry onceI, who just the day before wept through the entirety of my child's thoroughly upbeat school play." ...|$|E
