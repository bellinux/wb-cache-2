In this framework, a series of centrifuge tests on an <b>inclined</b> <b>pile</b> group is performed. The analysis {{is based on the}} comparative response of two 2 × 1 simplified pile groups: one with vertical piles and the other with one vertical and one <b>inclined</b> <b>pile.</b> The response of these pile groups to repeated earthquakes or sinusoidal inputs is analyzed through the response frequencies, the envelop curves of bending moment profiles, the axial loads measured in both piles and the kinematic response of the cap.

In {{order to}} {{comparative}} study the force characteristics of vertical and inclined cantilever retaining pile in foundation pit engineering, a practical excavation engineering was considered. Based on the engineering geological conditions of this foundation pit, two three-dimensional simulation models for computing the force characteristics of vertical and inclined cantilever retaining pile were built.

Both the superstructure and piles are modelled with beam elements and the soil is schematized as a visco-elastic medium constituted by independent infinite horizontal layers. The soil-pile and the pile-soil-pile interaction are captured in the frequency domain by means of elastodynamic Green's functions that also allow including the hysteretic and radiation damping. The significance of kinematic stress resultants in piles, the foundation filtering effect and the rotational component of the input motion due to the coupled roto-translational behaviour of the soil-foundation system are also investigated; to this purpose kinematic interaction analyses are performed. These analyses revealed essential for the understanding of the general phenomena governing the dynamic response of the whole soil-foundation-superstructure systems.

The present work is a comparison, at reduced scale in the centrifuge, of the response of two simplified pile groups: a 1 × 2 vertical piles and 1 × 2 pile group with one <b>inclined</b> <b>pile.</b> Two configurations are considered: end-bearing and floating pile group, both with pile heads rigidly fixed with a massive cap. First, repeatability tests under horizontal cyclic loading were performed on both floating pile groups. Secondly, repeated horizontal impact tests were performed on both end-bearing pile groups.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical model, {{based on the}} beam-on-dynamic Winkler foundation approach, {{for the evaluation of}} impedances and kinematic response of single <b>inclined</b> <b>piles.</b> The pile is modelled as a Euler-Bernoulli beam having a generic inclination and the soil-pile interaction is captured by defining soil impedances according to expressions available in the literature for viscoelastic layers undergoing harmonic vibrations of a rigid disk. The coupled flexural and axial behaviour of the pile is governed by a system of partial differential equations, with the relevant boundary conditions, that is solved analytically in terms of exponential matrices. The solution for piles embedded in layered soils is achieved according to the direct stiffness approach by using the analytical solutions derived for generic pile sections embedded in homogeneous soils. Expressions of both the soil-foundation impedance functions and the foundation input motion are derived. Some applications, including comparisons of results with those obtained from rigorous boundary element formulations, are performed to evaluate the model capabilities. Classical stiffness and damping coefficients, based on the propagation of shear and pressure waves in plane-strain condition, are used in the applications to account for the soil-pile interaction; anyway, different formulations can be easily implemented. Results of applications, concerning piles with different inclination in both stiff and soft soils, demonstrate that the model, characterised by a very low computational effort, is able to capture the response of <b>inclined</b> <b>piles</b> subjected to seismic loading. Furthermore, with reference to linear problems, the model allows the derivation of the pile stiffness matrix that can be implemented in commercial computer software based on the finite element approach.

The in-line and lift force formulas for an <b>inclined</b> <b>pile</b> are formu-lated by referring to the conventional Morison and lift force formulas, respectively. Stokes third order wave theory {{is used for the}} estimation of flow kinematics induced around a pile. Based on these formulas, the time-independent and time-dependent values of the drag, mass and lift coefficients are determined by using several methods. Further, the time-dependent coefficients are expanded into Fourier series which consist of several significant components. Reliability of these coefficient values are studied by examining the relative deviation of the predicted wave forces based on these coef-ficient values from the measured ones. The analysis finds that relative deviations of the in-line and lift forces exceed in many cases 15 % and 100 %, respectively, when the time-independent coefficients are used for the prediction of wave forces, but that they are reduced to 5 % and 15 %, respectively, when the time-dependent coefficients are used for it...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} first {{results of}} a research focused {{on the effects of}} piles layout and inclination on the nonlinear seismic response of bridge piers. In particular, some case studies are analysed highlighting some interesting aspects of the research. The analysis methodology, based on the substructure approach, is firstly presented. The soil-foundation system is studied in the frequency domain according to a numerical model developed by the authors that allows computing the frequency dependent impedances of the soil-foundation system as well as the foundation input motion. The inertial interaction analysis of the superstructures are performed in the time domain to capture the non-linear structural behaviour and a suitable lumped parameter model is used to approximate the frequency dependent behaviour of the soil-foundation impedances in the time domain analyses. The procedure is applied to some case studies constituted by single bridge piers found-ed on a soft clayed soil halfspace. Two pile group configurations, characterised by vertical and inclined piles are considered, as well as piers with different yielding bending moments of the base cross sec-tions, to simulate systems with different ductility capacity. The linear behaviour of the systems is also investigated for comparison. Effects of soil-structure interaction are evaluated considering results of fixed base piers as benchmark; analyses demonstrate that <b>inclined</b> <b>pile</b> foundations may {{have a significant impact on}} the superstructure re-sponse, reducing the pier head displacements and ductility demand...|$|E

The cargo steamer Chronos was taken upstream by a rising tide and the bow was wedged under the Victoria Bridge. Tugs managed {{to pull it out}} eventually, but the rising tide could have dislodged a span of the bridge and dumped it in the river, and this was highlighted in the press at the time.As mentioned, the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the William Jolly Bridge posed a major problem {{in the design of the}} foundations. The original design had the piers supported on timber <b>piles,</b> with <b>inclined</b> <b>piles</b> to resist the thrust from the small arch. Piles were driven immediately to the south of the pier, but it became impossible to drive them into the rock and the design was changed to utilise reinforced concrete caissons (heavy, hollow, vertical reinforced concrete cylinders), and the contractor was noted as being completely in accord with this decision. The southern approach spans piers founded on timber piles all driven to rock, or to such depths as it was possible to drive them without damage, and the river piers are founded on reinforced concrete caissons. To achieve this the Sand Island method was invented by Manuel Hornibrook (1893-1970).|$|R

On the other hand, a few solutions {{exist for the}} case of pile groups (Mylonakis and Gazetas 1999). The numerical analysis of a pile or group of piles integrated in a homogeneous soil in the frequency domain is presented by several authors. Using the boundary element method, numerical models were developed {{and a group of}} piles was analyzed by Kaynia (1982) and Kaynia and Kausel (1991). Vibration isolation by a row of piles has been analyzed in Kattis et al. (1999 a, b), and dynamic impedances of pile groups have been studied by Vinciprova et al. (2003) and Maeso et al.

40|$|Since 1970 costal {{structures}} in the Port of Koper are designed as reinforced concrete slabs founded on vertical and <b>inclined</b> steel <b>piles</b> with a slope under the deck. This method of construction requires the excavation of large quantities of silt with bad characteristics, which is used mainly for acquiring new surfaces. The amount of pumped silt, derived from construction of new docks and deepening waterways, exceeds needs. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} take the extra silt elsewhere, which represents an increasing cost for the port. In the thesis is analyzed the possibility of using sheet pile wall on the particular case of the extension of dock number 11. The proposed coastal structure consists of concrete slab founded on steel tubular piles and steel sheet pile wall, which has a soil retaining and bearing function. This method of construction does not required addition excavations. Because of the complexity of the structure, individual elements and appropriate geometry models are acquired step by step. Initially the possibility of using a concrete slab on ground level founded on steel tubular piles and combined sheet pile wall that consist of different types of primary and secondary elements is analyzed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{slamming}} forces from plunging breaking waves on truss support structures in shallow water. The main parts have been model testing and analysis on an existing 1 : 50 scale model of a truss support structure for wind turbines at NTNU. An expanding building of offshore structures has led to increased focus on wave forces. Large slamming forces from breaking waves can occur in shallow water. These forces will impact the structure in a much bigger way than non-breaking wave forces. Several researches have been investigating wave slamming forces on single vertical and <b>inclined</b> <b>piles</b> for the last 50 years, but there are still uncertainties at this area. This causes uncertainties in the dimension of structures exposed to these kinds of forces, and are therefore still under investigation. A large number of measurements have been executed. The tests have been run with both regular and irregular waves, with different frequencies and wave lengths. This give waves with different wave heights and breaking points, so that maximum forces can be determined. A &# 147;new&# 148; analyzing method described by M&# 228;&# 228;t&# 228;nen (1979) is applied to obtain the wave slamming force for response force time series. This is a simplified analysis based on an assumption of a single degree of freedom system subjected to a total force. The probability of occurrence of plunging breakers on the foreshore is investigated by Reedijk, et al. (2009). The method is used to find the probability of occurrence of plunging breakers on the truss structure for irregular waves. Maximum force response is given by waves that broke some distance away from the structure and not when the wave broke directly at the structure. The wave broke ahead and surged against the structure, which imposed forces with a slamming character in both the top and bottom force transducers. It is significant air entrained in the water during the breaking process, which may influence the results differently in small-scale model testing and in reality. The reason for this may be scale-effects that may impact interpretation of the results. The measured crest height is smaller due to air entrance in the waves as well. </p...|$|R

The two-point velocity correlation function exhibits exponential decay for small to intermediate values of the separation between spheres. The correlation lengths identified by exponential fits to the data show nontrivial dependence on the averaging time used to determine grain velocities. We discuss the correlation length dependence on averaging time, <b>incline</b> angle, <b>pile</b> height, depth of the layer, system size and grain stiffness, and relate the results to other length scales associated with the rheology of the system.

A number of printed books, articles in journals and reliable internet sources were assessed prior to conducting the methodology analysis for the dissertation. As the literature research grew, it became more and more clear that experts on the field were focusing their studies on the different types of piles, the various items of piling equipment and later the possible installation methods of general application. Moreover, noise control in construction sites is nowadays a matter of increasing importance due to the global turn towards the environmental safety and {{the health and safety of}} the people. Whereas most would find the subject complete from a Civil Engineer point of view, a Surveyor would object; an essential aspect of the installation process is to come up with a way to accurately position the piling frame that will guide the pile to the correct position. The greater the magnitude of the project and the more piling work at sea, the greater the challenge. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of the project in positional tolerances, one would consider a new model of piling frame, one with the element of flexibility in micro – movements, rather than trying to achieve the aforementioned accuracy by positioning the marine barge. In that sense, a need arose for trying to explain the positioning scheme of a piling frame with GPS technology, as well as to explain the mechanics of this new piling frame model, in order to bring a steel pile to the correct place and orientation.

40|$|We study water-immersed {{granular}} avalanches {{in a long}} rectangular cell {{of small}} thickness. By video means, both {{the angle of the}} granular pile and the velocity profiles of the grains across the depth are recorded as a function of time. These measurements give access to the instantaneous granular flux. By <b>inclining</b> the <b>pile</b> at initial angles larger than the maximum angle of stability, avalanches are triggered and last for a long time, up to several hours for small grains, during which both the slope angle and the granular flux relax slowly. We show that the relaxation is quasi-steady so that there is no inertia: the relaxation at a given time is controlled only by the slope angle at that time. This allows us to adapt a frictional model developed recently for dry or water-immersed grains flowing in stationary conditions. This model succeeds well in reproducing our unsteady avalanche flows, namely the flowing layer thickness, the granular flux and the temporal relaxation of the slope. When a water counter-flow is applied along the pile, the granular avalanches are slowed down and behave as if granular friction were increased by an amount proportional to the water flow. All these findings are also reproduced well with the same friction model by taking into account the additional fluid force. 1...|$|R
40|$|When a {{quay wall}} {{does not meet}} the safety {{requirements}} it has {{to be replaced by a}} new quay wall. During the entire replacement project many stakeholders are affected. This can lead to resistance against the project. Resistance can be expected when the interests of the stakeholders are not (sufficiently) integrated in the design or construction method of the replacing quay wall. The high density of stakeholders in urban areas increases the probability that stakeholders will resist against the project. In Amsterdam the lead time for replacing a quay wall is up to five years this lead time accounts for the time from the decision to replace the quay wall until the realization of the new quay wall. One of the reasons for the long duration of the replacement projects is the time invested in dealing with the resistance of stakeholders. While the construction method of the new quay wall has influence on the reaction of the stakeholders, the reactions of the stakeholders on the other hand may influence the construction method. Therefore, in order to reduce the lead time for replacing a quay wall, an optimum between the construction method and the reaction of stakeholders is expedient. In order to minimize the resistance of the stakeholders it is advisable to take the interests of the stakeholders into account. The objective of the present research has been to develop a method to determine the construction method that will most be in accordance with the interests of the stakeholders, in order to possibly minimize the resistance produced by the stakeholders. C&S-matrix In this research, a method called “construction stakeholder matrix” (C&S-matrix) was constructed. This matrix connects the stakeholders and the construction method directly, by comparing the extent to which different construction methods are in accordance with the stakes of the stakeholders. Thereby, the matrix takes into account the influence of different stakeholders on the outcome of the project. The outcome of the matrix is a numerical value: the lower the number, the more resistance can be expected. The C&S-matrix is applied on a case of the Prisengracht in Amsterdam, four types of urban quay walls were selected. The outcome of the matrix is that the combined wall with <b>inclined</b> <b>piles</b> will result in the least amount of resistance produced by stakeholders. The C&S-matrix is a useful method to determine which construction method produces the least resistance. Since the output is numerical value it enables that the construction methods and the expected resistance can be compared, which makes this method unique. The effectiveness of the C&S-matrix mainly depends on the stakeholder analysis, it requires that all the stakeholders with their interest are identified and that the power-vs-interest grid resembles the actual power and interest of the stakeholders. This method predicts which stakeholders will most likely resist, this gives information for other measures to reduce this resistance for example compensation...|$|R

However, limited knowledge regarding load transfer for piles within moving soil may cause design of the piles to be more conservative than is actually needed. The objective of this work is to provide guidance on the effects of pile batter and spacing so designers can reasonably account for these effects when predicting response of piles from lateral loading within moving soils. Load transfer to piles within moving soil masses was analyzed using soil-structure interaction methods. Based on measured soil movements and sliding surface locations, p-y analyses were performed to backcalculate "best fit" p- and y-multipliers that would lead to prediction of the measured bending moments in the micropiles and drilled shafts. The back-calculated p-y parameters were compared with values from literature and with one another to develop recommendations for predicting lateral resistance in deep foundations for slope stabilization applications. As a result of this study, a method was established to obtain p- and y-multipliers for any combination of spacing and batter angle for micropiles with a capping beam. Results of analysis indicate that spacing ratio and batter angle are important factors that influence the resistance. Data suggest that closer spacing increases the resistance, but batter angle was observed to have the greatest effect on resistance. Data show that available resistance increases with batter angle from lower values for <b>piles</b> <b>inclined</b> upslope to greater values for <b>piles</b> <b>inclined</b> downslope. Further, a method was also established to obtain p- and ymultipliers for predicting resistance of piles installed without a capping beam in a continuous row with no batter. Data suggest that closer spacing decreases the resistance...|$|R
