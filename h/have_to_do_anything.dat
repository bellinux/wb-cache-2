Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns {{by pointing out that}} being loved means you have to be nice to people everyday but being hated means you do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> Burns agrees with that logic, saying [...] "I'm a selfish old crank--and that fits me like a Speedo!"

500|$|After the {{presidency}} of Jimmy Carter (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Reagan brought a Kennedy-esque glamour back into the White House. She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years. She remarked that hosting the dinners is [...] "the easiest thing in the world. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> Just {{have a good time}} and do a little business. And that's the way Washington works." [...] The White House residence staff found Reagan demanding to work for during the preparation for the state dinners, with the First Lady overseeing every aspect of meal presentations, and sometimes requesting one dessert after another be prepared, before finally settling on one she approved of.|$|E
500|$|... "Weeping Willow" [...] {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} 15 minutes of fame during the Information Age {{from the perspective of}} the Internet celebrity, one who gains fame through the creation of or participation in a popular website. Leight said of the episode, [...] "Forget about 15 minutes of fame: there are hundreds of people who get their 15 inches of bandwidth, people making names for themselves on YouTube and others. ... This blogging phenomenon has created a certain kind of 'cyberfame,' people who don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> more than put themselves on the Web and catch a cyberwave. We now have a spate of very strange celebrities." [...] Leight said the episode also focuses on the extent to which one will go to achieve such fame. While the Law & Order shows routinely draw on inspiration from real-life events in an approach the creators call [...] "ripped from the headlines", Criminal Intent producers referred to this episode as [...] "'pre-ripping' from the headlines", because the script usually took a real-life event (as the lonelygirl15 phenomenon) and added to it a fictional dramatic conflict (the kidnapping).|$|E

2500|$|On April 13, 2011, Kiss began {{recording}} {{a new album}} due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album [...] "is gonna be the next step to Sonic Boom. Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound." ...|$|E

One instructor wrote that [...] "she confesses that she would not like to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> 'two faced'", while another said she was [...] "very feminine in character, very eager to please, very ready to adapt herself to the mood of the company, the one of the conversation, capable of strong attachments, kind hearted, emotional, imaginative." [...] A further observer said: [...] "Tends to give far too much information. Came here without the foggiest idea what she was being trained for." [...] Later, others commented that she was also physically unsuited, claiming that she would not easily disappear into a crowd. Physically tiny, Inayat Khan also received poor athletic reports from her instructors: [...] "Can run very well but otherwise clumsy. Unsuitable for jumping" [...] "Pretty scared of weapons but tries hard to get over it." ...|$|E
