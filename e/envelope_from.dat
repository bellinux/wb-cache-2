25|$|After the 1984 coin flip, {{which was}} {{won by the}} Houston Rockets, the NBA {{introduced}} the lottery system to counter the accusations that the Rockets and several other teams were deliberately losing their regular season games {{in order to secure}} the worst record and consequently the chance to obtain the first pick. The lottery system involved a random drawing of an <b>envelope</b> <b>from</b> a hopper. Inside each of the envelopes was the name of a non-playoff team. The team whose envelope was drawn first would get the first pick. The process was then repeated until the rest of the lottery picks were determined. In this system, each non-playoff team had an equal chance to obtain the first pick. The rest of the first-round picks were determined in reverse order of the win-loss record.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} in February 1973, Wexler provided Nelson and his band with a studio in New York City, {{where most of the}} recordings were produced. Doug Sahm and his band were also invited to the sessions. During the first session, Nelson recorded the songs for The Troublemaker. Later, he proceeded with Shotgun Willie. Wexler had encouraged Nelson after singing the gospel album to start with the new one, to couple old material with new, and covers. He initially recorded twenty-three tracks along with his and Sahm's band, but Nelson still was not inspired. He wrote the title song after one of the sessions. Pacing in his hotel room, he went to the bathroom, where he sat on the toilet and took the empty <b>envelope</b> <b>from</b> a sanitary napkin from the sink, and penned the song on that. The title of the song refers to the nickname Nelson received after his daughter, Susie, warned him of the domestic abuse suffered by her sister Lana. Nelson drove to Lana's house, where he fought with her husband Steve Warren, and threatened to kill him if he repeated the assault. Soon after Nelson returned home, Warren arrived in his truck with his brothers. The men shot at the house with [...]22 caliber rifles. In response, Nelson and Paul English shot at the aggressors that retreated. When they returned later, Nelson took English's M1 Garand and shot the truck, causing them to surrender. He completed the rest of the song with a reference to John T. Floore, owner of the honky-tonk Floore's Country Store. After hearing the completed song, Wexler decided that the album was to be named after it.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Dorian {{is shocked}} to learn that Victor had another child and was {{apparently}} married to a woman other than Viki and sister Meredith's mother, Eugenia Randolph Lord. In 1985, Tina Clayton (Andrea Evans) claims to have been conceived {{as the result of}} a love affair-turned-marriage between Victor Lord and Irene Manning. Further, she claims that Dorian and Victor were never married but that Irene was in fact Victor's widow. Tina asserts that she should take over Dorian's half of the Lord estate. Tina showed Dorian the secret room which Victor had built below Llanfair and Dorian then showed Viki, which caused Viki to turn into alter-ego [...] "Niki Smith" [...] for the first time since 1969. Eventually, Viki reemerges again, and Dorian finds an <b>envelope</b> <b>from</b> Victor addressed to her. Inside is a decree certifying that Victor had indeed divorced Irene long before he married Dorian and therefore Dorian, not Irene, was his widow and rightful heir to half of the Lord fortune. A judge gives Tina nothing, but Viki eventually welcomes Tina into the family and as a member of the Lord estate, after which she changes her surname to [...] "Lord".|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{development}} of effective antiretroviral treatments, {{there is still no}} cure for HIV- 1. Major barriers to HIV- 1 eradication include the diversity of intrapatient viral quasispecies and the establishment of reservoirs in tissue sanctuary sites. A better understanding of these populations is required for targeted treatments. While previous studies have examined the relationship between brain and blood or immune tissues, few have looked at and compared the properties of viruses from other tissue compartments. In this study, 75 full length HIV- 1 <b>envelopes</b> were isolated <b>from</b> the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, colon, lung, and lymph node of an HIV- 1 infected subject. No envelopes could be amplified from the plasma or serum. Envelopes were subjected to genotypic and phenotypic characterization. Of the 75 envelopes, 53 were able to infect HeLa TZM-bl cells. The greatest proportion of non-functional <b>envelopes</b> was <b>from</b> the lung, a result of APOBEC-induced hypermutation. Lower frequencies of hypermutation were also observed in the occipital lobe and colon. <b>Envelopes</b> <b>from</b> regions of the brain were almost all macrophage tropic, while those from the body were predominantly non-macrophage tropic. All envelopes used CCR 5 as a coreceptor. Phylogenetic analyses showed that sequences were compartmentalized inside the brain. These findings were also observed using PacBio next generation sequencing to examine 32, 152 full length sequences. <b>Envelopes</b> <b>from</b> tissues of the body displayed greater variation in sequence length, charge, and number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in comparison to <b>envelopes</b> <b>from</b> tissues of the brain. Increased variation was also observed in IC 50 s for inhibition and neutralization assays using sCD 4, maraviroc, b 12, PG 16, 17 b, and 447 - 52 D. The increased variation observed in <b>envelopes</b> <b>from</b> tissues outside the brain suggests that different pressures may be influencing the evolution of these viruses and emphasizes the importance of further studies in these tissue sites...|$|R

40|$|Cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa became {{resistant}} to the lytic effect of ethylenediametetraacetate (EDTA) when grown in a Mg 2 +-deficient medium. To correlate ultrastructural changes in the cell wall associated with the shift to EDTA-resistance, a freeze-etch study was performed. Upon fracturing, the outer cell wall membrane split down the hydrophobic center to reveal the outer (concave) and inner (convex) layers. The concave cell wall layer of EDTA-sensitive cells grown in Mg 2 +-sufficient medium contained spherical units resting on an underlying smooth support layer. Upon EDTA treatment, approximately one-half of these spherical units were extracted. Cells grown in Mg 2 +-deficient medium were {{resistant to}} EDTA. The concave cell wall layer of EDTA-resistant cells had increased numbers of highly compacted spherical units, giving this layer a disorganized appearance. The highly compacted appearance of this layer was unaltered by EDTA treatment. Thus, growth in Mg 2 +-deficient medium resulted in cells which were resistant to EDTA and which possessed an ultrastructurally altered outer layer of the outer cell wall membrane. Cell <b>envelopes</b> <b>from</b> EDTA-resistant cells were found to possess 18 % less phosphorus, 16. 4 % more total carbohydrate, and 13. 3 % more 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate than cell <b>envelopes</b> <b>from</b> EDTA-sensitive cells.
