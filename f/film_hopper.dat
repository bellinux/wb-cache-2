40|$|An {{in depth}} {{study of the}} plot, script and {{techniques}} used in these <b>films.</b> Edward <b>Hopper</b> : Edward Hopper (1882 - 1967) {{is one of the}} best known and most admired of American artists. He found poetry in quiet, private moments set in unexceptional places, such as anonymous hotel rooms, diners (Nighthawks), gas stations, and traditional houses. Within these urban or small-town spaces, Hopper created iconic images of American life that present us with the possibility of narrative, but ultimately remain enigmatic. Rather than depict a specific story, they suggest a universal, shared experience. This <b>film</b> traces <b>Hopper's</b> varied influences, from French impressionism to the gangster films of the 1930 s. The documentary uses archival photos and film, specially shot footage of locations painted by Hopper in New York and the New England coast, and interviews with artists Eric Fischl and Red Grooms, scholars, and curators. Narrated by Steve Martin An Education : A coming-of-age story about a teenage girl in 1960 s suburban London, and how her life changes with the arrival of a playboy nearly twice her age. N/...|$|R
