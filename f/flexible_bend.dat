So fine were the lines of her lips that, though full, each corner of her mouth was as clearly cut as the point of a spear.

The structural properties of DNA lesions that determine their relative susceptibilities to NER are therefore of great interest. As a model system, we have investigated the major mutagenic lesion derived from the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 10 S (+) -trans-anti-B[a]P- 2 -dG in six different sequence contexts that differ in how the lesion is positioned in relation to nearby guanine amino groups. We have obtained molecular structural data by NMR and MD simulations, bending properties from gel electrophoresis studies, and NER data obtained from human HeLa cell extracts for our six investigated sequence contexts. This model system suggests that disturbed Watson-Crick base pairing is a better recognition signal than a <b>flexible</b> <b>bend,</b> and that these can act in concert to provide an enhanced signal. Steric hinderance between the minor groove-aligned lesion and nearby guanine amino groups determines the exact nature of the disturbances.

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} study presents {{the recognition of}} fingers grasps for various grasping styles of daily living. In general, the posture of the human hand determines the fingers {{that are used to}} create contact between an object at the same time while developing the touching contact. Human grasping can detect by studying the movement of fingers while bending during object holding. Ten right-handed subjects are participated in the experiment; each subject was fitted with a right-handed GloveMAP, which recorded all movement of the thumb, index, and middle of human fingers while grasping selected objects. GloveMAP is constructed using <b>flexible</b> <b>bend</b> sensors placed back of a glove. Based on the grasp human taxonomy by Cutkosky, the object grasping is distinguished by two dominant prehensile postures; that is, the power grip and the precision grip. The dataset signal is extracted using GloveMAP, and all the signals are filtered using Gaussian filtering method. The method is capable to improving the amplitude transmission characteristic with the minimal combination of time and amplitude response. The result was no overshoot in order to smoothen the grasping signal from unneeded signal (noise) that occurs on the input / original grasping data.

For human motions, soft sensors could provide direct joint-level angle measurements, hence lead to a reconstruction of human body trajectories. For soft robots, soft sensors are required to provide sensory and control information while not interfering with the primary compliant and adaptive features of the robotic devices. However, for both of the above application scenarios, bending and stretch are two closely coupled factors.

40|$|Cranial kinesis in {{vertebrates}} {{is found}} mainly in birds and reptiles. In birds, especially, cranial kinesis is well developed and found {{in almost all}} species (Zusi, 1984). In birds, cranial kinesis always implies {{the ability to move}} the upper bill, or a part of it, relative to the braincase. Within birds, three main types of cranial kinesis can be discriminated (Fig. 1; Zusi, 1984) : (i) prokinesis, in which the upper bill itself is inflexible and rotates around the nasal–frontal hinge, (ii) amphikinesis, in which the entire bill rotates around the nasal–frontal hinge with additional rotation near the rostrum maxillae, and (iii) rhynchokinesis, in which rotation occurs in <b>flexible</b> <b>bending</b> zones rostral to the nasal–frontal suture, where a clear hinge is absent. Within rhynchokinesis, five different types can be distinguished according to the position of the <b>flexible</b> <b>bending</b> zones (Zusi, 1984). The movement for cranial kinesis is generated by a complex mechanism in the skull. This mechanism includes the quadrates, pterygoids, palatines, jugal bars and all associated muscles and ligaments. The closely associated pterygoids, palatines and vomer will be referred to as the pterygoid– palatine complex (PPC; Gussekloo and Zweers, 1999). Bock (Bock, 1964) has described the kinematics of the quadrate and PPC in cranial kinesis for a neognathous prokinetic bird as follows: rostro-dorsal rotation of the quadrate results in a rostral movement of the pterygoids, which transfers the movement onto the palatine, vomer, maxilla and premaxilla, resulting in elevation of the upper bill. A caudo-ventral rotation of the quadrate, and a subsequent caudal movement of the pterygoid, palatine, vomer, premaxilla and maxilla, achieves depression of the upper bill...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe pipe-in-pipe {{which the}} authors propose {{in this paper}} is an {{innovative}} structural material to exert a more <b>flexible</b> and ductile <b>bending</b> performance than usual steel pipes. It consists of double thin wall pipes with granular materials such as sand between the outer and inner pipes to transmit their interactive stresses within a cross section. If a single hollow pipe is subjected to bending moment, the curvature of the pipe increases with the growth in magnitude of bending moment. Upon increasing of the bending moment, the pipe finally failed by local failure, and an oval-shaped deformation of cross section was observed. This failure {{is known as the}} Brazier Effect, a kind of local buckling. However, the major parts of the pipe still keep its original strength except for the failure portion. The sand filled between the outer and inner pipes of the pipe-in-pipe prevent this local failure by transmitting the interactive stresses between the pipes. As a result, smooth and <b>flexible</b> <b>bending</b> deformation is realized even under large bending moments. The purposes of our study are to clarify the mechanism of this system and to construct the model for design of this structure...|$|R

The as-fabricated flexible ATSC displays a much higher working voltage of 4. 5 V and hence efficient energy density as well as power density, which are 61 % and 33 % higher than those of the single asymmetric supercapacitor, respectively. The ATSC displays high capacitance stability over large working voltage of 4. 5 V with 97 % capacitance retention after 5000 charging-discharging cycles. In addition, a stable capacitive response is maintained during the <b>flexible</b> <b>bending,</b> and a constant capacitive response is maintained even at a much higher scan rate of 5000 mV/s. Moreover, the ATSC could be easily coupled with a photodetector to provide stable power during the detection of multiple illumination signals.

The in-plane dynamic equations of a generic launch vehicle with multiple <b>flexible</b> <b>bending</b> and fuel sloshing modes are developed and linearized. The information from LeRC about the grids, masses, and modes is incorporated into the model. The eigenvalues of the plant are analyzed for several modeling factors: utilizing diagonal mass matrix, uniform beam assumption, inclusion of aerodynamics, and the interaction between the aerodynamics and the <b>flexible</b> <b>bending</b> motion. Preliminary PID, LQR, and LQG control designs with sensor and actuator dynamics for this system and simulations are also conducted. The initial analysis for comparison of PD (proportional-derivative) and full state feedback LQR Linear quadratic regulator) shows that the split weighted LQR controller has better performance than that of the PD. In order to meet both the performance and robustness requirements, the H(sub infinity) robust controller for the expendable launch vehicle is developed. The simulation indicates that both the performance and robustness of the H(sub infinity) controller are better than that for the PID and LQG controllers. The modelling and analysis support studies team has continued development of methodology, using eigensensitivity analysis, to solve three classes of discrete eigenvalue equations. In the first class, the matrix elements are non-linear functions of the eigenvector. All non-linear periodic motion can be cast in this form. Here the eigenvector is comprised of the coefficients of complete basis functions spanning the response space and the eigenvalue is the frequency. The second class of eigenvalue problems studied is the quadratic eigenvalue problem. Solutions for linear viscously damped structures or viscoelastic structures can be reduced to this form. Particular attention is paid to Maxwell and Kelvin models. The third class of problems consists of linear eigenvalue problems in which the elements of the mass and stiffness matrices are stochastic. dynamic structural response for which the parameters are given by probabilistic distribution functions, rather than deterministic values, can be cast in this form.
