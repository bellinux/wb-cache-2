Luster was represented in that suit by Jay Leiderman and J. David Nick. The habeas corpus petition was granted in April 2012. [...] On March 11, 2013, the Ventura County Superior Court vacated Luster's 124-year sentence but not his conviction, based on the trial judge's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> specific <b>reasons</b> for imposing consecutive sentences, and ordered a new sentencing hearing April 4, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The 2nd Circuit, in U.S. v. Myers, {{ruled that}} if the liberty {{interest}} at stake in a decision involving a condition of release is fundamental, a deprivation of that liberty is [...] "reasonably necessary" [...] only if the deprivation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. Courts of appeals have consistently required district courts to set forth factual findings to justify special probation conditions. It is not enough that the required findings are implicit in the record. The District Court is required to give reasons on the record for imposition of special conditions of supervised release. A district court's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> its <b>reasons</b> for conditioning supervised release results at a minimum in a remand.|$|R

50|$|The Court first {{noted that}} federal {{question}} case law often erroneously conflated subject matter jurisdiction requirements with the required {{elements of a}} claim for relief. Courts often did not specify whether a case was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> a claim. The Supreme Court had itself in prior Title VII decisions {{declined to comment on}} whether the lower court had properly designated the plaintiff's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> a claim under Title VII as a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> establish subject matter jurisdiction, preferring instead to focus on the lower court's construction of the statute.|$|R

In its motion to dismiss, Target Corporation argued that the applicable civil rights laws mandated that only retail stores must provide accessibility accommodations to disabled persons, and thus that dismissal should be granted for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> a valid claim against its online activities. Target argued that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to apply exclusively to physical accommodations instead of cyberspace, and that such application of the California acts on accessibility would violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.|$|R
