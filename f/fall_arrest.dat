[...] The viaduct was built {{before the advent}} of construction safety equipment such as hard hats and <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> devices. [...] Surprisingly, no deaths were recorded during the construction, but deaths have occurred at the viaduct since completion; mainly from people crossing it while trains passed in opposite directions. [...] Charlie, the old white horse who had hauled the empty railcars back to Sharon, Massachusetts (4 miles), was placed upon the flat car and hauled across the viaduct by the workers, thus becoming the first [...] "passenger" [...] to cross the structure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>arrest</b> is of {{two major}} types: general <b>fall</b> <b>arrest,</b> such as nets; and {{personal}} <b>fall</b> <b>arrest,</b> such as lifelines.

50|$|Because <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> designs require high-rate-energy {{capacity}} design methods, fundamental <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> {{design is}} tedious and esoteric. Thus, most <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> parts and systems {{are designed to}} the force standards contained in Federal OSHA 29CFR1910.66 appendix c, a force-type design standard which accounts for required energy considerations. The standard mitigates PPE interchangeability problems, allows wide use by designers not versed in high rate energy methods, and it limits the force into the worker to a survivable level.|$|E

5000|$|Because most {{of these}} crimes take place in private or {{with some degree of}} secrecy, it is {{difficult}} to establish the true extent of the crime. The [...] "victims" [...] are not going to report it and arrest statistics are unreliable indicators of prevalence, often varying in line with local political pressure to [...] "do something" [...] about a local problem rather than reflecting the true incidence of criminal activity. In addition to the issue of police resources and commitment, many aspects of these activities are controlled by organized crime and are therefore more likely to remain hidden. These factors are used to argue for decriminalization. Low or <b>falling</b> <b>arrest</b> statistics are used to assert that the incidence of the relevant crimes is low or now under control. Alternatively, keeping some of these [...] "vices" [...] as crimes simply keeps organized crime in business.|$|R

5000|$|The {{severity}} of a <b>fall</b> <b>arrested</b> by the climbing rope {{is measured by}} the fall factor: the ratio of the height a climber falls before his rope begins to stretch and the rope length available to absorb the energy of the fall. (A leader may reduce their fall factor by using [...] "protection", equipment that attaches in some way to the rock, allowing the rope to pass through it.) A fall of 20 feet is much more severe (exerts more force on the climber and climbing equipment) if it occurs with 10 feet of rope out (i.e. the climber has placed no protection and falls from 10 feet above the belayer to 10 feet below—a factor 2 fall) than if it occurs 100 feet above the belayer (a fall factor of 0.2), in which case the stretch of the rope more effectively cushions the fall.|$|R

25|$|The 1953 American Karakoram {{expedition}} was a mountaineering {{expedition to}} K2, at 8,611 metres {{the second highest}} mountain on Earth. It was the fifth expedition to attempt K2, and the first since the Second World War. Led by Charles Houston, a mainly American team attempted the mountain's South-East Spur (commonly known as the Abruzzi Spur) in a style which was unusually lightweight for the time. The team reached a high point of 7750m, but were trapped by a storm in their high camp, where a team member, Art Gilkey, became seriously ill. A desperate retreat down the mountain followed, during which {{all but one of}} the climbers were nearly killed in a <b>fall</b> <b>arrested</b> by Pete Schoening, and Gilkey later died in an apparent avalanche. The expedition has been widely praised for the courage shown by the climbers in their attempt to save Gilkey, and for the team spirit and the bonds of friendship it fostered.|$|R

40|$|Hong Kong's {{construction}} industry has shown {{significant improvement in}} safety performance {{since the turn of}} the century. The number of industrial accidents in the {{construction industry}} has decreased from 11, 925 in 2000 to 3, 833 in 2004, which is an encouraging drop of almost 68 %. However, the category "fall of person from height" has always represented a large proportion of the industrial accidents, particularly fatal accidents. In 2004, fall of person from height represented just over 47 % of the total number of fatal accidents in the construction industry. The statistics show that although the overall number of accidents has dropped immensely, the same does not apply for fall from height accidents. According to statistics provided by the Labor Dept. of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, there were a total of 22 fatal industrial accidents associated with fall of persons from height in repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition works during 2000 - 2004. When analyzing these case studies, 12 common factors were identified for analyzing these case studies and strategies were suggested to prevent recurrence of similar accidents in each case. The top five strategies were: (1) provide and maintain a safe system of work; (2) provide a suitable working platform; (3) (tier) provide safety information/training/instruction/supervision; (4) (tier) provide suitable <b>fall</b> <b>arresting</b> system/anchorage; and (5) maintain safe workplace.
