5|$|The {{major areas}} that are highly {{productive}} and buildable are basically in Tablas and Sibuyan. These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island. All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level to gently sloping lands. Overall, good <b>developable</b> lands represent about 13 percent of the province’s total area.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of <b>developable</b> land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as <b>developable</b> land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

25|$|One way of {{describing}} a projection is first to project from the Earth's surface to a <b>developable</b> surface {{such as a}} cylinder or cone, and then to unroll the surface into a plane. While the first step inevitably distorts some properties of the globe, the <b>developable</b> surface can then be unfolded without further distortion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>developable</b> surface {{may also}} be either tangent or secant to the sphere or ellipsoid. Tangent means the surface touches but does not slice through the globe; secant means the surface does slice through the globe. Moving the <b>developable</b> surface away from contact with the globe never {{preserves}} or optimizes metric properties, so that possibility is not discussed further here.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of surfaces with Gaussian curvature 0 include cones, tangent developables, and more generally any <b>developable</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{complex of}} groups is <b>developable</b> if {{and only if}} the homomorphisms of Γσ into the edge-path group are injective.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sphere}} {{is not a}} <b>developable</b> surface, it is {{impossible}} to construct a map projection that is both equal-area and conformal.|$|E
25|$|When {{a surface}} has a {{constant}} zero Gaussian curvature, {{then it is}} a <b>developable</b> surface and the geometry of the surface is Euclidean geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{domain and}} quotient Y = X / Γ can naturally {{be identified as}} simplicial complexes in this case, given by the stabilisers of the simplices in the fundamental domain. A complex of groups Y {{is said to be}} <b>developable</b> if it arises in this way.|$|E
25|$|Smooth {{surfaces}} {{equipped with}} Riemannian metrics are of foundational importance in differential geometry. A Riemannian metric endows a surface with notions of geodesic, distance, angle, and area. An important class of such surfaces are the <b>developable</b> surfaces: surfaces {{that can be}} flattened to a plane without stretching; examples include the cylinder and the cone.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, former {{gasworks}} have commonly {{been developed}} over for residential and other uses (including the Millennium Dome), {{being seen as}} prime <b>developable</b> land {{in the confines of}} city boundaries. Situations such as these are now leading to problems associated with planning and the Contaminated Land Regime and have recently been debated in the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|Minding's theorem (1839) {{states that}} all {{surfaces}} {{with the same}} constant curvature K are locally isometric. A consequence of Minding's theorem is that any surface whose curvature is identically zero can be constructed by bending some plane region. Such surfaces are called <b>developable</b> surfaces. Minding also raised the question whether a closed surface with constant positive curvature is necessarily rigid.|$|E
25|$|In August 1989, San Francisco was surpassed for {{the first}} time in {{population}} by San Jose (located in Silicon Valley), the world center of the computer industry. San Jose has continued since then to grow in population since it is surrounded by large tracts of <b>developable</b> land. Thus, San Francisco is now the second largest city in population in the San Francisco Bay Area after San Jose.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the last}} <b>developable</b> parcels of land on the island, a 15 acre site {{approved}} for residential development facing the shipping channel that separates the island from Miami Beach, was {{for a number of}} years subject to a protracted legal battle between Inna Gudavadze, the widow of the late Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili, and investors aligned with his distant relative and former business associate, Joseph Kay.|$|E
25|$|As the University {{continues}} to expand, numerous other potential housing sites {{have been evaluated}} by master planners. In mid-2015, the Borough of Glassboro issued Requests for Qualified Developers for the remaining <b>developable</b> land along Rowan Boulevard. Additionally, the Borough is seeking to redevelop the former Roxy theatre location in Downtown Glassboro. Rowan University has agreed to lease space at this location for its College of Performing Arts and the Rowan Television Network.|$|E
25|$|The orbifold {{is said to}} be <b>developable</b> or good if it arises as the {{quotient}} by {{a finite}} group action; otherwise it is called bad. A universal covering orbifold can be constructed for an orbifold by direct analogy with the construction of the universal covering space of a topological space, namely as the space of pairs consisting of points of the orbifold and homotopy classes of orbifold paths joining them to the basepoint. This space is naturally an orbifold.|$|E
25|$|The idea of '{{resilience}} building' is debatably at {{odds with}} the concept of resilience as a process, since it is used to imply that it is a <b>developable</b> characteristic of oneself. Those who view resilience as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage resilience. Bibliotherapy, positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building. In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.|$|E
25|$|If M is a Riemannian n-manifold with a cocompact proper {{isometric}} {{action of}} a discrete group Γ, then the orbit space X = M/Γ has natural orbifold structure: for each x in X take a representative m in M {{and an open}} neighbourhood V'm of m invariant under the stabiliser Γm, identified equivariantly with a Γm-subset of T'm'M under the exponential map at m; finitely many neighbourhoods cover X and each of their finite intersections, if non-empty, is covered by an intersection of Γ-translates g'm·V'm with corresponding group g'm Γ g'm−1. Orbifolds that arise in this way are called <b>developable</b> or good.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, 1998, Intrawest {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} the Action Park property along with the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area (but not all of it, as some of the Great Gorge property {{was not included in the}} deal and became Crystal Springs Resort) and <b>developable</b> real estate lands GAR previously owned. After a massive overhaul, which included revamping rides and removing attractions deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, the waterpark was reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark and operated under that name until 2013. With an increased emphasis on ride safety, the alpine slide and Motorworld areas were eliminated and some new water attractions were added.|$|E
2500|$|A {{surface that}} can be {{unfolded}} or unrolled into a plane or sheet without stretching, tearing or shrinking is called a <b>developable</b> surface. The cylinder, cone and the plane are all <b>developable</b> surfaces. The sphere and ellipsoid do not have <b>developable</b> surfaces, so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image.

2500|$|Lee's {{objection}} {{refers to}} the way the terms cylindrical, conic, and planar (azimuthal) have been abstracted in the field of map projections.

2500|$|The three <b>developable</b> {{surfaces}} (plane, cylinder, cone) {{provide useful}} models for understanding, describing, and developing map projections.

2500|$|Once {{a choice}} is made between {{projecting}} onto a cylinder, cone, or plane, {{the aspect of}} the shape must be specified. The aspect describes how the <b>developable</b> surface [...] is placed relative to the globe: it may be [...] normal (such that the surface's axis of symmetry coincides with the Earth's axis), transverse (at right angles to the Earth's axis) or oblique (any angle in between).|$|E
2500|$|Finding {{algebraic}} equations is straightforward, {{the solutions}} {{of which have}} the topology of a Möbius strip, but in general, these equations do not describe the same geometric shape that one gets from the twisted paper model described above.

In this case the simplicial complex X is canonically defined: it has k-simplices (σ, xΓσ) where σ is a k-simplex of Y and x runs over Γ / Γσ. Consistency can be checked using the fact that the restriction of the complex of groups to a simplex is equivalent to one with trivial cocycle gρστ.|$|E

50|$|In particular, {{if one of}} the {{surfaces}} is a plane, then the other is called a <b>developable</b> surface: thus a <b>developable</b> surface is one which is locally isometric to a plane. The cylinder is <b>developable,</b> but the sphere is not.|$|E
