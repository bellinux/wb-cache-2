5|$|Khonsari first {{discussed}} {{the game in}} February 2011, announcing it as 1979: The Game. It was initially intended to be episodic, consisting of three or nine episodes, but was later reduced to one game. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US$395,000, but failed to reach its goal, {{with a total of}} US$304,741 raised. Additional fundraising was set up on the game's website. Following the failed campaign, the team partnered with the New Frontier Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015, the Museum of the Moving Image <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Doris Duke Foundation. 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5, 2016, for iOS devices on June 10, 2016, and for Android devices on December 14, 2016; console versions are also in development. The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit with the experience. 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine. Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel, stating that it depends on the commercial success of the first game. He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale Indian {{immigration}} to the Pacific coast of North America {{took place in the}} 20th century, especially from Punjab, which faced an economic depression. The Canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada and at restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth. The community had expected that its commitment would be honoured with the same welcome and rights which the British and colonial governments extended to British and white immigrants. The restrictive legislation fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. Many Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems. Meanwhile, India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining on the east coast of North America towards 1910, but activity gradually shifted west to San Francisco. The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast, and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement.|$|E
