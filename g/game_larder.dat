25|$|Many of the abbey's {{outbuildings}} were derelict in {{the late}} 20th century. The stables were restored and converted into luxury holiday cottages in 1994–97. Restoration of the <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> and clock tower was completed in the early 21st century, removing the former from the at risk register.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} service {{buildings to}} the abbey mainly {{date from the}} 18th and 19th centuries, and are predominantly constructed in red brick. Many feature Gothic ornamentation. A service court consisting of two ranges dating from the 18th or early 19th century stands adjacent to {{the house on the}} south-east side; the ranges are both listed at grade II. The north range features lancet windows, cross-shaped arrowslits and a parapet with battlements; it includes an octagonal turret and a water tower, both with battlements. The south range includes a square clock tower, built in 1815 to celebrate the Battle of Waterloo; the clock is by JB Joyce & Co. The tower is decorated with arrowslits and capped by an octagonal timber bell cote. Standing in the courtyard is a grade-II*-listed <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> probably by the Irish Morrison family, which dates from the early 19th century. The octagonal structure is topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. The original ironwork on which game was hung remains in the interior.|$|E
500|$|The park {{includes}} a Grade I listed building, White Lodge. [...] The boundary {{wall of the}} park is Grade II listed as are ten other buildings: Ham Gate Lodge, built in 1742; Holly Lodge (formerly known as Bog Lodge) and the <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> in its courtyard, built in 1735; Pembroke Lodge; Richmond Gate and Richmond Gate Lodge, dated 1798 and designed by Sir John Soane; [...] Thatched House Lodge; and White Ash Lodge and its barns and stables, built in the 1730s or 1740s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Game</b> <b>larders</b> {{were usually}} {{situated}} near the kitchen. The usual English design is single storey, sometimes octagonal, and usually of brick or stone construction; ventilation {{is provided by}} louvred roof lanterns and louvred or mesh-covered unglazed windows. Some <b>game</b> <b>larders</b> had separate rooms for small and large game. A stone or slate floor helped to cool the room. By the early 20th century, refrigeration via cooling pipes was employed. <b>Game</b> <b>larders</b> were sometimes combined with other outbuildings, especially ice houses, as for example at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire and Raith Park in Fife. In central Europe, ice houses were themselves sometimes used for storing deer carcasses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Game</b> <b>larders</b> and venison larders were {{sometimes}} marked on Ordnance Survey maps as ice houses.|$|R

50|$|<b>Game</b> <b>larders</b> {{continue}} to be used on shooting estates in Britain to store game and sometimes additionally to process it to meat products such as venison. To comply with modern food hygiene regulations, their design incorporates drinking-quality water outlets, and frequently powered ventilation, insect-killing devices and refrigeration.|$|R
5000|$|Staddle stones (variations include Steddle stones [...] ) were {{originally}} used as supporting bases for granaries, hayricks, <b>game</b> <b>larders,</b> etc. The staddle stones lifted the granaries {{above the ground}} thereby protecting the stored grain from vermin and water seepage. In Middle English staddle or stadle is stathel, from Old English stathol, a foundation, support or trunk of a tree. They can be mainly found in England, Galicia and Asturias (Northern Spain).|$|R

50|$|A {{relatively}} early {{example is}} the <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> at Farnborough Hall, Warwickshire, which dates from around 1750 and {{is thought to be}} by Sanderson Miller; the hexagonal rendered-brick structure has a loggia with Tuscan columns and is surmounted with a wooden cupola. An example of an unornamented square <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> stands at Studley Park in Yorkshire; built in limestone, it dates from the late 18th century. The square stone <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> at Rydal Hall in Cumbria has a timber upper storey reached by an external staircase. Although most extant game larders are built in stone or brick, some timber examples have survived. Examples include the structures at Brodsworth Hall, Yorkshire, Audley End House, Essex, and the Bird <b>Game</b> <b>Larder</b> at Ardverikie House, Badenoch and Strathspey.|$|E

50|$|To {{keep the}} ice frozen, doors or {{openings}} were usually built facing north and barley straw, reeds, fern fronds or sawdust was added between layers of ice or snow {{to act as}} insulation. Treated this way the ice would stay frozen for many months, or even a few years if a solution of ice and salt was added, and {{could be used to}} keep food fresh in the castle kitchens, make ice cream, sorbets, chilled drinks, syllabubs and so on consumed during the summer months and the ability to provide these exotic luxuries would raise the owner's social status. Ice was also used to help keep food fresh in the kitchens or <b>game</b> <b>larders</b> during hot summer months. Ice houses were not used as stores or 'fridges' for the preservation of foodstuffs. The development of compressor driven refrigeration {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century rang the death knell for these structures.|$|R
50|$|Van Utrecht {{was mainly}} {{a still life}} painter. The range of still life {{subjects}} that he tackled was wide and included scenes of fish, meat and vegetable stalls, kitchen scenes often including figures or living animals adding a narrative element, displays of <b>game</b> in <b>larders</b> or as hunting trophies, still lifes of fish, fruit and vegetables. More recently, {{on the basis of}} a signed and dated Vase of Flowers of 1642, a few still life paintings with bouquets of flowers have been attributed to van Utrecht.|$|R
50|$|The story {{centers on}} the {{memories}} of disillusioned writer Harry Street (Gregory Peck) who is on safari in Africa. He has a severely infected wound from a thorn prick, and lies outside his tent awaiting a slow death, though in the film it is pointed out he may have acquired the infection from leaping into a muddy river to rescue one of the safari's porters from a hippo after he falls in the river. His female companion Helen (Susan Hayward) nurses Harry and hunts <b>game</b> for the <b>larder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their practical purpose, game larders on great estates often served a decorative function, and could be highly ornate in their design. The <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> at Uppark in Sussex, designed by Humphry Repton, has a floor decorated with deer vertebrae, and {{has been described as}} [...] "a mannered grotesque advertisement for the pleasures of the chase and the table awaiting arriving guests." [...] Dating from around 1810, the rectangular flint-faced building has an octagonal timber portion. The <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> at Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, which also dates from the early 19th century and is thought to be by the Irish Morrison family, has decorative windows in the Gothic style. The octagonal red-brick structure is capped with a timber roof lantern. The <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> at Abbotsford House in Selkirkshire, built by John Smith of Darnick in 1851, {{takes the form of a}} circular castle, with crenellations. The circular interior of the <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> at Holkham Hall in Norfolk is lined with alabaster; designed by Samuel Wyatt, the octagonal building dates from 1803.|$|E
50|$|The walled {{garden and}} the gardener's cottage {{on the north side}} of the walled garden are both listed Grade II, as is the <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> to the north east of the hall.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Cromlix House - {{including}} the <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> ancillary building, gatepiers and garden boundary walls - was {{designated as a}} Category C listed building. An obelisk sundial in the garden is Category A listed.|$|E

50|$|The Manor House, {{next to the}} church, {{dates from}} c. 1690 with {{enlargement}} and alteration in the 18th century. Southwest {{of the house is}} a Grade II* listed <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> and gazebo of similar date. Glebe House, a former farmhouse north of the church, is from the late 17th century and early 18th.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the house and}} gardens, several other buildings and structures on the estate are listed Grade II. The garden wall to the south west of the hall, two urns and a male and female statue, a sundial and an obelisk, the tea rooms, bridge, <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> and revetment are all listed Grade II.|$|E
50|$|A {{separate}} {{building for}} storing game during the maturation process improves ventilation, while reducing the odour problem. Most large country houses in Britain had a <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> and numerous examples built between the early 18th and early 20th centuries survive. The structure also existed in other European countries where hunting or shooting game was popular, including Germany and Austria-Hungary.|$|E
50|$|These were partly {{underground}} structures {{with stone}} foundations, used to store pheasants, rabbits, and other game, apart from venison. Ice {{was taken from}} the ice houses to the larders, which were placed conveniently beside the footpath to the laundry, as close to the castle kitchens as possible. Nothing remains today. An 1807 map clearly marks a <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> in this position.|$|E
50|$|Several other {{buildings}} and structures within the estate are listed as category B and C. Already mentioned are the category C listed single-storey <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> which has a flat roof and is constructed using rubble; a category B listed octagonal shaped dairy; and laundry, all constructed in 1825. Ten years later in 1835 an eight sided dovecote, a quadrangular stable block and walled garden were included.|$|E

50|$|A <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> also {{sometimes}} {{known as a}} deer or venison larder, deer, venison or game house, game pantry or game store, is a small domestic outbuilding where the carcasses of game, including deer, game birds, hares and rabbits, are hung to mature in a cool environment. A feature of large country houses in Britain and parts of northern Europe from the 18th century, game larders continue {{to be used by}} shooting estates.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{includes}} a Grade I listed building, White Lodge.

50|$|Bannerman {{continued}} {{the development of}} the estate, planting trees and cultivating parkland. He continued to utilise Simpson's services and had several ancillary buildings designed and added. Among these were a <b>game</b> <b>larder</b> built from rubble, an octagonal shaped dairy and laundry, all constructed in 1825. Ten years later in 1835 an eight-sided dovecote, a quadrangular stable block and walled garden were included. Bannerman's son, Alexander (1823-1877) the 9th baronet, progressed with further upgrading and he added a third storey with a mansard roof featuring dormer windows to the mansion around 1860. In {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century, he kept a record of the work, both before and after the renovations, in the form of glass negatives. The land around the estate comprised mainly peat moss; some pedigree and half bred sheep were also grazed in the area.|$|E

50|$|Combermere Abbey, {{the remains}} of a former Cistercian monastery founded in 1133, is listed at grade I. Richly endowed at foundation, its lands {{included}} the manor of Wilkesley, the villages of Dodcott, Lodmore and Royal, land at Burleydam, and woods at Butterley Heyes. After its dissolution in 1538, the abbey was granted to Sir George Cotton, who converted part of the abbey buildings into a country house, demolishing the remainder. The estate remained in the Cotton family, later the Viscounts Combermere, until 1919. Little remains of the medieval monastic buildings; remnants of medieval stonework from an arch are concealed in a cupboard in the house, and a sundial in the park is believed to incorporate part of a 12th-century column. The existing house incorporates a building generally considered to represent the Abbot's House, part of whose timbers have recently been dated to around 1502. Its timber-framed structure was hidden under a Gothic remodelling of around 1814-21, in which cement render, castellations and windows with pointed arches were added. Combermere Park occupies a substantial area in the west of the civil parish and contains almost half of the parish's listed buildings and structures. The other listed buildings and structures within the park date from the 18th and 19th centuries; many also have Gothic features. Unusual structures include a grade-II*-listed <b>game</b> <b>larder,</b> an icehouse, a folly incorporating dog kennels, a battlemented water tower and a clock tower.|$|E
