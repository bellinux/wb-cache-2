25|$|Unlike the larval stage, the pupal stage seems {{much less}} variable.

25|$|Once the {{requirements}} are understood, {{it is now}} the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A decision matrix, or Pugh method, is one way (QFD is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects <b>graphic</b> <b>representations</b> of the system (without changing {{the requirements}}). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, reliability analysis, system dynamics (feedback control), and optimization methods.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{a comment}} by Pausanias, who compares {{sacrificial}} practice in Olympia {{with that in}} Pergamon, {{this is the only}} written reference to the altar in all of antiquity. This is all the more surprising because the writers of antiquity otherwise wrote a great deal about such works of art and Ampelius, after all, considered the altar {{to be one of the}} wonders of the world. The absence of written sources from antiquity about the altar has given rise to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the Romans did not regard this Hellenistic altar as important since it did not date from the classic epoch of Greek, especially Attic, art. Only this art and later evocation of the associated values were considered significant and worth mentioning. This view was held particularly by German researchers starting in the 18th century, especially after the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann became known. The only <b>graphic</b> <b>representations</b> of the altar are on coins of the Roman Empire, which show the altar in a stylized form.|$|E

2500|$|During the Joseon Era {{before the}} Japanese {{annexation}} there were travelling theater groups known as namsandang which included underaged males called midong (beautiful boys).

2500|$|The maguey {{was one of}} {{the most}} sacred and {{important}} plants in ancient Mexico. It had a privileged place in mythology, religious rituals and the Mesoamerican economy. [...] Pulque appears in a number of <b>graphic</b> <b>representations</b> from pre-colonial times, beginning with stone carvings from about 200 CE. The first major work involving pulque is a large mural called the [...] "Pulque Drinkers", unearthed in 1968 at the pyramid of Cholula, Puebla. The most likely means of the discovery of aguamiel and fermented pulque was from the observation of rodents who gnaw and scratch at the plant to drink the seeping sap. Fermentation of the aguamiel can take place within the plant itself.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{the case}} that the biomass of each trophic level {{decreases}} {{from the base of the}} chain to the top. This is because energy is lost to the environment with each transfer as entropy increases. [...] About eighty to ninety percent of the energy is expended for the organism’s life processes or is lost as heat or waste. Only about ten to twenty percent of the organism’s energy is generally passed to the next organism. [...] The amount can be less than one percent in animals consuming less digestible plants, and it can be as high as forty percent in zooplankton consuming phytoplankton. [...] <b>Graphic</b> <b>representations</b> of the biomass or productivity at each tropic level are called ecological pyramids or trophic pyramids. [...] The transfer of energy from primary producers to top consumers can also be characterized by energy flow diagrams.|$|E
2500|$|In 1896, Munch {{moved to}} Paris, where {{he focused on}} <b>graphic</b> <b>representations</b> of his [...] "Frieze of Life" [...] themes. He further {{developed}} his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch's Self-Portrait With Skeleton Arm (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by Paul Klee. Munch also produced multi-colored versions of [...] "The Sick Child", concerning tuberculosis, which sold well, {{as well as several}} nudes and multiple versions of Kiss (1892). Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch's work [...] "violent and brutal" [...] but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance. His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, {{in the small town of}} Åsgårdstrand in Norway. He dubbed this home the [...] "Happy House" [...] and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years. It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. [...] "To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here".|$|E
60|$|In {{the fine}} arts, {{as well as}} in literature, a {{levelling}} principle is going on, fatal, perhaps, to excellence, but favourable to mediocrity. Such facilities are afforded to imitative talent, that whatever is imitable will be imitated. Genius will often be suppressed by this, and when it exerts itself, will find it far more difficult to obtain notice than in former times. There is the evil here that ingenious persons are seduced into a profession which is already crowded with unfortunate adventurers; but, on the other hand, there is a great increase of individual and domestic enjoyment. Accomplishments which were almost exclusively professional in the last age, are now to be found in every family within a certain rank of life. Wherever there is a disposition for the art of design, it is cultivated, and in consequence of the general proficiency in this most useful of the fine arts, travellers represent to our view the manners and scenery of the countries which they visit, as well by the pencil as the pen. By means of two fortunate discoveries in the art of engraving, these <b>graphic</b> <b>representations</b> are brought within the reach of whole classes who were formerly precluded by the expense of such things from these sources of gratification and instruction. Artists and engravers of great name are now, like authors and booksellers, induced to employ themselves for this lower and wider sphere of purchasers. In all this I see the cause as well as the effect of a progressive refinement, which must be beneficial in many ways. This very diffusion of cheap books and cheap prints may, in its natural consequences, operate rather to diminish than {{to increase the number of}} adventurers in literature and in the arts. For though at first it will create employment for greater numbers, yet in another generation imitative talent will become so common, that neither parents nor possessors will mistake it for an indication of extraordinary genius, and many will thus be saved from a ruinous delusion. More pictures will be painted but fewer exhibited, more poetry written but less published, and in both arts talents which might else have been carried to an overstocked and unprofitable market, will be cultivated for their own sakes, and for the gratification of private circles, becoming thus a source of sure enjoyment and indirectly of moral good. Scientific pursuits will, in like manner, be extended, and pursuits which partake of science, and afford pleasures within the reach of humble life.|$|E
