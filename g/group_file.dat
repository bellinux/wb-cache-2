40|$|In this project, we cast {{distributed}} resource {{access as}} operations on files {{in a global}} name space and developed a common, scalable solution for group operations on distributed processes and files. The resulting solution enables tool and middleware developers to quickly create new scalable software or easily improve the scalability of existing software. The cornerstone {{of the project was}} the design of a new programming idiom called <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operations that eliminates iterative behavior when a single process must apply the same set of file operations to a group of related files. To demonstrate our novel and scalable ideas for <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operations and global name space composition, we developed a <b>group</b> <b>file</b> system called TBON-FS that leverages a tree-based overlay network (TBON), specifically MRNet, for logarithmic communication and distributed data aggregation. We also developed proc++, a new synthetic file system co-designed for use in scalable <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operations. Over the course of the project, we evaluated the utility and performance of <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operations, global name space composition, TBON-FS, and proc++ in three case studies. The first study focused on the ease in using <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operations and TBON-FS to quickly develop several new scalable tools for distributed system administration and monitoring. The second study evaluated the integration of <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operation and TBON-FS within the Ganglia Distributed Monitoring System to improve its scalability for clusters. The final study involved the integration of <b>group</b> <b>file</b> operations, TBON-FS, and proc++ within TotalView, the widely-used parallel debugger. For this project, the work of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) team occurred primarily in two directions: bringing the MRNet tree-based overlay network (TBON) implementation to the Cray XT platform, and investigating techniques for predicting the performance of MRNet topologies on such systems. Rogue Wave Software (RWS), formerly TotalView Technologies Inc., worked with the University ofWisconsin (UW) team on the design and prototyping of a scalable version of the TotalView debugger.

40|$|Multicast {{networking}} {{support is}} becoming an increasingly important technology area for both commercial and military distributed or group-based applications. The underlying delivery mechanism for IP multicast is presently the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or raw IP packets. At present, these mechanisms provide a &quot;best effort &quot; delivery service. Best effort implies that IP packets are treated with essentially equal weight, and while IP makes an effort to deliver all packets to their destination, packets may be occasionally be delayed, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order. In the past such delivery mechanisms have worked fine for supporting traffic insensitive to occasional lost or missing data (e. g [...] voice, video). An increasing variety of distributed multimedia applications are being developed in which a consistent and/or reliable data delivery of all or a subset of data packets is a critical performance factor. In future military tactical internetworks, situational awareness data will {{play a major role}} as a critical multicast application. Reliable <b>group</b> <b>file</b> transfer (e. g [...] image dissemination) and interactive mission planning applications are also likely applications for military mobile units. This paper presents a taxonomy of presently available reliable multicasting solutions. The protocols are classified in terms of performance issues and scalability.

40|$|In a small network, {{clients and}} servers may all be {{connected}} to a single Ethernet without significant performance concerns. As the number of clients on a network grows, the necessity of splitting the network into multiple sub-networks, each with a manageable number of clients, becomes clear.

The higher speed of FDDI seems to offer an easy solution, but in practice both expense and interoperability problems render FDDI a poor choice. Ethernet switches appear to permit cheaper and more reliable networking to the servers while providing an aggregate network bandwidth greater than a simple Ethernet. This paper studies the evolution of the server networks at SLAC. Difficulties encountered in the deployment of FDDI are described, as are the tools and techniques used to characterize the traffic patterns on the server network. Performance of Ethernet, FDDI, and switched Ethernet networks is analyzed, as are reliability and maintainability issues for these alternatives. The motivations for re-designing the SLAC general server network to use a switched Ethernet instead of FDDI are described, as are the reasons for choosing FDDI for the farm and firewall networks at SLAC. Guidelines are developed which may help in making this choice for other networks...|$|E
40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s Internet is not {{designed}} to protect the privacy of its users against network surveillance, and source and destination of any communication is easily exposed to third party observer. Tor, a volunteer-operated anonymity network, offers low-latency practical performance for unicast anonymous communication without central point of trust. However, Tor is known to be slow and it can not support group communication with scalable performance. Despite the extensive public interest in anonymous group communication, there is no system that provides anonymous group communication without central point of trust. ^ This dissertation presents MTor, a low-latency anonymous group communication system.

The survey provided key housing data on tenure, owner occupation and the social rented sector, and regular information about the private rented sector. The survey was originally sponsored by the Department of the Environment, which became the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions {{in time for the}} 1996 - 1997 survey, then the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, by 2000 - 2001. Responsibility for the SEH was transferred to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister after the fieldwork for the 2002 - 2003 survey commenced, and on 5 May 2006 the series became part of the remit of the newly-established Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). The main aims of the SEH were to provide regular information about the main features of people's housing and their views about their circumstances, and information about the private rented sector (not covered by routine administrative statistics like the owner-occupied and social rented sectors). From 2008, the SEH merged with the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) to form the new English Housing Survey (EHS). The last SEH dataset is the 2007 - 2008 study. The EHS data are available at the UK Data Archive under GN 33422. Further information about the SEH and the EHS may be found on the DCLG web site Survey of English Housing and English Housing Survey web pages. A set of questions on air quality was also included in the 1998 - 1999 survey, asked on behalf of the Building Research Establishment. Main Topics : The SEH comprises a main core of factual questions that remain largely unchanged from year to year, and cover tenure, housing costs and difficulties with mortgage/rent payments, housing history, moving intentions, and the type of home desired. The survey also carries a set of attitudinal questions which are revised/rotated each year.

40|$|Online social {{networking}} {{is available to}} {{anyone who wants to}} sign up to the many sites available. The web-based services allow users to communicate with many media sources and to build relationship networks that have personal meaning. The medium permits open communication and, consequently, the propagation of hidden messages (steganography) and the exchange of images, text, sound files and so on, that may contain hidden information. The purpose of this research is to find out {{whether or not it is}} necessary to include steganography as a routine check when conducting digital forensics examinations in relation to online {{social networking}}. This is a challenge to digital forensic investigators as the hidden messages will not be found if they are not being searched for. 	The research testing was carried out in a laboratory environment under an empirical approach. In the pre-test, five steganographic techniques with different image formats were uploaded on Facebook and Google+ social network websites and then downloaded to identify the techniques that can and cannot be used on Facebook and Google+ for the complete process of covert communication up to the extraction of the hidden messages. Two suitable techniques, JP Hide and Seek and StegHide with common JPEG images were chosen for the experimental case scenarios, based on the pre-test results. The experimental case scenarios were simulated on laboratory computers and digital forensic examinations were undertaken to identify both the uploaded hidden messages in different images and to extract the hidden messages in the uploaded and downloaded image files. Based on the digital forensic examination performed on the experimental case scenarios, a guideline for the steganographic examination process was established. 	The findings from the pre-test results showed that steganography is difficult to perform in the Facebook photo upload feature. Here the hidden message cannot be extracted after the image is downloaded from Facebook, but it can be successfully performed through the message file attachment and <b>group</b> <b>file</b> sharing features with a variety of image formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF. On Google+ photo sharing, on the other hand, the complete cycle of steganography communication from embedding up to the extraction of hidden messages was successfully undertaken with JPEG, PNG, BMP or GIF image formats. The results show that steganography can be propagated in social media; therefore it is necessary to include steganographic evaluation in the standard digital investigation procedures. 	It was discovered during the research experiment that there is a lack of effective forensic tools in the area of steganographic image analysis or signature detection. The current steganalysis tools are designed for specific signatures but there are very many steganographic tools that are capable of embedding hidden messages using different techniques. This is a challenge for the digital forensic investigator. Therefore, there is an opportunity for further research in this area where the capabilities of detection tools can be further developed with more steganographic signatures...|$|E
