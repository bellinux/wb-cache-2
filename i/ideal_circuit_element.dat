40|$|We {{present a}} {{tutorial}} on {{the properties of}} the new <b>ideal</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> a memristor. By definition, a memristor M relates the charge q and the magnetic flux ϕ in a circuit, and complements a resistor R, a capacitor C, and an inductor L as an ingredient of ideal electrical circuits. The properties of these three elements and their circuits {{are a part of the}} standard curricula. The existence of the memristor as the fourth <b>ideal</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> was predicted in 1971 based on symmetry arguments, but was clearly experimentally demonstrated just this year. We present the properties of a single memristor, memristors in series and parallel, as well as ideal memristor-capacitor (MC), memristor-inductor (ML), and memristor-capacitor-inductor (MCL) circuits. We find that the memristor has hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. We show that the ideal MC (ML) circuit undergoes non-exponential charge (current) decay with two time-scales, and that by switching the polarity of the capacitor, an ideal MCL circuit can be tuned from overdamped to underdamped. We present simple models which show that these unusual properties are closely related to the memristor's internal dynamics. This tutorial complements the pedagogy of ideal circuit elements (R,C, and L) and {{the properties of the}}ir circuits. Comment: 22 pages, 12 figures, substantial text revisio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Switching power supplies, due {{to their}} {{high-frequency}} switching operation, draw {{a substantial amount of}} input ripple current. Such ripple current manifests itself as electromagnetic interference (EMI). Active and passive ripple cancellation methods have been proposed in the past. This paper discusses the cancellation methods, and classifies the basic circuit configurations for ripple current cancellation. The basis of discussion is a “nullification ” process, which can be described effectively in terms of the <b>ideal</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> nullor. The initial focus is on differential-mode noise cancellation, but the basic technique can be applied equally to cancelling common-mode noise. The classification provides a clear guideline for synthesizing practical cancellation circuits. Both active and passive implementation examples are given and experimentally demonstrated.
