60|$|CRAMPTON. Coolly and rationally! No, I can't. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that?</b> I can't.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> your Angela is unmarried, {{that she}} was never really married at all--and that she asks {{nothing better than to}} marry you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MAN. Well, I don't {{intend to}} get killed if I can help it. (Still more determinedly.) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that?</b> (He locks {{the door with a}} snap.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The {{shame of}} marrying one man when you love another. You can't love two men.... You'll give yourself. You'll be his wife! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> what <b>that</b> means?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a minute, Madame Pratolungo! One {{thing is}} of the utmost {{importance}} to begin with. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> thoroughly <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I am, in no sense of the word, to blame--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Sir,' {{retorted}} Quilp, 'and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> now, <b>that</b> they're not poor--that they can't be, if {{they have}} such men as your lodger searching for them, and scouring the country far and wide?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'A bet? What d'you mean? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I {{am on the}} Government service, {{and that}} {{you will see the}} inside of a gaol for this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 72. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{you may not}} {{be allowed}} to marry until three years after your {{appointment}} as an Officer, and do you engage to abide by this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did. It's the rotten {{sort of thing}} you would think. Rag, by Jove! Look at this. Now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> this is a genuine concern?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are <b>you</b> <b>doing,</b> woman?" [...] Mr. Fentolin demanded hoarsely. [...] "Listen! It was an {{accident}} that your people were drowned. I'll give you an annuity. I'll make you rich for life--rich! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> what <b>that</b> means?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More of Ki's tricks! Oh! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{the lifting}} of the {{darkness}} at that moment was Ki's work, because he wished the people to believe that I am indeed a sorceress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O stupid one! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are only}} {{to pretend to}} go south? When you are well out of sight, then turn north, and make for the berg. You will find me there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Sir John. [...] "Well, {{you have}} a talent for wrong turns, and such partings are hard. Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the last}} of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON (urgently). Finch: do {{you realize}} what is happening? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> my {{children}} have invited that man to lunch, {{and that he will}} be here in a few moments? ...|$|E
6000|$|SHEFFIELD--[Coldly.] You're mistaken. It {{leads to}} this: <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> your {{running away from}} this child--on the very day of its mother's funeral!--will have a very queer {{appearance}} {{in the eyes of}} the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 50. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{perfectly}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> no salary or allowance {{is guaranteed}} to you, and {{that you will have}} no claim against the Salvation Army, or against any one connected therewith, on account of salary or allowances not received by you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I'm {{beginning}} {{to understand why the}} SRB machines couldn't factor him. It's impossible for us to understand this kind of person. Winslow says he asked for work, any kind of work. The man said he could do anything, fix anything. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> what <b>that</b> means?" ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS [patiently {{putting down}} his pencil] Look here. All {{this is no}} good. <b>You</b> <b>dont</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>You</b> imagine <b>that</b> I'm simply an {{ordinary}} criminal.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if that's so, {{you don't}} {{come in for}} anything? You must excuse me for {{mentioning}} it; but she has told everybody that you were to have it, {{and if there is}} no will--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the future}} must look after itself," [...] {{answered}} Leonard, [...] "snake or no snake. At present we must follow our luck. Otter, listen to me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{you are a}} god, the god of this people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{hell with}} your influence!" [...] {{retorted}} Warburton, the lion in him rising. [...] "The builders--the directors--the {{owners of the}} U. P. R. are {{right here in this}} car. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that?</b> Do you demand that I call a spade a spade?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, father," [...] {{she said}} when he had <b>done,</b> [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are pronouncing Noie's death sentence? If you were in my place, would you not go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they had}} begun in my day and we will discuss them later. Still, I say--nearer to the ape than you or I, and {{therefore}} of interest, as the germ of things is always. Yet he has qualities, I think; cunning, and fidelity and love which in its round is all in all. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand,</b> Allan, <b>that</b> love is all in all?" ...|$|R
60|$|BARBARA [looking at {{him with}} quick {{interest}} and nodding] Just so. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come to <b>understand</b> <b>that?</b> [Lomax is heard at the door trying the concertina].|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} do,' {{retorted}} the dwarf, viciously snapping at his words. 'Of course {{do you understand}} then, that it's no matter what comes of this fellow? of course <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> for any other purpose he's no man for me, nor for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{no answer}} to my question. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> at this moment I am getting a fall which will break every bone in my skin and put any other {{climbing}} {{out of the question}} as far as I am concerned? Do you understand that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's very probable, sir, {{that you}} won't be wanted upstairs for several minutes, Sir, because MY master {{is at this}} moment {{particularly}} engaged in settling the hash of YOUR master, Sir; and therefore you'll have leisure, Sir, for a little private talk with me, Sir. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> Sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I wish {{one could}} be a Christian within and remain a pagan without," [...] I {{answered}} grimly; [...] "though alas! that may not be. Martina, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it was for no such reasons as these that I kissed the Cross; that in so doing I sought not fortune, but to be its servant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything can talk, if <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> its language, Bastin. But keep a good heart, Humphrey, for {{the bold}} seeker finds in the end. Oh! foolish man, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> all is yours {{if you have}} but the soul to {{conceive}} {{and the will to}} grasp? All, all, below, between, above! Even I know that, I who have so much to learn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. I think I <b>did.</b> Can <b>you</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a man may be {{in great}} doubt as to the exact words {{that he may have}} spoken at such a time?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, Harry, {{you were}} {{speaking}} {{on a subject}} that I would rather not have discussed in this house. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> Hermione? I will have no talking about Lord Ongar or his wife. We know very little, and what we hear is simply uncomfortable. Will you dine here to-day, Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{possible}} {{you can see}} this double Wreck," [...] said Mr. Finch, indicating his wife and child, [...] "and suppose that I would communicate or sanction communication of any sort, with the persons who are responsible for it?--My dear! Can you account for Madame Pratolungo's extraordinary question? Am I to understand (<b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand)</b> <b>that</b> Madame Pratolungo is insulting me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, I'll {{tell you}} what it is, young man,' said Mr. Muzzle solemnly, enraged at the last two allusions, 'this here lady (pointing to the cook) keeps company with me; and when you presume, Sir, to talk of keeping chandlers' shops with her, you injure me {{in one of the most}} delicatest points in which one man can injure another. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> Sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] he answered, [...] "but <b>you</b> {{certainly}} won't <b>do</b> it. Can't <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> {{unless we}} grow into our parts, {{they will never}} come naturally to us? Besides, we may be watched. You cannot tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I <b>do.</b> I thought <b>you</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that.</b> That is, if {{you will}} have me. Your old friend, the lunatic, you and I will {{together}} seek for and find this golden flower. I say that's settled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, {{not until}} you have listened. You are very cruel to me, very cruel indeed. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> rather than <b>do</b> <b>you</b> the {{slightest}} harm, I would die a hundred times." ...|$|R
