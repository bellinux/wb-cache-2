The formation energy of the <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair</b> is low at 1.16 eV, and the migration activation energy is unusually low at 0.05 eV (compare to NaCl: 2.18 eV {{for the formation of}} a Schottky pair and 0.75 eV for cationic migration).

5000|$|In {{order for}} a {{permanent}} defect to be produced from initially perfect crystal lattice, the kinetic energy that it receives [...] must be larger than {{the formation energy of}} a <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair.</b> However, while the <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair</b> formation energies in crystals are typically around 5-10 eV, the average threshold displacement energies are much higher, 20-50 eV. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the defect formation is a complex multi-body collision process (a small collision cascade) where the atom that receives a recoil energy can also bounce back, or kick another atom back to its lattice site. Hence, even the minimum threshold displacement energy is usually clearly higher than the <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair</b> formation energy.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} on materials {{is rooted in}} the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. While the event is made up of several steps or processes, the primary result is the displacement of an atom from its lattice site. Irradiation displaces an atom from its site, leaving a vacant site behind (a vacancy) and the displaced atom eventually comes to rest in a location that is between lattice sites, becoming an interstitial atom. The vacancy-interstitial pair is central to radiation effects in crystalline solids and is known as a <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair</b> (FP). The presence of the <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair</b> and other consequences of irradiation damage determine the physical effects, and with the application of stress, the mechanical effects of irradiation by the occurring of interstitial, phenomena, such as swelling, growth, phase transition, segregation, etc., will be effected. In addition to the atomic displacement, an energetic charged particle moving in a lattice also gives energy to electrons in the system, via the electronic stopping power. This energy transfer can also for high-energy particles produce damage in non-metallic materials, as so called ion tracks.|$|E

Experimental and theoretical groups have attempted to explain this phenomenon with various complex theories. In this study, experimental lattice expansion and super saturation of the lattice were well reproduced by molecular dynamics simulation method. From the resemblance with the experimental data, here it is manifested that only oxygen <b>frenkel</b> <b>pairs</b> were created in the fission induced lattice while alpha particle radiation causes both oxygen and considerable amount of uranium defects. Moreover, in this work, defects are divided into two sub-groups as obstruction and distortion and it is shown that obstruction type <b>frenkel</b> <b>pairs</b> merely responsible for the lattice swelling for both fission and alpha particle radiation.

50|$|A Frenkel defect, <b>Frenkel</b> <b>pair,</b> or Frenkel {{disorder}} {{is a type}} of point defect in a crystal lattice. The defect forms when an atom or smaller ion (usually cation) leaves its place in the lattice, creating a vacancy, and becomes an interstitial by lodging in a nearby location. Their prime mechanism of generation is by particle irradiation, as their equilibrium concentration according to the Boltzmann distribution is much smaller than the pure vacancies distribution, due to the large energy necessary for the creation of the associated interstitial atoms. The phenomenon is named after the Soviet physicist Yakov Frenkel, who discovered it in 1926.|$|E
