25|$|When {{the lens}} first {{contacts}} the eye, {{it should be}} comfortable. A brief period of <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, {{taking a break from}} lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.|$|E

60|$|You will {{understand}} that the one alternative before me, after what has happened, is to fill the place from which Penrose has withdrawn. I abstained from breathing a word of this to Romayne. It is he, if I can manage it, who must invite me to complete the work of conversion--and, besides, nothing can be done until the visit of Penrose {{has come to an}} end. Romayne's secret sense of <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> be safely left to develop itself, with time to help it.|$|E
50|$|Skin <b>{{irritation}}</b> <b>may</b> {{also occur}} {{at the site of}} application. Usually, skin irritation is mild to moderate and does not need any further treatment. It may also diminish after prolonged use of docosanol.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} light therapy for sleep phase {{disorders}} include jumpiness or jitteriness, headache, eye irritation and nausea. Some non-depressive physical complaints, such as poor vision and skin rash or <b>irritation,</b> <b>may</b> improve with light therapy.|$|E
50|$|Caprolactone hydrolyses {{rapidly and}} the {{resulting}} hydroxycarboxylic acid displays unexceptional toxicity, as is common for the other hydroxycarboxylic acids. It is known to cause severe eye <b>irritation.</b> Exposure <b>may</b> result in corneal injury.|$|R
50|$|Side {{effects are}} {{generally}} few but can include skin <b>irritation.</b> It <b>may</b> be used mixed with water or alcohol. Chloroxylenol {{is most effective}} against Gram-positive bacteria. It works by disruption of the cell wall and stopping the function of enzymes.|$|R
50|$|This {{compound}} is a {{flammable liquid}} and vapor. It causes eye <b>irritation,</b> and <b>may</b> be harmful if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. It can cause {{depression of the}} central nervous system. It has a flash point of 53 °C.|$|R

50|$|Symptoms include skin <b>irritations,</b> which <b>may</b> be itchy or painful, and are {{sometimes}} confused with hives. These irritations appear upon or shortly after exposure to sunlight, and may last from 1 to 7 days. Lesions have been photographed showing fluid-filled blisters.|$|R
50|$|Veins {{may become}} {{temporarily}} blocked if the internal {{lining of the}} vein swells in response to repeated injury or <b>irritation.</b> This <b>may</b> be caused by the needle, the substance injected, or donating plasma. Once the swelling subsides, the circulation will often become re-established.|$|R
50|$|If iron {{phosphide}} is ingested, water must be {{consumed by the}} victim in order to dilute the {{iron phosphide}} and dampen its effects. Do not use emetics. Ipecac {{should not be used}} either. Ipecac can worsen and aggravate any iron-induced gastrointestinal <b>irritation</b> that <b>may</b> be occurring.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used in}} {{southeast}} Mexico {{in the region of}} Tabasco, as a cold herbal tea, which is named Matali.Skin <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> result from repeated contact with or prolonged handling of the plant — particularly from the clear, watery sap (a characteristic unique to T. zebrina as compared with the other aforementioned types).|$|E

50|$|Once inserted, CIDRs provide slow-release {{administration}} of progesterone, which artificially extends the luteal phase. Plasma progesterone levels rapidly increase upon insertion, and remain relatively consistent while in place. Following CIDR removal, progesterone levels decrease rapidly. Occasionally, vaginal <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> occur. This is normal {{and does not}} impact {{the effectiveness of the}} device or the animal’s performance.|$|E
50|$|Potassium metabisulfite causes skin irritation, serious eye <b>irritation,</b> and <b>may</b> cause {{respiratory}} <b>irritation.</b> Hence, {{it should}} be manipulated under individual protective elements, such as gloves, coat, mask and glasses. Also, {{it should be}} manipulated under alkaline conditions as potassium metabisulfite reacts with acids, liberating toxic gases.|$|R
30|$|There were no {{cases of}} angular or {{rotational}} displacement. No cases of implant breakage were noted. None {{of the patients}} in our study had tendon <b>irritation.</b> This <b>may</b> because we were extra cautious during soft tissue suturing over plate. In none of the patients was implant removal required.|$|R
50|$|Allergic contact {{stomatitis}} {{appears as}} non-specific inflammation, {{so it may}} be mistaken for chronic physical <b>irritation.</b> There <b>may</b> be burning or soreness of the mouth and ulceration. Chronic exposure to the allergen may result in a lichenoid lesion. Plasma cell gingivitis may also occur, which may be accompanied by glossitis and cheilitis.|$|R
50|$|Hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, nausea or {{vomiting}} are {{side effects}} commonly seen when polystyrene resins are used. Cases of colonic necrosis have been reported, particularly when sodium polystyrene sulfonate {{was used in}} combination with the laxative sorbitol. Additionally, electrolyte disturbances, systemic alkalosis or gastric <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> occur. Furthermore, anorexia, nausea, vomiting or constipation as well as diarrhea have been recorded if high doses were applied.|$|E
50|$|In such cases, their <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> {{cause the}} bird to damage itself by scratching. In extreme cases, the {{infestation}} may even interfere with egg {{production and the}} fattening of poultry. Unlike true lice, bird lice do not carry infectious diseases. Having coevolved with their specific host(s), phylogenetic relationships among bird lice are sometimes of use when trying to determine phylogenetic relationships among birds.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms arise 4-12 {{hours after}} {{exposure}} to an organic dust, and generally last {{from one to}} five days. Common generalised symptoms include fever over 38 °C, chills, myalgia and malaise. The most frequent respiratory symptoms are dyspnea and a dry cough, while a wheeze may be present less commonly. Headache, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and keratitis can also be present, and skin <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> occur in those handling grain.|$|E
5000|$|Laxity is {{also another}} aging-related eyelid {{condition}} {{that can lead}} to dryness and <b>irritation.</b> Surgery <b>may</b> be necessary to repair the eyelid to its natural position. In certain instances, excessive lower lid laxity creates the Fornix of Reiss - a pocket between the lower eyelid and globe - which is the ideal location to administer topical ophthalmic medications.|$|R
50|$|The {{signs of}} acute {{chlorine}} gas poisoning are primarily respiratory, and include difficulty breathing and cough; {{listening to the}} lungs will generally reveal crackles. There will generally be sneezing, nose irritation, and throat <b>irritation.</b> There <b>may</b> also be skin irritation or chemical burns and eye irritation or conjunctivitis. A person with chlorine gas poisoning may also have nausea, vomiting, or a headache.|$|R
50|$|Skin {{irritation}} from allergies {{is fairly}} easy to identify. Some of the symptoms are redness, itching, hair loss and recurring skin infections from the <b>irritation.</b> The dog <b>may</b> begin to scratch himself more thus bringing on the skin problems.|$|R
50|$|Feeding polyps snare {{plankton}} {{from the}} passing current along exposed portions of upper reef slopes up to 15 m depth, growing transverse {{to the prevailing}} current to ensure maximum exposure to passing foodstuff. The stinging nematocysts contain a toxin which causes painful burn-like wounds on contact. At worst, this may cause collapse in those with a severe allergic reaction. Skin <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> continue {{for up to two}} weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Itching and {{localized}} {{swelling and}} inflammation sometimes {{result from a}} bite. Swelling can be quite pronounced depending on the species and the individual's immune response, and <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> persist for weeks. Intense feeding can cause [...] "black fly fever", with headache, nausea, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and aching joints; these symptoms are probably a reaction to a compound from the flies' salivary glands. Less common severe allergic reactions may require hospitalization.|$|E
50|$|However, some ozone escapes the {{filtering}} {{process in}} commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller consumer printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated {{for a long period}} of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> be noticed. A potential for creating a health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases.|$|E
5000|$|Amputation stumps can be {{sensitive}} to cold or heat, particularly as their capacity to regulate tissue congestion is limited. The skin of amputation stumps can be very sensitive to allergic, chemical or mechanical <b>irritation</b> and thus <b>may</b> have to be protected.|$|R

50|$|After using a {{deodorant}} containing zirconium, {{the skin}} may develop an allergic, axillary granuloma response. Antiperspirants with propylene glycol, {{when applied to}} the axillae, can cause <b>irritation</b> and <b>may</b> promote sensitization to other ingredients in the antiperspirant. Deodorant crystals containing synthetically made potassium alum {{were found to be}} a weak irritant to the skin. Alcohol-free deodorant is available for those with sensitive skin. Frequent use of deodorants was associated with blood concentrations of the synthetic musk galaxolide.|$|R
