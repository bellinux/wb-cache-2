[...] Pāṇini's grammar is characterized by its extreme thoroughness and explicitness in accounting for Sanskrit linguistic forms. Bloomfield noted that [...] "Pāṇini gives the formation of every inflected, compounded, or <b>derived</b> <b>word,</b> with an exact statement of the sound-variations (including accent) and of the meaning." [...] In a letter to Algonquianist Truman Michelson, Bloomfield noted [...] "My models are Pāṇini {{and the kind of}} work done in Indo-European by my teacher, Professor Wackernagel of Basle." ...|$|E
2500|$|The word {{swastika}} {{is derived}} from the Sanskrit root swasti which is composed of su, [...] meaning [...] "good, well", and asti meaning [...] "it is, there is". The word swasti occurs frequently in the Vedas, and it means [...] "well, good, auspicious, luck, success, prosperity". Swastika is a <b>derived</b> <b>word</b> and connotes a form of welcome or a sign of something [...] "associated with well-being". According to Monier-Williams, a majority of scholars consider it a solar symbol, and in the ancient Indian texts the base swasti is equivalent to [...] "may it be well with thee! hail! health! adieu! so be it!". The sign implies something fortunate, lucky or auspicious, and when applied to entrances, doors, mandalas or object it denotes or reminds of auspiciousness or well-being.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, only Spanish root {{words are}} listed, derivations (including nouns, verbs or adjectives) not being {{included}}. For example, aceite (from az-zeit, oil) is included but not aceitería, aceitero, aceitón or aceitoso. On the other hand, aceituna (olive) is included since it derives not from az-zeit but from az-zeituna in Arabic, {{even though the}} root of the Arabic word is the same. [...] Aceituno (olive tree), on the other hand, would not be included, since it shares the same root as aceituna. For this reason a significant number of verbs and adjectives are excluded from this list. An exception to this rule may be made when the <b>derived</b> <b>word</b> is much more commonly used than the root word, when the meaning of the derivative has no evident connection with the root word or when {{it is not clear that}} one is derived from the other (e.g. horro and ahorrar).|$|E
