40|$|In {{the context}} of {{automated}} feeding (orienting) of industrial parts, we study the algorithmic design of traps in the bowl <b>feeder</b> <b>track</b> that filter out all but one orientation of a given polyhedral part. We propose {{a new class of}} traps that removes a V-shaped portion of the track. The proposed work advances the state-of-the-art in algorithmic trap design by extending earlier work [1, 6, 17]—which focuses solely on 2 D parts— to 3 D parts, and by incorporating a more realistic part motion model in the design algorithm. We exploit the geometric structure of the design problem and build on concepts and techniques from computational geometry to obtain an efficient algorithm that reports the complete set of valid traps. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibratory}} bowl feeder {{remains the most}} common approach to the automated feeding (orienting) of industrial parts. We study the algorithmic design of a trap in the bowl <b>feeder</b> <b>track</b> that filters out all but one orientation of a given polygonal part. We propose {{a new class of}} traps that we call guillotine traps, which remove a portion of the track between two parallel lines. A major advantage of guillotine traps over previously studied traps [1] is that they permit feeding the part in a user-specified stable orientation, whereas these other traps offered no control over the orientation to be fed. The capability of feeding a part in any priorly specified orientation for example offers the user a means of control over the feed rate. We present a complete algorithm that takes as input any polygonal part consisting of n vertices, along with its center of mass, and a desired output orientation of the part. Our algorithm computes a guillotine trap for a {{vibratory bowl}} feeder that outputs parts in the desired orientation, or reports that no such trap exists. The algorithm runs in O(nα(n) log n + nk), where α(n) is the extremely slowly growing inverse of the Ackermann function, and k is the number of candidate solutions. Although the value of k is trivially bounded by O(n), we conjecture that k is a small constant except for highly symmetric and regular parts. Surprisingly, our algorithm is considerably more efficient than the algorithm for the more restricted and hence less powerful gap trap, which was shown to run in O(n 2 log n) time [1]. We have implemented our complete algorithm in Mathematica and C++...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013 - 14, Lincoln University, in {{conjunction}} with the Rod Donald Banks Peninsula Trust, undertook an investigation into the recreational use of Banks Peninsula Summit Walkway and associated <b>feeder</b> <b>tracks.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the current and potential use of the track network, as well as to document perceptions of current track users about existing and future provisions to inform the “Spine of the Lizard” project, a joint partnership between the Trust and the Department of Conservation...|$|R
5000|$|... "Down to the River / This Town" [...] are {{two songs}} on a double A-sided single by Feeder, {{released}} as the group's {{third and final}} single from their seventh album Renegades in 2010, while being their 31st single overall and their third double A-sided single after the 2008 release of [...] "Tracing Lines / Silent Cry". Both tracks like {{the majority of the}} Renegades album, started off life as tracks first performed live under their Renegades side-project name, but were both only released commercially as <b>Feeder</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Feeder's</b> <b>track</b> Shatter {{originally}} {{appeared on}} Tumble And Fall, a primer to their latest album Pushing The Senses and has sparked a fan based petition {{for the song}} to be released. Fans may be in luck too, Just A Day was featured in Gran Turismo 3 and as a single with Seven Days In The Sun, until it was re-released as a standalone single in 2001 where it became an instant favourite, and has been since voted the number one Feeder song of all time. A sample of the song, Shatter is available to download, via PlayStation Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside {{his work}} with Feeder, Taka also works as an {{electronic}} music solo musician, often playing all the instruments alongside bass {{on a series of}} recordings under the alias name of [...] "Funkybottom". He also has remixed <b>Feeder</b> <b>tracks</b> such as [...] "Tracing Lines", as well as [...] "Free Your Mind", a short 28 second interlude intended for Silent Cry which did not make the final cut. On the Funkybottom version, the remix extends the track with extra effects added in. He played on Inoran's 2011 single [...] "Hide and Seek". In June 2012, he once again teamed up with Inoran, and Feeder's support guitarist Dean Tidey, to form the band Muddy Apes.|$|R

50|$|Canadian National Railways (CN) serves Hamilton for {{lifting and}} setting off traffic for the Rail America (Southern Ontario Railway Shortline), but as heavy {{industry}} declined and the preferred {{mode of transportation}} changed to road, the number of branch lines and <b>feeder</b> <b>tracks</b> has declined dramatically. Until the early 1970s, the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway offered passenger service. Since the late 1980s, GO Transit has offered sporadic passenger train service from its James Street North station. In the late 1990s, GO Transit operations were consolidated at the refurbished Art Deco building on Hunter Street which formerly served the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo service. GO trains and buses serve a population of six million in an 8,000 km2 area (3,000 sq.mi.) radiating from Downtown Toronto to Hamilton and Guelph in the west; Orangeville, Barrie, and Beaverton to the north; and Port Perry, Oshawa, and Newcastle in the east. The buses extend GO's service as far as over 100 km (about 60 miles) from Downtown Toronto. GO connects with every municipal transit system in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton areas, including the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TH&B station retains its name today, at the GO Transit network located {{in the heart of}} Hamilton's downtown core. The nearest Via Rail Canada station is at Aldershot GO Station in west Burlington.|$|R
50|$|Overhead {{lines or}} {{overhead}} wires {{are used to}} transmit electrical energy to trams, trolleybuses or trains. Overhead line is designed {{on the principle of}} one or more overhead wires situated over rail <b>tracks.</b> <b>Feeder</b> stations at regular intervals along the overhead line supply power from the high-voltage grid. For some cases low-frequency AC is used, and distributed by a special traction current network.|$|R
5000|$|Bowl feeders: {{consists}} of a bowl top with a spiral track inside the bowl. The component parts are delivered {{from the bottom of}} the bowl <b>feeder</b> up the <b>track</b> into the top of the feeder as the bowl vibrates. The parts are then positioned in the proper position. These parts are usually then fed on to a vibratory or air track ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{contains}} several {{songs from}} rock bands, e.g. [...] "Jack" [...] by the Belarusian group TT-34 and [...] "Spanish" [...] by Drum Ecstasy.The song {{played in the}} credits of the international version of the movie is called [...] "Shatter" [...] and performed by the Welsh rock band <b>Feeder.</b> The <b>track</b> was a top 20 hit single in the United Kingdom charting at #11 in 2005, {{to coincide with the}} international release of the film. The song playing during the end credits of the American release of Night Watch is [...] "Fearless" [...] by The Bravery. In the original Russian version it is a rap song Nochnoy dozor (Finalnyy rep) performed by Uma2rman.|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics {{refer to}} an {{employee}} {{doing the same}} menial daily tasks, and wanting {{to get away from}} it all. Grant once said that the distorted vocal emulates that of a tannoy in a supermarket. The Dandy Warhols 2003 hit [...] "We Used to Be Friends" [...] duplicates the bassline from the <b>track.</b> <b>Feeder's</b> Grant Nicholas was given a co-writer credit on the single and the corresponding album.|$|R
50|$|The song {{features}} backing vocals from Fran Healy and Dougie Payne from Travis, {{who both}} sing the backing vocals {{in the final}} chorus. It was revealed by Healy that the band were recording what would be their fifth studio album The Boy With No Name in a nearby studio room. At the same time Feeder were recording what would be Pushing the Senses and ended up working with <b>Feeder</b> for this <b>track.</b>|$|R

Up there in the hills, where they are going, they'll balance their grass with grain. This makes them assemble every night at the feeding places and enables the <b>feeders</b> to keep <b>track</b> of them with a minimum of effort. I've shipped fifty stallions, two-year- olds, every year for the past five years, to Oregon alone. They're sort of standardized, you know. The people up there know what they're getting. They know my standard so well that they'll buy unsight and unseen." ...|$|R
