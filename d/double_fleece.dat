Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called Capra hircus laniger, {{as if they were}} a subspecies of the domestic goat Capra hircus. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies Capra aegagrus hircus. Cashmere goats produce a <b>double</b> <b>fleece</b> that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called guard hair. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting [...] "cashmere" [...] is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} described in which a study was made on the fleece characteristics of Angora Goats kept in Canterbury. Animals that bore twin kids were heavier at tupping than animals that had single kids. The latter were heavier than animals that remained dry. The trial animals showed highly variable fleece characteristics between body positions on an animal and between animals. Responses to environmental and seasonal influences were highly variable. The trial goats had an S/P ratio of around 7, varying between 5 and 10. During spring the mohair fleece showed rudiments of a primitive type <b>double</b> coated <b>fleece</b> by growing kemps, fibres associated with the outer coat of primitive fleeces. The trial goats showed a shedding of the entire fleece by late spring. The trial goats had high fleece yields of around 90 %. The trial animals showed a marked seasonal rhythm of mohair production, with minimum production occurring in winter and maximum production occurring in late spring to early summer. Reproductive activities reduced annual mohair production by about 10 - 14 %. This reduction was brought about by a decrease in fibre diameter, a decrease in fibre length growth rate {{and an increase in}} the number of inactive follicles during winter and early spring. Fleece characteristics changed throughout the year. Average fibre diameter was lowest in winter and highest in spring. Average fibre length growth rate was lowest in winter and highest in summer. The number of growing fibres/unit area was highest in summer and lowest in winter. The degree of medullation (including kemps) was highest in spring and lowest in winter. Relationships between fleece characteristics varied considerably, however: -: average fibre diameter changes occurred prior to average length growth rate changes. -: average fibre diameter and average fibre length correlated positively. -: average fibre diameter and degree of medullation correlated positively. -: average fibre length growth rate and fibre length variation showed an inverse relationship. -: the number of growing fibres/unit area and the degree of medullation showed an inverse relationship. Kemp fibres grew predominantly along the backline and downward over the rump. Kemps grew excessively in spring and to a lesser degree in autumn. Kemps, though relatively few, had a marked influence on average fibre diameter. Angora Goats in Canterbury should be shorn early in spring and early in autumn in order to obtain mohair of high standard. Assessment of the degree of kemp and hairiness of animals should be carried out around late spring to early summer (December). Assessing the average fibre diameter of mohair is best done with a projection microscope on a midside sample, which should be collected in late summer. The C. S. I. R. O Fibre Fineness Distribution Analyser, in its present form of development, cannot be recommended for measuring mohair...|$|R

Characterization of thermal environment on the trailer {{is crucial to}} identify stress-prone regions during transportation. At the same time, Broilers experience high physiological stress during pre-slaughter transport, especially under extremes of thermal environment. Characterization of thermal environment on the trailer is crucial to identify stress-prone regions during transportation. At the same time, quantification of heat loss of the broilers loaded on trailers is important in understanding {{the well-being of the}} broilers. We have developed four electronic chickens (E-chickens) to simulate the sensible heat loss of live broiler during transit and holding period in commercial live-haul trips. It is an average broiler-sized enclosure with a thermostatically controlled circuit to keep the internal temperature at 41 °C. Power consumption as a result of four different combinations of covering the enclosure as well as their sensitivity with exposed wind were compared. <b>Double</b> layer of <b>fleece</b> fabric was selected as the insulation cover for the E-chickens to match the sensible heat production reported in literature. Heat loss exhibited a positive correlation with the wind and a negative correlation with the temperature gradient between internal and external environment. However, the wet cover of E-chickens did not increase heat loss compared to dry cover, indicating its inability to release moisture unlike evaporation from natural feathers and respiratory water loss. Thirty-two commercial live-haul trips were monitored to determine humidity ratio increase-above-ambient air humidity, E-chickens were installed in eight of the trips. Moderate levels of measured power consumption of the E-chickens suggested that ambient temperatures in the range of 11 °C- 25. 1 °C (during transit) and 5. 3 °C- 21. 7 °C (during holding) were in the zone of thermal comfort (allowing the live chickens to regulate heat by their metabolism to stay comfortable). For the holding period, the winter trips were mostly in the zone of thermal comfort, but during summers, hyperthermic conditions were widespread during transit. Fan-assisted evaporative cooling during on-farm loading may have introduced additional cooling due to wetting of live chicken surface, not quantified by the limitation of E-chickens. The mild weather observed during spring and fall season was the most comfortable for broilers...|$|R
