25|$|However, not {{all members}} of the royal family were {{dissatisfied}} with Peter's mesalliance and subsequent loss of dynastic rights. His aunt, Princess Andrew, was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> excluded from the line of succession because it brought her own son, Prince Philip (later Duke of Edinburgh), closer to the throne.|$|E
500|$|The Ice King {{decides that}} he wants to enlist Marceline's help in writing a song to woo princesses, taking pages {{randomly}} torn from an old scrapbook with him for later inspiration. He flies to her cave, and after a minor scuffle that involves Finn and Jake, Marceline finally relents and helps him write a song. At first, the Ice King simply sings a song he wrote about Princess Bubblegum, before breaking down, crying about his loneliness and damaging Marceline's living room with his ice magic. Marceline tells him to stop acting crazy, and he pushes her, before timidly retreating to the top of her refrigerator. Marceline begins to lament, via the song [...] "Nuts," [...] and notes that, despite his instability, she is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> The Ice King is surprised to find out that she [...] "likes" [...] him and asks for a hug. However, when he misinterprets her feelings and tries to kiss her, Marceline angrily confronts him and asks if he remembers his past by calling him by his actual name: Simon.|$|E
500|$|While Rochussen {{had been}} <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> go, {{back in the}} Netherlands van Hoëvell fared better politically. He was vindicated when the {{government}} canceled the acceptance of his forced resignation, and he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the events of May 1848. The publication of the Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië, which had stopped at his expulsion from Batavia, was resumed in 1849, now in a less repressive environment. For some pamphlets, he used the pseudonym Jeronymus. In September 1849, {{he was elected to}} the House of Representatives of the Netherlands for the Liberal party and he remained a member of parliament until 1862. He was one of only a handful of Dutch parliamentarians who had actually been to the East Indies, and often spoke eloquently on colonial matters in parliament. He became [...] "one of the most ferocious critics" [...] of the Cultivation System, the government-run system (already criticized by W.Bosch and others) that demanded that the local peasantry set aside a significant portion of their land to grow crops for the Dutch to export. Van Hoëvell was a proponent of private ownership, and argued that the system, besides being immoral, was also economically ineffective. His criticism of Dutch colonial practices extended to the Dutch West India Company; he was a supporter of abolitionism at a time when Dutch colonists owned tens of thousands of slaves, mainly on plantations in Surinam.|$|E

500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning, wrote, [...] "Even in {{an episode}} like 'The 'C' Word,' {{where some of}} the ideas fall a bit short, there were still plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to talk about. [...] In the end, the great writing outweighed the slightly bothersome contrivances to make this yet another laugh-filled episode of 30 Rock." [...] He said that the pairing of Jack and Tracy [...] "gave us another opportunity to enjoy the pairing of the polar opposite personalities". Canning reported that the Liz plot had [...] "its funny moments", but opined that it was hard to [...] "get past the fact this wasn't exactly the Liz we knew", in regards to her being a [...] "domineering boss that cares little about her employees." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that putting Alec Baldwin and Rip Torn together [...] "was a genius move." [...] She was complimentary towards Tina Fey, citing that it was [...] "another great week" [...] in her [...] "continuing portrayal of what being a hard-working gal is actually like." [...] Ward enjoyed Tracy's speech, noting that it was [...] "priceless", and was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> having [...] "ample screen time... which was a nice change of pace." [...] TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote he enjoyed all of the episode's storyline pairings, but much enjoyed Jack and Tracy. Further in his recap, Mitovich reported that Liz's plot could have been better had the comedy show How I Met Your Mother [...] "not gone there with the C-word" [...] in an episode. Though, he said that Liz's story [...] "had a fitting message – that she is held to a different standard, yet shouldn't be, as a female head writer. Plus, her story gave us that winning flurry of flashbacks to times when she was a... not very nice lady." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brooke {{wrote to}} Alfred Russel Wallace on leaving England in April 1853, [...] "to assure Wallace {{that he would}} be very <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> at Sarawak." [...] This was an {{invitation}} that helped Wallace decide on the Malay Archipelago for his next expedition, an expedition that lasted for eight years and established him as one of the foremost Victorian intellectuals and naturalists of the time. When Wallace arrived in Singapore in September 1854, he found Rajah Brooke [...] "reluctantly preparing to give evidence to the special commission set up to investigate his controversial anti-piracy activities." ...|$|E

In his announcement, Sanders said, [...] "I don't believe that {{the men and women}} who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process," [...] and made this a central idea throughout his campaign. Senator Elizabeth Warren welcomed Sanders's entry into the race, saying, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be," [...] but never endorsed him.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, the Santorums' son Gabriel {{was born}} prematurely after 20 weeks of {{pregnancy}} {{and died in}} the hospital two hours later. Karen wrote that she and Rick slept with the dead infant between them in the hospital that night, then brought him home the following day and introduced him to their other children as [...] "your brother Gabriel". Fifteen years later, their handling of their infant son's death attracted scrutiny in January 2012 following Santorum's success in the Iowa caucuses. One psychologist interviewed by ABC News said what the Santorums did was encouraged at the time, although no longer recommended; another told the media outlet: [...] "It's not far out of the norm at all... There is nothing pathological about it or particularly alarming." [...] Writers who had experienced a stillbirth defended the Santorums' actions, with columnist Charles Lane writing that he personally regretted not showing the body of his stillborn baby to his then six-year-old son, and Jessica Heslam, writing that holding her own stillborn baby brought her [...] "much peace". The four eldest children appeared with their parents on Piers Morgan Tonight in January 2012. Elizabeth, who was five {{at the time of}} Gabriel's death, said she was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> and that he holds a place in her heart.|$|R
