5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became {{a substitute for the}} Black Codes.

5|$|On July 14, 2016, Gingrich {{stated that}} he {{believes}} that Americans of Muslim backgrounds who believe in Sharia law should be deported, and that visiting websites that promote the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or Al-Qaeda should be a felony.

5|$|The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution {{prevents}} Congress {{from making}} any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of religion, or abridging {{the freedom of}} speech, {{the freedom of the}} press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.|$|E
50|$|Together with {{physiotherapists}} Kobi Schwartz and Danny Kelman, Dr. Mendes {{developed a}} system of painless 'reverse action' and 'gravity dependent' exercises to preserve Hip joint mobility. The system has been tested with rewarding results {{for more than twenty}} years. The term 'praying exercises' was chosen due to the similarity to movements during rituals in a variety of religions. Later was modified to 'Pain <b>Free</b> <b>Exercises.</b> The exercises move the joint in maximal range with painless motions, keeping low joint pressure, and lubricate the articular cartilage to maintain its viability by alternating light pressure.|$|R

5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on {{the freedom of the}} press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E
5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of private judgement.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The {{product of a}} compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> of religion. The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E
