25|$|The results {{reported}} in The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys (2007) {{indicated that there}} might be <b>evolutionary</b> <b>force</b> behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and Capuchin monkeys when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object in stead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Wallace, {{a number}} of {{scholars}} considered the role of sexual selection in human evolution controversial. Darwin was accused {{of looking at the}} evolution of early human ancestors through the moral lens of the 19th century Victorian society. Joan Roughgarden, citing many elements of sexual behaviour in animals and humans that cannot be explained by the sexual-selection model, suggested that the function of sex in human evolution was primarily social. Joseph Jordania suggested that in explaining such human morphological and behavioural characteristics as singing, dancing, body painting, wearing of clothes, Darwin (and proponents of sexual selection) neglected another important <b>evolutionary</b> <b>force,</b> intimidation of predators and competitors with the ritualised forms of warning display. Warning display uses virtually the same arsenal of visual, audio, olfactory and behavioural features as sexual selection. According to the principle of aposematism (warning display), to avoid costly physical violence and to replace violence with the ritualised forms of display, many animal species (including humans) use different forms of warning display: visual signals (contrastive body colours, eyespots, body ornaments, threat display and various postures to look bigger), audio signals (ing, growling, group vocalisations, drumming on external objects), olfactory signals (producing strong body odors, particularly when excited or scared), behavioural signals (demonstratively slow walking, aggregation in large groups, aggressive display behaviour against predators and conspecific competitors). According to Jordania, most of these warning displays were incorrectly attributed to the forces of sexual selection.|$|E

500|$|Morchella sextelata was {{originally}} identified as phylogenetic species [...] "Mel-6" [...] in the species-rich Elata clade (brown morels) elucidated by microbiologist Kerry O'Donnell and colleagues in a 2011 publication. The specific epithet sextelata alludes to this preliminary name.

The original specimens collected were obtained as part of the Morel Data Collection Project, a research effort designed to improve the understanding of North American morels.|$|E
2500|$|Practitioners do {{not believe}} that Satan {{literally}} exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype embracing the Hebrew root of the word [...] "Satan" [...] as [...] "adversary", who represents pride, , and enlightenment, and of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be motivated by a [...] "dark <b>evolutionary</b> <b>force</b> of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things". The Devil is embraced as a symbol of defiance against the Abrahamic faiths which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. Moreover, Satan also serves as a metaphorical external projection of the individual's godhood. LaVey espoused the view that [...] "god" [...] is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of [...] "god". In his book, The Satanic Bible, the Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true [...] "self"—a projection {{of his or her own}} personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. LaVey explained that the gods worshiped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship. The current High Priest of the Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, further expounds that [...] "...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates [...] Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will. The Church of Satan has chosen Satan as its primary symbol because in Hebrew it means adversary, opposer, one to accuse or question. We see ourselves as being these Satans; the adversaries, opposers and accusers of all spiritual belief systems that would try to hamper enjoyment of our life as a human being" [...] The term [...] "Theistic Satanism" [...] has been described as [...] "oxymoronic" [...] by the church and its High Priest. The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers, atheistic or otherwise, and maintains a purist approach to Satanism as expounded by LaVey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Reproductive gene {{evolution}} is commonly in-voked {{as a source}} of reproductive isolation during specia-tion. This possibility has not been adequately explored in the Ascomycota, the most species-rich fungal phylum. The mechanisms of mate-recognition in this group are relatively simple: a “mating type ” locus determines reproductive mode and sexual compatibility, and two pheromone/receptor pairs control sexual attraction. However, ascomycete reproductive genes can experience unique and interesting <b>evolutionary</b> <b>forces,</b> which could lead to rapid divergence. In this review, we examine the mechanisms of sexual interaction in ascomy-cetes and explore current evidence as to whether these mech-anisms allow for species-specificity in mate-recognition. We discuss the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>forces</b> that can drive reproductive gene divergence, how these may apply in the world of asco-mycetes, and their possible consequences for speciation...|$|R
40|$|Intra-genomic {{variation}} between housekeeping and tissue-specific genes {{has always}} been a study of interest in higher eukaryotes. To-date, however, no such investigation has been done in plants. Availability of whole genome expression data for both rice and Arabidopsis has made it possible to examine the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>forces</b> in shaping codon usage pattern in both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in plants. In the present work, we have taken 4065 rice–Arabidopsis homologous gene pairs to study <b>evolutionary</b> <b>forces</b> responsible for codon usage divergence between housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. In both rice and Arabidopsis, it is mutational bias that regulates error minimization in highly expressed genes of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. Our results show that, in compari-son to tissue-specific genes, housekeeping genes are under strong selective constraint in plants. However, in tissue-specific genes, lowly expressed genes are under stronger selective constraint compared with highly expressed genes. We demonstrated that constraint acting on mRNA secondary structure is respon-sible for modulating codon usage variations in rice tissue-specific genes. Thus, different <b>evolutionary</b> <b>forces</b> must underline the evolution of synonymous codon usage of highly expressed genes of housekeep-ing and tissue-specific genes in rice and Arabidopsis.
