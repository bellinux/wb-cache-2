5|$|If f {{is allowed}} to be any Euclidean function, then the list of {{possible}} D values for which the domain is Euclidean is not yet known. The first example of a Euclidean domain that was not norm-Euclidean (with D=69) was published in 1994. In 1973, Weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with D>0 is Euclidean if, and only if, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> ideal domain, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the set of}} all numbers ua + vb is {{equivalent}} to the set of multiples m of g. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (a and b) {{is equivalent}} to the set of multiples of gcd(a, b). The GCD {{is said to be the}} generator of the ideal of a and b. This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a single element) and a principal ideal domain (a domain in which every ideal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> ideal).|$|E
5|$|MD 97 has two {{stretches}} {{along which}} {{it is a part}} of the National Highway System. The highway <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> arterial from its southern terminus in Silver Spring north to Brookeville Road in Brookeville. Within that section, MD 97 is an intermodal connector from I-495 north to MD 192 in Forest Glen. The highway is also a principal arterial from MD 32 at Fenby north to MD 140 in Westminster and from MD 140 in Westminster to a point south of MD 496 north of Westminster. MD 97 {{is a part of the}} main National Highway System along its concurrency with MD 140 in Westminster.|$|E

5|$|The areas NY3 {{passes through}} {{alternate}} between {{long stretches of}} rural area, consisting of a mix of open terrain and dispersed residences, and compact settlements containing concentrations of houses and businesses. NY3 is classified mainly as a minor arterial road, the major exception being the section that is concurrent with NY812, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> arterial road. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. Exceptions are in the cities of Watertown and Plattsburgh, where {{at least part of}} the road is city-maintained. In Watertown, NY3 is locally maintained from Massey Street (southbound US11 junction) to the end of the NY3/NY12 overlap. The route is entirely city-maintained in Plattsburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although {{it may not be}} possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> ideal. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E
5|$|York {{has been}} a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839 at the {{beginning}} of the railway age. For many years the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway. York railway station <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> stop on the East Coast Main Line from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh. It takes less than two hours to get to York from London by rail, with at least 25 direct trains each weekday. The station is also served by long distance trains on CrossCountry services linking Edinburgh and Newcastle with destinations in south and west England via Birmingham. TransPennine Express provide a frequent service of semi-fast trains linking York to Newcastle, Scarborough, Leeds, Manchester, Manchester Airport, and Liverpool. Local stopping services by Northern connect York to Selby, Harrogate, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and many intermediate points, as well as many other stations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire.|$|E
