25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the <b>fluted</b> <b>feed</b> rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E
50|$|In agriculture, most seed is now sown using a seed drill, {{which offers}} greater precision; seed is sown evenly {{and at the}} desired rate. The drill also places the seed at a {{measured}} distance below the soil, so that less seed is required. The standard design uses a <b>fluted</b> <b>feed</b> metering system, which is volumetric in nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10-30 cm apart, depending on the crop species and growing conditions. Several row opener types are used depending on soil type and local tradition. Grain drills are most often drawn by tractors, but can also be pulled by horses. Pickup trucks are sometimes used, since little draft is required.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{flow rate}} and flow {{evenness}} of sesame seeds from <b>fluted</b> <b>feed</b> rolls in seed drills were investigated using Minitab. The variables are the flute diameter, the active roll length {{and the rate}} of revolution. The data obtained from the experiments were analyzed statistically and the graphics of flow rate and flow evenness were presented. In conclusion, in order to get an even flow of sesame seeds from <b>fluted</b> <b>feed</b> rolls, the flute diameter should be 6 - 8 mm and the rolls should also be run in the active roll lengths of 15 - 25 mm at the rate of revolution 20 - 40 min - 1...|$|E
