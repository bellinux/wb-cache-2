40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} set of LAS enhancements to enable support for topographicbathymetric (topo-bathy) lidar. The importance of these enhancements stems, in part, from {{the emergence of a}} new class of topo-bathy lidar systems that occupies the middle ground between conventional bathymetric and commercial topographic systems and provides seamless, highresolution coverage across the backshore, intertidal, and shallow nearshore zones. Many users of these systems and the data they provide are interested in integrating the data into existing topographic lidar processing streams. However, the stock LAS specification does not currently support these data. The Topo-Bathy Lidar Domain Profile adds point classification values for bathymetric point, water surface, derived water surface, submerged object, IHO S- 57 object, and bottom not found depth.

Our three revised objectives to this study became: (1) to describe bacterioplankton population dynamics in the Mid Atlantic Bight using TRFLP analysis of 16 S rRNA genes. (2) to determine whether spatial and temporal factors are driving bacterioplankton community dynamics in the MAB using monthly samping along our transect line over a 2 -year period. (3) to identify dominant members of a coastal bacterioplankton population by clonal library analysis of 16 S rDNA genes and sequencing of PCR product corresponding to specific TRFLP peaks in the data set. Although open ocean time-series sites have been areas of microbial research for years, relatively little was known about the population dynamics of bacterioplankton communities in the coastal ocean on kilometer spatial and seasonal temporal scales. To {{gain a better understanding of}} microbial community variability, monthly samples of bacterial biomass were collected in 1995 - 1996 along a 34 -km transect near the Long-Term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO- 15) off the New Jersey coast.

Principal components analysis models supported the temporal patterns.

To examine a continuous and unbroken stratigraphic interval of the Corwin formation in the northeastern part of the Deadfall Syncline as an initial step toward evaluation of the whole basin. This was accomplished by drilling overlapping [...] holes aligned generally parallel to the dip direction, and spaced in accordance with [...] the magnitude of dip and depth capacity of the drill.

40|$|Detailed {{information}} concerning {{the composition of the}} raw materials employed in the production of biologics is important for the efficient control and optimization of bioprocesses. The analytical methods used in these applications must be simple and fast as well as be easily transferable from one site to another. In that context, microchip‐based electrophoresis represents a promising tool for application in the analysis of raw materials in biologics. Using electrophoresis micro‐chips, analysis times can be reduced to seconds and high separation efficiencies can be achieved using extremely low volume samples, minimal reagent consumption and waste generation, low cost/disposability, portability and ease of mass‐production [1]. Additionally the use of Capacitively Coupled Contactless Conductivity Detection (C 4 D) offers a rather simple and yet sensitive method for detection of ionic species. Recently, C 4 D has gained much popularity as on‐chip detection in electrophoresis micro‐chips [2]. The main {{reason for this is that}} there is no physical contact of the detection electrodes with the electrolyte solution. Therefore, the integration of this detection mode within the analytical system is rather simple. Furthermore, the background noise is significantly reduced leading to lower detection limits than the conventional contact conductivity detection. Vitamins are present at very low concentrations in biopharma raw materials and are usually determined using HPLC and CE methods [3]. Electrophoresis micro‐chips are a very good alternative to these techniques due to the shorter analysis time and yet very good resolution, among others. In this paper, we present the application of electrophoresis micro‐chips with C 4 D detection to the analysis of water‐soluble vitamins in raw materials used for the production of biologics in bioreactors. For that purpose, hybrid PDMS/glass chips were fabricated by using standard photolithographic techniques (Figure 1).

40|$|Abstract The human {{visual system}} {{utilizes}} depth information {{as a major}} cue to group together visual items constituting an object and to segregate them from items belonging to other objects in the visual scene. Depth information can be inferred {{from a variety of}} different visual cues, such as disparity, occlusions and perspective. Many of these cues provide only local and relative information about the depth of objects. For example, at occlusions, T-junctions indicate the local relative depth precedence of surface patches. However, in order to obtain a globally consistent interpretation of the depth relations between the surfaces and objects in a visual scene, a mechanism is necessary that globally propagates such local and relative information. We present a computational framework in which depth information derived from T-junctions is propagated along surface contours using local recurrent interactions between neighboring neurons. We demonstrate that within this framework a globally consistent depth sorting of overlapping surfaces can be obtained on the basis of local interactions. Unlike previous approaches in which locally restricted cell interactions could merely distinguish between two <b>depths</b> (<b>figure</b> and ground), our model can also represent several intermediate depth positions. Our approach is an extension of a previous model of recurrent V 1 –V 2 interaction for contour processing and illusory contour formation.

40|$|The {{use of a}} blue {{diode laser}} (405 nm wavelength) {{provides}} an increase in storage density {{by a factor of}} about 2. 5 with respect to DVD which uses a red laser. Another factor of two is made possible by increasing the numerical aperture of the objective to 0. 85 (DVD has 0. 60). We have developed all basic technologies for such a system, that is able to record 22. 5 GB on a single sided 12 cm diameter disc, at a user data rate of up to 50 Mb/s. Physical Concept A diffraction limited focused laser beam has a focal spot diameter scaling as λ / NA, where NA is the objective lens numerical aperture given by NA = n sin θ with n the refractive index (1 in air) and θ the opening angle of the lens. In going from CD to DVD, the seven-fold increase in capacity was mainly enabled by reducing the spot size by using shorter wavelength light (650 nm instead of 780 nm), and by increasing the numerical aperture of the objective (NA= 0. 6 instead of 0. 45). In addition, manufacturing tolerances of the discs and the drives had to be tightened, changes were made to the data format and the channel modulation code, and a more powerful error correction scheme was introduced. Finally, to keep operating margins for parameters such as disc tilt and focus error within acceptable levels, the substrate thickness had to be halved to 0. 6 mm. But to maintain mechanical stability and the same physical appearance as a compact disc, a DVD consists of two 0. 6 mm substrates bonded back-to-back. To realize a capacity of up to 22. 5 GB (5 times that of DVD), the DVR system is based on a a blue diode laser [1], and an NA= 0. 85 objective lens [2]. The high numerical aperture places stringent constraints on disc tilt (due to comatic aberration) and on variations in disc thickness (due to spherical aberration), and it results in a shorter <b>depth</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 : Physical concept of the DVR system. 0. 1 mm cover layer dielectric phase-change layer dielectric mirror 1. 1 mm substrat...|$|E
30|$|Another {{estimation}} {{can be made}} on {{the basis}} of the local sedimentation rate. The seismic reflection profile across the offset region shows that a deep piggy-back basin has developed beneath the offset channel on the downthrown side of the mega-splay fault (Figure 6 e,f). The thickness of the basin fill derived from the upper slope is approximately 1, 000 m. The lower part of the basin fill becomes progressively tilted landward with <b>depth</b> (<b>Figure</b> 6 f), while the upper basin fill (lying unconformably on the lower basin fill) does not. This indicates that the lower basin fill is coeval with, and the upper basin fill post-dates, activity of the trenchward imbricate thrust fault. On the other hand, the mega-splay fault system has likely been active throughout the deposition of the basin fill because the basin-fill strata thicken toward and terminate against the mega-splay fault system. The deposition rate of the slope sediment in this piggy-back basin has not been estimated, but it could be high because of the considerable amount of sediment that can be supplied from Shionomisaki Canyon, which is one of the major supply routes of terrestrial sediment. Using the depth of the slope sediment beneath the offset deposits (1, 000 m) at the landward side of the trough axis, the average deposition rate of the slope sediment can be estimated to be greater than 0.5 mm/year by dividing the sediment thickness (approximately 1, 000 m) by the age of the accretionary prism (approximately 2 Ma). Because the height of the channel wall (scarp) of the canyon at the offset point is approximately 150 m and because the present canyon center is almost the same depth (approximately 200 m deeper than the surrounding seafloor; Figure 3), the offset floor did not receive significant sediment during the 6 -km strike-slip movement. To preserve the 150 -m scarp of the previous canyon wall at 6 km from the canyon center with the high sedimentation environment (> 0.5 mm/year), the WBSF would have had to slip 6 km in less than approximately 0.3 Ma (= 150 m/ 0.5 mm/year). Therefore, we can approximately estimate the slip rate as 20 mm/year (= 6 km/ 0.3 Ma). Although our estimation of the slip rate based on several assumptions (e.g., local sedimentation rate) contains large error, the slip rate of the WBSF is of similar order with the plate convergence rate. The slip rate would be faster than that of the landward MTL (approximately 5 mm/year), which is a large strike-slip fault that partitions oblique Philippine Sea Plate motion west of the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku Island (Ikeda et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Most macaque {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) studies are based on monitoring the intrinsic blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD) or, alternatively, on measuring changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) after injection of a contrast agent. The intravascular contrast agent MION (monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles) has been recently applied in a number of studies (Dubowitz et al., 2001; Leite et al., 2002; Mandeville et al., 1997; Mandeville et al., 1998; Mandeville and Marota, 1999; Tsao et al., 2003 a; Tsao et al., 2003 b; Vanduffel et al., 2001). In comparison to BOLD, imaging with MION results in higher contrast to noise ratios (CNR) (Leite et al., 2002;Vanduffel et al., 2001) which may provide improved fMRI sensitivity, making MION especially appealing at low to moderate magnetic field strengths. Moreover, {{it has been suggested that}} MION may result in improved spatial specificity, since it appears to arise primarily from small parenchymal vessels (Mandeville et al., 1998; Mandeville and Marota, 1999) as opposed to BOLD which, at low magnetic fields, is known to be influenced by larger vessels that run along the cortical surface (Gati, Menon, et al., 1997). In order to directly compare the spatial resolution of BOLD versus MION, we conducted a series of experiments in the anaesthetized macaque monkey preparation (macaca mulatta) at a magnetic field strength of 4. 7 T. We acquired data using 8 -segment multishot EPI with flip angle = 40 deg, TE = 20 ms, TR = 805 ms, for both BOLD and MION experiments. We typically injected 8 mg/kg MION which is known to give near optimal CNR (Mandeville, Marota, et al., 1998; Vanduffel, Fize, et al., 2001). In a first set of experiments we measured the distribution of BOLD/MION as a function of gray matter depth in macaque primary visual cortex (V 1). Stimulation was done by alternating a rotating polar checkerboard with a field of uniform light intensity. Voxel size was 0. 2 x 0. 2 x 1 mm 3. Correlation coefficients were computed voxel by voxel and then averaged for voxels lying at the same cortical <b>depth.</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 plots the average correlation coefficients for BOLD (blue) versus MION (red) as a function of depth in the primary visual cortex (V 1) of one macaque. Note that the correlation coefficients for MION appear to peak deeper in gray matter as compared to BOLD. To compare the spatial extent of functional activation seen with BOLD versus MION along the cortical surface, we used a similar stimulation paradigm as before, except that now the rotating polar checkerboard pattern contained a 6 deg diameter occluder (artificial scotoma) centered at 6 deg from the fovea. This assured that the corresponding cortical area in V 1 received no direct visual stimulation. Figure 2 shows the correlation maps obtained with BOLD and MION under these stimulation conditions in a slice through the left V 1 of one macaque (voxel resolution: 1 x 1 x 2 mm 3). Note that the spread of functional activity into the cortical area corresponding to the artificial scotoma (i. e. where there is no visual stimulation) appears to be markedly greater for MION than for BOLD...|$|E

40|$|Dans la retenue hypereutrophe de Grangent, le {{phytoplancton}} estival est dominé par la cyanobactérie Microcystis aeruginosa. Dans le but de lutter contre {{la formation}} de ces blooms cyanobactériens, une expérimentation de brassage artificiel épilimnique par aération a été réalisée en 1997 - 1998. Ce dispositif avait pour but de créer des turbulences supprimant l'avantage adaptatif que constitue, chez M. aeruginosa, la faculté de réguler sa flottabilité. Il devait également permettre l'homogénéisation des teneurs en oxygène dissous, la réduction des pics de pH, de la turbidité des eaux superficielles et des teneurs en ammonium. Les résultats escomptés ont été vérifiés pour les paramètres physicochimiques. Les valeurs se sont révélées plus homogènes, mais seulement à proximité des lignes de brassage et uniquement jusqu'à 10 m de profondeur. En revanche, les blooms cyanobactériens n'ont pas été réduits. Il apparaît même au contraire que, sous l'influence du mélange, les cyanobactéries ont eu à leur disposition une plus grande quantité de nutriments qu'elles ont utilisés pour constituer des réserves glucidiques. Ainsi, en aval de la zone brassée, ces réserves ont permis une synthèse protéique plus importante. Sur la retenue de Grangent, le dispositif de brassage peut offrir une solution palliative du point de vue touristique en limitant l'accumulation de cyanobactéries en surface, mais il ne permet pas d'éliminer, ni même de diminuer, les proliférations de M. aeruginosa en période estivale. In the reservoir of Grangent, a highly eutrophic lake {{located on the}} upper part of the Loire River, about 10 miles south of Saint-Étienne (France), Microcystis aeruginosa usually dominates the phytoplankton community in late summer and early autumn for many years. Mass developments of this cyanobacterium led to serious difficulties in multi-purpose usage. In order to fight against blooms, an epilimnic artificial mixing was experimented. M. aeruginosa is adapted to stable stratification of the water column. Therefore, partial destratification or bubbling with air are employed to replace M. aeruginosa by better grazable, non- " blooming " and non-toxic species. This cyanobacterium is supposed to lose its advantage of buoyancy and to reduce his growth. This system was also employed to reduce peaks of pH, turbidity of surface waters and concentration of NH 4 and to homogenize the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the water column. Three lines of mixing were tested in 1998 : one located at "Châtelet", upstream of reservoir, measuring 700 m at 11 m depth; one near the beach of Saint-Victor, with the same length and immersed to 15 m depth and, finally, a line of 400 m, near the port, at 16 m <b>depth</b> (<b>figure</b> 1). Data were collected from representative sites, upstream, near and downstream the artificial mixing. They were sampled weekly since April to November 1998. At each site the vertical profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured (figure 2). For each sample, the parameters following were analyzed: pH, NO 3, NH 4, PO 4, carbohydrates, proteins, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton enumeration. Concerning the physicochemical parameters, the assumptions were checked: the values appeared more homogeneous near the lines of mixing than at the other stations. For example, the average temperatures varied between 20, 6 °C (at 10 m depth) and 21, 3 °C (at 0, 5 m depth) at Saint-Victor. This variation reached 1, 3 °C at the station Camaldules. On the other hand, this effect was perceived only up to 10 m of depth and at a limited distance of mixing. In the same way, the colonies of M. aeruginosa were mixed in the water column but only up 10 m depth and near mixing. Moreover, their growth has not decreased on the whole of reservoir. In period of bloom (August 25), G/P ratio was higher in the mixing zone than in the neighbourhoods, primarily because of an increase in carbohydrates (figure 3). In the mixed zone, M. aeruginosa seemed to benefit greater quantity of mineral elements it could use to constitute carbohydrates reserves (figure 4). In this way, when the conditions that became less favourable, like downstream, cyanobacteria were able to follow their development by synthesizing proteins starting from their reserves in carbohydrates. In the reservoir of Grangent, artificial mixing did not allow to fight effectively against blooms of cyanobacteria. Colonies of M. aeruginosa were simply diluted in the water column near mixing but did not reduce their growth...|$|E
40|$|Dans cette étude, on propose un modèle {{hydraulique}} capable de contribuer à la gestion des eaux de la rivière Sebou {{au niveau}} de la retenue d'un barrage de garde situé à l'intérieur de la plaine agricole du Gharb. Le modèle hydraulique élaboré (MHS. 1) est du type filaire et utilise un schéma de différences finies. L'écoulement est influencé par la présence du barrage à l'aval et de nombreuses grandes stations de pompage utilisées pour l'irrigation le long du tronçon étudié. Cependant, les données relatives à la quantité d'eau pompée {{au niveau de}} ces stations ainsi que par les particuliers sont rarement disponibles. Ainsi, une attention particulière a été attribuée à l'estimation du pompage vue son importance quantitative. Les résultats du calibrage et de la validation du modèle pour des périodes de basses eaux de l'année 1997 sont très satisfaisants. Le modèle donne les valeurs du niveau d'eau aux stations de pompage et permet de suivre l'évolution de la réserve de la retenue du barrage. Ce code regroupe dans un seul outil des données provenant de différentes sources et utilisées pour la première fois dans un modèle hydraulique. Il représente un atout considérable pour les organismes publics gestionnaires des ressources hydriques. The studied reachThe Sebou River (600 km) is an important river in Morocco and its waters are solicited for several different uses. The Sebou has an average bottom slope of 10 - 4, variable geometry and many meanders. The flow is characterised by considerable annual and seasonal variations (Figure 2). The studied reach is situated between the town of Belksiri and the Lalla Aïcha dam. Flow {{is influenced by the}} presence of two dams, the Al Wahda upstream and the Lalla Aïcha in the downstream reach. The first dam was constructed on the Ouergha River, which has a torrential regime. The second dam comprises five principal and two secondary radial floodgates and these gates are opened from the bottom. This dam is completely opened during the period of high flows. The maximum flow during this season is 1800 m 3 / s. The dam has a catchment area of 2700 km 2. The maximum volume of the dam reservoir is 37 Mm 3. Its length of influence is about 120 km. During the dry season, the floodgates are partially closed in order to increase the water level upstream. The maximum level upstream of the dam is 6. 5 m NGM (the bottom is at - 1 m). This situation facilitates the pumping of water for agriculture, allowing the irrigation of 15, 600 hectares of rice. A volume of 200 Mm 3 of water is mobilised annually, which, before the construction of the dam, was lost to the Atlantic Ocean. The hydraulic model MHS. 1 The hydraulic model MHS. 1 is based on a modification (essentially the representation of the topography and the outputs) of the DYNHYD 5 model. It solves the one dimensional Saint-Venant equations of continuity and momentum (equations 1 and 2). The Manning coefficient used in the momentum equation is evaluated initially by the empirical formula (Formula No. 3) proposed by Chow. The factor n 0 is evaluated from granulometric measurements that were carried out from upstream to downstream in the studied reach. The others coefficients were evaluated from observations of the river in aerial photos, from the cross sectional areas and available photos, and from field visits. MHS. 1 uses a network called ''Link-Node''. The equations of continuity and momentum, expressed in a finite difference manner, give respectively equations 4 and 5. These equations are solved using a Runge-Kutta procedure. Discretisation of the studied reachThe discretisation of the studied reach was performed using aerial photos achieved by the ORMVAG (L'Office Régionale de la Mise en Valeur Agricole du Gharb) in 1983. These photos were taking in a dry period where the river was nearly dry. This situation permitted a good stereoscopic visualisation of the river morphology. The river reach was divided into 529 grids with a length varying between 50 and 900 m. Data on cross sectional areas from the ORMVAG and other sources were used. Near the town of Souk Tlat (Figure 1), we exploited a new technique called ''Numeral photogrammetry'', which allowed us to reconstitute many cross sectional areas. This technique uses principally stereoscopic pairs of aerial photographs and photogrammetry software. The remaining cross sectional areas were evaluated from observations on aerial photos and from field visits. Evaluation of the pumped waterOne of the important factors that affect flow in the studied reach is the intensive pumping of waters along the river. The pumped water was divided into two types. The first type corresponded to the ten central stations managed by the ORMVAG (Fig. 1). The data of this first type were neither centralised nor easily available. Only the data at the important S 2 station were readily available. The second type corresponded to water pumped by individuals and is less quantified than the first type. Two major hypotheses were adopted. First, the pumped flow at the S 2 station was assumed to be equal to 25 % of the total flow pumped by all the ORMVAG stations. The stations were classified into three classes according to their theoretical capacity (Table 1). This hypothesis allowed the estimation of the unknown pumped flow at the nine other stations. We further assumed that in the neighbourhood of each station, the flow pumped by individuals was equal to the flow pumped by the station. This latter hypothesis was adopted {{on the basis of a}} field investigation in a 7 km characteristic reach. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the overall pumped flow evaluated for the months of June and July 1997. These two months were used respectively for the validation and calibration of the model. Calibration and validation of MHS. 1 The Manning coefficient, estimated initially by the Chow formula (3), varied along the studied reach. It ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 04 s/m 1 / 3, with a mean value of 0. 037 s/m 1 / 3. In the calibration procedure, the Manning coefficient was modified to the same degree along the studied reach because we assumed that the sources of errors involved in its evaluation are identical for all the grids. Along the studied reach, the only available measured data are the water levels at the S 2 station and upstream of the dam. The period chosen for the calibration was from 07 / 01 / 1997 to 07 / 30 / 1997. The upstream boundary (at the Belksiri hydrological station) was given as values of the water level as a function of time (Figure 4). The downstream boundary was given as values of the discharge (flow through the dam gates) as a function of time (Figure 5). Figures 6 and 7 give the results of the calibration (month of July). The Manning coefficient decreased for all the reaches by 0. 008 s/m 1 / 3. These figures show good agreement between the calculated and the observed water level at the S 2 station and near the dam. In order to confirm the results of the calibration test, we proceeded with a validation test of the model for the period from 06 / 04 / 1997 to 06 / 30 / 1997. The results are also satisfactory (Figure 6 and 7, month of June). Figure 8 shows the evolution of the water level on 12 / 06 / 1997. The water level profile remains parallel to the bed profile for the zones situated very far from the dam (the downstream end). From the 45 th kilometre (between stations S 7 and S 8, see Figure 1), we begin to detect the effect of the dam, characterised by an increase in the water level (and therefore an increase in <b>depth).</b> <b>Figure</b> 9 show the evolution of stream velocity from the upstream to downstream regions on 12 / 06 / 1977. Great variations in velocity can be seen due to the changes in river geometry. Also, these variations tend to decrease downstream, reflecting the effect of the dam. Figure 10 represents the evolution of the water reserve available for the whole reach during the months of June and July. It shows a series of decreases in this variable due to the pumping of water. The reserve reaches very low levels (15 Mm 3) compared to its maximal capacity, which is 37 Mm 3. Also, there is an interrelationship between the evolution of the reserve, and pumped water and the flow differences between upstream and downstream. The reserve increases when the upstream-downstream flow difference is greater than the pumped flow. Inversely, when the pumped water is greater, the water reserve decreases. Finally, in this study we proposed a mathematical model that can provide the stages at all locations of the studied reach, specifically at the pumping stations. Water reserve availability can also be provided at any moment, allowing rapid interventions when this variable begins to decrease dramatically. However, more measured water levels at different stations could improve the present results. Also, other considerations must be included such as hydroelectric energy production in dams upstream and river characteristics. Thus, a multipurpose model of the river must be used. More hydraulic data can improve the accuracy of the present model...|$|E

30|$|Radiocarbon {{data suggest}} that these {{observed}} changes in SOM characteristics are not {{the product of a}} single fire event, namely the 2002 Biscuit Fire. Instead, radiocarbon data suggest a long history of differing fire frequencies for the so-called unburned control and high severity plots. The greater abundance of charcoal in the high-severity plots at both sampled <b>depths</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1) suggests that these areas have burned more frequently (González-Pérez et al. 2004). Radiocarbon abundances of the charcoal fragments separated from the unburned control and high severity plots are also indicative of differences in fire history among these plots. The effect of longer-term cycles of repeat burning on variables such as soil N turnover and 13 C signatures cannot be surmised from the current dataset. However, the data presented here highlight the usefulness of radiocarbon as a natural tracer in soils that can be exploited to evaluate fire histories in forest soils. Application of radiocarbon analysis to elucidate relationships between fire frequency, erosion, and accumulation or loss of SOM could additionally be useful in a modeling context. Although fire is often a part of C cycle models, its influence on the SOM pool is generally poorly constrained due to the complexity of the variables influencing SOM dynamics following fire events (Arora and Boer 2005, Kloster et al. 2010). Radiocarbon measurements of soil charcoals and mineral soils could offer insights into how to parameterize the effects of fire on forest soils (Sun et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} concerns {{within the field of}} geotechnical engineering is the presence of cavities in soils. This present work is an attempt to understand the behaviour of strip footing subjected to inclined load and constructed on cavitied soil. The failure mechanism of strip footing located above such soils was studied analytically. The capability of analytical model to correctly expect the system behaviour is assessed by carrying out verification analysis on available studies. The study was prepared by finite element software (PLAXIS) in which an elastic-perfectly plastic soil model was used. It was indicated, from the results of the study, that the load carrying capacity of foundation constructed on cavity can be analysed well using such analysis. The research covered many foundation cases, and in each foundation case, there occurs a critical depth under which the presence of cavities has shown minimum impact on the foundation performance. When cavities are found above this critical depth, the load carrying capacity of the foundation differs with many influences, such as the location and size of the cavity and footing <b>depth.</b> <b>Figures</b> involving the load carrying capacity with the affecting factors studied are presented. These figures offer information beneficial for the design of strip footings rested on underground cavities. Moreover, the results might be used to design a shallow foundation constructed on cavitied soil, whereas the obtained failure mechanisms may be employed to improve numerical solutions for this kind of problems...|$|R

By increasing the opacity at these boundaries in (c) the boundary surface are clearly visible, however, the sense of material thickness from absorption in homogeneous regions is lost. With our technique shown in (d), lighting transfer functions are used to selectively enhance boundary surfaces of interest, allowing opacity to be used to illustrate material thickness and <b>depth.</b> <b>Figures</b> (a), (b), and (d) share the same color and opacity transfer function and have variations only in their lighting transfer function. An important task in volume rendering is the visualization of boundaries between materials. This is typically accomplished using transfer functions that increase opacity based on a voxel’s value and gradient. Lighting also plays a crucial role in illustrating surfaces. In this paper we present a multi-dimensional transfer function method for enhancing surfaces, not through the variation of opacity, but through the modification of surface shading. The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions. With our method, the user is given a means of visualizing boundaries without modifying opacity, allowing opacity to be used for illustrating the thickness of homogeneous materials through the absorption of light...|$|R
