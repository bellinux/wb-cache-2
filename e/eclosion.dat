5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this <b>eclosion</b> process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after <b>eclosion,</b> the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal abdomen (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before <b>eclosion.</b> The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before <b>eclosion,</b> the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

25|$|Discriminating nestmates from non-nestmates is {{dependent}} on acquiring and encountering odors from the nest post-eclosion. Individuals removed from a nest before <b>eclosion</b> will not recognize, or be recognized by, members of that nest. There {{is no indication that}} there is any recognition based on genetic relatedness.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} time it takes for a brood to fully develop is highly {{variable}} and is complicated by occurrences of nest cannibalism, which is often undetected as replacement eggs appear. Males leave the nest 2–7 days after <b>eclosion.</b> Tenure on the nest for a worker female is more variable. Their residence time ranges from 1–60 days.|$|E
25|$|Independently {{of whether}} they are or not copulating, females do not move {{more than a few}} centimeters from their <b>eclosion</b> site until they are able to fly away, usually at twilight. Females start {{preparing}} for flight by fanning their wings. Frequently, fanning begins during mating and is often the first sign of its end as females fly away soon after.|$|E
25|$|The {{stationary}} phase, which lasts {{about two}} to three weeks, begins when the larvae pupate. From this point on, the prey that were previously fed to the larvae are now fed exclusively to the queen. The abdomen (gaster) of the queen swells significantly, and she lays her eggs. At {{the end of the}} stationary phase, both the pupae emerge from their cocoons (<b>eclosion)</b> and the next generation of eggs hatch so the colony has a new group of workers and larvae. After this, the ants resume the nomadic phase.|$|E
25|$|Four larval instars {{have been}} {{described}} based on their morphological characters. With the exception of size differences, the larvae of the minor and major workers are almost impossible to distinguish. Major worker fourth-instar larvae tend to be larger than minor worker prepupae with a wider width. Only the reproductive larvae are larger than major workers and in general, are very robust. Even male third-instar larvae tend to be longer and larger than third-instar workers. No significant morphological difference can distinguish male and queen larvae, but the internal gonopodal imaginal discs differ. Most larval changes are not significant, but the moulting of third-instar larvae and studies of their <b>eclosion</b> support four larval-instar stages.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{produced}} less frequently and in less quantity than females {{are produced}}. After <b>eclosion</b> males {{remain on the}} nest {{for up to a}} week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do not because they lack food access and females do not give them an opportunity to do so in natural populations.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{generation}} occurs per year. The butterfly lays its eggs on the leaves, buds, and seed pods of L. albifrons, L. formosus, and L. variicolor. The eggs are usually {{laid on the}} upper side of new lupine leaves. Eggs generally hatch within 6 to 10 days and the first- and second-instar larvae feed on the mesophyll of the lupine plants. The caterpillars, extremely small, feed {{for a short time}} and then crawl to the plant base, where they enter a dormant state, known as diapause, until the late winter or the following spring. Diapause usually begins about three weeks after <b>eclosion</b> and begins {{about the same time as}} the host plant shifts its energy to flower and seed production. When the caterpillar comes out of its diapause and begins feeding, it occasionally sheds its skin to accommodate its growth.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in <b>eclosion</b> time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether feeding is of practical importance has by now been clearly settled for some Chironomus species, at least; specimens that had fed on sucrose flew {{far longer than}} starved specimens, and starved females longer than starved males, which suggested they had eclosed with larger reserves of energy than the males. Some authors suggest the females and males apply the resources obtained in feeding differently. Males expend the extra energy on flight, while females use their food resources to achieve longer lifespans. The respective strategies should be compatible with maximal probability of successful mating and reproduction in those species that do not mate immediately after <b>eclosion,</b> and in particular in species that {{have more than one}} egg mass maturing, the less developed masses being oviposited after a delay. Such variables also would be relevant to species that exploit wind for dispersal, laying eggs at intervals. Chironomids that feed on nectar or pollen may well be of importance as pollinators, but current evidence on such points is largely anecdotal. However, the content of protein and other nutrients in pollen, in comparison to nectar, might well contribute to the females' reproductive capacities.|$|E
25|$|In Drosophila, a molecularly-driven clock {{mechanism}} {{works to}} regulate circadian rhythms such as locomotor activity and <b>eclosion</b> by oscillating {{the levels of}} the proteins PER and TIM via positive and negative feedback loops. The doubletime gene produces the protein DBT, a kinase that phosphorylates PER to regulate its accumulation in the cytoplasm and its degradation in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, PER and TIM levels rise during the night, and DBT binds to PER while levels of TIM are still low. DBT phosphorylates the cytoplasmic PER, which leads to its degradation. Only once TIM accumulates do PER and TIM bind, and this binding inhibits the degradation of PER. This cytoplasmic PER degradation and then accumulation causes the 4-6 hour delay seen between the levels of per mRNA and the levels of PER protein. The PER/TIM complex, still bound to DBT, migrates into the nucleus where it suppresses the transcription of per and tim. TIM is lost from the complex, and DBT then phosphorylates PER which leads to its degradation, allowing for the transcription of the clock and clock-controlled genes (those with transcription controlled by circadian mechanisms). The oscillations in the PER and TIM proteins presence causes oscillations in their own and other genes' expression, which {{is the basis for}} circadian rhythmicity.|$|E
2500|$|Pupation usually {{occurs in}} spring {{at the end}} of the larval tunnel in the sapwood, <b>eclosion</b> occurs 12–50 days later, and adults will chew out of the tree {{approximately}} one week after <b>eclosion.</b> Adults feed on leaf petioles and can chew through bark on small branches to feed on the vascular cambium. Eggs, larvae or as pupae can overwinter within the tree. In their overwintering phase, pupae are inactive and development does not occur. They resume their life cycle when temperatures are above [...]|$|E
50|$|Pittendrigh was {{influential}} in establishing {{many of the}} key criteria that a biological system must have {{in order to be}} considered a biological clock. His work studying the <b>eclosion</b> (the process of an insect emerging from its pupa stage) rhythms of Drosophila pseudoobscura demonstrated that 1) <b>eclosion</b> rhythms persist without environmental cues (i.e. in constant conditions), 2) unlike most chemical reactions, the period of <b>eclosion</b> remains relatively constant when exposed to changes in ambient temperature ("temperature compensation"), and 3) <b>eclosion</b> rhythms can be entrained by light cycles that are close to the flies' natural period (τ).|$|E
50|$|The pupa is 4-6 mm, {{fusiform}} and greenish yellow in {{the early}} pupal stage, changing gradually to yellowish brown and eventually blackish brown before <b>eclosion</b> (emergence).|$|E
50|$|Pupation usually {{occurs in}} spring {{at the end}} of the larval tunnel in the sapwood, <b>eclosion</b> occurs 12-50 days later, and adults will chew out of the tree {{approximately}} one week after <b>eclosion.</b> Adults feed on leaf petioles and can chew through bark on small branches to feed on the vascular cambium. Eggs, larvae or as pupae can overwinter within the tree. In their overwintering phase, pupae are inactive and development does not occur. They resume their life cycle when temperatures are above 10 C.|$|E
50|$|Bursicon is {{released}} just after <b>eclosion</b> and induces epidermis cell death. At {{the same time}} it hastens the tanning reaction, and hardens the newly expanded cuticle of the wing.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of beetles in genus Cyclommatus share many {{characteristics}} of that of other stag beetles, starting with an egg, then three larval stages, pupation and finally <b>eclosion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hall worked {{primarily}} with Drosophila {{to study the}} mechanism of circadian rhythms. Rather than using the more traditional method of measuring <b>eclosion,</b> Hall measured locomotor activity of Drosophila to observe circadian rhythms.|$|E
50|$|The {{chrysalis}} are 10.5-15.5 mm long, suspended {{with the}} head down. It is a light lime green, with pale green or white speckling, and turns a medium brown about two days before <b>eclosion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Males usually start <b>eclosion</b> (emergence) {{earlier than}} females and peak in numbers before females. Both {{of the sexes}} are sexually mature {{by the time of}} <b>eclosion.</b> Butterflies and moths {{normally}} do not associate with each other, except for migrating species, staying relatively asocial. Mating begins with an adult (female or male) attracting a mate, normally using visual stimuli, especially in diurnal species like most butterflies. However, the females of most nocturnal species, including almost all moth species, use pheromones to attract males, sometimes from long distances. Some species engage in a form of acoustic courtship, or attract mates using sound or vibration such as the polka-dot wasp moth, Syntomeida epilais.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, mutants of Drosophila melanogaster {{that lack}} bursicon gene do not spread their wings after <b>eclosion.</b> Secondly, the {{elongated}} abdomen {{shape of a}} newly eclosed fly remains for a much longer period of time. In addition, the abdomen of a fly is less melanized.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{live for}} about 10 days after <b>eclosion</b> {{and do not}} eat, but may drink if water is available. The mating system is polygamous; many females will only mate once, however. In mating, which takes several hours, the abdomens are placed end to end.|$|E
50|$|Some organisms reach sexual {{maturity}} {{in a short}} metamorphosis, such as <b>eclosion</b> in many insects. For others, the transition from juvenile to fully mature is a more prolonged process — puberty for example. In such cases, juveniles during this transformation are sometimes called subadults.|$|E
50|$|In 1883, John Lubbock revitalized Harvey’s {{hypothesis}} {{and argued}} that the origin and evolution of holometabolan development {{can be explained by}} the precocious <b>eclosion</b> of the embryo. Hemimetabolan species, whose larvae look like the adult, have an embryo that completes all developmental stages (namely: ‘protopod’, ‘polipod’, and ‘oligopod’ stages) inside the eggshell. Holometabolan species instead have vermiform larvae and a pupal stage after incomplete development and hatching. The debate continued through the twentieth century, with some authors (like Charles Pérez in 1902) claiming the precocious <b>eclosion</b> theory outlandish, Antonio Berlese reestablishing it as the leading theory in 1913, and Augustus Daniel Imms disseminating it widely among Anglo-Saxon readers from 1925 (see Wigglesworth 1954 for review). One of the most contentious aspects of the precocious <b>eclosion</b> theory that fueled further debate in the field of evolution and development was the proposal that the hemimetabolan nymphal stages are equivalent to the holometabolan pupal stage. Critics of this theory (most notably, H.E. Hinton) argue that post-embryonic development in hemimetabolans and holometabolans are equivalent, and rather the last nymphal instar stage of hemimetabolans would be homologous to the holometabolan pupae. More modern opinions still oscillate between these two conceptions of the hemi- to holometabolan evolutionary trend.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally females will {{split the}} clutch into two roughly equal-sized masses, {{both of which}} may be laid on the same night or over two nights. The average egg mass {{contains}} about 300 to 400 eggs. Females live for 6-8 days after <b>eclosion,</b> just like other related saturniids.|$|E
5000|$|Adult Tachinids are not parasitic, {{but either}} do not feed {{at all or}} visit flowers, {{decaying}} matter, or similar sources of energy to sustain themselves until they have concluded their procreative activities. Their non-parasitic behaviour after <b>eclosion</b> from the pupa is what justifies {{the application of the}} term [...] "protelean".|$|E
5000|$|In biology, {{meconium}} {{describes the}} metabolic waste product from the pupal stage of an insect that is expelled through the anal {{opening of the}} adult upon <b>eclosion</b> from the pupa. Other insects, such as beetles and some Hymenoptera (Aculeata) expel the meconium {{at the end of}} the larval stage, before becoming a pupa.|$|E
50|$|Adult moths {{normally}} {{emerge from}} their cocoons in late morning or early afternoon. <b>Eclosion</b> (emergence from the cocoon) only {{takes a few}} minutes. After eclosing, the moths climb and hang on plants so that their furled wings can be inflated with fluid (hemolymph) pumped from the body. This inflation process takes about twenty minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{behavioral}} {{aspects of}} Drosophila such as [...] activity have been monitored with ectopic expression of pdf, {{which in this}} case is concentrated in the dorsal central brain. These alterations in expression caused severely altered rhythmic behavior in <b>eclosion</b> of larvae, further substantiating the evidence that PDF modulates the rhythmic control of Drosophila behavior.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} time it takes for a brood to fully develop is highly {{variable}} and is complicated by occurrences of nest cannibalism, which is often undetected as replacement eggs appear. Males leave the nest 2-7 days after <b>eclosion.</b> Tenure on the nest for a worker female is more variable. Their residence time ranges from 1-60 days.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Hydrophyllaceae species, {{including}} Phacelia {{species and}} Hydrophyllum virginianum. Full-grown larvae are 11 - 13 mm long and olive-green, with a clearly defined narrow longitudinal middorsal yellowish-white line, margined with grey {{and a light}} green head. Pupation occurs {{on the surface of}} dead leaves of the food plant. The pupa turns dark before <b>eclosion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After punk <b>eclosion</b> at late 1970s, {{the genre}} also was {{influenced}} by many other music styles. Some British punk and new wave acts like The Clash included elements {{that could be considered}} as [...] "latin" [...] in [...] "Sandinista!" [...] (1980). Other bands such as Bow Wow Wow, Gang Of Four, The Slits or Special AKA did so.|$|E
