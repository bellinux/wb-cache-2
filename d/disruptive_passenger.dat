40|$|Traditional {{transportation}} systems in metropolitan areas often suf-fer from inefficiencies due to uncoordinated actions as system ca-pacity and traffic demand change. With the pervasive deployment of networked sensors in modern vehicles, {{large amounts of}} infor-mation regarding traffic demand and system status can be collected in real-time. This information provides opportunities to perform various types of control and coordination for large scale intelli-gent {{transportation systems}}. In this paper, we present a novel re-ceding horizon control (RHC) framework to dispatch taxis, which combines highly spatiotemporally correlated demand/supply mod-els and real-time GPS location and occupancy information. The objectives include reducing taxi idle driving distance and match-ing spatiotemporal ratio between demand and supply for service quality. Moreover, our RHC framework is compatible with differ-ent predictive models and optimization problem formulations. This compatibility property allows us to model <b>disruptive</b> <b>passenger</b> de-mands and traffic conditions into a robust optimization problem. Extensive trace driven analysis with a real taxi data set from San Francisco shows that our solution reduces the average total idle distance by 52 %, and reduces the total supply demand ratio error across the city by up to 45 %...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The alleged August 2006 terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives onboard multiple commercial aircraft bound for the United States from the United Kingdom has highlighted both the continued importance of securing the civil aviation system and the potential that improvised explosive devices (IED) may be smuggled onboard passenger aircraft. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has primary responsibility for ensuring the security of civil aviation, which includes the safety of passengers and flight crew. One measure TSA uses to protect the aviation system is prohibiting individuals from carrying items that it determines {{to be a threat}} to the aircraft and its passengers into an airport sterile area or onboard an aircraft either in their carry-on bag or on their person. To implement this measure, TSA maintains a prohibited items list that informs both the Transportation Security Officers (TSO) who conduct passenger screening and the traveling public of items that will not be allowed into an airport sterile area or onboard an aircraft. In December 2005, TSA revised its prohibited items list to allow passengers to carry: (1) metal scissors with pointed tips and a blade 4 inches or less in length as measured from the fulcrum; and (2) tools [...] such as pliers, screwdrivers, and wrenches [...] 7 inches or less in length (excluding crowbars, drills, hammers, and saws). TSA considers any incident that threatens the security or safety of an aircraft or its passengers and flight crew to be a security incident. These could include a range of activities onboard an aircraft such as <b>disruptive</b> <b>passenger</b> behavior, violence against a passenger or crew member, hijacking attempts, or the use of an improvised explosive device. By examining the security impacts of the change to the prohibited items list, this report considers the impacts that could result from a passenger attempting to use scissors or tools to hijack an aircraft or to commit other forms of violence onboard a flight. Such actions fall within TSA's statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and security of passengers and crew aboard aircraft. In accordance with Conference Report 109 - 699, which accompanied the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations act, this report addresses the following questions: (1) What was TSA's basis for removing certain scissors and tools from the prohibited items list and what are stakeholder views on the change? (2) What have been the impacts, if any, of the removal of certain scissors and tools from the prohibited items list on the security of aircraft passengers and flight crew and on the effectiveness of checkpoint screening operations?...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} frequently, {{incidents}} caused by passengers occur on board commercial aircraft. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> behaviour varies from case to case. They can consist {{for example in}} being abusive towards crew members or other fellow passengers, in refusing to follow safety instructions or even in committing acts of violence against persons on board. All these behavioural patterns often jeopardize aviation safety. Airlines have recently {{become aware of the}} seriousness of this phenomenon and of the danger it can be for safety. ICAO itself has put a study group in charge of evaluating the situation and making suggestions. The following study analyses at first the answers given to the problem of <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> by the international conventions related to aviation safety while pointing out that these solutions yet contain serious loopholes. It then examines the question of the airlines liability resulting from acts committed by <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> and, briefly, the <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> liability towards the victims of their acts. Finally, after a brief overview of the solutions given by U. S. law, the following study addresses the question of the need of a new international instrument...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} common to see older flight attendants in many countries. Embraer, Boeing and GMA Research, Inc. collaborated to conduct focus groups, fly-along observations and on-line surveys with older flight attendants in Germany and the United States. Difficulties with workload, overhead lifting and injuries were common themes. Offsetting the negative physical aspects {{for the older}} flight attendants was {{the feeling that they}} were better able to cope with <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> and crew issues...|$|R
25|$|Day-to-day {{operations}} will {{be handled}} rather {{like those of}} Docklands Light Railway, with service employees riding in some trains {{to watch out for}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> and unusual occurrences and to supply information to passengers. Unlike the DLR however, not every train will be accompanied by a service employee, and again unlike the DLR, service employees have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Doors close automatically, supervised by light barriers and pressure-sensitive door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of driving the train. For this purpose, all service employees are fully trained drivers.|$|R
40|$|A contextual inquiry was {{conducted}} at the Systems Operational Center (SOC) of a Regional Airline with approximately 100 aircraft from the 24 - 27 th of July 2006. A total of 30 hours of direct observation were conducted with {{various members of the}} SOC Staff including the Director of Systems Operations (DSO), the Manager of Customer Operations (MCO) and the Line Maintenance Planner (LMP). During the inquiry a wide variety of situations occurred: unscheduled maintenance delays, estimated ready time slips, a bird strike, a <b>disruptive</b> <b>passenger</b> requiring a cabin lock-down, a declared emergency due to oil temperature, taxi delays, weather delays, and brake-cooling delays. The vast majority of these situations were handled as if they were no different from routine operations; however, there were moments when the SOC personnel were pushed to their professional limits and the introduction of any other, even minor, issue could have caused severe disruptions to the schedule. The majority of problems faced by the the airlineâ€™s SOC on a daily basis came from lack of resources (planes and flight crew) and from inclement weather. During the inquiry, between 4 - 12 planes (6 - 9 % of the fleet) were consistently out for unscheduled maintenance. Additionally, one one day during the observations 241 flight crew who were scheduled to fly were unavailable. Unlike other airlines, ATC restrictions are not often an issue for this airline, although station curfews in southern California do place an additional constraint on the schedule recovery process. Beyond the resource shortages and the inevitable weather interruptions, the majority of problems stemmed from software tools which limited the effectiveness of the SOC personnel. For example, several of the major software tools depend on different databases with limited connectivity, creating discrepancies between systems and requiring information to be entered multiple times. Additionally, the VisOps tool, used a primary measure of airline schedule adherence, does not support the logging of problems/issues, solution generation through the use of either advanced sort and search features, optimization algorithms and solution sharing. To make best use of the software tools on hand, especially VisOps, larger computer monitors are needed. The resolution at which the software tools must be set for visibility limits their usefulness with 19 inch monitors. Finally, none of the staff interviewed could indicate to any consistent quantitative feedback regarding the relative merits of their decisions on overall system performance. Instead, they often faced inquires about specific decisions which may only make sense when viewed from the overall context of the situation. Appropriate feedback could be provided as summary statistics regarding number of fights canceled, average delay and daily operational costs, which could be generated and displayed to them automatically...|$|E
50|$|Plastic restraints, {{known as}} wrist ties, riot cuffs, plasticuffs, flexicuffs, flex-cuffs, tri-fold cuffs, zapstraps, zipcuffs, or zip-strips, are lightweight, {{disposable}} plastic strips resembling electrical cable ties. They {{can be carried}} in large quantities by soldiers and police and are therefore well-suited for situations where many may be needed, such as during large-scale protests and riots. In recent years, airlines have begun to carry plastic handcuffs {{as a way to}} restrain <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers.</b> Disposable restraints could be considered to be cost-inefficient; they cannot be loosened, and must be cut off to permit a restrained subject to be fingerprinted, or to attend to bodily functions. It is not unheard of for a single subject to receive five or more sets of disposable restraints in his or her first few hours in custody.|$|R
40|$|Airline {{personnel}} have, increasingly, {{found it}} necessary to deal with unruly and <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers,</b> some of whom display violent behaviour. This behaviour can result in serious injury to staff and passengers and can compromise the safety of the aircraft. Termed 2 Ì† 7 Air Rage 2 Ì† 7, this phenomenon enjoys regular media attention and airlines, unions and governments are attempting initiatives to tackle this issue. This paper examines the main incidents of air rage and presents reasons why this phenomenon should come to the public eye in recent years. This paper also summarises initiatives that airlines, air transport unions and aviation authorities have introduced in an attempt to combat air rage incidents. Finally, the paper concludes by reporting on preliminary research undertaken to assess the importance of including air rage in higher education curricula and discussing the role higher education can play in better preparing graduates to deal with these situations...|$|R
5000|$|Bill Briggs of MSNBC {{said that}} the {{incident}} [...] "launched a fresh examination of the two-faced persona all flight attendants are asked to master: grinning snack server one moment, frowning rules enforcer the next." [...] Corey Caldwell, {{a spokesperson for the}} Association of Flight Attendants, said that while the association did not condone Slater's behavior, it held concerns for flight attendants working longer hours for lower wages and for passengers carrying heavier bags due to fees on checked luggage. Sarah Keagle, a flight attendant who writes in the blog The Flying Pinto, said [...] "Hopefully," [...] the incident [...] "was an 'Aha' moment for the traveling public." [...] Keagle argued that while flight attendants like dealing with most <b>passengers,</b> a few <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> make the job difficult. Kathy Sweeney, a flight attendant who worked for America West Airlines, said in an AOL Original article that [...] "While I don't agree with Steven Slater endangering passengers by 'blowing a slide' (let alone forcing JetBlue to pay about $10k to repack the slide), I can see how he snapped." ...|$|R

30|$|These initial {{simulations}} {{are encouraging}} {{in terms of}} the data they are able to generate and the insights gained therein to how passenger crowds might board, alight and disperse in various carriage arrangements. Extending the range of behaviours that 3 D agents exhibit when reacting to other agents poses a number of interesting possibilities. If a crowd consists of passengers mostly travelling alone, the simulation could account for peopleâ€™s general preference in not only their spatial separation but also for seats facing forward and next to a window. The Authorsâ€™ current simulation reflects an environment most like a peak time commute, whereby most passengers are not associated with a group of other people. What if our agents were travelling in the company of friends and companions? Fine tuning the simulation to account for groups of agents gathering together near the doors or in adjacent seats would entail a consideration for how other agents navigate around these groups. A large crowd of vocal high school students boarding at a station, for example, brings about a new range of agent behaviours and movement dynamics. We discussed above the possibility of agents moving at very different speeds, but how might agents be convincingly programmed to consider other agents, for example, to give up their seat or make way for elderly or disabled passengers? And finally, how might other agents react to groups of <b>disruptive</b> <b>passengers</b> or even aggressive and intoxicated ones? Refinements of agent behaviours such as these would clearly benefit from the collaboration of behavioural psychologists.|$|R
40|$|In 1993, the U. K. {{passenger}} rail industry was privatized with expectations of greater investment, increased efficiency, and improved network performance. To date, {{progress has been}} mixed and the industry has been subject to a critical national press and passenger complaints that have reached record levels. The industry is continuing to develop a service that can do justice to its privatization. Passenger information is {{an important aspect of}} these improvements and national rail journey planning services are now heavily used. However, relatively little consideration has been given to understanding the role that information might play in assisting passengers who have already planned their journey but who encounter problems when they travel by train. Failure to execute a journey as planned can be severely <b>disruptive</b> to rail <b>passengers</b> in terms of lost time, expense, anxiety, and frustration. This article charts the development of the privatized rail industry and defines a set of journey breakdown situations that can be encountered by passengers. Insights are gained from passenger complaint letters. Such letters typically provide detailed accounts of journey breakdowns, attempts to recover the situations, and the use made of available information. Inaccurate or misunderstood pre-trip information is found to be a factor in many journey breakdowns. Accessible, timely, and appropriate provision of en-route information can improve passengers' satisfaction by enabling completion of their immediate journey and might also be decisive in ensuring they have the confidence to use the rail network again in the future. <br/...|$|R
