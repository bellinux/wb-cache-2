2500|$|As Jordan, Price was {{famed for}} her surgically {{enhanced}} breasts. At 19 {{she had the}} first in a succession of breast-enhancement surgeries, increasing her natural 32B to a 32FF. Unhappy with her breasts from an early age and despite her family's objections, she went ahead with the procedure because she felt that, as a glamour model, she did not look [...] "as sexy or [...] womanly" [...] as other models. She has since had many enhancements, as well as reductions, on her breasts in addition to later having liposuction on her hips and thighs, fat implanted into <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> boost her pout, and a nose job. She told a reporter, [...] "Some people may be famous for creating a pencil sharpener. I'm famous for my tits." [...] Price was later barred from Page Three in The Sun with their adoption of a policy to only use [...] "all natural" [...] models.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Sound of Drums", the Master, as Harold Saxon, {{is married}} to Lucy Saxon, to whom he refers at one point as his [...] "faithful companion". Lucy {{is aware of the}} nature of the Master's plans yet is still loyal to him. She has {{travelled}} with him to Utopia, the end of the universe, and thus believes [...] "there's no point to anything." [...] Their relationship appears to be non-platonic; they kiss quite often and it seems as though their marriage is more than just a pretence. Lucy comments, [...] "I made my choice, for better or for worse." [...] In [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] she is still present, but showing signs of apparent physical abuse, and her loyalty towards him begins to waver. She shoots the Master at the climax of the story, killing him. She is imprisoned, but when the Master's coven made the preparations for his resurrection in The End of Time, she is forced into giving the Master's biometric signature on <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> complete the ritual. Having foreseen his return, Lucy threw a vial containing a chemical to disrupt the resurrection, killing herself in the resulting explosion while only succeeding in giving the Master a tentative life.|$|E
