60|$|These {{negotiations}} were commenced, {{and they went}} on {{two or three years}} without making any sensible progress. Donna Maria was a Catholic, and Charles a Protestant. Now a Catholic could not marry a Protestant without a special dispensation from the pope. To get this dispensation required new negotiations and delays. In the midst of it all, the King of Spain, Donna Maria's father, died, and his son, her brother, named Philip, succeeded him. Then the negotiations had all to be commenced anew. It was supposed that the King of Spain did not wish to have the affair concluded, but liked to have <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>discussion,</b> as it tended to keep the King of England more or less under his control. So they continued to send embassies back and forth, with drafts of treaties, articles, conditions, and stipulations without number. There were endless discussions about securing to Donna Maria the full enjoyment of the Catholic religion in England, and express agreements were proposed and debated in respect to her having a chapel, and priests, and the right to celebrate mass, and to enjoy, in fact, all the other privileges which she had been accustomed to exercise in her own native land. James did not object. He agreed to every thing; but still, some how or other, the arrangement could not be closed. There was always some pretext for delay.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the factors shaping {{innovation}} in online newsrooms in three nations of the Arab World, with particular interest in the adoption of multimedia news innovations. Applying theoretical perspectives from the social shaping of technology and the diffusion of innovation literature, this study sought to identify the key factors shaping the innovation process. Field studies were based in three Arabic newsrooms: Aljazeera Net in Qatar, Almasry Alyoum in Egypt, and Almassae in Morocco. The case studies are grounded in two weeks of participant-observation field research within each online newsroom, along with over 100 in-depth interviews with {{those involved in the}} production of online news, and online archival reviews of the three news portals since their inception. Field research began with participant observation at Aljazeera in 2010, prior to the uprisings of the Arab Spring, and continued through early 2013. The political context of each newsroom during the field research became a major aspect of the innovation process of each case study. The thesis reinforces a wide range of social, economic, and organizational factors in the adoption and adaptation of multimedia technologies in the newsrooms studied, supporting earlier research on newsroom innovation across other regions of the world. For example, conceptions about ‘ideal’ industry multimedia models for the modern newsroom were important in each case. However, in the political context of events related to the Arab Spring, the overriding importance of the larger political context emerged in each case. The significance of this observation suggests that research on news organizations cannot take the political context for granted and should more explicitly embed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>discussion</b> of the social shaping of innovation, even under more stable and liberal political conditions. There is a relative lack of systematic empirical research on Arabic newsrooms among studies of news innovation. Looking at the political context of emergent or weak democracies and their influence on modern multimedia newsrooms especially during crisis events, therefore, can {{contribute to the development of}} theory and research in Western democracies; and reintroduce politics into theories of innovation within modern newsrooms. This study suggests that future scholarship brings politics into the study of the social shaping of newsroom innovation without losing the many significant advances of existing research in more liberal democratic Western contexts of the multimedia newsroom.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Tax Credit Claimants dataset provides information {{about the number of}} families that receive Working Tax credit (for people who are working and on a low income) and Child Tax credit (for people that are responsible for children) in the UK. The dataset provides information on household composition, level of entitlement and employment status of the household. Additionally, the data provides information on families who benefit from help with their child care costs. Information is taken from application, renewal packs and change of circumstances sent to HMRC. The current tax credit system was introduced in April 2003 when the existing tax credits (Working Families’ Tax Credit, Disabled Person’s Tax Credit and Children’s Tax Credit) were replaced with Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. The actual Tax Credit Claimants dataset contains data from its introduction in 2003 onwards. The Tax Credits dataset provides a snapshot of claims paid in each quarter. Aggregate data&# 160;are published twice a year in April and December and are available from the HMRC website. The dataset holds information relating to claims in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The dataset can be geographically referenced to the lower layer super output area. To {{give you an idea of}} the size of dataset, in 2008 / 09 more than 6 million families containing 10 million children were receiving tax credits. These included 455, 000 tax credit recipients without children. Working Tax and Child Tax Credits are available for the majority of households in the UK. The amount of entitlement depends upon a range of factors including&# 58; how many children you have living with you; whether you work – and how many hours you work; if you pay for childcare; if you or any child living with you has a disability; if you’re aged 50 plus and are coming off benefits; and income levels. Those eligible for a tax credit receive either a full or partial amount depending on their income levels. Please note that this dataset does not include records of people who are eligible for tax credits but choose not to claim them, not does it include records of those who are ineligible or who make an unsuccessful claim. Quarterly datasets are available showing a snapshot of claims at particular dates, along with an annual dataset showing the average number of claims over the year and their entitlement. Published counts of Tax Credits data at small area level are rounded so the published total number of claimants in a larger area may possibly not match the summed totals from data tables produced at smaller geography. The Tax Credit dataset geographical areas are calculated using the postcode and address information reported on the claim. Accurate linking using the National Insurance Number, Child Benefit Number, or names and addresses can then occur. Most HMRC data do contain names and addresses. If the data were released to researchers in the future HMRC would need to consider the detail released to ensure the dataset was not disclosive. Variables within the dataset may be subject to statistical disclosure control techniques to prevent disclosure and confidentiality breaches. The dataset is considered to be of a very high quality. It is a full record of all claimants in any one year. Information is taken from application or renewals for the Working Tax and Child Tax Credits, so is not subject to a sampling error. &# 160; Anyone attempting to defraud the system is liable to prosecution and so is a deterrent for false claims. The HMRC also carry out a number of standard checks to ensure overall quality of the data. Before conducting any research it is recommended that you gain an understanding of both Working Tax and Child Tax Credits as both the eligibility criteria and the calculation of payments are complex. If you are considering time series research please consider how changes in the eligibility criteria over time could impact upon the data and your findings. Generally, the take up of tax credits is relatively high; however, in areas with low levels of take-up of tax credits, the data may not adequately represent the eligible population. Research Usage and Linkage The Tax Credits dataset has a wide variety of research uses. It can provide an insight into income levels of a geographical area and more specifically provide information on&# 58; The analysis of the number of low and middle income families by geographical area; The number of children living in low or middle income families in a geographical area; The number of lone-parents (and children living in lone-parent household) in a geographical area. The data has also been used in other specific circumstances, such as the creation of the Indices of Deprivation by Communities and Local Government. The research team involved was not allowed direct access to the data though. Instead, they wrote code in SAS and sent this to HMRC. There, staff reviewed and revised <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>discussion</b> with the research team, and finally produced the small area level counts needed to meet the specification of the project. In total, the process took 14 months from initial discussions to receipt of data by the research team. The Tax Claimants dataset is linked by the HMRC with other datasets that they hold, including the Child Benefit dataset. It is linked using either the National Insurance number or Tax Credit address to enable in depth analysis of families income. The dataset is also linked to Department for Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study which combines benefits, income and employment data. </div...|$|E

40|$|Cherry (1955) {{discovered}} {{that if a}} subject listens to a passage of prose presented to one ear and repeats it aloud, he remains ignorant of the content, though not of the general characteristics, of another, different prose passage presented simultaneously to his other ear. The present thesis examines {{the nature of this}} selective blocking of content in selective dichotic listening, suggests a model for the mechanisms involved, discusses the relations between this and other "kinds" of attention, and speculates on the neurophysiological mechanisms involved. Using Cherry's original technique it is shown that even if the rejected passage is a list of seven words repeated 55 times it leaves no detectable trace (Chapter XI). Certain stimuli can break down this block, however, and these seem to be "important" stimuli such as the subject's own name. An attempt to make a word "important" by pairing it with electric shock la described, with another attempt to change the affective value of stimuli by giving the subject instructions to alter his "set*. The first of these attempts was successful (chapter IV). The block appears to be extraordinarily effective, since the subject's attention does not switch even when there is a considerable disparity in loudness between the two messages (Chapter III). A review is given of some of the recent work on selective listening, and {{on the basis of this}} a model is suggested for the mechanisms which underlie the observed phenomena. The model supposes that the input from either ear is treated in two ways. One pathway from the ear to perceptual mechanisms treats words simply as sounds, and this pathway is not blocked in selective dichptic listening. But there is a second pathway, which leads to the higher analytical mechanisms which treat sounds as words, and in selective listening this may be blocked below the level of conscious perception. The signals passing into the central nervous system are sampled by a localisation device, which compares the two inputs and takes a decision as to whether one or more messages are present and where they are localised. The subject's voluntary decision to listen to one ear and not the other "biasses" the system towards accepting signals along one input pathway rather than the other, unless the localisation device decides there is only one message present in a position which renders the voluntary selection impossible. The brain receives the early parts of the message, and on the basis of past experience of the transitional probabilities between the signals of a language, it predicts what signals are likely to appear later in the message. Whichever input channel receives a message which most nearly matches these predictions will tend to be accepted (Chapter III). Modifications of this basic model are suggested to deal with the role of "important" signals, and situations involving more than two messages (Cbapter IV). Various experiments to test the model are described, such as one in which the transitional probabilities between signals are varied by using statistical approximations to English. Further, if the same message is sent to the two ears, but with a large time difference between the arrival of a given word at the ears, the subject does not realise that they are the same message if he listens to one of them. If he listens to, and repeats, the one which leads in time he realises that they are the same (his attention breaks down) when the two messages are as much as six or more seconds apart. If he listens to the one which lags in time this only happens wben the messages are less than 1 Â½ seconds apart. The difference is shown not to be an artefact of the time taken to repeat what is heard, which takes only about 1 second. The difference would be predicted by the model, and is related to <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>discussion.</b> Other data from the review are also related to the model. Two phenomena which bear on the general problem of selective listening are discussed - the time taken to switch attention, and the apparent diversity of the "kinds" of attention. The failure to break down the subject's attention by "setting" him with instructions raised the question of switching time, for one of the conditions used in that experiment was such that the estimate of switching time of attention made by Broadbent (1954), and similar work by the writer, should have allowed the subject ample time to switch to that message for which he was set. An experiment is described which produces results which differ from Broadbent's as regards switching time, and which cast doubt on his "Filter Theory" model. He has suggested that there is a very short term memory store peripheral to a filter which can select one of the possible channels through which signals enter the nervous system, but the data here presented show that the effect of the rate of presentation upon recall of stimuli in an immediate memory experiment is not such as would support Broad- bent's model. A critique of the rationale of experiments on switching time is given, pointing out that the present experimental designs are inadequate to ensure that the subject is indeed switching (Chapter V). The way in which the concept of attention has been used in modern experimental psychology is reviewed, and four apparently distinct uses are described. Firstly there is the "mentalistic" use of the early experimental psychologists, such as Wundt and Titchener. Secondly, there is the use in vigilance experiments, which seem best described as a prolonged task of signal/noise discrimination. Thirdly, there is the use such as is found in the present thesis, where attention refers to the selection of one from a number of possible channels along which signals may arrive. Lastly, there is the use in the sense of "mental concent- ration". Titchener's list of attention-catching stimuli is compared with the results found in selective dichotic listening. It is suggested that it would be both useful and possible to enquire whether separate mechanisms underlie those different uses of the concept of attention, and a start is made in this direction by showing that there is no significant correlation between scores on a test of concentration and scores on a listening-and-repeating situation (Chapter VI). In considering the neurophysiology of these phenomena the evidence about four parts of the mechanism is assessed. Firstly evidence is brought from ablation studies in animals and dysphasia in humans to show that the meaning-analysis mechanisms of the brain can be affected without affecting those responsible for comparatively crude discriminations. For example in word deafness aphasia there is little or no lose in auditory sensitivity as measured with an audiometer, but the meaning of words and tunes is utterly lost. Secondly, the position of the auditory localisation mechanisms is considered, and that for comparing the early and later parts of messages received. It is tentatively concluded that the auditory localisation mechanisms are located in the olivary nuclei of the trapezoid body; and that a pathway from the parieto-temporal area of the cortex which is brought into relation with the afferent inflow by way of a circuit involving the reticular formation may be the mechanism of the prediction devices. Thirdly, the level of the block for meaning is discussed. On the basis of ablation studies in animals, GSR conditioning experiments in the awake human, and EEG studies of the ability of the sleeping human to discriminate between signals, it is suggested that the block lies between the auditory cortex and the reticular formation. Lastly, the question of the way in which "switching" of the attention is brought about is discussed. It is tentatively suggested that the initial "biassing" of the system is through a fronto-reticular pathway, and that the reticular formation is probably the centre of the system, where the several factors responsible for producing the particular response observed on any given occasion interact to produce the final result (Chapter VII). In a final chapter a recapitulation of the model is given together with a brief discussion of the writer's attitude to models in general. The present thesis is considered as a preliminary progress report on work in a field which seems to be as yet untouched except by the writer and Taylor (1960). Points of particular interest are noted and a programme of research using both behavioural and neurophysiological techniques is indicated. </p...|$|E
