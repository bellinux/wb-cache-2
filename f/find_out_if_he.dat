Pillsbury, the white turpentine mill supervisor, for protection; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier, and tortured him to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had aided Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict.

5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E
5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} tobacco company Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.|$|E

25|$|From {{the day of}} the Gardner Museum theft, Donati was {{believed}} to have had a role in it, possibly as one of the two thieves who, wearing what appeared to be police uniforms, took the guards captive and stole the works. FBI agents went to see Connor, then in jail in Chicago awaiting trial on another theft, the next day to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had orchestrated it from prison. He had not, but recalled that he and Donati had long cased the museum and considered plans for a theft. In 1997, Connor told Vanity Fair that he believed Donati had taken the gu, the oldest work in the museum's collection, to present to him as a gift later.|$|E

Sonya {{complains}} to Yelena that she has loved Astrov for six years but that, because she is not beautiful, he doesn’t notice her. Yelena volunteers to question Astrov and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he’s</b> in love with Sonya.

500|$|Three more Bonanno made {{men would}} choose to {{cooperate}} before Massino came to trial. The first was James Tartaglione; anticipating he would shortly be indicted as well {{he went to the}} FBI and agreed to wear a wire while he remained free. The second was Salvatore Vitale. In custody Massino again put out the word, to a receptive Bonanno family, that he wanted Vitale killed. After learning of Massino's earlier plans to kill his brother-in-law from Coppa and Cantarella, prosecutors informed Vitale. Vitale was already dissatisfied by the lack of support he and his family received from Massino after his arrest. On the day he was arraigned with Massino, Vitale decided to flip {{as soon as it was}} safe to do so; he formally reached a deal with prosecutors in February. He was followed in short order by Lino, knowing Vitale could implicate him in murder as well. [...] Also flipping was longtime Bonanno associate Duane Leisenheimer, concerned for his safety after an investigator for Massino's defense team visited to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> intended to flip.|$|E
2500|$|After a lackluster {{previous}} season, {{assistant coach}} Tanquingcen was named co-head coach of Ginebra, who coached alongside Uichico as head coach. After {{the news that}} Hatfield left the Kings due to personal matters, the team selected Reil Cervantes and James Martinez in the 2011 PBA draft, but only kept Cervantes due to the guard heavy roster. Helterbrand signed only a one– conference contract extension, due to his desire to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> [...] "still had it" [...] {{and if he does}} not, he announced that he would retire after the conference.|$|E

I just flipped over it and said, 'Please <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wants to work with me.'" [...] Ahmadzaï spoke little English, and Madonna commented: [...] "The first couple of days we were recording, I wanted to rip my hair out.

I just flipped over it and said, 'Please <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wants to work with me.'" [...] Ahmadzaï always preferred taking musical risks and hence he wanted the collaborations with Madonna to get out the best from the artist.

2500|$|Draper had to {{work very}} {{carefully}} in regards to venereal disease control, but other aspects of his tenure as Virginia's health commissioner worked very smoothly. [...] The state kept a close liaison with the Hygeneic Laboratory when problems arose which they could not handle, and the laboratory would sometimes send experts down to help them, {{and at other times}} Virginia would send its practitioners to the Hygeneic Laboratory for some brushing up or further training. [...] Draper's time as Virginia's Health Commissioner ended in 1934 {{when he returned to the}} headquarters of the Public Health Service. [...] One of the big initiatives within this organization in the next two years, spearheaded by Dr. Parran, was to bring the plight of venereal diseases into the public domain where it could be discussed and handled openly. [...] A humorous outcome of this occurred when Draper was selected to speak to a woman's organization, and he called the secretary of the group ahead of time to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could discuss venereal diseases.

They buried Leekie under their garage. This [...] "bonding" [...] helped to jump-start their relationship, giving it newfound passion, trust, and happiness.

60|$|He came forth {{into the}} flare--a tall, slim, dark-faced youth, wearing sombrero, blouse and trousers. Duane {{collared}} him {{before any of}} the others could move and held the gun close enough to make him shrink. But he did not impress Duane as being frightened just then; nevertheless, he had a clammy face, the pallid look {{of a man who had}} just gotten over a shock. He peered into Duane's face, then into that of the cowboy next to him, then into Lawson's, and if ever in Duane's life he beheld relief it was then.
