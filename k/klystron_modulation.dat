40|$|The {{proposed}} Next Linear Collider {{contains a}} large number of linac RF systems with new requirements for wideband <b>klystron</b> <b>modulation</b> and accurate RF vector detection. The system will be capable of automatically phasing each klystron and compensating for beam loading effects. Accelerator structure alignment is determined by detection of the beam induced dipole modes with a receiver similar to that used for measuring the accelerator RF and is incorporated into the RF system topology. This paper describes the proposed system design, signal processing techniques and includes preliminary test results. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} Next Linear Collider (NLC) contains linac systems {{operating at}} L,S,C, and X band. This paper describes a wideband modular low-level RF (LLRF) system applicable for all NLC pulsed RF systems. High speed digital IF techniques {{are used for}} both arbitrary <b>klystron</b> drive <b>modulation</b> and accurate RF vector detection. Measurement of relative beam to RF phase, beam loading compensation, and structure dipole modes for automated alignment are all handled by the system. Modern signal processing techniques are also described. 1...|$|R
40|$|The PEP-II B-factory has {{aggressive}} current increases {{planned for}} luminosity through 2008. At 2. 2 A (HER) on 4 A (LER) currents, {{we estimate that}} longitudinal growth rates will be comparable to the damping rates currently achieved in the existing low level RF and longitudinal feedback systems. Prior to having a good non-linear time domain model [1] it was postulated that klystron small signal gain non-linearity may be contributing to measured longitudinal growth rates being higher than linearly predicted growth rates. Five prototype <b>klystron</b> amplitude <b>modulation</b> linearizers {{have been developed to}} explore improved linearity in the LLRF system. The linearizers operate at 476 MHz with 15 dB dynamic range and 1 MHz linear control bandwidth. Results from lab measurements and high current beam tests are presented. Future development plans, conclusions from beam testing and ideas for future use of this linearization technique are presented...|$|R
50|$|Two {{differences}} from the klystron {{give it a}} lower cost and higher efficiency. First, the <b>klystron</b> uses velocity <b>modulation</b> to create bunching; its beam current is constant. It requires a drift tube several feet in length to allow the electrons to bunch. In contrast the IOT uses current modulation like an ordinary triode; most of the bunching {{is done by the}} grid, so the tube can be much shorter, making it less expensive to build and mount, and less bulky. Secondly, since the klystron has beam current throughout the RF cycle, it can only operate as an inefficient class-A amplifier, while the grid of the IOT allows more versatile operating modes. The grid can be biased so the beam current can be cut off during part of the cycle, enabling it to operate in the more efficient class B or AB mode.|$|R
