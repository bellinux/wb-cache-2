40|$|The vast {{majority}} of dynamical systems depend on system parameters. In this paper, we consider dynamical systems that arise from variation of two parameters within given parameter domains. Efficient adaptive methods for simultaneous simulation of such dynamical systems with parameter sets are presented. To enhance performance two key principles are introduced. Firstly, the principle of changing activity enables different states of activity for points of the parameter domain. And secondly, the principle of changing roles enables the usage of points of the parameter domain as mesh nodes, error grid points, and additional spare points in a flexible way. Various methods are tested on a model that describes the dynamics of a passenger vehicle. The model includes longitudinal and lateral motion as well as rotation around the vertical axis. As an example, the behaviour of the side slip angle is computed {{as a function of}} the vehicle mass and the height of the centre of gravity. The side slip angle is of special interest since it is an <b>indicator</b> <b>for</b> <b>vehicle</b> stability and thus passenger safety...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original time-sensitive traffic management application for road safety diagnosis in signalized intersections. Such applications require {{to deal with}} data streams that {{may be subject to}} concept drift over various time scales. The method for road safety analysis relies on the estimation of severity <b>indicators</b> <b>for</b> <b>vehicle</b> interactions based on complex and noisy spatial occupancy information. An expert provides imprecise labels based on video recordings of the traffic scenes. In order to improve the performance-overall and for each class-and the stability of learning in a stream, this paper presents new ensemble methods based on incremental algorithms that rely on their sensitivity to the processing order of instances. Different data selection criteria, many used in active learning methods, are studied in a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and the prediction of severity indicators. The best performance is obtained with a criterion that selects instances which are misclassified by the current hypothesis. The proposed ensemble methods using this criterion and AdaBoost have similar principles and performance, while the proposed methods have a smaller computational training cost...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modelling and simulation {{of a stable}} angle-based instability threat <b>indicator</b> <b>for</b> articulated off-road <b>vehicles.</b> First, a stable angle {{is represented by the}} vertical forces of four wheels and steering angle of an off-road articulated steer vehicle. Then a vehicle prototype model is built based on a specific wheel loader type and a tyre/terrain model. Finally, the prototype model and tyre/terrain model are imported to the multi-body dynamics analysis software-ADAMS to conduct a number of simulations using the stable angle-based instability threat indicator. Simulation results indicate that a stable angle of 80. 5 ° is the threshold angle for lateral instability, and a stable angle of 90 ° is the threshold angle for longitudinal instability of this model. Compared with the traditional instability indicating methods <b>for</b> off-road <b>vehicles,</b> the proposed stable angle-based method is more efficient and can deal with both lateral and longitudinal instability of an articulated vehicle effectively.

The paper uses original data from the 1989 / 91 National Travel Survey and identifies a method for incorporating a range of vehicle operating conditions into calculations of vehicle emissions and energy consumption for each journey recorded in the National Travel Survey data. The paper shows that travel distance is a reasonable proxy <b>for</b> <b>vehicle</b> energy consumption and emissions of most pollutants. Travel distance per person is therefore a simple and readily available environmental <b>indicator</b> <b>for</b> transport.

In this industrial sector, mixed-model assembly lines show very different capacity requirements according to the product because of high product variants and shifting product mixes. The main task of line balancing is to evenly utilize the line staff. Market requirements and process planning both influence the utilization of staff. Furthermore, peaks in capacity can be met by flexible use of employees. A system of key performance <b>indicators</b> <b>for</b> the evaluation of balanced lines in truck assembly is presented, where simulation software is necessary to include employee flexibility. ...|$|R
