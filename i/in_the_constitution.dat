5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E

5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right.
