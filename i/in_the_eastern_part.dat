5|$|In 1942, {{fighting}} with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH governments were aware of this danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E
5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group.

5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding struck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> {{of the state and}} in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E
5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH. The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their {{appearance on the}} Bosnian-Serbian border area. The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated {{in the autumn of}} 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and {{due to the lack of}} other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{indigenous peoples}} traveled through Oklahoma {{as early as}} the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita, Kichai, Teyas, Escanjaques, and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern Plains Villagers lived in the central and west of the state, with a subgroup, the Panhandle culture people living in panhandle region. Caddoan Mississippian culture peoples lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> of the state. Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, was a major Mississippian mound complex that flourished between AD 850 and 1450.|$|E

With a {{population}} of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is also worth noting most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors {{as a result of}} wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E

5|$|Kingston Road was {{formerly}} Ontario Highway 2, {{and was the}} main highway through Scarborough until {{the building of the}} Highway 401, which runs east-west across the middle of Scarborough, with six to eight lanes in each direction. The short, minor freeway Highway 2A runs parallel to Lake Ontario <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> of Scarborough. In the 1960s, Metropolitan Toronto planned to build a second east-west highway across Scarborough. It was intended to link Highway 2A with an eastern extension of the Gardiner Expressway. The highway, known as the Scarborough Expressway, was cancelled due to public opposition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{changes were}} {{occurring}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> of Jefferson County. The portion of highway from Ryan {{east to the}} Love County line {{was removed from the}} highway system on December 31, 1937. As a result, SH-32 was discontiguous; one section stretched from Davidson to Ryan, while another began at a spur ending at the Jefferson–Love county line and continued east from there. The portion of SH-32 concurrent with US-81 between Waurika and Ryan, once necessary to connect to the now-decommissioned road, was removed on February 24, 1938. Both of these sections of road were reinstated as part of SH-32 on February 29, 1944.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} Portuguese {{settlement}} efforts was launched {{for the purpose}} of territorial conquest. It is true that both gradually came to occupy and farm a broad area around their initial bridgeheads (in the case of Luanda, mostly along the lower Kwanza River). However, their main function was trade – overwhelmingly the slave trade. Slaves were bought from African intermediaries and sold to Brazil and the Caribbean. In addition, Benguela developed a commerce in ivory, wax, and honey, which they bought from Ovimbundu caravans which fetched these goods from among the Ganguela peoples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> of what is now Angola.|$|E
