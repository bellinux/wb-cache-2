40|$|Onboard {{radioisotope}} {{power systems}} being developed and planned for NASA's deep-space missions require reliable design lifetimes {{of up to}} 14 yr. The structurally critical <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> of the high-efficiency Stirling power convertor has undergone extensive computational analysis of operating temperatures, stresses, and creep resistance of the thin-walled Inconel 718 bill of material. A preliminary assessment {{of the effect of}} uncertainties in the material behavior was also performed. Creep failure resistance of the thin-walled <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> could show variation due to small deviations in the manufactured thickness and in uncertainties in operating temperature and pressure. Durability prediction and reliability of the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> are affected by these deviations from nominal design conditions. Therefore, it is important to include the effects of these uncertainties in predicting the probability of survival of the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> under mission loads. Furthermore, it may be possible for the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> to experience rare incidences of small temperature excursions of short duration. These rare incidences would affect the creep strain rate and, therefore, the life. This paper addresses the effects of such rare incidences on the reliability. In addition, the sensitivities of variables affecting the reliability are quantified, and guidelines developed to improve the reliability are outlined. <b>Heater</b> <b>head</b> reliability is being quantified with data from NASA Glenn Research Center's accelerated benchmark testing program...|$|R

Various mechanisms contributing to incompatibility between materials are identified and discussed. Large thermal gradients, coupled with requirements for long life (60, 000 h at temperature) {{and a large number}} of heatup and cooldown cycles (20, 000) drive the design from a structural standpoint. The pressurized cylinder is checked for creep rupture, localized yielding, reverse plasticity, creep and fatigue damage, and creep ratcheting, in addition to the basic requirements for bust and proof pressure.

40|$|Free-piston Stirling convertors are {{fundamental}} {{to the development of}} NASA s next generation of radioisotope power system, the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG). The ASRG will use General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules as the energy source and Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASCs) to convert heat into electrical energy, and is being developed by Lockheed Martin under contract to the Department of Energy. Achieving flight status mandates that the ASCs satisfy design as well as flight requirements to ensure reliable operation during launch. To meet these launch requirements, GRC performed a series of quasi-static mechanical tests simulating the pressure, thermal, and external loading conditions that will be experienced by an ASC E 2 <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> assembly. These mechanical tests were collectively referred to as lateral load tests since a primary external load lateral to the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> longitudinal axis was applied in combination with the other loading conditions. The <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> was subjected to the operational pressure, axial mounting force, thermal conditions, and axial and lateral launch vehicle acceleration loadings. To permit reliable prediction of the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> s structural performance, GRC completed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) computer modeling for the stress, strain, and deformation that will result during launch. The <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> lateral load test directly supported evaluation of the analysis and validation of the design to meet launch requirements.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has {{identified}} high efficiency Stirling technology for potential use on long duration Space Science missions such as Mars rovers, deep space missions, and lunar applications. For the long life times required, a structurally significant design limit for the Stirling convertor <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> is creep deformation induced even under relatively low stress levels at high material temperatures. Conventional investigations of creep behavior adequately rely on experimental results from uniaxial creep specimens, and much creep data {{is available for}} the proposed Inconel- 718 (IN- 718) and MarM- 247 nickel-based superalloy materials of construction. However, very little experimental creep information is available that directly applies to the atypical thin walls, the specific microstructures, and the low stress levels. In addition, the geometry and loading conditions apply multiaxial stress states on the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> components, far from the conditions of uniaxial testing.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy is {{planning}} to develop the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for potential use on future space missions. The ASRG provides substantial efficiency and specific power improvements over radioisotope power systems of heritage designs. The ASRG would use General Purpose Heat Source modules as energy sources and the free-piston Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC) to convert heat into electrical energy. Lockheed Martin Corporation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is integrating the ASRG systems, and Sunpower, Inc., of Athens, Ohio, is designing and building the ASC. NASA Glenn Research Center of Cleveland, Ohio, manages the Sunpower contract and provides technology development in several areas for the ASC. One area is reliability assessment for the ASC <b>heater</b> <b>head,</b> a critical pressure vessel within which heat is converted into mechanical oscillation of a displacer piston. For high system efficiency, the ASC <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> operates at very high temperature (850 C) and therefore is fabricated from an advanced heat-resistant nickel-based superalloy Microcast MarM- 247. Since use of MarM- 247 in a thin-walled pressure vessel is atypical, much effort is required {{to assure that the}} system will operate reliably for its design life of 17 years. One life-limiting structural response for this application is creep; creep deformation is the accumulation of time-dependent inelastic strain under sustained loading over time. If allowed to progress, the deformation eventually results in creep rupture. Since creep material properties are not available in the open literature, a detailed creep life assessment of the ASC <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> effort is underway. This paper presents an overview of that creep life assessment approach, including the reliability-based creep criteria developed from coupon testing, and the associated <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> deterministic and probabilistic analyses. The approach also includes direct benchmark experimental creep assessment. This element provides high-fidelity creep testing of prototypical <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> test articles to investigate the relevant material issues and multiaxial stress state. Benchmark testing provides required data to evaluate the complex life assessment methodology and to validate that analysis. Results from current benchmark <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> tests and newly developed experimental methods are presented. In the concluding remarks, the test results are shown to compare favorably with the creep strain predictions and are the first experimental evidence for a robust ASC <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> creep life...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has {{identified}} the high efficiency Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) {{as a candidate}} power source for use on long duration Science missions such as lunar applications, Mars rovers, and deep space missions. For the inherent long life times required, a structurally significant design limit for the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> component of the ASRG Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC) is creep deformation induced at low stress levels and high temperatures. Demonstrating proof of adequate margins on creep deformation and rupture for the operating conditions and the MarM- 247 material of construction is a challenge that the NASA Glenn Research Center is addressing. The combined analytical and experimental program ensures integrity and high reliability of the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> for its 17 -year design life. The life assessment approach starts with an extensive series of uniaxial creep tests on thin MarM- 247 specimens that comprise the same chemistry, microstructure, and heat treatment processing as the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> itself. This effort addresses a scarcity of openly available creep properties for the material {{as well as for}} the virtual absence of understanding of the effect on creep properties due to very thin walls, fine grains, low stress levels, and high-temperature fabrication steps. The approach continues with a considerable analytical effort, both deterministically to evaluate the median creep life using nonlinear finite element analysis, and probabilistically to calculate the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> s reliability to a higher degree. Finally, the approach includes a substantial structural benchmark creep testing activity to calibrate and validate the analytical work. This last element provides high fidelity testing of prototypical <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> test articles; the testing includes the relevant material issues and the essential multiaxial stress state, and applies prototypical and accelerated temperature profiles for timely results in a highly controlled laboratory environment. This paper focuses on the last element and presents a preliminary methodology for creep rate prediction, the experimental methods, test challenges, and results from benchmark testing of a trial MarM- 247 <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> test article. The results compare favorably with the analytical strain predictions. A description of other test findings is provided, and recommendations for future test procedures are suggested.

Conventional investigations of creep behavior adequately rely on experimental results from uniaxial creep specimens, and a wealth of creep data is available for the Inconel 718 material of construction.

40|$|WhisperGenTM <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> {{components}} are currently machined from the {{austenitic stainless steel}} Sandvik 253 MA. The inner surface of the <b>heater</b> <b>heads</b> is subjected to the working gas of the engine, which is a high-pressure, high-temperature nitrogen-based environment with carbonaceous impurities. As {{a result of this}} exposure, a scale forms during operation and eventually spalls. This spalled scale causes abrasive damage to piston seals and guides, which leads to pressure loss and eventual failure of the engine. The aim of the present work was to compare the performance of the austenitic alloy 253 MA with two alternative alloys, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310, thereby enabling a material recommendation. A literature review provided information about many general aspects of high temperature corrosion in similar alloys. However, little was found about the application of these alloys in environments similar to those experienced by a WhisperGenTM <b>heater</b> <b>head.</b> Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to indicate the relative performance characteristics of the three potential alloys (253 MA, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310). To overcome the difficulties with testing at high temperatures and pressures, Thermo-Calc™ was used to calculate gas mixtures at 1 bar that approximated the chemical potentials of carbon and nitrogen in the working gas at 24 bar. Comparisons of the different materials were made via weight loss/gain measurements and metallographic analysis, which included optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray mapping and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). The laboratory test sample results were also compared with results from <b>heater</b> <b>heads</b> of the same materials that were run in an actual WhisperGenTM engine. The experimental results taken in total indicate that 253 MA is the least suitable alloy for the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> application because it exhibited poor spalling performance, internal oxidation and formation of a large amount of Cr 23 C 6. AISI 310 was shown in all cases to develop the detrimental sigma phase, although this alloy was the least susceptible to internal oxidation.

Materials requirements for the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> include compatibility with hydrogen, resistance to hydrogen permeation, high temperature oxidation/corrosion resistance, and high temperature creep-rupture and fatigue properties. A materials research and technology program identified the wrought alloys CG- 27 and 12 RN 72 and the cast alloys XF- 818, NASAUT 4 G-A 1, and NASACC- 1 as candidate replacements for the cobalt containing alloys used in current prototype engines. It is concluded that manufacture of the engine is feasible from low cost iron-base alloys rather than the cobalt alloys used in prototype engines. Results of research that lead to this conclusion are presented...|$|R
40|$|The heater (or acceptor) of a Stirling engine, {{where most}} of the thermal energy is {{accepted}} into the engine by heat transfer, is the hottest part of the engine. Almost as hot is the adjacent expansion space of the engine. In the expansion space, the flow is oscillatory, impinging on a two-dimensional concavely-curved surface. Knowing the heat transfer on the inside surface of the engine head is critical to the engine design for efficiency and reliability. However, the flow in this region is not well understood and support is required to develop the CFD codes needed to design modern Stirling engines of high efficiency and power output. The present project is to experimentally investigate the flow and heat transfer in the <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> region. Flow fields and heat transfer coefficients are measured to characterize the oscillatory flow as well as to supply experimental validation for the CFD Stirling engine design codes. Presented also is a discussion of how these results might be used for <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> and acceptor region design calculations...|$|R
40|$|A 1 kW single {{cylinder}} free piston Stirling engine, configured {{as a research}} engine, was tested with helium working gas. The engine features a posted displacer and dashpot load. The test results show the engine power output and efficiency to be lower than those observed during acceptance tests by the manufacturer. Engine tests results are presented for operation at the two <b>heater</b> <b>head</b> temperatures and with two regenerator porosities, along with flow test results for the heat exchangers...|$|R
50|$|Infrared fusion (IR) is {{a process}} similar to CBF except that the {{component}} ends never touch the <b>heater</b> <b>head.</b> Instead, the energy to melt the thermoplastic is transferred by radiant heat. IR comes in two variations; one uses overlap distance when bringing the two components together while the other uses pressure. The use of overlap in the former reduces the variation seen in bead size, meaning that precise dimensional tolerances needed for industrial installations can be maintained better.|$|R
