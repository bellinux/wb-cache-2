40|$|The unusual wetting {{phenomenon}} of liquid Bi on surface-porous copper has been studied. A porous layer was prepared {{at the surface}} of a copper substrate and the wetting behavior of liquid Bi on this layer was investigated and compared with that on a flat solid copper substrate. A surface-oxidized copper substrate was reduced at 473 K in H 2 to prepare a porous layer at the surface. Since the contact angle of liquid Bi on the flat solid copper substrate was gradually declining with increasing temperature, the behavior of liquid Bi on solid copper was shown to have good-wettability. In addition, the unusual wetting behavior of liquid Bi was observed on surface-porous copper substrate. This result is evidence that the pores in the porous layer are 3 -dimensionally inter-connected. This usual wetting {{phenomenon of}} liquid Bi was then applied in the <b>joining</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>wire</b> with the surface-porous copper substrate. Bonding was successfully achieved with a minimized weld overlay at the joining point. [doi: 10. 2320 /matertrans. MRA 2007179...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{mechanical}} strength of different joints made by conventional brazing, TIG and laser welding with and without filling material. Five standardized <b>joining</b> configurations <b>of</b> orthodontic <b>wire</b> in spring hard quality were used: round, cross, 3 mm length, 9 mm length and 7 mm to orthodontic band. The joints were made by five different methods: brazing, tungsten inert gas (TIG) and laser welding with and without filling material. For the original orthodontic wire and for each kind of joint configuration or connecting method 10 specimens were carefully produced, totalizing 240. The fracture strengths were measured with a universal testing machine (Zwick 005). Data were analyzed by ANOVA (p= 0. 05) and Bonferroni post hoc test (p= 0. 05). In all cases, brazing joints were ruptured on a low level of fracture strength (186 - 407 N). Significant differences between brazing and TIG or laser welding (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni post hoc test) were found in each joint configuration. The highest fracture strength means were observed for laser welding with filling material and 3 mm joint length (998 N). Using filling materials, there was a clear tendency to higher mean values of fracture strength in TIG and laser welding. However, statistically significant differences were found only in the 9 -mm long joints (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni post hoc test). In conclusion, the fracture strength of welded joints was positively influenced by the additional use of filling material. TIG welding was comparable to laser welding except for the impossibility <b>of</b> <b>joining</b> orthodontic <b>wire</b> with orthodontic band...|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} the term [...] "mobile" [...] as applied to {{sculpture}} has evolved since it was first suggested by Marcel Duchamp in 1931 to describe the early, mechanized creations of Alexander Calder. [...] At this point, [...] "mobile" [...] was synonymous with the term [...] "kinetic art", describing sculptural works in which motion is a defining property. While motor or crank-driven moving sculptures may have initially prompted it, the word [...] "mobile" [...] later came to refer more specifically to Calder's free-moving creations. Influenced by the abstract work of Piet Mondrian, Joan Miró and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Calder in many respects invented an art form where objects (typically brightly coloured, abstract shapes fashioned from sheet metal) are connected by wire much like a balance scale. By the sequential attachment of additional objects, the final creation consists of many balanced parts <b>joined</b> by lengths <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> whose individual elements are capable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Thus, [...] "mobile" [...] has become a more well-defined term with its origin in the many such hanging constructs Calder produced in a prolific manner between the 1930s until his death in 1976.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} self-producing heat and {{external}} radiation on the insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> are studied experimentally in this paper. In the experiments of self-producing heat <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> 6 types <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes to characterise residential power line configurations {{and to determine}} the extent to which wire codes provide a proxy measure of residential magnetic field strength in a case-control study of childhood leukaemia conducted in nine states within the United States. METHODS: Misclassification <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0. 89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on <b>wire</b> codes because <b>of</b> misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code range. The lack of an association between high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area...|$|R
