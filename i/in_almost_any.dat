5|$|The superb fairy-wren can {{be found}} <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> area that has {{at least a little}} dense {{undergrowth}} for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. The superb fairy-wren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, {{as well as in}} meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that the court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> case.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} industrial {{enterprises in}} Arkhangelsk Oblast are shipyards in Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk (including Sevmash), {{pulp and paper}} mills in Koryazhma and Novodvinsk, and bauxite extraction plant <b>in</b> Severoonezhsk. <b>Almost</b> <b>any</b> town has some timber works.|$|R
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> theory, <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> {{material}} {{may be used}} {{to construct}} regular polyhedra. Instructions for building origami models may be found [...] , for example. They may be carved out of wood, modeled out of wire, formed from stained glass. The imagination is the limit.|$|R

50|$|<b>In</b> fact, <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> palo can be sung unaccompanied, {{especially}} in private juergas (parties), {{where there is}} often no guitarist available. Even in professional settings, some palos which are normally accompanied by the guitar, like seguiriya, bulerías, or even soleá, are sometimes heard 'a palo seco'.|$|R
25|$|A new {{wind energy}} {{technology}} is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity. This energy, called Vibro-Wind technology, can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines, and can be placed <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> location.|$|E
25|$|Volcanoes {{are present}} <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> {{mountain}} belt, {{but this does}} not make it a volcanic arc. Often there are isolated, but impressively huge volcanoes in a mountain belt. For instance, Vesuvius and the Etna volcanoes in Italy are part of separate but different kinds of mountainous volcanic ensembles.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{originally}} for velocity measurements {{in medical}} applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) can measure {{in real time}} complete velocity profile <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions. Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient. This technique is fully non-invasive.|$|E
50|$|Pikuach Nefesh (Hebrew: פיקוח נפש) {{describes}} the principle in Jewish law that {{the preservation of}} human life overrides virtually any other religious consideration. When {{the life of a}} specific person is <b>in</b> danger, <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> mitzvah lo ta'aseh (command to not do an action) of the Torah becomes inapplicable.|$|R
50|$|Regulatory {{provisions}} in the US, EU and elsewhere {{is in a state}} of flux, continuously being challenged by developments <b>in</b> technology; thus <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> regulation stated here exists in a tentative format.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} is frequent in the Goidelic languages (Scottish Gaelic, Irish, and Manx), {{much more so}} than in English, and can be used in ways that would be ambiguous or ungrammatical <b>in</b> English: <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> element of a sentence can be clefted. This sometimes carries over into the local varieties of English (Highland English, Lowland Scots, Scottish English, Hiberno-English).|$|R
25|$|Hoverfly mimics {{can be seen}} <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> {{garden in}} the {{temperate}} zone. The Syrphidae are a large (5600+ species) family of flies; their imagoes feed on nectar and pollen, and are well known for their mimicry of social hymenoptera. The mimicry is Batesian in nature: hoverflies are palatable but hymenoptera are generally unpalatable and may also be protected by stingers and/or armour.|$|E
25|$|Larval {{stages of}} the Chironomidae can be found <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> aquatic or semiaquatic habitat, {{including}} treeholes, bromeliads, rotting vegetation, soil, and in sewage and artificial containers. They form an important fraction of the macrozoobenthos of most freshwater ecosystems. They are often associated with degraded or low-biodiversity ecosystems because some species have adapted to virtually anoxic conditions and are dominant in polluted waters.|$|E
25|$|Portland cement {{is a basic}} {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout. The most common use for Portland cement is {{in the production of}} concrete. Concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water. As a construction material, concrete can be cast <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> shape desired, and once hardened, can become a structural (load bearing) element. Portland cement may be grey or white.|$|E
5000|$|Through 1992, {{the focus}} of MicroMUSE {{continued}} to change, though not very noticeably to existing users. New users were given a smaller [...] "quota" [...] of object which they could build. The game was extremely popular at this point. One could log <b>in</b> at <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> time of day, and find at least thirty active people.|$|R
5000|$|Row covers: Light fabric {{placed over}} plants retains heat and can offer {{up to several}} degrees of frost protection. <b>In</b> smaller gardens <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> type of cover, {{including}} newspaper cones, miscellaneous bits of plastic, etc., can serve the same purpose.|$|R
5|$|Paris and Île-de-France {{are central}} regions where almost {{anything}} from the country is available, as all train lines meet in the city. Over 9,000 restaurants exist <b>in</b> Paris and <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> cuisine can be obtained here. High-quality Michelin Guide-rated restaurants proliferate here.|$|R
25|$|Smog {{can form}} <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> climate where {{industries}} or cities release {{large amounts of}} air pollution, such as smoke or gases. However, it is worse during periods of warmer, sunnier weather when the upper air is warm enough to inhibit vertical circulation. It is especially prevalent in geologic basins encircled by hills or mountains. It often stays {{for an extended period}} of time over densely populated cities or urban areas, and can build up to dangerous levels.|$|E
25|$|His one {{taste of}} Test cricket {{came on the}} 1951/52 tour to India. Poole, who had {{replaced}} Jack Ikin because of injury, played three times for what was, in effect, an England second eleven, scoring two fifties. He was never picked for England again, his batting defensive frailities counting against him, though he continued in county cricket until 1962, and had his best season {{at the age of}} 40. He was an outstanding fielder <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> position.|$|E
25|$|Pacific {{coast of}} South America. This species {{apparently}} has no close living relatives. It has a highly apomorphic colour pattern: naked red base of bill, red feet, {{and a white}} neck spot, and it is crestless. It seems to be convergent in some aspects with the punctatus superspecies. What seems sure is that this species must {{be placed in a}} distinct monotypic genus Poikilocarbo <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> case, if any species are split from Phalacrocorax at all.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drug policy}} in Glynn County, Georgia was {{established}} by Amanda F. Williams, chief judge of the Glynn County Superior Court. She {{had been on the}} bench since 1991, and started the drug court <b>in</b> 1998. By <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> standard, the program is [...]|$|R

5000|$|Today a {{crossing}} of the Aiguilles du Diable is usually done as a rock climbing tour, which, <b>in</b> summer, avoids <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> contact with snow. The overall difficulty is assessed as [...] "difficult" [...] on the SAC scale and climbing grade V+ on the UIAA scale.|$|R
25|$|The {{education}} {{period is}} five years (one year German preparatory, and four year high school). The German Abitur {{has been offered}} at İstanbul Lisesi since 2002. The Abitur diploma permits successful students the admission to any German university <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> faculty. All science and mathematics courses {{in the last two}} years are at Abitur level. İstanbul Lisesi has a very strong academic record, with a high proportion of its students proceeding to prominent universities in Turkey, Germany, Austria and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust {{alternative}} to brass. Plastic instruments could come <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> colour. The sound plastic instruments produce {{is different from the}} one of brass, lacquer, gold or silver. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{probability}} distribution and the random variables which they describe underlies the mathematical discipline of probability theory, and the science of statistics. There is spread or variability <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> value that {{can be measured in}} a population (e.g. height of people, durability of a metal, sales growth, traffic flow, etc.); almost all measurements are made with some intrinsic error; in physics many processes are described probabilistically, from the kinetic properties of gases to the quantum mechanical description of fundamental particles. For these and many other reasons, simple numbers are often inadequate for describing a quantity, while probability distributions are often more appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Shigeru Katagiri {{and various}} co-authors have (re) {{introduced}} a nonstandard error mea-sure {{which can be}} used <b>in</b> training <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> classifier. This measure is usually called MCE for Minimum Classification Error, and is often coupled with an equally nonstan-dard technique, known as GPD for Generalized Probabilistic Descent, for updating the classifier’s parameters due to the error. In the present paper, we will present this measure and technique, and describe its use in speech recognition applications. ...|$|R
5000|$|A 'breeder' {{is simply}} a reactor {{designed}} for very high neutron economy with an associated conversion rate higher than 1.0. <b>In</b> principle, <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> reactor design could possibly be tweaked to become a breeder. An example {{of this process is}} the evolution of the Light Water Reactor, a very heavily moderated thermal design, into the Super Fast Reactor [...] concept, using light water in an extremely low-density supercritical form to increase the neutron economy high enough to allow breeding.|$|R
50|$|Various molds {{came with}} the kit. Several {{expansion}} kits were also available for molding various other shapes. <b>In</b> actual use <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> small object that could withstand {{the temperature of the}} heated plastic sheet for a few seconds {{could be used as a}} mold. Plastic refill sheets came in a variety of colors.|$|R
