5|$|Jelena Balšić {{was praised}} as an {{extraordinary}} woman who preserved {{the power of}} the Balšić family during a very turbulent period. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> she had a strong personality probably similar to her mother, Princess Milica of Serbia. She managed to maintain the cultural heritage of the Kingdom of Serbia, and her writing has been evaluated highly.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Cowper {{took the}} pages {{into his hand}} with a benevolent smile. At the first glance, however, his {{expression}} changed. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> greatly interested. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious,</b> also, <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> correspondingly surprised.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} her deliberately; it <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> speaking the truth.|$|R
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies {{at the expense of}} smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at {{a lower level of}} development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in any danger, he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and {{is in danger of}} being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Paul and Kim manage to stop Amy and Leo from consummating their relationship. David bonds with Paul soon after, {{although}} Leo stays away from him due to their business rivalry, but eventually comes to accept Paul as his father. Paul tries to pursue a relationship with Terese, but she rejects him and later gets engaged to Gary. After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and he does his best to support her. However, once it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> her chemotherapy is not working, Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre in the premises. Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes it clear that she and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E

25|$|From {{the above}} it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that,</b> {{provided}} {{that a given}} content can belong to many groups (each possibly defined by distinctive qualities), {{it is possible that}} many CRIDs carry the same content. That is, several CRIDs may be resolved into the same locator.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} the atomists {{appears to be more}} nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other theory of antiquity. However, the {{similarity}} with modern concepts of science can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> classical atomists would never have had a solid empirical basis for modern concepts of atoms and molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 1945, the First Bulgarian Army {{is engaged in}} the battles for the liberation of Hungary from the Nazis during the Second World War. Three men are sent to join the army. At first glance it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they are {{completely}} unprepared and without {{a clear idea of}} warfare. They are laughable with their inability to cope with their tasks.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} encounter, the Battle of Satala, the Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife. Detailed {{descriptions}} of the dispositions of the two armies have not survived, but it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the Roman army caught the Persians unprepared whilst encamped. Presumably, the active aid of the local Armenian population allowed the Romans to approach and trap the Persians without being detected.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> if {{we could}} find {{characters}} or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters insofar as {{they are subject to}} reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>obvious,</b> <b>that,</b> if the {{citizens}} of each state were to be deemed aliens to each other, they could not take, or hold real estate, or other privileges, except as other aliens. The intention of this clause was to confer on them, if one may so say, a general citizenship; and to communicate all the privileges and immunities, which {{the citizens}} of the same state would be entitled to under the like circumstances.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} popular music played in Cuba after the Spanish conquest was {{brought by the}} Spanish conquerors themselves, and was most likely {{borrowed}} from the Spanish popular music in vogue during the 16th century. From the 16th to the 18th century some danceable songs that emerged in Spain were associated to Hispanic America, or considered as been originated in America. Some of these songs with picturesque names such as Sarabande, Chaconne, Zambapalo, Retambico and Gurrumbé, among others, shared a common trait, its characteristic rhythm called Hemiola or Sesquiáltera (in Spain).|$|E
25|$|Basis risk {{is a major}} {{disadvantage}} of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk {{is a direct result}} of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> high basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} {{son of the}} late King Magnus III of Sweden (1240–90), Valdemar (1280s-1318), was given his late uncle Benedict's Duchy of Finland at the coronation of his eldest brother King Birger of Sweden in 1302. Valdemar's elder brother Duke Eric in the 1310s was establishing a truly independent principality in Western Sweden, Duke Valdemar being his ally. There {{is no evidence that}} Duke Valdemar succeeded in having as independent a position as Eric, but it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> Valdemar used his ducal revenues to assist Eric's campaign against the King and kept his Finnish appanage and administration under Eric instead of the King.|$|E
