The Network Rail team which {{worked on the}} line was {{essentially the same as}} the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of <b>engineering</b> <b>support,</b> for £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no US ground forces under MacArthur's command in action against the Japanese, and the task of {{securing}} Finschhafen was allocated to Australian troops from the 9th Division. A veteran formation of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), the 9th Division was vastly experienced, having fought in the North African campaign, where it had held Tobruk against a German onslaught earlier in the war and had been heavily engaged at the First and Second Battle of El Alamein. In early 1943, the division had been brought back to Australia, and it had subsequently been reorganised {{to take part in}} jungle warfare. With an establishment of 13,118men, the division consisted of three brigades of infantry– the 20th, 24th and 26th– each consisting of three battalions, along with organic battalion-level engineer, pioneer, artillery, and armoured formations attached at divisional level. In support of the 9th Division, Militia infantry units from the 4th Brigade would also take part in the fighting after the initial fighting. American forces would also be involved, mainly providing logistical, naval and <b>engineering</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dunning {{remained}} in charge at Columbia until 1 May 1943, when the Manhattan District {{took over the}} contract. By this time Slack's group had nearly 50 members. His was the largest group, and it {{was working on the}} most challenging problem: the design of a suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in the other five groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, <b>engineering</b> <b>support.</b> The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put in charge, with Dunning becoming head of one of its divisions. It would remain this way until 1 March 1945, when the SAM Laboratories were taken over by Union Carbide.|$|E

25|$|Other {{aerospace}} companies challenged that TRW's Air Force advisory role granted it unfair {{access to}} its competitors' technology, and in September 1959 the United States Congress issued a report recommending that STL be converted to a non-profit organization.

25|$|Naming {{conventions}} of units differ for traditional British historical reasons, creating a significant opportunity for confusion; an infantry battalion {{is equivalent to}} a cavalry regiment. An infantry regiment is an administrative and ceremonial organisation only, and may include several battalions. For operational tasks, a battle group will be formed around a combat unit, supported by units or sub-units from other areas. An example would be a squadron of tanks attached to an armoured infantry battle group, together with a reconnaissance troop, artillery battery and <b>engineering</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
