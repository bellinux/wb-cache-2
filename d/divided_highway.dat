5|$|Expansion of US 113 to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> slowed in the 1970s. As {{with most}} major highway projects, the <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act.

However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> from Milford to Little Heaven.

5|$|Expansion of US113 to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> {{began in}} the 1950s in Dover. Much of the {{remainder}} of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US113 in Maryland to be expanded to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become US113Business. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane <b>divided</b> <b>highway.</b> US113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, MD 5 was rerouted {{to follow}} Branch Avenue to the Washington, D.C. border, {{replacing}} MD 637; MD 637 was designated onto Naylor Road between MD 5 and the Washington, D.C. border by 1966. In addition, the route was widened into a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> along the US 301 concurrency between the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB and along Branch Avenue between {{south of the}} Henson Creek and the Washington, D.C. border. MD 5 was upgraded from a bituminous to a paved road between St. Mary's City and Great Mills in 1953. The same year, the portion of route along the US 301 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border was widened into a <b>divided</b> <b>highway.</b> MD 5 was relocated to a new alignment to the east between TB and north of Camp Springs in 1956, with a northward extension of MD 381 designated onto the former alignment. This section of MD 381, called Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue, was transferred to county maintenance in 1965. In 1959, MD 5 was paved between south of St. Inigoes and St. Mary's City. A year later, {{the remainder of the}} route south to Point Lookout was paved. In 1962, MD 5 was widened into a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> between south of Newmarket and the St. Mary's-Charles county border and between MD 223 in Clinton and Camp Springs. An interchange was built at the northern terminus of the US 301 concurrency in 1963. The route was upgraded to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> in the Beantown area in 1964. In 1965, MD 5 was improved to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> between MD 235 and south of Newmarket. The <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> was extended south from Beantown to the MD 488 intersection in 1966.

MD 2/MD 4 was widened to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> between Huntingtown and the split in Sunderland in 1967. The <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> was extended to south of Huntingtown in 1969, bypassing Huntingtown to the east. The former alignment through the community became MD 524. In 1970, MD 2/MD 4 became a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> between Prince Frederick and south of Huntingtown. In January 1978, MD 4 was rerouted north of Solomons onto the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge over the Patuxent River.

MD 2/MD 4 was shifted west to a new <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> between south of St. Leonard to Port Republic in 1981, with the former two-lane routing designated part of MD 765.

The first segment of the original DuPont Highway south of Dover to be expanded to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> was from Walnut Street {{at the north end of}} Milford to south of Frederica; the southbound roadway of the <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> section was constructed between 1957 and 1959.

The Frederica bypass was constructed as a four-lane <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> between 1963 and 1965. US 113 was expanded to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> from just north of the Maryland state line in Selbyville to DE 20 north of Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967. The highway's second carriageway was built from north of Dagsboro to Stockley between 1966 and 1968. US 113 was completed as a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> from Stockley to Bedford Street on the northern edge of Georgetown in 1969.

5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further movement toward <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane <b>divided</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the <b>divided</b> <b>highway</b> south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state.
