40|$|The {{toxicity}} and metabolism of <b>isofenphos</b> and bendiocarb {{were compared}} between southern corn rootworm (SCR) adults and larvae. In the toxicity tests, insecticide solutions were applied topically on the ventral abdomen, and the LD(, 50) values were determined after mortality was evaluated 48 h posttreatment. <b>Isofenphos</b> {{and three of}} its metabolites (<b>isofenphos</b> oxon, des-N-isopropyl <b>isofenphos,</b> and des-N-isopropyl <b>isofenphos</b> oxon) were 2. 5 to 3. 6 times less toxic to SCR larvae than to adults. The 48 -h topical LD(, 50) values ranged from 1. 7 to 2. 7 (mu) g/g for adults, and 5. 9 to 8. 2 (mu) g/g for larvae. Bendiocarb was approximately seven times less toxic to SCR larvae than to adults. The 48 -h topical LD(, 50) values of bendiocarb to SCR adults and larvae were 1. 3 and 9. 1 (mu) g/g, respectively;In the metabolism studies, SCR adults and larvae were analyzed at specific time intervals after treatment with a (2 ̆ 714) C-labeled insecticide solution at sublethal dosage levels, at the LD(, 10) dosage for <b>isofenphos,</b> and at the 1 / 10 LD(, 50) dosage for bendiocarb. Most of the (2 ̆ 714) C was recovered from internal organic extract and container rinse fractions;The proposed major metabolic pathway of <b>isofenphos</b> in SCR included oxidative desulfuration of <b>isofenphos</b> to <b>isofenphos</b> oxon, hydrolysis of <b>isofenphos</b> oxon and/or parent <b>isofenphos</b> to isopropyl salicylate, and conjugation of isopropyl salicylate. <b>Isofenphos</b> penetrated approximately three times faster into larvae than into adults. Less accumulation of toxic compounds inside the larvae, however, resulted from a faster metabolism (1. 5 x) and rapid elimination of toxic parent <b>isofenphos.</b> Less internal toxic compound in SCR larvae may explain partially the lower <b>isofenphos</b> toxicity for larvae;The proposed major metabolic pathways of bendiocarb in SCR are hydrolysis of the carbamate ester bond to yield bendiocarb phenol and the subsequent conjugation of bendiocarb phenol. The major metabolites from bendiocarb were beniocarb phenol and conjugated compounds for SCR adults and larvae, respectively. For bendiocarb, the ratio of applied dose to internal toxic compound was similar to both adults and larvae. Therefore, the amount of internal toxic dose, affected by the rates of penetration, metabolism, and excretion, was not a determining factor in the selective toxicity of bendiocarb between SCR adults and larvae...|$|E

Enhanced degradation in the phenomenon whereby a soil-applied insecticide is rapidly degraded by populations of soil microorganisms previously exposed to it or a similar insecticide. A laboratory methodology was employed in these studies;The enhanced degradation of <b>isofenphos</b> was investigated in soil in order to elucidate the chemistry and microbiology of this phenomenon. <b>Isofenphos</b> was most rapidly degraded in Iowa cornfield soils that had a history of <b>isofenphos</b> insecticide use. Between 13 and 42 % of an applied dose of 5 ppm remained as <b>isofenphos</b> after 4 weeks in soil with <b>isofenphos</b> use history, whereas between 63 and 75 % remained incomparable nonhistory soils. Soils with enhanced <b>isofenphos</b> degradation contained an adapted population of soil microorganisms responsible for its degradation. Degradation products of <b>isofenphos</b> detected in cultures of adapted soil microorganisms included isopropyl salicylate, CO[subscript] 2, and polar products;The specificity of enhanced degradation within the organophosphorus insecticide class was investigated. The degradation rates and product distributions of chloropyrifos, fonofos, ethoprop, terbufos, and phorate were not dramatically altered in soils containing microbial populations adapted to rapidly degrade <b>isofenphos.</b> An Arthrobacter sp. isolated from soils with a history of <b>isofenphos</b> use rapidly metabolized <b>isofenphos</b> in pure culture, but did not metabolize or cometabolize any of the other 5 organophosphorus insecticides. Likewise, only fonofos was rapidly degraded in soil with a long history of fonofos use. None of the organophosphorus insecticides was rapidly degraded in soil containing carbofuran-degrading microbial populations;The specificity of enhanced degradation within the carbamate insecticide class was also investigated. Soils with prior field exposure to carbofuran, cloethocarb, or several carbamates contained adapted microbial populations capable of rapidly degrading carbofuran. Bendiocarb was rapidly degraded in all soils displaying enhanced carbofuran degradation, but carbaryl and cloethocarb were most rapidly degraded only in soil with prior exposure to several carbamates or to cloethocarb.

40|$|The phosphoramidates are a {{group of}} {{organophosphates}} whose mode of action is not as clear as other activated phosphates. To better understand the mode of action of phosphoramidates, the insecticidal activity and relative potency of paraoxon and the aryl phosphoramidate <b>isofenphos</b> (0 -ethyl 0 -(2 -isopropoxycarbonyl) - phenyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate) and its metabolites, iso- fenphos oxon, des-N-isopropyl <b>isofenphos</b> (DNI) and des-N-iso- propyl <b>isofenphos</b> oxon (DNIO) were examined using the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Each chemical was dissolved in saline and applied to the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of a dissected cockroach. The electrical response of the normally quiescent giant interneurons (GIs) to each chemical was recorded extracellularly from the VNC. Although all compounds tested evoked repeated, high-frequency bursting activity in GIs, the GIs appeared most sensitive to the oxons, especially DNIO. The mean time from application (10 ppm) to the VNC until the induction of GI bursting was 2. 3, 10. 8, 32. 5, and 40 min for paraoxon, DNIO, <b>isofenphos</b> oxon, DNI, and <b>isofenphos.</b> The correlation between the time to GI bursting and cholinesterase inhibition by DNIO suggests {{that one of the}} modes of action of iso- fenphos is cholinesterase inhibition through its metabolite DNIO.

40|$|Trials for {{the control}} of soil pests, {{particularly}} of termites (Isoptera:Termitidae), in groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea) in India and Sudan used chlorpyrifos and <b>isofenphos</b> granules, chlorpyrifos, phorate, carbosulfan and carbofuran in controlled release formulations, and chlorpyrifos seed dressing. Their effects on foliar pests were also noted. Chlorpyrifos controlled release pellets were as effective as aldrin, used as a standard, in reducing root and pod attack and, like aldrin, doubled yields. <b>Isofenphos</b> and chlorpyrifos granules increased yields and reduced pod damage, but to a lesser extent. Other treatments were less effective. Carbosulfan and phorate controlled release and <b>isofenphos</b> granules reduced leaf miner attack. These trials establish the efficacy of controlling termites and other soil pests with controlled release formulations of otherwise non-persistent insecticides.

40|$|Wild cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a {{promising}} crop for biomass production. A nursery trial {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of mycorrhizal inoculation on the biomass yield of wild cardoon seedlings {{and the effect of}} the pesticides fosetyl-Al, folpet and propamocarb, as fungicides, and <b>isofenphos,</b> phoxim and oxamyl, as insecticides, on cardoon plant growth and the mycorrhization. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inocula were: commercial inoculum with Glomus mosseae spores, and an inoculum of a Glomus sp. strain (AMF-i) isolated locally. Mycorrhizal inoculation with either inoculum increased cardoon shoot biomass compared to non-inoculated control plants. The pesticide applications had a neutral or positive effect on cardoon seedling growth. However, the AM fungi colonisation did not decrease except for plants colonised by G. mosseae and treated with the insecticides <b>isofenphos</b> and oxamyl.

40|$|A {{rating system}} was {{developed}} to predict the mortality of southern corn rootworm (Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber) larvae used as test animals to bioasaay soil insecticides. The mortality probabilities, based on behavior of moribund larvae, resulted in data that was more consistent with the assumptions underlying parameteric statistics and provided more precision {{when compared to the}} usually accepted alternate method of considering moribund larvae as dead. The rating system bioassay technique was used to study the effects of different soil factors on the relative decline in biological activity of six soil insecticides: carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, fonofos, <b>isofenphos,</b> phorate, and terbufos. Field studies (including one that altered pH with lime and sulfur) were conducted to measure the effects of soil pH, texture, organic matter, and moisture on insecticide persistence. In the laboratory, the LC 90 levels were determined for each insecticide in several soils. Studies measured the effects of moisture and temperature on the change in biological activity of the six insecticides in soils of varying texture, pH, and percent organic matter. All insecticides were influenced by pH, to varying degrees, in at least one test. Carbofuran persistence was most sensitive to increasing pH. The influence of soil texture was variable. Loss of carbofuran activity in sandy soils was attributed to leaching. Mortality from chlorpyrifos was inversely proportional to percent clay. Soil pH and texture influences on activity of fonofos and <b>isofenphos</b> were inconsistent. The effect of organic matter on biological activity of the insecticides was minimal. Regression models indicated that time accounted for approximately 55 % of variation in the activity of phorate and terbufos with little effect attributed to soil factors. Variation in chlorpyrifos mortality increased an average of 17 % (from 25 %) by the inclusion of soil factors in the models. The LC 90 s revealed that terbufos was the most toxic and fonofos the least toxic insecticide. Higher moisture levels accelerated the decline of fonofos and terbufos activity. Chlorpyrifos and <b>isofenphos</b> were least influenced by different soil moisture levels. Soil temperature had no effect on insecticide persistence. All insecticides were affected by some edaphological or environmental factors, but the influences and degrees of response varied...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{strategy for}} the study of enhanced degradation is described based on its occurrence in Midwestern corn soils. The shift from recalcitrant chlorinated hydrocarbons to biodegradable organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides has resulted in the failure of some compounds, notably carbofuran and <b>isofenphos,</b> to provide adequate pest control following repeated use. Enhanced degradation of an insecticide involves its rapid degradation by a population of soil microorganisms that has adapted to beneficially catabolize it following exposure to it or a similar insecticide. For enhanced degradation to be thoroughly investigated studies must be carried out to demonstrate an increased rate of degradation in soils with prior insecticide exposure, to identify the rates and products of degradation in similar soils under controlled conditions, and to elucidate the microbiological mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{concern in}} the {{widespread}} use of soil-applied pesticides is the phenomenon of enhanced degradation by soil microorganisms. This study investigated selected factors influencing the enhanced microbial degradation of pesticides. Because hydrolysis is a significant initial step in the degradation of pesticides, the role of hydrolysis metabolites in the induction of enhanced degradation was studied. Salicylic acid, p-nitrophenol, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol conditioned the soil for enhanced degradation of their parent compounds, <b>isofenphos,</b> parathion, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, respectively. Repeated applications of 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol resulted in increased persistence of its parent compound, chlorpyrifos. Pretreatment of soil with hydrolysis metabolites of carbofuran, diazinon, fonofos, and 2, 4, 5 -T did not have any effect on the degradation of their respective parent compounds;The properties of pesticide metabolites such as toxicity and availability to microorganisms may influence their potential to condition soils for the enhanced degradation of their parent pesticides. Mobility studies using a soil thin-layer chromatography technique indicated that for a pesticide to be susceptible to enhanced degradation, it need not necessarily be very mobile. Because some metabolites are capable of inducing or inhibiting the enhanced degradation process the mobility/availability of hydrolysis metabolites is of practical significance. Soil pH significantly affected mobility of most of the chemicals studied, with increased mobility in soils with higher pH 2 ̆ 7 s. Water solubility, by itself, was not a good predictor of mobility and structural similarity {{does not seem to be}} an indicator of mobility. The Microtox system was employed to determine the toxicity of pesticides and their metabolites to bacteria. Hydrolysis metabolites of pesticides susceptible to enhanced degradation (<b>isofenphos,</b> diazinon, and carbofuran) recorded higher EC[subscript] 50 values, indicating their low toxicity to bacteria;The effect of manuring on the degradation of pesticides was investigated. Manuring for seven years resulted in increased persistence of pesticides or their pesticidal metabolites. This study found no evidence that amending soil with manure encourages the development of enhanced microbial degradation of pesticides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{adequate}} and simple analytical method based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography–flame photometric detection (GC–FPD) for {{the determination of}} eleven organophosphorus pesticide residues (i. e., ethoprophos, sulfotep, diazinon, tolclofos-methyl, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, <b>isofenphos,</b> methidathion, ethion, triazophos, leptophos) in vegetables samples (cabbage, kale and mustard) was developed. Important parameters that influence the extraction efficiency (i. e., fibre type, extraction modes, extraction time, salt addition, desorption time and temperature) were systematically investigated. Four types of commercially available fibres (i. e., 50 / 30 μm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and 85 μm polyacrylate (PA)) were evaluated. PA fibre exhibited the best performance and {{was used for the}} rest of the studies. The optimised extraction conditions were: extraction time, 30 min at room temperature; stirring speed, 1275 rpm; salt content, 10 % NaCl; desorption time and temperature, 11 min at 260 °C; and no pH adjustment of the sample extract. The method was validated over the range 0. 1 – 100 μg/L. Repeatabilities were satisfactory, ranging between 2. 44 % and 17. 9 % for all analytes. The limits of detection and quantitation ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 14 and 0. 03 to 0. 42 μg/L, respectively. The method was applied to twenty local vegetable (cabbage, kale and mustard) products.

40|$|Fourteen {{pesticides}} (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides) {{were tested}} {{to determine whether}} they had deleterious effects on the bioinsecticide Bacillus popilliae, the causal agent of milky disease. All of these pesticides reduced levels of spore viability, spore germination, and/or vegetative cell growth when they were tested over a range of concentrations from 0 to 1, 000 ppm of active ingredient, and the fungicides had the greatest detrimental effects. As determined by tests in water, the level of spore viability was significantly reduced by chlorothalonil, iprodione, (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid plus 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid, and 2 -[(4 -chloro-o-tolyl) oxy]propionic acid plus (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid. In tests performed with iprodione, loss of viability was evident at concentrations less than the concentration calculated to result from recommended use. Tests performed in soil demonstrated that triadimefon, chlorothalonil, (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid plus 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid, and pendimethalin at concentrations resulting from recommended rates of application reduced spore titers. Spore germination did not occur in the continued presence of 2 -[(4 -chloro-otolyl) oxy]propionic acid plus (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid, <b>isofenphos,</b> and chlordane, whereas exposure of spores to triadimefon or pendimethalin for 2 days stimulated germination. The tests to determine effects on spore germination were inconclusive for all other pesticides.
