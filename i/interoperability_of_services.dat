The Committee seeks to generate new technical insights from interaction between the Internet and public network communities, contributing to the worldwide emergence of a ubiquitous, multimedia, and high-performance Internet. The Committee sponsors and cosponsors workshops, organizes sessions at conferences of both Societies, and encourages submission of articles to their publications. The scope of the Committee includes evolution of the IP protocol; architectural and scaling issues; addressing, routing, and directory services; protocols and technologies in support of real-time media; dynamic control of quality of service; congestion control and admission policies; signaling and network management; access via diverse local and metropolitan networks; information retrieval and sharing; and international <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and applications.|$|E

No one institution acting alone can build the needed infrastructure or explore the full range of new technologies as they become available; it requires a coordinated, community-wide effort that also reaches out to other communities, such as the world of e-research. CNI seeks to highlight links between technology and policies at all levels, to offer a context for collaborative experiments and test beds, and to serve as a focal point for sharing knowledge about new technologies.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} complexity and heterogeneity of contemporary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence systems at all levels within military organizations, {{the adoption of the}} Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) principles and concepts is becoming essential. SOA provides flexibility and <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> enabling the realization of efficient and modular information infrastructure for command and control systems.

40|$|Web {{services}} are evolving quickly {{in terms of}} standardization. Technology and additional wireless networks exact requirements upon web services used via wireless connections, such as mobile networks. The <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> is essential in wireless networks because cost effective development and deployment of new wireless services for a user requires maximum utilization of service infrastructure. At the moment, constraints of service interface description models and implementation of services restrict interoperability between services. To achieve interoperability and composability, a standardized way to describe services and service interfaces is required, {{and for this reason}} standardization bodies are promoting the set of Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies as the basis for a set of common standards. To respond to the challenges concerning service interoperability, this paper illustrates three widely known web standards that promote interoperability between web services- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Definition Language) and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) and proposes an interface description model for wireless Internet services. The proposed model takes into account architectural level service description in a novel way and presents its implementation using XML.

40|$|Previously, {{techniques}} of Context-Aware Computing were limited only to small scale monolithic applications {{due to the}} lack of standardized technologies which could support <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> owned by different organizations. The advancement in Service-Oriented Computing technology allowed autonomous and heterogeneous applications to be exposed as Web Services and interconnected into service compositions exploiting well-agreed interfaces, protocols and message formats. The Web Service Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) is the de-facto standard for composing reusable Web services. To enable handling of context information in applications, context information has to be made available within service compositions; hence, integrated in WS-BPEL processes. Through this means, new innovative context-enriched services can be built and provided using the convergence of context-aware computing and workflow technology. In this diploma thesis, context information provided by the C-CAST Context Management Framework and Google Maps Web services, is integrated into WS-BPEL, and business modelers are supported with the creation of context-based compositions.

The choice of an NGN platform is justified through {{a discussion of the}} problems related to packet networks currently in use, and how the NGN eliminates these problems. The multi-service nature of the NGN architectures is highlighted. The paper describes the setup of one basic service, videoconferencing, and applies TINA's composition and federation abilities to create complex teleworking services from basic services. Important features of the service design addressed here are the reuse of service components, the aggregation of services, and integration of existing services. Service federation is used to illustrate the <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> that have been designed on the NGN, without having to worry about the transport technologies involved.

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{collaboration}} in e-science and business environments {{is no longer}} limited to the boundary of a single organization. People belonging to different organizations collaborate together to achieve a common goal by establishing virtual teams. The current trend is to rely on SOA-based tools and services for virtual teams and their collaborative processes because SOA offers many technologies to simplify the integration and <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> belonging to different organizations and to allow the user to easily access existing services and tools. In complex environments comprising distributed software services and people, {{we need to understand}} how people and software services interact in order to adapt activities and services to the change of their operating environments as well as to allow them to self-manage their behaviors during the collaboration. We observed that {{there is a lack of}} tools supporting the analysis of interactions in such ad-hoc collaborative processes at runtime. In this paper we present our VOIA(Vienna Online Interaction Analysis) framework which aims at analyzing interactions within collaborative processes in SOA-based environments. We present a comprehensive list of interaction metrics and patterns associated with ad-hoc collaborations and techniques used to determine these metrics and patterns. We discuss how metrics and patterns can be used in process adaptation and illustrate VOIA’s capabilities with several experiments. ...|$|E

40|$|Web search {{providers}} {{have developed}} a highly successful business model, which has rendered them amongst {{some of the most}} profitable companies operating on the internet. Many observers regard mobile search as the next new big market. In contrast to search on PCs, however, the provision of search on mobiles is still in its infancy. In order to shed light on the real prospects of mobile search we performed a two-round Delphi exercise with experts, in which we included two innovative elements. First, the Delphi exercise included seven forward-looking scenarios for discussion. Then, {{the second round of the}} Delphi was carried out during a workshop with 19 of the original 61 participants involved. In this paper we present the findings from the discussions of this final round. Our study confirms the high expectations put into the mobile search market. We found that this optimism is rooted in the view that critical technological components are already available. Our paper argues that the technology push is not yet matched by a corresponding market pull. Web search engines, mobile phone manufacturers, and telecom operators are already starting to take action to place themselves in a favourable position. They are exploring trial applications, but business models are still unclear and companies are experimenting with very different approaches. Our Delphi study identifies interfaces as critical for increased mobile search usage. Moreover, experts think that perceived usefulness is valuable but trust is essential and that privacy should be seen as an opportunity rather than a constraint. The paper concludes with some suggestions for fostering innovation, growth and competitiveness in the mobile search domain by increasing the <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> assuring the openness and mash-ups of content and services, and developing personal identity data management systems to improve user acceptance and enhance trust.
