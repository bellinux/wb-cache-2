5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own.|$|E
5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I <b>have,</b> <b>my</b> dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing.

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|One award Sheindlin had {{difficulty}} winning was a Daytime Emmy Award. By 2011, her program had been nominated 14 consecutive years without winning.

500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface.
