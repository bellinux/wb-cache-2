40|$|We {{suggest a}} novel method for {{injection}} of electrons into the acceleration phase of particle accelerators, producing low emittance beams appropriate {{even for the}} demanding high energy Linear Collider specifications. In this paper we work out the injection into the acceleration phase of the wake field in a plasma behind a high intensity laser pulse, {{taking advantage of the}} laser polarization and focusing. With the aid of catastrophe theory we categorize the injection dynamics. The scheme uses the structurally stable regime of transverse wake wave breaking, when electron trajectory self-intersection leads to the formation of a flat electron bunch. As shown in three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the interaction of a laser pulse in a line-focus with an underdense plasma, the electrons, injected via the transverse wake wave breaking and accelerated by the wake wave, perform betatron oscillations with different amplitudes and frequencies along the two transverse coordinates.

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} {{mass spectrometry}} (LA-ICP-MS) has been established as a powerful quantitative elemental imaging technique in routine mode for biological tissue with a spatial resolution of 12 - 160 mu m. Several applications necessitate an improved spatial resolution of LA-ICP-MS at the low micrometre scale and below. To achieve the improvement of spatial resolution of LA-ICP-MS we created a new experimental arrangement by coupling a laser microdissection system (LMD) used for laser ablation of tissue with a sensitive quadrupole-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer for the subsequent analysis of ablated material. A <b>flat</b> <b>laser</b> ablation chamber made of glass was inserted into the LMD, fitted to the microscope slide with the specimen. The biological tissue fixed on the glass slide was ablated using the focused solid-state Nd:YAG laser of the LMD. The laser ablated material was transported by argon as carrier gas into the inductively coupled plasma of the mass spectrometer and analysed according to the mass-to-charge ratio. Using this novel LMD-ICP-MS arrangement, in initial experiments ion signals of 63 Cu* and 65 Cte were measured from a 30 -p. m-thick cryosection impregnated with a droplet of a Cu solution. A spatial resolution of about 3 pm was obtained using the modified LMD system coupled to the ICP-MS. Laser-induced mass spectrometric measurements of metal distributions can be performed together with simultaneous inspection of the tissue section via the microscope of the LMD and be combined with other modalities of the LMD system. In future, a more powerful laser in the LMD apparatus will allow ablation down to the sub-micrometre scale to study the elemental distribution in small tissue sections. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Our results are {{comparable}} to their observations {{when we consider the}} relativistic case and use coshyperbolic-Gaussian <b>lasers.</b> <b>Flat</b> top or super-Gaussian like lasers destabilize as these propagate in the medium leading to two separate peaks in THz profile, whereas Gaussian-like beam retains its shape as it propagates through the medium. Therefore, the THz field in Fig.  2 shows small intensity peak at the center. In nonrelativistic cases the SG index plays important role to enhance the amplitude of the THz [26], but in case of relativistic ponderomotive force the density ripples are found to enhance the amplitude significantly, whereas SG index does not play that much significant role. Main difference between the results obtained in relativistic and nonrelativistic cases is that multiple components appear in Eq. [10] as obtained by Bituk and Fedorov [28] also.|$|R

40|$|Pulsed Laser-Oscillators {{are limited}} to a maximum output power {{depending}} on their regime of puls duration and repetition rate. The use of amplifiers enable higher power levels. The present theses reports {{on the development of}} laser amplifiers with a <b>flat</b> <b>laser</b> media and a special hybrid resonator, {{that can be used for}} a wide range of applications. The optical setup staring with the pump source, the active media and the resonator is described and methods for design and production are developed. Experimental results are given for a system of 10 ps puls duration and 50 W output power. The amplifier is running with high repetition rates as a quasi cw system and diffraction limited beam quality. The special slab shaped geometry of the crystal matches to the characteristic beam shape of high power diode laser bars. The radiation of the diode lasers is transformed to a homogeneous narrow line, that is imaged to the end face of the amplifier crystal. The use of a waveguide forms the homogeneous intensity distribution. Different waveguide concepts are introduced for the use of actively and passively cooled diode lasers. The pump unit is also usable for direct applications like laser welding of plastics or surface treatment of metal. The thermomechanical management of the slab crystal requires an efficient and constant cooling of two crystal side faces in order to achieve a minimum optical distortion of the amplifier beam. Heatsinks with different production techniques and geometries are described for the active conductive cooling of the laser crystal. The distribution of stress, expansion and temperature of the Nd:YAG and Nd:YVO 4 crystals is calculated using FEM methods. The technological challenge is the packaging of the crystal and the heatsinks. The thermal contact of materials with different thermal properties has to enable a constant boundary condition in the contact plane on two faces of the crystal. Therefore different joining methods are tested and a new soldering method for the simultaneous soldering of two contact areas with a constant thickness of the solder gap is developed. The development of the components is the basis for the analysis of the amplifier system. Optical design methods are adapted for the calculation of the hybrid resonator layout and the beamshaping on the input of the amplifier. Experiments show, that the amplifier has two unique properties. Firstly high amplification factors of up to 300 where obtained. On the other hand the system can be designed to run very efficiently. With input powers of 2 W and output powers of 50 W, the amplifier shows behaviour of fully saturated amplification. The beam quality is determined to be better than M 2 < 1, 3. The optical-optical efficiency was measured to be 38 % based on the absorbed pump radiation and 30 % related to the total pump radiation. High pulsenergies are useful for frequency conversion. 80 % of the output power can be converted to green laser radiation using an extra cavity nonlinear crystal. Experimental results proof, that scaling of the amplifier is not limited yet. A 12 mm wide Nd:YVO 4 crystal is abele to produce 50 W output power. Nd:YVO 4 crystals are available with a width of more than 30 mm in the market. On the assumption of double sided pumping and a 30 mm wide crystal 250 W output power could be possible. Power levels of 50 W where successfully used for display technology and micro machining.

The hydrophobic coating is applied onto <b>flat</b> selective <b>laser</b> sintered (SLS) surfaces prepared from polyamide 12 (PA 12) having a surface roughness of Ra = 20 µm. The hydrophobic coating consists of 5 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in acetone.

The layer formation applying the ultrasonic spray coating is studied and compared with layer formation using pneumatic spray coating. It is found that a roughness reduction down to 5 µm was achieved via an ultrasonic spray coating with 30 layers of PVDF solution. It is shown in cross-section electron microscopy pictures that, {{due to the nature of}} the ultrasonically generated droplets, the rough and porous surface of the SLS surface is filled with the PVDF material after which the roughness is reduced by adding a thin layer on top.

The study of {{laser ablation}} inside a cavity is of both fundamental and practical significance. In this dissertation, cavities with different aspect ratios (depth/diameter) were fabricated in fused silica by laser micromachining. Pulsed laser ablation in the cavities was studied and compared with laser ablation on a flat surface. The formation of laser-induced plasmas in the cavities {{and the effects of}} the cavities on the ablation processes were investigated. The temperatures and electron number densities of the resulting laser-induced plasmas in the cavities were determined from spectroscopic measurements. Reflection and confinement effects by the cavity walls and plasma shielding were discussed to explain the increased temperature and electron number density with respect to increasing cavity aspect ratio. The temporal variations of the plasma temperature and electron number density inside the cavity decreased more rapidly than outside the cavity. The effect of laser energy on formation of a plasma inside a cavity was also investigated. Propagation of the shock wave generated during pulsed laser ablation in cavities was measured using laser shadowgraph imaging and compared with laser ablation on a flat surface. It is found that outside the cavity, after about 30 ns the radius of the expanding shock wave was proportional to t 2 / 5, which corresponds to a spherical blast wave. The calculated pressures and temperatures of the shocked air outside of the cavities were higher than those obtained on the <b>flat</b> surface. <b>Lasers</b> with femtosecond pulse duration are receiving much attention for direct fabrication of microstructures due to their capabilities of high-precision ablation with minimal damage to the sample.

While the magnitude of the mean velocity deficit increased with average pore size, the slip velocity remained approximately constant. Fits to the mean velocity profile suggest that the logarithmic region is shifted relative to a smooth wall, and that this shift increases with pore size until it becomes comparable to substrate thickness h. For all foams, the turbulence intensity was found to be elevated further into the boundary layer to y/ δ≈ 0. 2. An outer peak in intensity was also evident for the largest pore sizes. Velocity spectra indicate that this outer peak is associated with large-scale structures resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices that have streamwise length scale 2 δ- 4 δ.

40|$|Cadmium {{sulphide}} (CdS) is a II-VI semi-conductor with {{a direct}} band gap of 2. 42 eV for the hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. CdS is an important electronic and optoelectronic material with applications in light-emitting diodes, <b>lasers,</b> <b>flat</b> panel displays, etc. Bulk CdS crystals at three different orientations were modified using a Ga+ focused ion beam (FIB). The effects of this modification were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Kelvin Probe Microscopy (KPM) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) techniques. These techniques provide information about the morphology, contact surface potential and crystal structure (including defect structure, impurities etc) of the semiconductor crystal. All of these factors are important in any subsequent application of the CdS. The bulk crystals were prepared either by mechanical polishing or by Ga+ ion beam polishing. It {{was found that the}} Ga+ ion beam sputtering depths increased linearly with exposure to the beam and at the same rate for each crystal orientation. The contact surface potential in the mechanically polished crystals increased quickly with dose until an equilibrium was reached, but in the ion beam polished samples the increase in contact surface potential was linear. The UV-visible CL spectra (1. 3 – 6 eV) for the bulk crystals consisted of two peaks – the intrinsic peak at ~ 2. 42 eV and a defect peak at ~ 1. 7 eV. The CL emission was highly sensitive to the scratch damage caused by the mechanical polishing. Ion beam polishing removed most of the scratch damage and allowed the effect of ion beam sputtering to be investigated. The intensity of the defect peak did not change significantly with dose. The intrinsic peak was initially reduced in intensity and then increased to an equilibrium point. The CL characteristics of cadmium sulphide powder crystals were also investigated and compared to the characteristics of CdS microstructures of similar size patterned using the FIB.

There is, however, a lack of methods for establishing a full dataset of the local material directions. The present research aims at the development and application of a laboratory method to assess the geometry of growth layers and the orientation of fibres in a high-resolution 3 D grid within wood specimens containing knots. The laboratory method was based on optical <b>flatbed</b> scanning and <b>laser</b> scanning, the former resulting in surface images and the latter, utilizing the tracheid effect, resulting in in-plane fibre angles determined in high-resolution grids on scanned surfaces. A rectangular solid wood specimen containing a single knot was cut from a tree {{in such a way}} that it could be assumed that a plane of symmetry existed in the specimen. By splitting the specimen through this plane through the centre line of the knot, two new specimens with assumed identical but mirrored properties were achieved. On one of the new specimens, the longitudinal-radial plane was subsequently scanned, and the longitudinal–tangential plane was scanned on the other. Then, by repeatedly planing off material on both specimens followed by scanning of the new surfaces that gradually appeared, 3 D coordinate positions along different growth layers and 3 D orientation of fibres in a 3 D grid were obtained. Comparisons between detected fibre orientation and growth layer geometry were used for the assessment of the accuracy obtained regarding 3 D fibre orientation. It was shown that the suggested method is well suited to capture growth layer surfaces and that it provides reliable information on 3 D fibre orientation close to knots. Such knowledge is of great importance for understanding the properties of timber including knots.

A <b>flat</b> temporal profile originally required in the LCLS design {{is not necessary to}} achieve a low emittance electron beam for the LCLS operations. According to our recent studies, a laser pulse with 3 ps Gaussian temporal profile (FWHM) can achieve a similar emittance compared to a <b>flat</b> temporal profile <b>laser.</b> The sensitivity of the emittance to the laser pulse length at 250 pC of bunch charge was studied, as shown in Figure 1. Only slight variations were observed for both projected and time-sliced emittances with laser pulses from 2. 2 ps to 4. 5 ps FWHM. Space charge forces certainly become weak but RF emittance which is proportional to the bunch length square increases due to the longer laser pulse. Thus, the projected emittance optimum may be a trade-off between space charge forces and RF emittance, while the time-sliced emittance determined by space charge forces may be slightly improved with a longer laser pulse length. Simulations and theory also show that spatial Gaussian-cut laser profile produces a better emittance compared to uniform profiles due to increased linearity of the space charge forces. Preliminary experimental data show that the emittance with a Gaussian-cut is almost as good as the one with uniform although not better than. In addition, the laser transmission through the iris for spatial Gaussian-cut is about twice the one for spatial uniform. More experimental studies with the new Coherent laser system are needed to make a more solid conclusion...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on the {{synthesis}} of mordenite zeolite and ZSM- 5 zeolite. In Chapter 3 reports the growth of ZnS nanoclusters in the pore channels of mordenite zeolite. ZnS as an important wide-band-gap (3. 6 eV) semiconductor nanoclusters and have various technological applications such as photocatalysis, nonlinear optics, sensors, solar cells, injection <b>lasers,</b> <b>flat</b> panel displays, ultraviolet light emitting diodes (LED). Zeolites have several different applications in industries, such as in catalysis, ion exchange adsorption and gas separation. Zeolites are mostly used as a catalyst in the petrochemical industry. ZSM- 5 zeolite is widely used a heterogeneous catalyst in the petrochemical industry due to its unique porous structure. Special attention {{has been made to}} synthesize nano-ZSM- 5 in order to improve its catalytic activity. Catalysis depends on the characteristics length scale of the active sites, while the rate depends on the accessible active sites. In order to improve the performance of ZSM- 5 zeolite used as a catalyst in the petrochemical industry, the researchers amid to produce nanocrystalline of the ZSM- 5 zeolite. That will help to reduce the path length for the reaction and hence will increase the rate of a reaction. Comparative synthesis nano-particles of ZSM- 5 zeolite using two different methods of treatment i. e. pre-treatment and interrupted treatment with ultrasound and without ultrasound was studied, its effect on aging and crystal growth during the hydrothermal treatment. In Chapter 4 the pre-treatment with ultrasound and without ultrasound (static) with an increasing time intervals have been reported. The resulting product the particle size is clearly decreased by using ultrasound pre-treatment. While in Chapter 5 using a different method of treatment called interrupted of the hydrothermal process. As in this method, we stopped the hydrothermal process for 20 minutes and treated the gel with ultrasound for 15 minutes. This treatment was repeated after every 2 hours of hydrothermal treatment. Similarly, the same method was applied to the experiment but without the use of ultrasound called a static method of aging. A 3 rd method was also applied to investigate the effect of ultrasound on the particle size distribution of the synthesized crystalline powder. All the results showed that the ultrasound not only effects on the particle size but it also affects the crystallinity too i. e. increased the crystallinity and the reduced in the particle size. </p...|$|R
