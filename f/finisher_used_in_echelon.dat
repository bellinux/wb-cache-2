40|$|AbstractProcurement for {{humanitarian}} supply chains is often done by agencies that underlie public procurement regulations. These regulations {{tend to focus}} on transparency and openness, in other words, tender processes, price and quality. In other words, public procurement can be seen as hindering innovation through its rigidity. At the same time, humanitarian organizations face highly turbulent environments, sudden demand, and disaster- and context-specific requirements on items and technologies. Innovation in humanitarian supply chains needs to be swift but also robust, fitting an environment with disruptions in critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation. In spite of context-specific requirements, innovation does not stand alone but impacts on the supply chain through its requirements on suppliers, <b>use</b> <b>in</b> other <b>echelons,</b> and even, use across various sectors. Innovation thus cascades both upstream the supply chain and across sectors. Such cascades need to be identified, managed, or if detrimental, mitigated in the humanitarian supply chain. This paper therefore develops a framework for cascading innovation in humanitarian supply chains...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates {{methods for}} {{reallocation}} of service capacities in open Jackson networks {{in order to}} minimize either a system’s mean total work-in-process or its response time. The focus is mainly on a method called node generation, by which capacity can be transferred from a node <b>in</b> <b>echelon</b> j to a newly generated node <b>in</b> <b>echelon</b> j + 1. The proposed procedure is compared with the more conventional capacity redistribution method, by which capacity can be transferred from any node <b>in</b> <b>echelon</b> j to existing successor nodes <b>in</b> <b>echelon</b> j + 1. Formulation of each method as a mathematical programming problem reveals the structure of the optimal solution for both problems. The motivation for considering these approaches stems from real-life settings, in particular, from a production line or supply chains where the two types of capacity reallocation are applied. Heuristic methods are developed to solve relatively large networks in tractable time. Numerical results and analyses are presented...|$|R

50|$|Claude Blankiet with American Garment Finishers from Texas {{promoted}} {{the use of}} cellulase enzymes in the finishing industry. Cellulase was already <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the paper pulp, food processing industry and currently in the fermentation of biomass for biofuel production. Cellulase is produced primarily by fungi, bacteria and protozoan that catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulose. Since the enzyme decomposes cellulose fibers this enhanced the characteristic appearance that the jeans have been abraded with stones (and eliminated or considerably reduced the usage of natural pumice stones). Selecting the most suitable type of enzyme and their application for ageing jeans {{was the key to}} success. American Garment <b>Finishers</b> <b>used</b> a new cellulolytic agent patented in 1991 by Novo Nordisk from Denmark because of its safer effect on cotton fiber.

50|$|These {{results may}} be easier to {{understand}} by putting the augmented matrix of the coefficients of the system <b>in</b> row <b>echelon</b> form by using Gaussian elimination. This row echelon form is the augmented matrix {{of a system of}} equations that is equivalent to the given system (it has exactly the same solutions). The number of independent equations in the original system is the number of non-zero rows <b>in</b> the <b>echelon</b> form. The system is inconsistent (no solution) if and only if the last non-zero row <b>in</b> <b>echelon</b> form has only one non-zero entry that is in the last column (giving an equation 0 = c where c is a non-zero constant). Otherwise, there is exactly one solution when the number of non-zero rows <b>in</b> <b>echelon</b> form is equal to the number of unknowns, and there are infinitely many solutions when the number of non-zero rows is lower than the number of variables.|$|R
