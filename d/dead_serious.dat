25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is <b>dead</b> <b>serious</b> about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

500|$|In {{consumer}} publications, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the kind of youthful, Brit-knockabout pop energy director Matthew Vaughn absorbed {{from his}} previous collaborations as producer of director Guy Ritchie's bloke-y larks", and found McAvoy and Fassbender [...] "a casting triumph.

500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are <b>dead</b> <b>serious</b> about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the minimal}} damage inflicted, American morale, {{still reeling from}} the attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan's {{subsequent}} territorial gains, soared when news of the raid was released. The Japanese press was told to describe the attack as a cruel, indiscriminate bombing against civilians, women, and children. After the war, the casualty count was 87 <b>dead,</b> 151 <b>serious</b> injuries, and more than 311 minor injuries; children were among those killed, and newspapers asked their parents to share their opinion on how the captured raiders should be treated. For years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, there had been mock air raid drills in every Japanese city, although China's air force was almost nonexistent; this may {{have been part of the}} process of keeping warlike emotion at a high pitch.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Serious</b> {{caused an}} {{immediate}} sensation upon its release in March 1992.

Giving it a 4 out of 5-mic rating, The Sources Matty C compared the duo's lyrical style to that of Busta Rhymes, Treach, and EPMD, writing [...] "Not only have they innovated a new rhyme flow that expands on all these styles, but they have brought back fun filled hip-hop". Ronin Ro of Spin complimented their [...] "hard lyrics that simultaneously perplex, captivate, annoy, and amuse... television-induced, schizophrenic, lyrical wit". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention (...) rating, indicating [...] "a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like".|$|E
2500|$|The Kennedy {{campaign}} {{began to}} focus on Oregon. Its workers repeatedly denied that Morse was a serious candidate, but to make sure of a win, the campaign sent Rose Kennedy and Ted Kennedy to speak in Oregon and outspent Morse $54,000 to $9,000. [...] Morse often found himself responding to Kennedy’s claim that he was not a “serious candidate”, by proclaiming: “I’m a <b>dead</b> <b>serious</b> candidate.” Quietly, Oregon Democrats began to worry about what a loss for Morse would mean in 1962 against possible Republican challenger Governor Mark Hatfield. Morse would use this to his advantage to help sway undecided Democrats, claiming that if he lost in the primary, it would certainly help Republicans defeat him in 1962. Kennedy brushed off this argument by claiming that regardless of the outcome of the presidential primary, the people of Oregon had a tremendous respect for Wayne Morse and would send him back to the Senate, and that he would even come back to Oregon in 1962 to campaign for him. [...] On Election Day, Morse came up roughly 50,000 votes short of defeating Kennedy. Morse abandoned his presidential race that same week.|$|E

5000|$|Venereology was {{my first}} release on a death metal label. So, my target was [...] "death metal" [...] itself.

30|$|The {{internal}} {{quantum efficiency}} (IQE) of these solar cells were derived also from the EQE characteristics via IQE = EQE/(1 [*]−[*]R), where R is adopted from Figure  3. There is only a slight difference between the IQE and EQE for the two SiNW-based solar cells due to the low reflectance in the whole wavelength range of the SiNW structure. If we compare the IQE values of the two axial p-n junction solar cells, {{we can see that}} the IQE of the NW-A solar cell is much lower in the short-wavelength region (400 [*]<[*]λ[*]<[*] 600  nm) than that of the P-A solar cell. This could be attributed to the formation of the <b>dead</b> layer and <b>serious</b> surface recombination brought by the SiNW structure. As for the NW-R solar cell, in spite of the equally serious surface recombination related to the SiNW structure, an IQE enhancement in the short-wavelength region can be seen. The IQE behavior further indicates that the radial p-n junction is beneficial for carrier transport and collection.|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{inoculation}} {{studies with}} Diplodia pinea (Desm.) Kickx in the glass-house and growth cabinet established that initiation of infection (as {{indicated by the}} first appearance of stem symptoms) of Pinus radiata D. Don requires a minimum shoot wetness duration of 3 h {{but no more than}} 48 h within the temperature range 10 °- 30 °C. Duration of wetness seems important to infection as interruption of the wetness period by a dry period of 12 h or longer reduced the disease level. Temperature requirements for the initiation of infection and the subsequent development of the disease are not the same. Infection cannot be initiated at 5 °C, but at 10 °C the level of infection can be high if wetness is not a limiting factor. However, at this temperature lesion extension is limited and dead tops do not develop, even if the temperature is subsequently raised to the optimum. On the other hand, when infection is initiated at a high temperature, e. g., 25 °- 30 °C, lesion extension continues until {{a large part of the}} shoot is killed even at a subsequent temperature as low as 10 °C. Thus, temperature and duration of wetness during the early stages of infection largely determine the ultimate level of disease. Briefly, temperatures of 10 °- 12 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °- 25 °C or higher during 1 - 2 wet or humid days would represent respectively, light, moderate, and <b>serious</b> <b>dead</b> top development...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} the characteristics and prognostic factors of 28 patients with Fournier’s Gangrene (FG) referred to our medical center at Southeastern Iran. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including 28 cases of FG that were operated in Surgery department of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences during a 10 -year period from April 2002 to March 2012. The study analyzed 9 parameters including the body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, hematocrit, {{white blood count}} (WBC), and serum levels of sodium, potassium, creatininee (twice for 2 for acute renal failure), and bicarbonate for Fournier Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) score. The aspects taken into account were age, gender, predisposing factors, duration of symptoms, hospitalization period, and number of debridements, disease outcome and the FGSI. Results: All patients were males, aged from 26 to 68 years, with mean age 44. 6 ± 8. 49 years. Statistically significant differences in age (p< 0. 001), duration of symptoms (p= 0. 001), number of debridements (p= 0. 006), hospitalization duration (p< 0. 001) and FGSI (p< 0. 001) were found between surviving and dead patients. The mortality rate was 35. 7 %, and the most common presentation was perianal/scrotal pain (78. 6 %). Perianal and primary scrotal abscesses were most common causes of FG and were found in 57. 14 % and 21. 42 % of patients respectively. The most prevalent predisposing factor was diabetes mellitus in 12 (42. 85 %) patients. With respect to laboratory findings, statistically significant differences in WBC (p= 0. 002), creatinine (p< 0. 001), albumin (p< 0. 001), calcium (p< 0. 001) and serum sodium (p= 0. 035) {{were found between the}} surviving and <b>dead</b> patients. Conclusion: <b>Serious</b> outcome of FG was associated with old age, delayed diagnosis and treatment, inadequate surgical debridement, shorter hospitalization and higher FGSI scores. In addition higher WBC, higher creatininee and serum sodium and lower albumin and calcium levels implicated worse prognosis...|$|R
