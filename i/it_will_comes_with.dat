There is no WI-FI connectivity in the currently announced model and it is unknown whether there will be a version with such capabilities. It is comparable in size, usability and design as the Intel NUC. There has been no price or release date on the system, and no further details released on the topic. It is uncommon to see such a product being produced by AMD since the company hasn’t played much of a role in the mini desktop scene.Since it is using an x86 based chip, it is capable of running Windows 7 which is also the operating system that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> preinstalled <b>with.</b> <b>It</b> <b>will</b> also be able to support users wanting to upgrade to Windows 8 without any problems.|$|R

40|$|The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test is {{typically}} called upon when testing whether a symmetric distribution has a specified centre and the Gaussianity is in question. As with all insurance policies it <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> a cost, even if small, {{in terms of}} power versus a t-test, when the distribution is indeed Gaussian. In this note we further show that even when the distribution tested is Gaussian there need not be power loss at all, if the alternative is of a mixture type rather than a shift. The signed rank test {{may turn out to}} be more powerful than the t-test, and the supposedly conservative strategy, might actually be the more powerful one. Drug testing and functional magnetic imaging are two such scenarios. Wilcoxon' signed rank test will typically be called upon by a researcher when testing for the location of a single population, using a small sample and Gaussianity is dubious. As all insurance policies, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> a cost [...] power. It is well known, that under a Gaussian setup, the signed rank test is less powerful than, say, a t-test. The works of Pitman and others have reassured us that this power loss is surprisingly small. In this note we argue that the power loss might actually be smaller than typically assumed. In particular, if the deviation from the null Gaussian distribution is of a mixture type and not a shift type, the signed rank test is no longer dominated by the t-test and can actually be more powerful...|$|R
50|$|Mill {{scale is}} a {{nuisance}} when the steel {{is to be}} processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> off <b>with</b> the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by flame cleaning, pickling, or abrasive blasting, which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and steel fixers used to leave steel and rebar delivered freshly rolled from mills {{out in the open}} to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays most steel mills can supply their produce with mill scale removed and steel coated with shop primers over which welding or painting can be done safely.|$|R
