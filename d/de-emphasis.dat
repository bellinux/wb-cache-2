5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a <b>de-emphasis</b> of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and {{a focus on the}} development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017 Taiwan's Ministry of Culture {{announced}} plans to transform the hall into a national center for “facing history, recognizing agony, and respecting human rights.” A corresponding <b>de-emphasis</b> of the Chiang personality cult is underway as proposals for transforming the hall are reviewed.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{development}} of ICBMs and the <b>de-emphasis</b> of their bomber force decreased {{the value of}} the Hercules system. Beginning around 1965, the number of Nike batteries was reduced. Thule's air defense was reduced during 1965, and SAC air base defense during 1966, reducing the number of batteries to 112. Budgetary cuts reduced that number to 87 in 1968, and 82 in 1969. Nike Hercules was included in SALT I discussions as an ABM.|$|E
25|$|After 1975, Framingham/Worcester Line {{service was}} {{cut back to}} Framingham, though other lines reached exurbs more distant from Boston than Framingham. As {{compensation}} for delays in the Old Colony Lines restoration, rush-hour service to Worcester Union Station was restored in 1994, with infill stations at Ashland, Southborough, Westborough, and Grafton stations were added in the MetroWest region between 2000 and 2002. The service was successful, resulting in relative <b>de-emphasis</b> of Amtrak and commuter bus services operating in the same corridor.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{scene and}} subject magnification, the {{background}} blur increases with lens focal length. If {{it is not}} important that background objects be unrecognizable, background <b>de-emphasis</b> can be increased by using a lens of longer focal length and increasing the subject distance to maintain the same magnification. This technique requires that sufficient space {{in front of the}} subject be available; moreover, the perspective of the scene changes because of the different camera position, and this {{may or may not be}} acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Part of this {{relative}} lack of success {{can be attributed to}} President Colgate Darden's <b>de-emphasis</b> of football after the 1952 season, leading the program to turn down an invitation to the 1953 Cotton Bowl Classic against the Texas Longhorns in the first televised football game. Most significantly, Darden also reduced the number of football scholarships by 80% relative to competing teams when joining the Atlantic Coast Conference later that year, leading Art Guepe to resign and coach Vanderbilt. While future Presidents would allow the same number of scholarships as its rivals after Darden retired in 1959, Virginia would remain a shadow of its former football self until the 1981 hiring of Welsh some twenty-two years later.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{advertised as}} an action-oriented series, the series' {{uniqueness}} primarily stems from its <b>de-emphasis</b> on action as such and greater reliance on well-crafted dialogue and complex plot structures more {{common to the}} genre of sophisticated spy-fi as influenced by film noir and neo-noir. Since its inception, the series {{did not have a}} large enough budget to finance complex action sequences (as seen in later dramatic spy fiction or spy thriller television series such as Alias or 24). Its creative team exhibited great ingenuity marshalling its modest resources, channelling their energies into the writing of episodes with more complex plot structures, fuller character development, and more substantial dialogue for the series' actors (all of which aspects are less costly than filming special effects in action sequences).|$|E
25|$|FM {{provides}} improved Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), {{as compared}} for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding <b>de-emphasis</b> in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E
25|$|Reform {{mathematics}} is {{an approach to}} mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards {{with the publication of}} Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to {{serve as the basis for}} many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a <b>de-emphasis</b> on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.|$|E
25|$|Yashovijaya {{stressed}} that neutrality {{does not mean}} acceptance of every position whatever, but acceptance only of those that satisfy at least the minimal criteria of clarity and coherence needed to legitimately constitute a point of view. Hence he criticised the Carvaka philosophy as being too confused in {{their understanding of the}} topic of liberation even to be said to have a ‘view’. He also confronted the Brahmin scholar Raghunatha Siromani, one of the greatest exponent of modern logic during his time, thus proving his extraordinary talent. Paul Dundas notes that, Yashovijaya also criticized the famous Digambara Jain monk Kundakunda for his more reliance on one standpoint. He also strongly attacked the laity based Adhyatmika sect whose <b>de-emphasis</b> on the role of rituals and ascetics was derived from works of Kundakunda and his commentators. At the same time, Yashovijaya also opposed the views of Svetambara monk Dharmasagara for his supremacist perspective of Jainism and exclusivist refusal to accept validity of any religious path except that of Tapa Gachchha (a sub-sect of Svetambara Jains).|$|E
25|$|Some years later, after Easton became President of the American Political Science Association, he led {{the charge}} of a new post-behavioralist revolution, arguing that {{political}} science research should be both relevant and action-oriented, so it might better {{serve the needs of}} society by solving social and political problems revealed during the 1960s. This new revolution was not a change in the methods of inquiry but a change in orientation that grew out of a deep discontent with the direction of contemporary political research and which advocated more attention to the public responsibilities of the discipline and to relevant research on contemporary political problems and issues. According to John Gunnell, this was the official birth announcement of the public policy enterprise in political science which became the basis of the self-image of orthodox political science in the 1970s. With this shift came a distinct <b>de-emphasis</b> of concern for establishing a general unified theory as the core of the discipline, and a retreat from any pointed confrontation with the history of political theory.|$|E
500|$|Shikasta was {{intended}} to be a [...] "single self-contained book", but as Lessing's fictional universe developed, she found she had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a series of five. Shikasta, and the Canopus in Argos series as a whole, fall into the category of soft science fiction ("space fiction" [...] in Lessing's own words) due to their focus on characterization and social and cultural issues, and the <b>de-emphasis</b> of science and technology. Robert Alter of The New York Times suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre literary critic Northrop Frye called the [...] "anatomy", which is [...] "a combination of fantasy and morality". Gore Vidal placed Lessing's [...] "science fiction" [...] "somewhere between John Milton and L. Ron Hubbard".|$|E
500|$|Another major {{characteristic}} of Winesburg, Ohio that separates its style from Anderson's contemporaries, {{as well as}} his previous novels, is the minimal role of plot. According to critic David Stouk's article [...] "Anderson's Expressionist Art", [...] "As an expressionist drama, there is little development of a story line in the Winesburg tales in term of cause and effect." [...] Indeed, it is this <b>de-emphasis</b> of traditional story elements in lieu of experimentation with language that provides both a link and a rift between Winesburg, Ohio and the novels of the following decades; whereas the simple, stripped-down vernacular that Gertrude Stein found so appealing in Anderson's writing of the time became an exemplar of quintessential American style most famously associated with Ernest Hemingway, the expressionistic portrayal of emotional states in Winesburg, Ohio was later, by some critics, considered [...] "undisciplined" [...] and [...] "vague".|$|E
500|$|The film depicts Motoko's {{identity}} and ontological concerns, {{ending with the}} evolution of a being with full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master. Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is [...] "overtly feminine, and clearly non-female". In describing Motoko as a [...] "shapely" [...] and [...] "strong [...] {{at the center of the}} story" [...] who is [...] "nevertheless almost continuously nude", Roger Ebert noted that [...] "an article about anime in a recent issue of Film Quarterly suggests that to be a 'salary man' in modern Japan is so exhausting and dehumanizing that many men (who form the largest part of the animation audience) project both freedom and power onto women, and identify with them as fictional characters". [...] Carl Silvio has called Ghost in the Shell a [...] "resistant film", due to its inversion of traditional gender roles, its [...] "valorization of the post-gendered subject", and its <b>de-emphasis</b> of the sexual specificity of the material body.|$|E
500|$|The BSA had {{introduced}} the [...] "Improved Scouting Program" [...] in 1972, {{along with a}} new edition of the Boy Scout Handbook. Many of the changes were intended to expand Scouting to a broader base of youth and to make Scouting more [...] "in tune with the times". Many Scouters, including Hillcourt, were critical of the new program changes, exclaiming that the <b>de-emphasis</b> on traditional outdoor skills had taken the [...] "outing out of Scouting". This change proved to be unsuccessful, deterring existing adherents and attracting relatively few new enrolments. To remedy this situation, Hillcourt convinced Chief Scout Executive Harvey L. Price that a new handbook was needed. Hillcourt then came out of retirement and spent a year writing and editing the 1979 edition of The Official Boy Scout Handbook, returning to the focus of Scoutcraft. In addition, he helped to develop the All Out for Scouting program that launched the return to the old standards. Hillcourt {{was regarded as a}} prominent figure and guide in BSA's recovery from its experiment earlier in that decade.|$|E
500|$|The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five is told {{largely from}} the point of view of the matriarchal utopian Zone Three, which places the novel in the {{category}} of feminist utopias or feminist science fiction. The Canopus in Argos series in general falls under the banner of soft science fiction, or [...] "space fiction" [...] as Lessing called it, due to its focus on characterisation and social and cultural issues, and the <b>de-emphasis</b> of science and technology. Comparative literature professor Robert Alter suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre that literary critic Northrop Frye called the [...] "anatomy", which is [...] "a combination of fantasy and morality". Author Gore Vidal placed Lessing's science fiction between John Milton and L. Ron Hubbard". American screenwriter and film director Frank Pierson called Lessing's science fiction [...] "mythic tale" [...] that are closer to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Herbert's Dune than works by Clarke and Asimov. British writer Graham Sleight said The Marriages comes closest to Ursula Le Guin's works in the way that both Lessing and Le Guin scrutinise societies. Sleight compared The Marriages to Le Guin's science fiction novel The Dispossessed (1974), saying that each revolves around conflicts between differing worldviews, namely the Zones in The Marriages, and Anarres and Urras in The Dispossessed.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode an F and criticized the episode's plot and, most notably, its ending. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that the episode diluted the characters of Doggett and Scully in a [...] "mechanical plot", writing [...] "'Salvage' would never have made a great episode, but if it had only bothered {{to give a little}} more depth to Doggett and Scully, it might still have been an entertaining one." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris referred to the episode as an [...] "assembly line monster-of-the-week episode" [...] and criticized it for failing to make the audience truly empathetic to Ray Pearce's plight. However, Vitaris did praise the make-up in the episode, noting that [...] "that makeup is [...] William's performance [...] he is an astonishing sight." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He applauded the way the guest star was allowed to [...] "take over" [...] the episode, but felt that the <b>de-emphasis</b> on Scully and Doggett rendered their scenes [...] "boring". Ultimately, VanDerWerff noted that the problem with it was that the two halves of the story—Dogget and Scully investigation, and Ray's plight—were largely unconnected.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gelman, [...] "A unitive {{experience}} {{involves a}} phenomenological <b>de-emphasis,</b> blurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive {{significance of the}} experience is deemed to lie precisely in that phenomenological feature".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{challenging}} FID roles is that of aviation, given that the US Air Force has long emphasized strategic attack and the <b>de-emphasis</b> of airpower's supporting functions have contributed to a doctrinal void regarding airpower's role in counterinsurgency.

2500|$|Buddhist modernist traditions often {{consist of}} a {{deliberate}} <b>de-emphasis</b> of the ritual and metaphysical elements of the religion, as these elements are seen as incommensurate with the discourses of modernity. Buddhist modernist traditions have also been characterized as being [...] "detraditionalized," [...] often being presented {{in a way that}} occludes their historical construction. Instead, Buddhist modernists often employ an essentialized description of their tradition, where key tenets are described as universal and sui generis. It was this form of Zen that has been popularized in the West: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1853, Roberts {{was sent}} to Brockport, New York. By 1854, {{it was clear that}} a major, conference-wide {{conflict}} was brewing. On the one side were those conservatives who favored traditional Methodist teaching on matters of social and personal ethics, and who favored the traditional Methodist emphasis on entire sanctification. On the other side were those progressives who favored an assimilation of Methodism to prevailing American sensitivities and mores, including a <b>de-emphasis</b> on entire sanctification in favor of more [...] "realistic" [...] ethical expectations. These conflicting undercurrents bubbled to the surface in 1855. Leslie Ray Marston, former bishop in the Free Methodist Church of North America, best described the situation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the <b>de-emphasis</b> on {{entertainment}} on {{the overall}} telecast, ESPN did bring back Hank Williams, Jr. for his 20th season {{as part of the}} opening. This time, the opening sequence was set in a private residence. At the end of the song, Williams Jr. touched a foot pump, which supposedly contained the helmets of that night's participating teams. The helmets were launched from the home toward the stadium at which the game was held. Through computer-generated imagery, the helmets [...] "land" [...] at midfield during a live shot, and then explode. The [...] "exploding helmets" [...] gimmick was also used at various times in the 1980s and 1990s during the pre-game tease. Williams Jr. then appeared again {{at the end of the}} game to promote the next week's matchup.|$|E
2500|$|Abernethy {{believed}} that AMC's reputation of building reliable economical cars could {{be translated into}} a new strategy that could follow AMC buyers as they traded up into larger, more expensive vehicles. AMC in reality had produced large cars throughout most of its history, The Rambler Ambassadors were every bit {{as large as a}} full-sized Ford or Chevy. There was only an absence of largest sized cars from the AMC lineup in 1963 and 1964 The first cars bearing his signature were the 1965 models. These were a longer Ambassador series and new convertibles for the larger models. During mid-year a fastback, called the Marlin, was added. It competed directly with cars like the Dodge Charger, AMC's [...] "family-sized" [...] car emphasized personal-luxury. Abernethy also called for the <b>de-emphasis</b> of the Rambler brand. The 1966 Marlin and Ambassador lost their Rambler nameplates, and were badged as [...] "American Motors" [...] products. The new models shared fewer parts among each other and were more expensive to build.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{included}} two sophisticated instrumental tracks composed solely by Brian. One of them: the wistful [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile". the other instrumental {{is the title}} track, [...] "Pet Sounds". Both titles had been recorded as backing tracks for existing songs, {{but by the time}} the album neared completion Wilson had decided that the tracks worked better without vocals. Of [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile", Perone observes, [...] "There are melodic features but no tune to speak of. As an instrumental composition, this gives the piece an atmospheric feel; however, the exact mood is difficult to define." [...] Of [...] "Pet Sounds", the piece represents the Beach Boys' surf heritage more than any other track on the album with its emphasis on lead guitar, although Perone maintains that it is not really a surf composition, citing its elaborate arrangement involving countless auxiliary percussion parts, abruptly changing textures, and <b>de-emphasis</b> of a traditional rock band drum set.|$|E
2500|$|The split within {{liberalism}} led to {{the rise}} of modern liberalism within the Liberal Party, and the <b>de-emphasis</b> of what some refer to as [...] "classical" [...] liberalism, which had allegedly been the dominant ideology within the party. Historically, liberalism emphasized a system of government to protect liberty; historically, liberalism viewed the threat to liberty as mainly coming from the force and coercion of the state. The split within liberalism occurred when many liberals viewed threats to individual liberty arising from sources other than the state, such as from the concentration of money, the amalgamation of power, or in the destitution of the poor, the sick, or the elderly. Modern liberalism was an ideology which promoted an active government as the best guardian of liberty – both theoretical liberty and effective liberty – through government aid. Several 'New Liberals' such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill replaced the earlier ideology apparent in figures such as William Ewart Gladstone (see Gladstonian Liberalism) who felt that people should be responsible for their own lives.|$|E
2500|$|In collegiate wrestling, {{there is}} a <b>de-emphasis</b> on [...] "throws", or {{maneuvers}} where the other wrestler is taken off his feet, taken through the air, and lands on his back or shoulders. This lack of emphasis on throws {{is another example of}} how collegiate wrestling emphasizes dominance or control, as opposed to the element of risk and explosive action. A legal throw in collegiate wrestling is awarded the same number of points as any other takedown. In freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, points awarded for a wrestler's takedowns increase with the level of explosiveness seen in the throws. Well-executed throws can even win a period in the international styles, especially when a throw is of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler takes an opponent off of the mat and controls his opponent so that his feet go directly above his head). In collegiate wrestling, some of the throws seen in the international styles may even be illegal, such as a full-back suplex from a rear standing position. However, many collegiate wrestlers still incorporate some throws into their repertoire of moves because a thrown opponent often lands on his back or shoulders and thus in a position more conducive to producing near fall points or securing a fall.|$|E
2500|$|Temptation was an Australian {{game show}} which premiered on the Nine Network on 30 May 2005. Hosted by Ed Phillips and Livinia Nixon, {{the show was}} a remake of Sale of the Century, which aired on Nine in the same {{timeslot}} {{for more than twenty}} years between 1980 and 2001. Temptation had the same general format of its predecessor, but with several new features and a <b>de-emphasis</b> on the [...] "shopping" [...] aspects of the endgame. The show ran until 30 November 2007, when it was placed on hiatus by the network following strong competition from game show Deal or No Deal on the rival Seven Network; during the hiatus, Nine filled the timeslot with episodes of the American sitcom Two and a Half Men. When Ed Phillips made an appearance on The NRL Footy Show he announced [...] "maybe summer" [...] would be the return of the show. This statement was accurate, as Temptation returned for a shortened fourth series from 1 December 2008 with unaired episodes which were recorded during 2008. During that time, Ed Phillips was dumped by the Nine Network after his contract expired in November, and Temptation never returned to the schedule. After 23 January 2009, when the show's final episode aired, all Temptation websites were removed, and Two and a Half Men returned to Channel Nine's 7:00pm schedule.|$|E
