[...] It is also used to manufacture the military explosive <b>hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (HNIW) which is superior to older nitroamine high explosives like HMX and RDX, though it is less stable. The US Navy is testing HNIW for use in rocket propellants, such as for missiles, as it has lower observability characteristics such as less visible smoke. [...] HNIW is prepared by first condensing benzylamine with glyoxal in acetonitrile under acidic and dehydrating conditions. [...] Four of the benzyl groups are removed from hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane by hydrogenolysis catalysed by palladium on carbon and the resulting secondary amine groups are acetylated in acetic anhydride. [...] The resulting dibenzyl-substituted intermediate is then reacted with nitronium tetrafluoroborate and nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate in sulfolane to produce HNIW.|$|E

30|$|To {{improve the}} safety of {{ammonium}} nitrate explosives, the melamine urea-formaldehyde resin (MUF resin) was selected for the preparation of three typical nitramine explosives (cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine, HMX; cryclo-trimethylenetrinitramine, RDX; and <b>hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane,</b> CL- 20) based green polymer-bonded explosives (GPBXs) via interfacial polymerization. Meanwhile, the corresponding composite particles prepared by physical mixing and drying bath methods were studied and compared. The particle morphology, crystal structure, thermal stability, and safety performance of the resultant composite particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and impact sensitivity test, respectively. SEM results showed that MUF was successfully coated {{on the surface of}} the three explosives, and different composite particles prepared by the same method have their own unique characteristics. Such effect is attributed to the resin’s ability to isolate and buffer external stimuli. It is obvious that the interfacial polymerization is an effective desensitization technique to prepare core-shell composite particles for explosives.|$|E

We have now used computational procedures developed since that time to reassess the expected detonation performance of this compound. We find: density, 1. 940 g/cm 3; solid phase enthalpy of formation at 298 K, 757 cal/g; detonation velocity, 9. 8 mm/μs; detonation pressure, 444 kbar; impact sensitivity, h 50 ~ 40 cm.

40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to {{determine}} the enzyme kinetics for Pseudomonas species lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of substrate 4 -nitrophenyl butyrate in the presence of nitro compounds such as nitroglycerin, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), picric acid, styphnic acid, hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitrotriazocine (RDX), octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitrotriazocine (HMX) and <b>hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (HNIW) in vitro. Kinetically, picric acid and styphnic acid were the mixed-type inhibitors but TNT, RDX and HNIW were the essential activators of the enzyme {{in the presence of a}} detergent triton-X 100. Interestingly, HMX and nitroglycerin were neither an inhibitor nor an activator of the enzyme. From chemical structure point of view, hydrophilic nitro compounds such as picric acid and styphnic acid are capable to enter, the hydrophilic active site of lipase and become inhibitors of the enzyme, while hydrophobic nitro compounds such as TNT, RDX and HNIW presumably mix with Triton-X- 100 and bind to the co-lipase binding site of the enzyme and become the essential activators of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the assessment and {{of the development of}} energetic materials can be increased by modelling stability, compatibility, ageing and thermal decomposition of the used components and formulations. All four terms have in common that chemical reactions are the dominating processes, besides for example migration of mobile components. These chemical reactions are only in part controlled by thermodynamics, to a great extend they are controlled kinetically. Kinetic models are formulated and used for mass loss measurements with isothermally operated ovens and TGA (Thermogravimetric Analysis). The models include autocatalytic decomposition and evaporation or decomposition of a minor component beside a main component. A formulation of a general bimolecular reaction in terms of mass loss is useful in compatibility studies. Approximations and simplifications of the autocatalytic models are discussed. The shown applications include new data on <b>hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> crystallized in epsilon-phase (E-HNIW, epsilon-CL 20) and rocket propellant formulations of type HFK containing epsilon-CL 20 as main component.

40|$|<b>Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (CL- 20) is an {{emerging}} explosive that may replace the currently used explosives such as RDX and HMX, but {{little is known}} about its fate in soil. The present study was conducted to determine degradation products of CL- 20 in two sandy soils under abiotic and biotic anaerobic conditions. Biotic degradation was prevalent in the slightly acidic VT soil, which contained a greater organic C content, while the slightly alkaline SAC soil favored hydrolysis. CL- 20 degradation was accompanied by the formation of formate, glyoxal, nitrite, ammonium, and nitrous oxide. Biotic degradation of CL- 20 occurred through the formation of its denitrohydrogenated derivative (m/z 393 Da) while hydrolysis occurred through the formation of a ring cleavage product (m/z 156 Da) that was tentatively identified as CH 2 N 2 ̆ 013 C(N 2 ̆ 013 NO 2) 2 ̆ 013 CH N 2 ̆ 013 CHO or its isomer N(NO 2) CH 2 ̆ 013 CH N 2 ̆ 013 CO 2 ̆ 013 CH NH.

40|$|<b>Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (HNIW) or CL- 20 is a caged {{structure}} polycyclic nitramine {{that may}} replace RDX and HMX {{as a common}} use energetic chemical. To {{provide insight into the}} environmental fate of CL- 20 we photolyzed the chemical in a Rayonet photoreactor (254 - 350 nm) and with sunlight in aqueous solutions. Previously, we found that initial photodenitration of the monocyclic nitramine RDX leads to ring cleavage and decomposition. Presently, we found that photolysis of the rigid molecule CL- 20 produced NO 2 -, NO 3 -, NH 3, HCOOH, N 2 and N 2 O. Using LC/MS (ES-) we detected several key intermediates carrying important information on the initial steps involved in the degradation of CL- 20. The identities of the intermediates were confirmed using a uniformly ring labeled 15 N-(CL- 20). When CL- 20 was photolyzed in the presence of H 218 O, D 2 O or 18 O 2 we obtained a product distribution suggesting that the energetic chemical degraded via at least two initial routes; one involved sequential homolysis of N-NO 2 bond(s) and another involved photorearrangement prior to hydrolytic ring cleavage and decomposition in water.

40|$|A differential/integral {{method to}} {{estimate}} the kinetic parameters (apparent activation energy Ea and pre-exponential factor A) for thermal decomposition reaction of energetic materials based on Kooij formula are applied to study the nonisothermal decomposition reaction kinetics of <b>hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (HNIW) by analyzing nonisothermal DSC curve data. The apparent activation energy (Ea) obtained by the integral isoconversional non-isothermal method based on Kooij formula is used to check the constancy and validity of apparent activation energy by the differential/integral method based on Kooij formula. The most probable mechanism function of thermal decomposition reaction of HNIW is determined by a logical choice method.

Results of Microtox (15 -min contact) and 96 -h algae growth inhibition tests indicate that CL- 20 showed no {{adverse effects on}} the bioluminescence of marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the cell density of freshwater green algae Selenastrum capricornutum respectively, up to its water solubility (ca. 3. 6 mg 1 - 1). CL- 20 and its possible biotransformation products did not inhibit seed germination and early seedling (16 - 19 d) growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) up to 10 000 mg kg- 1 in a Sassafras sandy loam soil (SSL). Indigenous soil microorganisms in SSL and a garden soil were exposed to CL- 20 {{for one or two}} weeks before dehydrogenase activity (DHA) or potential nitrification activity (PNA) were assayed. Results indicate that up to 10 000 mg kg- 1 soil of CL- 20 had no statistically significant effects on microbial communities measured as DHA or on the ammonium oxidizing bacteria determined as PNA in both soils. Data indicates that CL- 20 was not acutely toxic to the species or microbial communities tested and that further studies are required to address the potential long-term environmental impact of CL- 20 and its possible degradation products.

40|$|Energetic cocrystals are a {{new class}} of {{materials}} that consist of two or more reactive species in a unique crystal structure. The multicomponent crystal structure can possess significantly different properties than either component, and therefore it is possible that ignition phenomenon could be different than a physical mixture. In this paper we report the time to ignition and reaction dynamics of cocrystallized HNIW energetic materials under CO 2 laser heating. An effort was made to minimize the material used in comparison to previous laser ignition. 1 : 1 molar Trinitrotoluene (TNT) : <b>Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (CL- 20) produced by slurry and precipitation methods and 1 : 2 molar cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) :CL- 20 produced by slurry and LabRAM methods were investigated in addition to the individual constituents and equivalent molar physical mixes for each. Cylindrical pellets with diameters of 3. 2 mm and heights between 1 and 2 mm were pressed of each material and a CO 2 laser was used to ignite the samples at irradiances ranging from 310 to 1446 W/cm 2. Visual light data was collected with a high speed camera and ultraviolet (UV) spectral data was collected with spectrometer coupled to a UV streak camera. Additionally, high speed schlieren imaging was performed to investigate the ignition dynamics prior to light generation. Ignition was characterized by both a ‘fully developed flame kernel’ and ‘first effect’ criteria in order for a more accurate comparison between materials. The cocrystallized materials were found to generate gas quicker than the constituents or a physical mixture although the times to the final flame kernel were less conclusive. Specific species identified with the spectrometer include OH and CN. Qualitatively the cocrystallized materials ignited similarly to their constituents. In particular the TNT:CL- 20 cocrystals ignited similarly to CL- 20 at low irradiances but resembled TNT at higher irradiances. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane,</b> or CL- 20, is an {{emerging}} highly energetic compound currently under consideration for military applications. With the anticipated wide use of CL- 20, {{there is the}} potential for soil and groundwater contamination resulting in adverse toxicologic effects on environmental receptors. Presently, {{there is a lack of}} data describing the toxic effects of CL- 20 on avian species. The present study describes the effect of CL- 20 on Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) modified from standard toxicity test guidelines. First, a 14 -day subacute assay was adopted using repeated gavage doses (0, 307, 964, 2439, 3475, or 5304 mg CL- 20 /kg body weight (BW) /d for 5 days followed by no CL- 20 exposure (vehicle only) for 10 days. Second, a subchronic feeding assay (0, 11, 114, or 1085 mg CL- 20 /kg feed) was done for 42 days. During both studies, no overt toxicity was observed in the CL- 202 ̆ 013 treated birds. During the first 5 days of the subacute study, CL- 202 ̆ 013 exposed birds showed a dose-dependent decrease in BW gain, whereas increased liver weight, plasma sodium, and creatinine levels were observed in birds receiving the highest dose tested. For the subchronic study, embryo weights were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Embryos from CL- 202 ̆ 013 exposed birds were observed to have multiple cranial and facial deformities, beak curvatures, possible mid-brain enlargement, and classic one-sided development with microopthalamia (nonstatistical comparisons with control embryos). A trend toward decreased number of eggs laid per female bird was also observed. We conclude that CL- 20 (or its degradation products) elicits few effects in adults but may affect avian development, although these preliminary findings should be confirmed.

40|$|<b>Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (CL- 20), a new {{polycyclic}} polynitramine, has {{the same}} functional nitramine groups (N-NO 2) as the widely used energetic chemicals hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazacyclohexane (royal demolition explosive [RDX]) and octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine (high-melting explosive [HMX]). Potential impacts of CL- 20 as an emerging contaminant must be assessed before its use. The effects of CL- 20, RDX, or HMX on adult survival and juvenile production by potworms Enchytraeus albidus and Enchytraeus crypticus were studied in three soil types, including Sassafras sandy loam (1. 2 % organic matter [OM], 11 % clay, pH 5. 5), an agricultural soil (42 % OM, 1 % clay, pH 8. 2), and a composite agricultural-forest soil (23 % OM, 2 % clay, pH 7. 9) by using ISO method 16387 (International Standard Organization, Geneva, Switzerland). Results showed that CL- 20 was toxic to E. crypticus with median lethal concentration values for adult survival ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mg/kg dry mass (DM) when using the three tested soils. In addition, CL- 20 adversely affected juvenile production by both species in all soils tested, with median effective concentration (EC 50) values ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 62 mg/kg DM. Enchytraeus crypticus and E. albidus were similarly sensitive to CL- 20 exposure in the composite agricultural-forest soil, which supported reproduction by both species and enabled comparisons. Correlation analysis showed weak or no relationship overall among the soil properties and reproduction toxicity endpoints. Neither RDX nor HMX affected (p > 0. 05) adult survival of either species below 658 and 918 mg/kg DM, respectively, indicating that CL- 20 is more toxic to enchytraeids than RDX or HMX. Examination of data shows that CL- 20 {{should be considered as}} a potential reproductive toxicant to soil invertebrates, and that safeguards should be considered to minimize the potential for release of CL- 20 into the environment.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} model the behaviour of energetic materials under operational {{conditions it is}} essential to obtain detailed structural information for these compounds at elevated temperature and/or pressures. The structural characterisation of the high explosives RDX and CL- 20 and a series of inorganic azides [Mn+(N 3) n] at extreme conditions is described herein. In addition to the characterisation of a highly metastable β -form of RDX (1, 3, 5 - trinitrohexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) at atmospheric pressure, the structure solution of a high-pressure/ high-temperature polymorph is described. This form, obtained above 4. 3 GPa and 450 K, {{has been shown to be}} distinct from the β -form and has therefore been denoted - RDX. Furthermore, ε -RDX is sufficiently metastable to allow its recovery to ambient pressure at 150 K; it only transforms to the α -form upon warming to 230 K. Finally, the ambient-temperature compression of RDX has been investigated to a maximum pressure of 23. 0 GPa, using methanol:ethanol (4 : 1) as the pressure-transmitting medium; no phase transition was observed under these conditions, other than the α → γ transition at 3. 9 GPa. The structure of a high-pressure polymorph of CL- 20 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 - <b>hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane)</b> has also been determined by a combination of powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compression of γ -CL- 20 to above 0. 7 GPa using Fluorinert (FC- 77) as the pressure-transmitting medium results in a phase transition to the ζ -form, which has been found to display structural similarities with both theγ γ - and ε -forms. The high-pressure behaviour of CL- 20, however, depends markedly on the starting polymorph and the pressure-transmitting medium selected. Compression of γ -CL- 20 in MeOH:EtOH (4 : 1) results in the formation of a 2 : 1 CL- 20 :MeOH solvate at 0. 5 GPa. This solvate is stable upon compression to P > 5. 0 GPa. It may also be recovered to ambient pressure at 293 K. Meanwhile, no phase transition is observed during the compression of ε -CL- 20 to a maximum pressure of 7. 2 GPa. Finally, a series of inorganic azides [NaN 3, CsN 3, TlN 3, NH 4 N 3, AgN 3 and Pb(N 3) 2] has been characterised under a range of pressure and temperature conditions. Of the six compounds studied, all displayed at least one polymorphic transition – 5 new forms have been structurally characterised in this work and evidence of another 5 is presented. The combined effect of pressure and temperature results in sodium azide adopting a tetragonal structure common to larger alkali metal azides. Caesium azide has been shown to undergo three phase transitions during compression to 6. 0 GPa – the structure of the first high-pressure form is reported. A variable temperature X-ray powder diffraction study of TlN 3 has allowed the structural characterisation of the low-temperature TlN 3 -IV (at 230 K) as well as providing evidence for a phase transition to a high-temperature form above 550 K. The high-pressure form III (obtained above 0. 76 GPa) has also been determined by neutron powder diffraction. Silver, ammonium and lead(II) azides have all been shown to undergo a phase transition at high pressures. Compression of silver azide (P > 0. 80 GPa) removes an orthorhombic distortion observed at atmospheric pressure, resulting in the tetragonal structure adopted by CsN 3 and TlN 3 under ambient conditions. Moreover, NH 4 N 3 and Pb(N 3) 2 have been found to undergo phase transitions at 2. 6 GPa, although their high-pressure structures have still to be determined...|$|E
