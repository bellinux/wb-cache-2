25|$|This {{construction}} permits free {{expansion and}} contraction of each plate individually under the varying influence {{of heat and}} centrifugal force and possesses {{a number of other}} advantages which are of considerable practical importance. A larger active plate area and consequently more power is obtained for a given width, improving efficiency. Warping is virtually eliminated and smaller side clearances may be used, which results in diminished leakage and friction losses. The rotor is better adapted for <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> and through rubbing friction resists disturbing influences thereby ensuring quieter running. For this reason and also because the discs are not rigidly joined it is protected against damage which might otherwise be caused by vibration or excessive speed.|$|E
25|$|The zero moment point (ZMP) is the {{algorithm}} used by robots such as Honda's ASIMO. The robot's onboard computer {{tries to keep}} the total inertial forces (the combination of Earth's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor reaction force (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no moment (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over). However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, {{some of whom have}} pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory. ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.|$|E

[Purpose] This study {{examined}} the relationship between the center of pressure (COP) displacement time during the stance subphases and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability when elderly cross obstacles 0, 10, and 40 cm in height. [Subjects] Fifteen older adults were enrolled in this study (≥ 65 years of age). [Methods] An F-Scan System was used to measure the COP displacement time when subjects crossed obstacles 0, 10, and 40 cm in height, and the Dynamic Gait Index, Berg Balance Scale, and Four Square Step Test were used to measure <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability. [Results] The Dynamic Gait Index, Berg Balance Scale, and Four Square Step Test were correlated with each other. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> tests were correlated with the COP displacement time during the stance phase. At obstacle heights of 10 and 40 cm during loading response and at all heights during pre-swing, there were correlations with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability. However, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability did not affect the COP displacement time during mid-stance and terminal stance. [Conclusion] People with a lower <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability show a larger COP displacement time during loading response and pre-swing. Therefore, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability can be predicted by measuring the COP displacement time...|$|R

40|$|Background: Poor <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance,</b> {{which is}} common after stroke, may affect gait function. In particular, spatiotemporal {{asymmetrical}} gait patterns may occur in hemiplegic patients after stroke. Objective: This study aimed {{to assess the}} relationship between <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and spatiotemporal gait symmetry in patients with chronic hemiplegic stroke. Methods: To calculate symmetry ratios for step length (spatial parameter) and swing time (temporal parameter), 41 patients with chronic stroke walked at a comfortable speed. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> measures included limit of stability (LOS) during standing and heel-to-heel base of support (H-H BOS) during gait. Analysis of correlations between various measures was performed. Results: The overall LOS score correlated with temporal gait symmetry (r= 0. 66). The forward, backward, paretic, and non-paretic direction LOS scores were related to temporal gait symmetry (r= 0. 38 â 0. 62). The H-H BOS was correlated with temporal (r=â 0. 63) and spatial (r=â 0. 36) gait symmetries. Other <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> variables were not significantly correlated with spatial gait symmetry. Conclusion: Thus, control of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> abilities {{is related to the}} magnitude of temporal gait symmetry. This observation suggests that rehabilitation strategies that improve <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> may enhance temporal gait symmetry in post-stroke patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> {{and quiet}} {{standing}} balance are decreased in knee osteoarthritis (OA), with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> being more affected. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of a group exercise programme of lower extremity muscles integrated with education on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> using the Star Excursion Balance test (SEBT) in knee OA. METHODS: Experimental before-and-after pilot study design. Nineteen participants with knee OA attended the exercise sessions once a week for six weeks, in addition to home exercises. Before and after the exercise programme, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> was assessed using the SEBT in the anterior and medial directions in addition to hip and knee muscle strength, pain, and function. RESULTS: Fourteen participants completed the study. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> on the affected side demonstrated significant improvements in the anterior and medial directions (p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 01, respectively). The contralateral side demonstrated significant improvements in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in the anterior direction (p< 0. 001). However, balance in the medial direction did not change significantly (p= 0. 07). Hip and knee muscle strength, pain, and function significantly improved (p< 0. 05) after the exercise programme. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore the effect of an exercise programme on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> using the SEBT in knee OA. The exercise programme was effective in improving <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> which is required in different activities of daily living where the patients might experience the risk of falling.

40|$|Maintaining <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> is an {{important}} component of walking function that is likely impaired in chronic stroke survivors, evidenced by an increased prevalence of falls. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control requires maintaining the center of mass (COM) within the base of support during movement. During walking, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control is achieved largely by modifying foot placement to adjust the base of support. However, chronic stroke survivors have difficulty with both precision control of foot placement, as well as reduced control of COM movement. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control strategies during walking in chronic stroke survivors. Additionally, we evaluated whether altered sensory feedback could be used to improve balance control in stroke survivors. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control was characterized during challenging walking conditions in stroke survivors and age-matched neurologically intact individuals. Adaptations to perturbations in frontal plane COM, induced using a custom cable-driven device, were used to further probe mechanisms of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control. Despite larger amounts of COM movement and step widths, chronic stroke survivors produced a similar ratio of step width to COM sway, indicating that simply increasing step width does not produce a safer walking pattern for the stroke group. Placement of the paretic limb was unchanged in response to the external perturbations of trunk movement, which might underlie deficits in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control. Augmented sensory feedback improved paretic foot placement and COM control, when applied during a stepping or treadmill walking task. These results provide insight into differences in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control in stroke while also demonstrating that augmented sensory feedback signals might be used to improve balance control, and thus walking function for chronic stroke survivors...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Assessing the {{recovery}} of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> after intravenous sedation in the elderly is important for ensuring their safe discharge, especially when they are walking.

Methods Midazolam was administered in divided doses, until the Wilson sedation score reached 3, in 18 elderly male volunteers. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> test using CDP with perturbation stimuli was performed before and after sedation. As simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> tests, the usual-speed walking (USW) and maximum-speed walking (MSW) tests and a modified timed “up and go” (TUG) test (subjects stand up from a chair, walk 5 [*]m forward and return to the chair with MSW, and sit down again) were performed.
