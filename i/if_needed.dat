5|$|After Britain {{declared}} war on Germany in September 1939, Auden told the British embassy in Washington that {{he would return to}} the UK <b>if</b> <b>needed.</b> He was told that, among those his age (32), only qualified personnel were needed. In 1941–42 he taught English at the University of Michigan. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, <b>if</b> <b>needed</b> repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E

5|$|Away colours {{have tended}} to be either white—often with black shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available <b>if</b> <b>needed</b> for European games, or {{in the event of a}} clash involving both red and white.|$|E
5|$|In early 1969, Anders {{accepted}} {{a job with}} the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable <b>if</b> <b>needed)</b> and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance <b>if</b> <b>needed,</b> especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E

The distance from the bottom bracket to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars <b>if</b> <b>needed</b> before the start.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{speculates that}} Gregory had {{originally intended to}} send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues {{that it was the}} lack of any bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop <b>if</b> <b>needed.</b> Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if they no longer had their own bishop and agent in place.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently <b>if</b> <b>needed.</b> On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|During the Harrier's {{service the}} RAF {{positioned}} {{the bulk of}} the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, <b>if</b> <b>needed,</b> forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.|$|E
