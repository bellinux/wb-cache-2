40|$|Ferric (oxyhydro-) oxides (FeOx) {{precipitate}} in the rhizosphere at {{neutral or}} alkaline pH and are adsorbed {{on the plant}} root surfaces. Consequently, the higher binding affinity of arsenate to FeOx and the low iron phytoavailability of the precipitated FeOx make the phytoremediation of arsenic difficult. In the present study, the influence of chelating ligands on arsenic and iron uptake by hydroponically grown rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) was investigated. When chelating ligands were not treated to the growth medium, about 63 and 71 % of the total arsenic and iron were distributed in the root extract (outer root surfaces) of rice, respectively. On the other hand, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) and hydroxyiminodisuccinic acid (HIDS) desorbed {{a significant amount of}} arsenic from FeOx of the outer root surfaces. Therefore, the uptake of arsenic and iron into the roots and their subsequent translocation to the shoots of the rice seedlings increased significantly. The order of increasing arsenic uptake by chelating ligands was HIDS > EDTA > EDDS. Methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA) and <b>iminodisuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (IDS) might not be effective in arsenic solubilization from FeOx. The results suggest that EDDS and HIDS would be a good and environmentally safe choice to accelerate arsenic phytoavailability in the phytoremediation process because of their biodegradability and would be a competent alternative to the widely used non-biodegradable and environmentally persistent EDTA. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{chelating}} ligands on iron movement in growth medium, iron bioavailability, and growth of radish sprouts (Raphanus sativus) were investigated. Iron is an important nutrient for plant growth, yet the insoluble state of iron hydroxides in alkaline conditions decreases its bioavailability. Iron chelates increase iron uptake and {{have been used in}} agriculture to correct iron chlorosis. While previous studies have reported {{the effects of}} chelating ligands on iron solubility and bioavailability, the present study elucidates the pattern of iron movement by chelating ligands in plant growth medium. The apparent mobility of iron in growth medium was calculated using a ' 4 -box' model. Ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) and hydroxy-iminodisuccinic acid (HIDS) produced the highest apparent mobility of iron from the bottom layer of the medium (initially 10 - 4 M Fe(III)) to the upper layer (no iron), followed by glutamatediacetic acid (GLDA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA), and <b>iminodisuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (IDS). Iron movement in the growth medium was influenced by the chelating ligand species, pH, and ligand exposure time. The iron uptake and growth of radish sprouts were related to the iron mobility produced by the chelating ligands. These results suggest that, in alkaline media, chelating ligands dissolve the hardly soluble iron hydroxide species, thus increasing iron mobility, iron uptake, and plant growth. HIDS, which is biodegradable, {{was one of the most}} effective ligands studied; therefore, this compound would be a good alternative to other environmentally persistent chelating ligands. © 2011 Elsevier B.

25|$|Commercially {{used since}} 1998, <b>iminodisuccinic</b> (IDS) <b>acid</b> biodegrades about 80% after only 7 days. IDS binds to calcium {{exceptionally}} well and forms stable compounds with other heavy metal ions. In {{addition to having}} a lower toxicity after chelation, the production of IDS is environment-friendly. Specifically, IDS is degraded {{through the use of}} IDS-epimerase and C–N lyase found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (BY6) which can be harvested on a large scale. Additionally, the reactions catalyzed by both enzymes do not require any cofactors and can thus be applied directly.|$|R
40|$|The complex {{formation}} equilibria of Cr 3 + and Fe 3 + ions in {{aqueous solution}} with two biodegradable aminopolycarboxylate chelants (dl- 2 -(2 -carboxymethyl) nitrilotriacetic acid (GLDA) and 3 -hydroxy- 2, 2 '- <b>iminodisuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> (HIDS)) were investigated. The potentiometric data obtained at the constant ionic strengths (I) of (0. 1 and 1. 0) mol·dm- 3 KCl and at (25 ± 0. 1) °C was processed {{with the aid of}} the computer program HYPERQUAD 2008. The formation constants of the proton-chelant and metal-chelant (log KML) species (M = Fe 3 + or Cr 3 +; L = GLDA or HIDS) were determined, and the concentration distributions of complex species in solution were evaluated for both metal ions. In various pH conditions, the interaction between the chelants (L = GLDA or HIDS) and the metal ions (M = Fe 3 + or Cr 3 +) leads to the formation of different complexes formulated as MH 2 L+, MHL, ML-, M(OH) L 2 -, and M(OH) 2 L 3 -. The log KML values at I = 0. 1 mol·dm- 3 KCl (T = (25 ± 0. 1) °C) were 15. 27 (log KFe-GLDA), 14. 96 (log K Fe-HIDS), 13. 77 (log KCr-GLDA), 12. 67 (log K Cr-HIDS), and at I = 1. 0 mol·dm- 3 KCl (T = (25 ± 0. 1) °C) were 14. 79 (log KFe-GLDA), 14. 34 (log K Fe-HIDS), 12. 90 (log KCr-GLDA), 12. 09 (log K Cr-HIDS). The conditional stability constants (log K'ML) of the ML complexes were calculated in terms of pH in the range of 2 to 12 and compared with the same for EDTA and other biodegradable chelants (NTA and EDDS). © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E

A total of 79 ± 20, 87 ± 6, 116 ± 15, and 63 ± 18 mg dry biomass of rice seedlings were produced with the addition of 0. 5 mM of EDDS, EDTA, HIDS, and IDS in the nutrient solution, respectively. The Fe concentrations in rice tissues were 117 ± 15, 82 ± 8, 167 ± 25, and 118 ± 22 μmol g- 1 dry weights when 0. 25 mM of EDDS, EDTA, HIDS, and IDS were added to the nutrient solution, respectively. Most of the Fe accumulated in rice tissues was stored in roots after the addition of chelating ligands in the solution. The results indicate that the HIDS would be a potential alternative to environmentally persistent EDTA for the increase of Fe uptake and plant growth. The HIDS also increased As uptake in rice root though its translocation from root to shoot was not augmented. This study reports HIDS {{for the first time as}} a promising chelating ligand for the enhancement of Fe bioavailability and As phytoextraction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
