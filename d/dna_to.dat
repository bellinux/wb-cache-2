5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA {{that carries}} {{information}} from <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> the ribosome, {{the sites of}} protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes).|$|E

50|$|Due to its cyclic structure, {{isophorone}} {{has been}} assigned <b>to</b> <b>DNA</b> binding in various studies. The Isoc form {{was found to have}} the highest affinity <b>to</b> <b>DNA.</b> <b>DNA</b> was found <b>to</b> be modified upon binding of isophorone derivatives. The Isob derivative interacts with the <b>DNA</b> leading <b>to</b> deformation of the right handed double helical structure.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> Mulder. Scully has the samples tested and confirms the DNA's non-terrestrial origin, but is {{attacked by a}} man who steals the samples. Scully learns that her attacker is Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee. When she tracks down Kritschgau and holds him at gunpoint, he reveals that he might be killed.|$|E

Galactic Federation scientists surgically remove {{large portions of}} her corrupted Power Suit and inject her with the Metroid hatchling's <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> save her. To prevent the now-dubbed X Parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to crash into the planet, during which she contends with the SA-X, an X Parasite that was born from her infected Power Suit pieces and possesses all of her abilities.|$|E

5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Sarah Jane being captured by an alien, who uses her <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> impersonate her, and frame her for stealing an important piece of alien merchandise. Sarah would have used her gadgets to fight her clone. This story however, was very similar to Sarah Jane in Prison, so it was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
50|$|Protein-DNA {{interactions}} {{occur when}} a protein binds a molecule of <b>DNA,</b> often <b>to</b> regulate the biological function of DNA, usually {{the expression of}} a gene. Among the proteins that bind <b>to</b> <b>DNA</b> are transcription factors that activate or repress gene expression by binding <b>to</b> <b>DNA</b> motifs and histones that form part of the structure of <b>DNA</b> and bind <b>to</b> it less specifically. Also proteins that repair DNA such as uracil-DNA glycosylase interact closely with it.|$|R

5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> Fox Mulder. Both Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) eventually meet Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee who claims that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is a lie. Kritschgau tells Mulder that his sister Samantha Mulder's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body discovered in Canada was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for the military–industrial complex. Distraught by Kritschgau's claims, Mulder loses his faith. Later, the FBI investigates Mulder's apparent suicide. Scully confirms the unseen body's identity.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, {{descendants}} of Edwin Booth {{reported that they}} obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor's body to obtain DNA samples to compare {{with a sample of}} his brother John's <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> refute the rumor that John had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin's body. The family hoped to obtain samples of John Wilkes's DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokeswoman Carol Johnson announced that the family's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.|$|E
40|$|Blood samples {{containing}} antibodies <b>to</b> <b>DNA</b> {{were obtained}} from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rabbits immunized with denatured <b>DNA</b> complexed <b>to</b> methylated bovine serum albumin. The immunoglobulin fractions from these sources did not decrease the over-all template activity of singlestranded DNA with DNA polymerase or DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In competition studies, both DNA polymerase and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibited the binding of <b>DNA</b> antibodies <b>to</b> single-stranded <b>DNA,</b> as evidenced by inhibition of micro-complement fixation. These findings suggest that antibodies <b>to</b> <b>DNA</b> fail <b>to</b> decrease denatured <b>DNA</b> template activity because the enzymes which use a single-stranded DNA template can displace or block the antibodies from the denatured DNA {{as a result of}} greater binding affinity <b>to</b> the denatured <b>DNA.</b> The anti-DNA antibodies associated with SLE, therefore, may not be involved in the pathogenesis of the intracellular abnormalities associated with the disease...|$|R

5|$|Kyo is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of The King of Fighters '99, and has no team. In the story, Kyo is kidnapped by the NESTS syndicate to use his <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> make various clones of himself. He tries to obtain answers personally from his captors entering their base but is forced to retreat when the place around him begins to collapse. Depending on how many points the player has when the game finishes, Kyo can be faced as a bonus fight. He continues his fight against the NESTS alone in The King of Fighters 2000 {{and in the next}} game, Kyo reunites with his old teammates, and his student Shingo Yabuki, to make a comeback on the Japan Team. In KOF 2002, Kyo is a playable character on the original Japan Team.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
5|$|The Sound Four do {{not become}} a {{prominent}} {{part of the story}} until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness {{in the midst of his}} battle against Gaara and Rock Lee. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces. In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> access their abilities.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Kary Mullis {{was working at}} Cetus Corporation on the {{application}} of synthetic <b>DNAs</b> <b>to</b> biotechnology. He {{was familiar with the}} use of DNA oligonucleotides as probes for binding <b>to</b> target <b>DNA</b> strands, as well as their use as primers for DNA sequencing and cDNA synthesis. In 1983, he began using two primers, one to hybridize to each strand of a target DNA, and adding <b>DNA</b> polymerase <b>to</b> the reaction. This led <b>to</b> exponential <b>DNA</b> replication, greatly amplifying the amounts of DNA between the primers.|$|R
40|$|Several {{homologous}} hamster embryonic cell lines, {{transformed in}} association with simian virus (SV) 40 infection, were examined {{for the presence of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (<b>DNA)</b> complementary <b>to</b> SV 40 ribonucleic acid (RNA) made in vitro. The methods employed permitted the detection of 10 − 5 μg of viral DNA in 100 μg of cellular <b>DNA,</b> corresponding <b>to</b> one-fifth of an SV 40 DNA molecule per cell. Those lines which contained both the SV 40 surface (S) and tumor (T) antigens also contained <b>DNA</b> complementary <b>to</b> SV 40 RNA synthesized in vitro. In contrast, neither of two lines which contained S, but not T, antigen contained detectable <b>DNA</b> complementary <b>to</b> SV 40 RNA. These findings suggest that the production of S antigen does not depend upon the persistence of SV 40 DNA in transformed cells...|$|R

5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their <b>DNA</b> <b>to</b> be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E
