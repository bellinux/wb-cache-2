5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} {{strong ties}} to its history and traditions. During Briarcliff Manor's 1952 semicentennial, nine people served on the <b>Historical</b> Committee and published a village history book. In March 1974, after the mayor appointed twelve people for a 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough <b>Historical</b> Society (BMSHS). The <b>historical</b> society published an updated village history (A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The <b>historical</b> society was initially located at the since-demolished Briarcliff Middle School building; it later moved {{to the second floor}} of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and moved back to the school building after it was leased by Pace University. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O'Connor Weber <b>Historical</b> Center, established as part of the expanded Briarcliff Manor Public Library.

The jail, which had been abandoned by the state in June of the same year, was selected by the Society as its new home and leased from the state.

5|$|Modern {{research}} on the <b>historical</b> Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the <b>historical</b> figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of <b>historical</b> sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} <b>historical</b> novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the <b>historical</b> record, Shelley uses their {{narratives}} to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other <b>historical</b> novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive <b>historical</b> narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
