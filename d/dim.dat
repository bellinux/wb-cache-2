40|$|We report {{observations}} of a two-stage coronal <b>dimming</b> in an eruptive {{event of a}} two-ribbon flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME). Weak gradual <b>dimming</b> persists {{for more than half}} an hour before the onset of the two-ribbon flare and the fast rise of the CME. It is followed by abrupt rapid <b>dimming.</b> The two-stage <b>dimming</b> occurs in a pair of conjugate <b>dimming</b> regions adjacent to the two flare ribbons, and the flare onset marks the transition between the two stages of <b>dimming.</b> At the onset of the two-ribbon flare, transient brightenings are also observed inside the <b>dimming</b> regions, before rapid <b>dimming</b> occurs at the same places. These observations suggest that the CME structure, most probably anchored at the twin <b>dimming</b> regions, undergoes a slow rise before the flare onset, and its kinematic evolution has significantly changed at the onset of flare reconnection.

25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} <b>dimmer</b> switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control <b>dimmer</b> interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. <b>Dimming</b> installations require a compatible <b>dimming</b> ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream.
