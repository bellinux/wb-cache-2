500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual <b>insulation</b> <b>failure.</b> [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2012, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{electrical}} transformers involved in the ship's propulsion system failed, after an earlier engineers report highlighted [...] "overheating of the propulsion motors and transformers". Inspection found that <b>insulation</b> <b>failure</b> had short-circuited the transformer, while other transformers aboard showed premature wear. Unable to find an available spare, a new unit had to be ordered from the manufacturer. In June, it was predicted that Choules would be out of service for four to five months, but by October, claims were made that the ship would be inoperable until at least January 2013, and if all of the wear-showing transformers were replaced, she would not return to service until April 2013. By December, the faulty transformer had been replaced, and the RAN had decided that although the other transformers (propulsion and others) had been shown to have acceptable levels of wear, all would be replaced before Choules was reactivated. These repairs were completed in early 2013, and the ship was assessed as ready to re-enter service on 12 April.|$|E

50|$|Each circuit detects {{a defined}} section of track, {{such as a}} block. These {{sections}} are separated by insulated joints, usually in both rails. To prevent one circuit from falsely powering another {{in the event of}} <b>insulation</b> <b>failure,</b> the electrical polarity is usually reversed from section to section. Circuits are powered at low voltages (1.5 to 12 V DC). The relays and the power supply are attached to opposite ends of the section to prevent broken rails from electrically isolating part of the track from the circuit. A series resistor limits the current when the track circuit is short-circuited.|$|E
50|$|Electrical treeing often {{occurs in}} {{high-voltage}} equipment prior to causing complete breakdown.

The insulation is unrolled (in the case of paper insulation) or sliced in thin slices (in the case of solid insulating materials). The results are then sketched or photographed to create a record of the breakdown process.|$|E

The maximum acceptable value is generally 0.5 ohms although certain standards may specify 0.1 ohms. This test is generally carried out at a slightly higher current (e.g. 25-60 A) so that the ground bond circuit maintains safe voltages on the chassis of the product, even at a high current, before the circuit breaker trips. This test is essential so that the product does not cause an electric shock resulting from <b>insulation</b> <b>failure.</b> In India current specified is 16 A so the test is done at double of the current i.e. 32 A.|$|E
