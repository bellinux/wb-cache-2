5|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{become involved in the}} social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other parties}} sought to be {{involved}} in the case as amici curiae, Amnesty International (represented by former Federal Court Justice Ron Merkel), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However both their applications were rejected, because they could not assist the court in a way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic.|$|E

Our approach involves relativistic kinematics via the addition law of relativistic velocities. Comment: Submitted to American Journal of Physic...|$|R
50|$|Notably, Jews in the UK {{benefitted from}} formal {{emancipation}} <b>in</b> 1858, after <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> become skilled tradesmen and conduct business freely without taking Christian oaths.|$|R
25|$|Peshawari and Shikarpuri Indian traders were {{involved}} in Central Asia. The Shikarpuri invested in grain in the Bukharan Emirate as well as Ferghana cotton/. They also engaged in legal money lending <b>in</b> Bukhara, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not legally do in Russian Turkestan. Jews, Hindus, Baluch, Persians, and Arabs lived in Samargand, and Hindus and Bahais live in Baluchistan and Khorasan in Iran.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In {{stark contrast to the}} industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{first entered}} Semarang, Dutch East Indies, {{in what is}} now Central Java, Indonesia, in the early 19th century. In 1808 Father Lambertus Prinsen (1777–1840) was sent from the Netherlands to the Indies as the pastor for Semarang and several {{surrounding}} settlements, including Salatiga and Klaten. He quickly established a council for handling religious duties, and baptisms began the following year; fourteen people, mostly Dutch, were baptised in 1809. However, this congregation did not have a church <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pray. Until 1815 the congregation used the nearby Immanuel Church, a building intended for Protestants. Between 1815 and 1822 services were held at the homes of members of the congregation, then from 7 August 1822 Mass was held at Prinsen's new home (near Immanuel).|$|E
50|$|The game {{is played}} with a 30-card {{stripped}} deck limited to all 8s onwards for all suits except for the 7 of Hearts and the 7 of Spades. The 7s are not considered high trumps (spade highest) except in some variants where they are regular cards (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>could</b> also be of any suit).|$|R
60|$|Only {{a little}} talking was allowed {{throughout}} the meal, but at its conclusion the cadets {{were given an}} hour off, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> time <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do very much as they pleased. In that hour some played games, others took walks, and not a few drifted over to the gymnasium, which stood at {{one corner of the}} grounds.|$|R

5|$|When Frederick III of Habsburg {{ascended to}} the throne, the Swiss {{suddenly}} faced {{a new situation}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> no longer count on support from the empire. Worse yet, conflicts with the Habsburg dukes threatened to become conflicts with the empire itself. Under Frederick's reign, this did not occur yet. Frederick had sided in 1442 against the confederacy in the Old Zürich War where he had supported the city of Zürich, and he also refused to reconfirm the imperial immediacy {{of the members of}} the Confederacy. But Frederick's troubled reign did not leave room for military operations against the Swiss. In Austria, Frederick was in conflict first with his brother Albert and then faced the pressure of Matthias Corvinus, who even drove him from Vienna and forced Frederick's court to assume an itinerant lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|When Jebe and Subutai {{heard of}} the Rus' movements, they began moving east, away from the Rus, which was the only {{direction}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> move. However, they left a rearguard of 1,000 {{under the command of}} an officer, Hamabek, to report of the Rus movements and act as bait. Soon, Mstislav the Bold reached the river opposite the rearguard, and it became apparent that no prince had been appointed commander-in-chief. Thus, all the princes could act as they pleased. Eventually, Mstislav crossed the river under heavy arrow fire. When the Rus landed, however, the Mongol numbers were too great, and the Rus' were killed to the last man.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including that backgrounds were pixilated, the movies and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic. On December 9, 2010, Revolution Software announced the release of Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered on Apple iOS devices, and was finally released on December 16, 2010. The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from Dave Gibbons, fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a Dropbox integration which facilitates a unique cross-platform save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full Game Center integration – including in-game achievements. The Mac and PC versions followed in early 2011.|$|E
50|$|Perpetual curates {{disappeared}} from view <b>in</b> 1868, after <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> legally call themselves vicars, but perpetual curacies remained in law until the distinct status of perpetual curate was abolished by the Pastoral Measure 1968.|$|R
50|$|Artists, {{writers and}} poets in Japan, like {{in other parts}} of the world, would often take on pen names or pseudonyms. These were {{sometimes}} derived from the names of their mentors (particularly in painting studios), <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be considered yagō. But more often these art-names or pen names are called in Japanese kagō (家号) or simply gō (号).|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{newsletter}} was to organize low income people in order that they might change a dehumanizing life situation. They {{felt that there was}} no vehicle through <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be informed of decisions made on their behalf, <b>in</b> terms <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> understand. <b>They</b> also recognized the need for a communication system which would express their feelings about those decisions, and their general situation, something which the established media {{did not seem to be}} doing.|$|R

25|$|Several LSSP {{members were}} {{appointed}} to important posts <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> press forward the party programme: e.g. Anil Moonesinghe became Chairman of the Ceylon Transport Board and theoretician Hector Abhayavardhana was made Chairman of the People's Bank and Doric de Souza was appointed permanent secretary to the Ministry of Plantations.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 79 students, {{participants}} played a game <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> repeatedly give money to others and receive from others. They {{were told that they}} would never interact with the same person in the reciprocal role. A player's history of donating was displayed at each anonymous interaction, and donations were significantly more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. Indirect reciprocity has only been shown to occur in humans.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of local people and passing taxi drivers stopped to collect the fuel oil <b>in</b> containers, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> then sell on {{for a bit of}} extra money, when the {{disaster}} occurred. Apparently, one of the persons collecting fuel was smoking, and dropped a cigarette, creating a flash fire, which travelled right back to the wrecked tankers, creating a massive fireball, which engulfed bystanders and persons collecting fuel.|$|R
50|$|Beside a Palestinian National Charter, which {{describes}} {{the ideology of}} the PLO, a constitution, named “Fundamental Law”, was adopted, which dictates the inner structure of the organization and the representation of the Palestinian people. A draft Constitution was written in 1963, to rule the PLO until free general elections among all the Palestinians in all the countries <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> resided <b>could</b> be held. The Constitution was revised in 1968.|$|R
50|$|It fired 2 {{types of}} high-explosive shells, <b>which</b> {{differed}} only <b>in</b> <b>which</b> fuzes <b>they</b> <b>could</b> accept. It used a three part charge in its cartridge case. Charge 1 yielded a muzzle velocity of 555 m/s. Charge 2 replaced Charge 1 in the cartridge case and propelled the shell with a velocity of 696 m/s. Charge 3 {{was added to}} Charge 2 and raised the muzzle velocity to 757 m/s.|$|R

25|$|Davuls were {{ideal for}} use as {{military}} instruments because of the unique way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be carried. The Ottoman janissaries, for example, hung their davuls at their breasts with thick straps. This {{made it easier for}} the soldiers to carry their instruments from battle to battle. This practice {{does not seem to be}} limited to just the Ottoman Empire, however; in Egypt, drums very similar to davuls were braced with cords, which allowed the Egyptian soldiers to carry them during military movements.|$|E
25|$|Somare's {{political}} {{style was}} both fiercely nationalistic and purportedly conciliatory, following {{the tradition of}} Sana as he professed to see it. One of the roles of Sana is to invite enemies to a feast before any fight. Somare often appointed political enemies to posts <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> exercise their interests and passions. In the lead-up to independence, Somare argued for and won citizenship and residency requirements which were both more severe than the outgoing Australian administration recommended and more moderate than most of his party wished.|$|E
50|$|In {{one of the}} {{paradoxical}} results of slavery, by 1860 most of the college's more than 200 paying students were mixed-race offspring of wealthy southern planters, who gave their children the education <b>in</b> Ohio <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not get <b>in</b> the South. The men were examples of white fathers who did not abandon their mixed-race children, but passed on important social capital {{in the form of}} education; they and others also provided money, property and apprenticeships.|$|R

5000|$|Williams went {{to study}} at Rice University, where he played for the Rice Owls from 2003, in the Western Athletic Conference of the NCAA. The Owls, who were not {{represented}} in the national NCAA finals since 1970 managed {{to qualify for the}} National Invitation Tournament in 2004 and 2005 season, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> each were eliminated in the first round. Subsequently, the Owls were transferred to the Conference USA <b>in</b> <b>which,</b> however, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not improve their season budgets and missed nationwide appearances.|$|R
25|$|The Subaru Legacy is a {{mid-size}} car {{built by}} Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru since 1989. Part {{of the original}} design goals for the Legacy model was to provide Subaru a vehicle <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> compete in the lucrative North American mid-size market against competitors Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Mazda6, and Nissan Altima. Higher performance variants of the Legacy are offered as competitive alternatives to compact executive cars such as the Audi A4, Alfa Romeo 159 and BMW 3 Series. The Legacy also serves as Subaru's flagship car.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the period, {{known as}} Confederate Ireland, in 1649 the only {{remaining}} Parliamentarian outpost in Ireland was in Dublin, under the command of Colonel Michael Jones. A combined Royalist and Confederate force under the Marquess of Ormonde gathered at Rathmines, south of Dublin, to take the city and deprive the Parliamentarians of a port <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> land. Jones, however, launched a surprise attack on the Royalists while they were deploying on 2 August, putting them to flight. Jones claimed to have killed around 4,000 Royalist or Confederate soldiers and taken 2,517 prisoners.|$|E
25|$|International Automobile Importers (IAI) was {{a company}} founded by Malcolm Bricklin to import the X1/9 and 2000 Spider after Fiat halted their manufacture. Bertone and Pininfarina carried on {{production}} {{under their own}} names and Bricklin's IAI took over their U.S. importation. Bricklin wanted to import additional brands, and international dealmaker Armand Hammer had been asked by the Yugoslavs to identify business areas <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> generate exports to bolster their economy. Hammer thought the idea of exporting the small cars made in Kragujevac, Serbia, by Zavodi Crvena Zastava, would be viable. Zastava had, since the mid-19th century, been a quality armaments producer and sponsored its own museum.|$|E
50|$|This {{short story}} {{tells of a}} Tibetan lamasery whose monks seek to list all {{of the names of}} God, since they believe the Universe was created for this purpose, and that once this naming is completed, God will bring the Universe to an end. Three centuries ago, the monks created an {{alphabet}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> calculated <b>they</b> <b>could</b> encode all the possible names of God, numbering about 9,000,000,000 ("nine billion") and each having no more than nine characters. Writing the names out by hand, as they had been doing, even after eliminating various nonsense combinations, would take another 15,000 years; the monks wish to use modern technology to finish this task more quickly.|$|R
50|$|The related theory, {{proposed}} by William Wang in 1969, {{is that all}} sound changes originate in a single word or {{a small group of}} words and then spread to other words with a similar phonological make-up, but may not spread to all words <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> potentially <b>could</b> apply. The theory of lexical diffusion stands in contrast to the Neogrammarian hypothesis that a given sound change applies simultaneously to all words <b>in</b> <b>which</b> its context is found.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning at dawn Leonard rose and, accompanied by Francisco, walked into the courtyard. This time the soldiers {{did not try to}} stop them, but the priests were still standing in front of Juanna's door, looking like spectres in the grey mist. They went to them and signified by signs that they would worship the Queen, but were sternly refused admission <b>in</b> words <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not understand, but that Soa, who was listening, afterwards translated to them.|$|R
