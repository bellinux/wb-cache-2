25|$|Operation Yellow Ribbon was the {{operation}} that Transport Canada created {{to handle the}} diversion of civilian airline flights following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The operation started after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all aircraft across the United States and re-routed incoming international flights to airports in Canada. During {{the operation}}, departing aircraft, {{with the exception of}} police, military, and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>flights</b> were canceled, marking the first time that Canada shut down its airspace. As a result of Operation Yellow Ribbon, 255 aircraft were diverted to 17 different airports across the country.|$|E
25|$|The nation hosts two Airports {{such as the}} Gjakova Airport and {{the only}} International Airport of Pristina. The Gjakova Airport was built by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) {{following}} the Kosovo War, next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>flights.</b> The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership {{with the aim of}} turning it into a civilian and commercial airport. The Pristina International Airport is located southwest of Pristina. It is Kosovo's only international airport and the only port of entry for air travelers to Kosovo.|$|E

25|$|The Army of Republika Srpska was newly established, {{put under}} the command of General Ratko Mladić, in a new phase of the war. Shellings on Sarajevo on 24, 26, 28 and 29 May were {{attributed}} to Mladić by Boutros-Ghali. Civilian casualties of a 27 May shelling of the city led to Western intervention, in the form of sanctions imposed on 30 May through UNSCR 757. That same day Bosnian forces attacked the JNA barracks in the city, which was followed by heavy shelling. On 5 and 6 June the last JNA personnel left the city during heavy street fighting and shelling. The 20 June cease-fire, executed in order for UN takeover of the Sarajevo airport for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>flights,</b> was broken as both sides battled for control of the territory between the city and airport. The airport crisis led to Boutros-Ghali's ultimatum on 26 June, that the Serbs stop attacks on the city, allow the UN {{to take control of the}} airport, and place their heavy weapons under UN supervision. Meanwhile, media reported that Bush considered the use of force in Bosnia. World public opinion was 'decisively and permanently against the Serbs' following media reports on the sniping and shelling of Sarajevo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{airport was}} closed to {{commercial}} air traffic on August 28, 2005, shortly before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, and it remained closed as floods affected the city. The Associated Press reported on August 31 that MSY would receive <b>humanitarian</b> <b>flights,</b> and that the airport [...] "has no significant airfield damage and had no standing water in aircraft movement areas", although the airport did, as the article put it, [...] " [...] damage to its roofs, hangars and fencing."

2500|$|Turkey {{was offered}} {{approximately}} $8.5 billion in loans {{in exchange for}} sending 10,000 peacekeeping troops in 2003. Even though the United States did say the loans and the sending of troops to Iraq were not directly linked, it also said the loans are contingent upon [...] "cooperation" [...] on Iraq. The Turkish government swiftly rejected all offers of financial aid, and on March 1, 2003, the Turkish Grand National Assembly rejected sending military forces to help participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The decision of the Turkish parliament to do so, at the time, was seen as both a response against American interests in the Middle East, {{and a desire to}} keep Turkey out of the Iraq War. The Turkish government, however, allowed all <b>humanitarian</b> <b>flights</b> into and out of Turkey, such as the airlifting of wounded coalition forces.|$|E

2500|$|At {{its peak}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pan Am advertised under the slogan, the [...] "World's Most Experienced Airline". It carried 6.7million {{passengers}} in 1966, and by 1968, its 150 jets flew to 86 countries on every continent except for Antarctica over a scheduled route network of 81,410unduplicated miles (131,000km). During that period the airline was profitable and its cash reserves totaled $1billion. Most routes were between New York, Europe, and South America, and between Miami and the Caribbean. In 1964 Pan Am began a helicopter shuttle between New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports and Lower Manhattan, operated by New York Airways. Aside from the DC-8, the Boeing 707 and 747, the Pan Am jet fleet included Boeing 720Bs and 727s (the first aircraft to sport Pan Am — rather than Pan American — titles). (The airline later had Boeing 737s and 747SPs (which could fly nonstop New York to Tokyo), Lockheed L-1011 Tristars, McDonnell-Douglas DC-10s, and Airbus A300s and A310s.) Pan Am owned the InterContinental Hotel chain and had a financial interest in the Falcon Jet Corporation, which held marketing rights to the Dassault Falcon 20 business jet in North America. The airline was involved in creating a missile-tracking range in the South Atlantic and operating a nuclear-engine testing laboratory in Nevada. In addition, Pan Am participated in several notable <b>humanitarian</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|E

On September 20, 1994, HMM-264 participated in a vertical assault of the Cap Haitian Airport and port facilities. This event marked the first Marine landing in Haiti since the early 1900s.

5000|$|International {{reaction}} to {{plight of the}} civilian population in the secessionist region was diverse. The United Nations and most national governments, expressing reluctance {{to become involved in}} what was officially considered an internal Nigerian affair, remained silent on the escalating humanitarian crisis. Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant, refused to support the airlift. The position of the Organization of African Unity was to not intervene in conflicts its members deemed internal and to support the nation-state boundaries instituted during the colonial era. The ruling Labour Party of the United Kingdom, which together with the USSR was supplying arms to the Nigerian military, dismissed reports of famine as [...] "enemy propaganda". Mark Curtis writes that the UK also reportedly provided military assistance on the ‘neutralisation of the rebel airstrips’, with the understanding that their destruction would put them out of use for daylight <b>humanitarian</b> relief <b>flights.</b>|$|R
