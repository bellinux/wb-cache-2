40|$|Abstract. The {{standard}} Merton-Black-Scholes {{formula for}} European Option pricing serves only as approximation to real values of options. More advanced extensions include applications of Lévy processes and {{are based on}} characteristic functions, which are more convenient to use than the corresponding probability distributions. We found one of the Lewis (2001) general theoretical formulae for option pricing based on characteristic functions particularly suitable for a statistical approach to option pricing. By replacing the unknown theoretical characteristic function with the empirical one the obtained model {{can be considered as}} a consistent estimator of the original Lewis formula. We explore behaviour of this model on empirical data and conclude {{that it is necessary to}} allow for two additional implied parameters to obtain option pricing superior to other models reported in the literature. 1. Implied volatility as a cure for inadequacy of the MBS theory. The Merton-Black-Scholes (MBS) theory of option pricing (Black & Scholes (1973), Merton (1973)), based on the assumption of Gaussian distribution of logarithmic returns, results in the famous and well known formula for the value of a European Call option C 0 (S, <b>K,</b> <b>v,</b> <b>T,</b> r) = S · N(d 1) − K · exp(−rT) N(d 2), (1...|$|R

30|$|The {{significant}} improvement in K 1 estimates {{can be explained by}} the direct link of this parameter to the early part of the AIF. The original SIME method has difficulty in accurately defining the AIF peaks but is more accurate in estimating the tail [6] especially when blood samples are used to anchor the estimated AIF. This makes it more successful in estimating macroparameters of kinetic analysis (i.e. <b>K</b> i, <b>V</b> <b>T)</b> rather than individual parameters. Since a reliable measurement of the whole blood curve is used in the constrained SIME, this method is superior in estimating the complete shape of the AIF curve, including the peak. This should be valid for most tracers except those with rapid uptake by red blood cells, which would result in differences between the plasma and whole blood curves.|$|R
