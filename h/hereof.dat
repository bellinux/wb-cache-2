The losses totaled J$274.3million (US$3.2 million), J$75.6 million (US$890,000) <b>hereof</b> to replace destroyed housing units.

The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which {{plays a crucial role}} in the Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. Surface runoff and spills along industrial zones and sewage systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems. In addition, there were traces of light damage to vegetation, such as uprooted trees.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Encyclical {{follows the}} lines of the {{traditional}} teaching concerning the rights and duties of property and the relations of employer and employee, it applies the old doctrines specifically to modern conditions. Leo first quotes Thomas Aquinas in affirming that private property is a fundamental principle of natural law. He then quotes Gregory the Great regarding its proper use: [...] ""He that hath a talent, let him see that he hide it not; he that hath abundance, let him quicken himself to mercy and generosity; he that hath art and skill, let him do his best to share the use and the utility <b>hereof</b> with his neighbor."

2500|$|In 1598 the London {{historian}} John Stow {{admitted that}} [...] "The cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory <b>hereof,</b> is none". However, his contemporary William Camden, in Britannia (1586), his historical description of Great Britain, {{concluded that it}} was a Roman milliarium, a central stone from which all distances in Roman Britain were measured, and similar to the Milliarium Aureum of Rome. This identification remains popular, although there is no archaeological evidence to support it. Camden's identification has been revived by John Michell in his book The Sacred Centre (2009), where he identifies the stone as the London terminus, a stone sacred to Jupiter that stood at the centre of every Roman city, and which parallels the golden milestone in the Forum in Rome. He believes it was at the intersection of the major axes of the Roman city, the north south Cardo Maximus and the east west Decumanus.|$|E
