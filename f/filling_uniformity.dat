40|$|Coatings for film, sheet, o r strip {{metal and}} {{building}} products {{have been applied}} by roll o r gravure for some time. I n recent years, the appli-caticn of these techniques to leather finishing has been studied to improve finish utilization and reduce solvent emission. These benefits are sub-stantiated {{by the results of}} this work. Finishing can be achieved with about one-half the solids add-on of spray application and without the over-spray waste. Further, the solids of applied coatings can be more than twice those of spray finishes, thus reducing solvent emission further. However, precision roll coating appears to be less than ideal, since a t best there is a compromise between face, <b>fill</b> and <b>uniformity</b> as in-fluenced by the tracking pattern. T h e same lacquers as applied by roll coatings, but reduced with thinner and sprayed generally produce ex-ccllent face, <b>fill,</b> and <b>uniformity</b> of leather appearance. I n general, the technology and mechanics of precision roll coating require, for trouble-free production, someone who is skilled in finish formulation and has a good understanding of the equipment...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Variabilities in preform {{permeability}} {{can lead}} to the formation of dry spots and nonuniform flow progression during mold filling in the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. Real-time flow control can improve <b>fill</b> <b>uniformity</b> and eliminate potential fill related defects. Flow control schemes commonly manipulate the inlet pressures or flow rates and have been shown in the literature to be limited in their ability to steer the flow in regions far from the inlet ports [1]. A viable solution to this problem is localized heating of the resin during the mold filling process, which can reduce the local viscosity of the flowing resin to compensate for spatial preform permeability variation. In this paper localized heating is achieved using an induction heater with carbon fiber susceptors embedded in the preform layup. This type of control must be applied to the VARTM process {{in such a way as}} to heat in the lagging regions while avoiding overheating and thus prematurely curing the resin. To this end, this paper presents a real time control strategy that is demonstrated in a lab scale experimental setup, and is shown to be successful in improving the uniformity of the flow during mold filling of heterogeneous preform layups...|$|R

Before sowing those varieties were compiled in equal proportion. &# 8216;Omega&# 8217; and &# 8216;Igna&# 8217; are varieties susceptible to infestation by fungi unlike &# 8216;Henika&# 8217; and &# 8216;Banti&# 8217; varieties. Wheat was cultivated with or without fungicide protection. Hectolitre weight, content of low molecular SDS-soluble protein and number of insoluble protein in flour were more profitable for mixtures made of pure stands than variety mixtures. As far as vitreousness of grain, milling properties of grain, content of protein in grain and SDS + ME-soluble protein are concerned the quality of variety mixtures was higher for the variety mixture in comparison with mixtures made of pure stands. Fungicide protection in the cultivation of pure varieties and varieties mixtures increased value of hectolitre weight and <b>filling</b> and <b>uniformity</b> of grain...|$|R
40|$|In {{lost foam}} casting (LFC) the foam pattern {{is the key}} criterion, and the filling process is crucial to ensure the high quality of the foam pattern. <b>Filling</b> which lacks <b>uniformity</b> and denseness will cause various defects and affect the surface quality of the casting. The infl uential factors of the fi lling process are {{realized}} in this research. Optimization of the fi lling process, enhancement of effi ciency, decrease of waste, etc., are obtained by the numerical simulation of the fi lling process using a computer. The equations governing the dense gas-solid two-phase flow are established, and the physical significance of each equation is discussed. The Euler/Lagrange numerical model is used to simulate the fluid dynamic characteristics of the dense two-phase fl ow during the mould fi lling process in lost foam casting.

40|$|A {{material}} and process study was performed using subscale panels {{in an attempt}} to reduce the cost of fabricating ablative heat shield panels. Although no improvements were made in the material formulation, a significant improvement was obtained in the processing methods compared to those employed in the previous work. The principal feature of the new method is the press filling and curing of the ablation material in a single step with the bonding and curing of the face sheet. This method was chosen to replace the hand troweling and autoclave curing procedure used previously. Double-curvature panels of {{the same size as the}} flat panels were fabricated to investigate fabrication problems. It was determined that the same materials and processes used for flat panels can be used to produce the curved panels. A design with severe curvatures consisting of radii of 24 x 48 inches was employed for evaluation. Ten low-density and ten high-density panels were fabricated. With the exception of difficulties related to short run non-optimum tooling, excellent panel <b>filling</b> and density <b>uniformity</b> were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceutical powders {{are very}} prone to {{electrostatic}} charging by colliding and sliding contacts with walls and other particles. In pharmaceutical formulation processes, particle charging {{is often a}} nuisance and can cause problems {{in the manufacture of}} products, such as affecting powder flow, and reducing <b>fill</b> and dose <b>uniformity.</b> For a fundamental understanding of the powder triboelectrification, it is essential to study charge transfer due to a single contact of a particle with a target plane under well-defined physical, mechanical and electrical conditions. In this study, charge transfer due to a single impact of a particle against a stainless steel target was measured for alpha-lactose monohydrate, aspirin, sugar granules and ethylcellulose. The amount of transferred charge is expressed as a function of impact velocity and impact angle as well as the initial charge. The maximum contact area during impact between a particle and a target plane is estimated by an elastic-plastic deformation model. It is found that the transferred charge is a linear function of the contact area. For a given material, there is an initial particle charge for which no charge transfer occurs due to impact. This is found to be independent of impact velocity and angle, and is hence viewed as a characteristic property, which is related to the contact potential difference and tribo-electric series of the sample powders...|$|R
40|$|The lead article, `Ion-beam {{propagation}} in a low-density reactor chamber for heavy-ion inertial fusion` (p. 89), {{explores the}} ability of heavy-ion beams to be adequately transported and focused in an IFE reactor. The next article, `Efficient production and applications of 2 - to 10 -keV x rays by laser-heated underdense radiators` (p. 96), explores {{the ability of}} the NIF to produce sufficient high-energy x rays for diagnostic backlighting, target preheating, or uniform irradiation of large test objects for Nuclear Weapons Effects Testing. For capsule implosion experiments, the increasing energies and distances involved in the NIF compared to Nova require the development of new diagnostics methods. The article `Fusion reaction-rate measurements [...] Nova and NIF` (p. 115) first reviews the use of time-resolved neutron measurements on Nova to monitor fusion burn histories and then explores the limitations of that technique, principally Doppler broadening, for the proposed NIF. It also explores the use of gamma rays on Nova, thereby providing a proof-of-principle for using gamma rays for monitoring fusion burn histories on the NIF. The articles `The energetics of gas-filled hohlraums` (p. 110) and `Measurements of laser- speckle-induced perturbations in laser-driven foils` (p. 123) report measurements on Nova of two important aspects of implosion experiments. The first characterizes the amount of energy lost from a hohlraum by stimulated Brillouin and Raman scattering as a function of gas <b>fill</b> and laser-beam <b>uniformity.</b> The second of these articles shows that the growth of density nonuniformities implanted on smooth capsule surfaces by laser speckle can be correlated with the effects of physical surface roughness.

The modified reinforced concrete revetment not only maintain safety but also beautify the appearance. For the sake of effectuation in worksite, this research chooses experimental revetment model to discuss, the characteristics of flow velocity and discharge within revegetation holes. In addition, this study discussed the hydraulic characteristics under the combinations of two types of refilled sediment, four revegetation holes with different slopes, and the relationship of drawdown with time series. In summary, there are some results concerning this study. They are presented as follows: 1. The refilled sediment was the main factor. In similar slope, both the velocity and the discharge of the refilled with the uniformity coefficient 10. 45 sediment are bigger than the uniformity coefficient 19. 92 sediment. 2. In the same refilled sediment, when the slope of revegetation hole is increased, both the velocity and the discharge are lesser. 3. In similar slope, the drawdown with time series of the <b>filled</b> with the <b>uniformity</b> coefficient 19. 92 sediment is longer than the uniformity coefficient 10. 45 sediment. 4. In the same refilled sediment, when the slope of revegetation hole is increased, the drawdown with time series is longer. 為改善現有之鋼筋混凝土護岸，將排水孔直徑加大至 30 公分，使之能填充植生包植生綠化護岸，此能較符合生態之原則，且鋼筋混凝土之結構也具安全性，護岸的外觀亦可砌石加以美化。本文採用試驗護岸模型以探討栽植孔之排水流量及流速等現象。 本試驗針對生態護岸模型所設置的栽植孔進行試驗，以二種不同均勻係數之回填砂石(10. 45 及 19. 92) 、四種不同斜率之洩水管(- 8 °、 0 °、 4 °及 8 °) 以及水位洩降與時間之關係進行探討。 由試驗結果可以得到： 1. 回填砂石粒徑為影響排水孔流速及流量之最主要因素。於相同洩水管坡度的情況下，回填均勻係數 10. 45 之試驗砂石時所量得的流速及流量皆大於回填均勻係數 19. 92 試驗砂石時之值。 2. 於相同回填砂石粒徑情況下，洩水管愈向上傾斜，流速及流量亦愈小。 3. 於相同洩水管坡度的情況下，回填均勻係數 19. 92 之試驗砂石時，水位洩降所需時間較回填均勻係數 10. 45 之試驗砂石長。 4. 於相同回填砂石粒徑情況下，洩水管愈向上傾斜，水位洩降所需時間愈長。第一章 緒論 1. 1 前言 [...] . 1 1. 2 研究動機 [...] . 2 第二章 資料收集與整理 2. 1 現有護岸的型式 [...] . 4 2. 2 護岸種類與適用情形 [...] . 8 第三章 文獻回顧 3. 1 排水孔 [...] 12 3. 2 護岸 [...] 13 3. 3 河溪適生植物 [...] 14 第四章 試驗介紹 4. 1 試驗介紹 [...] 16 4. 2 試驗目的 [...] 16 4. 3 試驗設備 [...] 17 4. 4 試驗設計及假設條件 [...] 29 4. 5 試驗步驟流程 [...] 30 4. 6 模型相似律 [...] 32 第五章 結果與討論 5. 1 各栽植孔於不同狀況下之流速變化情形 [...] 35 5. 2 各栽植孔於不同狀況下之流量變化情形 [...] 38 5. 3 各栽植孔於不同狀況下之時間與水位洩降關係 [...] 41 5. 4 由實驗數據進行現況推估 [...] 44 第六章、結論與建議 6. 1 結論 [...] 45 6. 2 建議 [...] 47 參考文獻 [...] . 50 附表 [...] . 5...|$|R
