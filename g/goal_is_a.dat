Horses may be suited to any type of riding or driving sport due to expansive, regular paces, a flat-footed walk and vibrant trot and canter. The best heads are fine, dry, and expressive, with a tapering neck and strong topline, withers pronounced and well-laid back, the back strong but flexible, and the croup long, sloping and muscular. The chest and shoulder should have depth and length, respectively. The foundation should be dry on prominent, correct joints and well-shaped hooves.|$|E

The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> versatile, correct and balanced horse with a calm temperament. Desirable is a horse with a strong constitution, peaceful companionable temperament, which utilizes its feed well, has high fertility, and is suitable as a riding and driving horse. The walk and trot should be efficient and expansive, the latter with some action. The physique should speak of a moderately elegant horse of great depth and breadth, well-sprung ribs and a strong hind end. The head should be expressive with a large, friendly eye. The neck is muscular, medium-length, well-formed and set high on a long, sloping, muscular shoulder with defined withers. The back is medium-long, solid and elastic with a broad loin, the croup slightly sloped, wide and muscular. The limbs should be correct and dry with great bone strength, very strong joints suited to the horse's size, ending in the all-important well-shaped hooves.|$|E

Its main declared <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong reduction in taxes and government intervention. The party is today considered to be conservative liberal, but has sometimes been described as populist. It has also been described as Europe’s most moderate populist party. While more fundamental libertarianism was earlier a component of its ideology, this has in practice gradually more or less vanished from the party. As of the late 2000s, the party has also been influenced by Thatcherism, particularly with Siv Jensen becoming party leader.|$|E

2500|$|Syria is a {{party to}} the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and {{maintains}} a civil nuclear program.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said the site in discussion was just [...] "a military site under construction" [...] and that Syria's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nuclear-free Middle East. Syria allowed the IAEA to visit the site on 23 June 2008, taking environmental samples that revealed the presence of man-made uranium and other materials consistent with a reactor. On 24 May 2011, IAEA Director General Amano released a report which assessed that the destroyed facility was a reactor, and the IAEA Board of Governors voted 17-6 (with 11 abstentions) to report this as non-compliance to the UN Security Council.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{aggressive}} focus on musical instruction within Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4 instead puts a larger {{focus on the}} franchise's core gameplay, multiplayer, and the overall feeling of the experience; Rigopulos felt that the franchise had become too [...] "sprawling" [...] in functionality, and that [...] "there is an existing gameplay core that is very powerful and very fun, and we don't want to tamper with that core. At the same time, {{we need to bring}} something new to the experience." [...] Owing to this renewed focus, the Pro Guitar and piano keyboard modes were dropped from the game. Rigopulos stated that Ubisoft's competing Rocksmith series [...] "is serving the audience that wants actual guitar instrumental instruction very well." [...] The new Freestyle Guitar Solo feature was something that Harmonix had built a prototype for in early 2014; at the time they did not have a clear concept of its use but found the mechanic to have potential and built up parts of Rock Band 4 around it. Rigopulos also noted that they were not trying to develop Rock Band 4 with competition from Guitar Hero Live in mind; that competition had caused the original over-saturation of the rhythm game market in 2009. With Rock Band 4, Harmonix' <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> smaller but known fraction of the market of both old Rock Band players and new ones, such that meeting those numbers would make the game financially viable even if it does not outsell Guitar Hero Live. This goal also helps to manage the costs of the game as {{they do not have to}} manufacture as many instrument sets as they had done previously.|$|E
