25|$|In September 2014, a law {{went into}} effect in Denmark {{effectively}} dropping the former practice of requiring transgender persons to undergo arduous psychiatric evaluation and castration before being allowed legal gender change. By requiring nothing more than a statement of gender identity and subsequent confirmation of the request for gender change after a waiting period of 6 months, this means that anyone wishing their legal <b>gender</b> <b>marker</b> changed can do so with no expert-evaluation and few other formal restrictions. Meanwhile, Norwegian Health Minister Bent Høie has made promises that a similar law for Norway will be drafted soon.|$|E
2500|$|India {{was ruled}} for many a century by Persian-speaking Muslims, amongst {{the most notable}} being the Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate, and the Turco-Mongol Mughal dynasty. As a {{consequence}} Indian languages were changed greatly, with the large scale entry of Persian and its many Arabic loans into the Gujarati lexicon. One fundamental adoption was Persian's conjunction [...] "that", ke. Also, while tatsam or Sanskrit is etymologically continuous to Gujarati, it is essentially of a differing grammar (or language), and that in comparison while Perso-Arabic is etymologically foreign, {{it has been in}} certain instances and to varying degrees grammatically indigenized. Owing to centuries of situation and the end of Persian education and power, (1) Perso-Arabic loans are quite unlikely to be thought of or known as loans, and (2) more importantly, these loans have often been Gujarati-ized. dāvo – claim, fāydo – benefit, natījo – result, and hamlo – attack, all carry Gujarati's masculine <b>gender</b> <b>marker,</b> o. khānũ – compartment, has the neuter ũ. Aside from easy slotting with the auxiliary karvũ, a few words have made a complete transition of verbification: kabūlvũ – to admit (fault), kharīdvũ – to buy, kharǎcvũ – to spend (money), gujarvũ – to pass. The last three are definite part and parcel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study aims to {{describe}} <b>gender</b> <b>markers</b> in Javanese and German names.

The discussion on German names and their <b>gender</b> <b>markers</b> was based on literature review, including the findings of the studies by Gerhards (2003), Nübling (2009) and Oelkers (2003). German names in the discussion were Vorname or first names. The findings show that there are similarities between Javanese names and German names in terms of <b>gender</b> <b>markers.</b> The similarities between them are apparent in: (a) phonetic signs in the form of suffixes, and (b) the number of syllables...|$|R

Thesis of Japanese Department, Faculty of Humanities, Diponegoro University. Advisor, Lina Rosliana, S. S., M. Hum. The {{research}} problems {{appointed in}} this thesis are: 1. How {{is the use of}} <b>gender</b> <b>marker’s</b> suffix in Japanese male comic and female comic? 2. How is the misuse of <b>gender</b> <b>marker’s</b> suffix in male comic and female comic? The purpose of the study {{in this thesis}} are: 1. To describe the <b>gender</b> <b>marker’s</b> suffix in male comic and female comic. 2. To describe and to explain the misuse of the <b>gender</b> <b>marker’s</b> suffix in male comic and female comic. There are 49 data that the writer analyzes in this thesis. In this thesis, the writer uses three method of the studies. The method for collecting the data that the witer uses is the listening and note taking method. Moreover, for the analyzing method, the writer uses the Descriptive Method. Meanwhile, the informal method is used to present the result of the thesis. The writer uses a compilation of theories from Iori, Chino, etc. as the writer refference for analyzing the data. Based on the result of the analysis, women who do misusing of <b>gender</b> <b>marker’s</b> suffix that is actually used for man are more common compared to the man who do misusing of <b>gender</b> <b>marker’s</b> suffix that is actually used for woman. In general, the cause of the miusing of this suffix takes place in the context of ach conversations. As in the war era, women tend to use ruder language than usual in order to make them look more masculin and not weak. It is also happened in the use of suffix. Moreover, other things that can cause misusing of suffix are the age, the culture, and the speaker’s gender factor, and also their listener.

5000|$|Germany {{is thought}} to be the first European country that recognizes [...] "indeterminate" [...] sex on birth certificates, which is materialized by the absence of any <b>gender</b> <b>marker,</b> from November 2013. A report by the German Ethics Council stated that the law was passed because, [...] "Many people who were {{subjected}} to a 'normalizing' operation in their childhood have later felt it to have been a mutilation and would never have agreed to it as adults." [...] Deutsche Welle reported that an [...] "indeterminate" [...] 'option' was made available for the birth certificates of intersex infants with ambiguous genitalia on 1 November 2013. The move is controversial with many intersex advocates in Germany and elsewhere suggesting that it might encourage surgical interventions, or simply fails to address the key health concerns of intersex people. On 21 January 2015, the Celle Court of Appeals confirmed in a judgment that intersex people cannot obtain a <b>gender</b> <b>marker</b> other than [...] "female" [...] or [...] "male" [...] in their birth certificate, but only the absence of any such marker. The court held {{at the same time that}} even an adult intersex person who was registered with a <b>gender</b> <b>marker</b> at birth can obtain the deletion of that <b>gender</b> <b>marker.</b> This judgment is currently being reviewed by the Federal Court of Justice.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the reflection of}} gender in Arabic and Indonesian languages and then connects it to their each cultural contexts. Gender in Arabic grammar is important subcategory that distinguishes between masculine and feminine in almost every part of speech, whereas gender in Indonesian is not an important subcategory. After data analysis through comparison and elaboration phases obtained the following results: (1) the <b>gender</b> <b>markers</b> in Arabic are dominated by the grammatical <b>markers,</b> while the <b>gender</b> <b>markers</b> in Indonesian are dominated by the lexical markers and if it not significant the <b>gender</b> <b>markers</b> in Indonesian are not presented, and (2) Arabic strictly applies the gender system and {{is closely related to}} the rules of concord (agreement), while Indonesian loosely does it and does not own the rules of conformity. The distinction of gender system between the two languages shows the different of cultural system also. Based on social structure system, the Arab society emphasizes the gender segregation like man versus woman, while the society of Indonesia emphasizes the age and status distinctions. Based on genetic relationship system, the Arab people tend to be individual, while the Indonesian people tend to have mutual cooperation and collectiveness. Based on cultural system, the Arab people applying strict patriarchy, while the Indonesian people applying loose patriarchy...|$|R

They also state that documentation of a name and/or <b>gender</b> <b>marker</b> change can be presented as a way of providing proof that the RLE has been completed, but do not state that a name and/or <b>gender</b> <b>marker</b> change is a necessary requirement for completion of the RLE.

40|$|The ongoing {{dispute in}} {{literary}} studies concerned with gender and writing style is wide and varied. Our preliminary analyses lend {{evidence to the}} claims that such gender differences are evident in writing across periods.
