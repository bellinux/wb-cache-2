Reviewing the film for History Extra, the website of BBC History Magazine, she said: [...] "The film starkly and powerfully unveiled the sights and sounds of enslavement– from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash down people's backs. [...] We also <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{selection}} of Jones to the U.S. 2014 Winter Olympics bobsled team was criticized by some American bobsledders as happening {{due to her}} fame. Curt Tomasevicz said, [...] "It's {{hard for me to}} name one or two athletes that would completely agree with that decision." [...] Emily Azevedo, who was competing with Katie Eberling and Jones for a spot on the team, said: [...] "I should have been working harder on gaining Twitter followers than gaining muscle mass." [...] Neither Eberling or Azevedo blamed Jones for her selection. United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation CEO Darrin Steele defended the selection: [...] "I haven't heard anyone making the argument about Lolo not being a better athlete right now, a better brakeman for the team. I don't think I've come across that one time. I've <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> history and all that's nice. But who's going to provide the best results for the U.S. team in Sochi?

40|$|Tax {{reform is}} {{very much on the}} agenda, despite the PM backing away from a GST increase. Many experts point to the tax {{concessions}} enjoyed by wealthy Australians as a good place to start. Keri Phillips reports. In Australia, the federal government raises most of its money through three kinds of taxes—personal income tax, company tax and the GST—while the states also raise smaller amounts through things like insurance taxes and stamp duties on buying property. Although the states raise less money, they 2 ̆ 7 re responsible for the lion 2 ̆ 7 s share of spending, which leads to a perpetual tussle between the two levels of government over money. We 2 ̆ 7 ve <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of talk <b>about</b> tax reform recently, but what exactly is the problem? Essentially, the government is spending more than it takes in and that shortfall was exacerbated by the GFC. The mining boom ended and both company tax and GST earnings contracted as consumers started spending less and saving more. So the government wants to find more money, but changes to the tax system can be a political hot potato—as we can see from the heat in the recent debate over increasing the GST...|$|R

I viewed archive footage and read testimonials from both Bangladeshi and Pakistani points of view. I also spoke to eye witnesses, including an Englishman who was in Dhaka on the night everything kicked off, 25th of March 1971. Forty-two years on, it's difficult to formulate a picture of what happened that is 100% correct, and as a filmmaker I understand that. I avoided disputed issues such as how many were killed during the genocide, but I accepted that there was genocide. It was important for me to find my own opinion and give that a narrative structure."

Le Nain was extremely excited about du Coudray's arrival. Le Nain {{was one of}} the first people to secure her services in his city. In her first lesson in Moulins, eighty students showed up, and the second lesson brought seventy. Fewer students came because this was also the time of harvest and so many women were not able to make it due to their duties on their farms. Du Coudray noted how many women had no aptitude and even sent them home and only a few women really stood out to her. Her course cost the women thirty six to forty livres, which also included the certificate of completion in the end. Du Coudray worked her students hard and taught the women just the basics, but even this was enough for the women to be extremely useful in their cities. Classes took place six days a week, all morning and all afternoon and lasted around two months so that every student had plenty of time to listen to lectures and practice each maneuver several times on the machine. Occasionally she would allow her best students to perform actual live births with her supervision. In most cities she was paid three hundred livres for each month of her teaching.|$|R
