Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

25|$|The Fool {{does not}} follow any ideology. He rejects all appearances, of law, justice, moral order. He sees brute force, cruelty and lust. He has no illusions and does not seek {{consolation}} {{in the existence of}} natural or supernatural order, which provides for the punishment of evil and the reward of good. Lear, insisting on his fictitious majesty, seems ridiculous to him. All the more ridiculous because he does not see <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> he is. But the Fool does not desert his ridiculous, degraded king, and accompanies him on his way to madness. The Fool knows that the only true madness is to recognize this world as rational.|$|E

Now [...] is addressing this anti-sharia fear mongering issue, and perhaps it may gain some currency and ... more people will make fun of it." [...] The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report. One student said: [...] "It's pretty cool showing <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> the hate is.

500|$|Sammy Davis, Jr. was {{instrumental}} in bringing about a general change in policy. When the Will Mastin Trio began performing at Sands in 1958, Davis informed Entratter that his father and uncle must be allowed permission to stay at Sands while he was performing there. [...] Entratter granted them permission but continued his objection to admitting other black guests. In 1961, an African-American couple entered {{the lobby of the}} hotel and were blocked by the security guard, witnessed by Sinatra and Davis. [...] Sinatra told the guards that they were his guests and let them into the hotel. Sinatra subsequently swore profusely down the phone to Sands executive Carl Cohen at <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> the situation was, and the following day, Davis approached Entratter and demanded that Sands begin employing blacks. Shortly afterwards the hotel changed its policy and it began hiring black waiters and busboys, and began permitting blacks entry into the casino.|$|E

500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining." [...] Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, [...] "Despite <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it was seeing {{character}} after character after character {{try to save}} Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really {{knows how to do}} big events. After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past four and a half years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we think the time has finally come to remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, a {{group of}} Chinese {{children}} garnered significant attention when a video of them reenacting the [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] musical sequence in their native language was released to the Internet and went viral. First shared by the Facebook page Disney Power, the video was eventually identified as a segment from a Chinese television show that features children reenacting scenes from popular films. The child actress who portrays Grandmother Fa in the reenactment has been widely commended for her performance, who Oh My Disney described as [...] "in it to win it." [...] Boing Boing's Caroline Siede wrote that the actress [...] "perfectly captures Mulan's grandmother". Praising the children's accuracy as upon reviewing a video that compares the live-action reenactment to the animated original side-by-side, Refinery29's Michael Hafford wrote that the children [...] "remind <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it is that Hollywood more or less refuses to cast non-white actors in lead roles", specifically referring to the whitewashing controversy surrounding American actors Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson's casting in the films The Great Wall (2016) and Ghost in the Shell (2017), respectively. Hafford continued, [...] "if literal children can be great in a scene from Mulan, why can't movie studios give roles to, like, adults?" ...|$|E

500|$|Within the series, set {{during the}} Prohibition-era of the United States, Isaac and Miria [...] "are {{a pair of}} idiotic lovers and thieves" [...] who are portrayed as [...] "always {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic". They are often mistaken for performers because {{of the variety of}} disguises they employ during their heists, such as dressing up as mummies or as the Tramp. The duo commit a variety of eccentric robberies, including attempting to steal time by stealing watches, trying to stop anyone from entering a museum by stealing the entrance and stealing the Genoard family fortune to prevent the family from fighting over it. Miria exhibits a complete trust in Isaac and supports anything he says no matter <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it is and often goes as far to mimic his body language and his speech, although she often does not really know what she is saying. Although the pair are very idiotic, Isaac is not completely stupid and there are occasions that shows that he displays his inner intelligence. He is able to recognize a pair of plainclothes officers because he claims that he is familiar with their speech style. Isaac and Miria may have been born into wealthy families because they state that their parents' homes and the Genoard mansion have similar exteriors.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Lars {{has been}} mixed. Positive responses {{focused on his}} [...] "badass nature", noted by IGN in reaction to his moveset consisting mostly of punches aimed at his opponent's face. The reviewer {{also noted that the}} accessories that players can unlock for Lars were designed to make the him more likable, reinforcing how appealing his character becomes across the game. GamesRadar highly praised Lars' heroic characterization in contrast with the antagonists in Tekken like Jin and Kazuya. Because of Lars' moves, writers have often recommended that beginner players of Tekken 7 play as him with Vandal comparing him with Jin as well as Ryu from the Street Fighter series, due to how easy to use he is. In a 2012 official fan poll by Bandai Namco, Lars {{was one of the most}} requested Tekken characters for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter, receiving 9755 (11.05%) of 88,280 votes. Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek focused on how, despite his family [...] always betraying each other, Lars might break this curse. He listed him as the 27th-best Tekken character, and found his role in his first game was positive and compared him favorably to Mortal Kombats newer protagonists at the time, like Shujinko or Taven, who he felt were less appealing. The reviewer had mixed feelings over Lars being able to escape the curse of the Mishima family, who are supposedly destined to fight each other. However, he thought teaming him up with Lee Chaolan, rather than fighting like their relatives, helped to expand Lee's popularity. A similar comment was made by 4thletter as while both Lars and Lee are not blood related brothers, they appear in Tekken 6 as allies, rather than enemies. Lars was also listed as the third best Tekken hero by Listas, as well as the 22nd best character in the franchise. VG247's reviewer enjoyed Lars' fights in Tekken 7s story mode against multiple armed guards despite <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> he found it. Different types of merchandising with Lars' image have also been released. [...] Anime News Network liked the alternate costume Kishimoto made for Lars, calling it [...] "one of the more stylish Naruto super-ninja". Siliconera found it similar to that of the Akatsuki, the series' antagonists.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} {{exceedingly}} {{impressed with the}} evil precedent of Colonel Napier's History of the Peninsular War. It is a specimen of the true French military school; not a thought for the justice of the war,--not {{a consideration of the}} damnable and damning iniquity of the French invasion. All is looked at as a mere game of exquisite skill, and the praise is regularly awarded to the most successful player. <b>How</b> perfectly <b>ridiculous</b> is the prostration of Napier's mind, apparently a powerful one, before the name of Buonaparte!

2500|$|The defense {{continued}} {{to suggest that}} the DNA-testing of evidence that the city-hired firm, Bode Technology, may have been contaminated in order to frame Littlejohn and to clear bar manager Danny Dorrian. The prosecution criticized the defense's argument that police framed Littlejohn to protect his former employer Dorrian. Prosecutor Kenneth Taub said to the jury: [...] "I can't even begin to describe <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> that is". [...] David in reply said the evidence may suggest her client dumped the body, but it did not prove that Littlejohn killed her and said: [...] "There is no proof at all, not a scintilla of proof, that Ms. St. Guillen had been to my client's home". David also said: [...] "Darryl Littlejohn was the solution to all their problems: solving the city's biggest crime at the time, protecting Danny Dorrian and protecting Rudy Giuliani from another scandal while he was running for President." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fernós {{argued that}} the Commonwealth realm {{relationship}} between Canada and the United Kingdom surpassed a simple form of autonomy, instead being a kind of association superior to any status that would keep the sovereignty of Puerto Rico {{in the hands of}} Congress. He considered his proposal a [...] "free federated commonwealth" [...] and a [...] "republic lacking international relations", which would be freely delegated to the Federal Government of the United States. Among other observations, Fernós also [...] noted <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it was to see the United States Congress hold the sovereignty of Puerto Rico when it wasn't the sovereign of the United States or its people and only served {{as a representative of the}} popular vote. He ultimately condemned the idea of a status where sovereignty was forfeit in favor of autonomy, comparing such an arrangement to a monarchy. The following year, Fernós analyzed the complications of directly transitioning from the colonial economic model established by the United States and listed what he considered could be possible steps for a prosperous sovereignty. On July 21, 1940, the founding assembly for the new party was held with the collaboration of 2,000 delegates. Fernós, who thought that the socio-economic issues should be attended first, was largely responsible for drafting the respective part of the party's program, being joined by Vicente Géigel Polanco and Rafael Arjona Siaca.|$|E
2500|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Fudge orchestrates {{a vicious}} smear {{campaign}} through the Daily Prophet to present Dumbledore as a senile old fool (even {{though he was}} constantly asking for Dumbledore's advice in his early days of being Minister for Magic) and Harry as an unstable, attention-seeking liar. He also passes a law allowing him to place Dolores Umbridge, his Senior Undersecretary, as a teacher at Hogwarts. He then appoints Umbridge as Hogwarts' [...] "High Inquisitor", {{with the power to}} inspect and sack teachers, and ultimately Dumbledore's successor as Headmaster, which gives her (and by extension, Fudge himself) primary control of how Hogwarts is managed. Fudge is concerned that Dumbledore is a threat to his power and that he is planning to train the Hogwarts students to overthrow the Ministry. After Voldemort appears in the Ministry of Magic at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Fudge finally admits that Voldemort has returned, and is sacked in disgrace from his position of Minister for Magic after the wizarding community calls for his resignation and is replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour, though he stays on as an advisor in Half-Blood Prince. Before his resignation, he makes several attempts to have Dumbledore arrange a meeting between himself and Harry so that Harry can lie on Fudge's behalf and make it look as though the Ministry is winning the war, but Dumbledore refuses, knowing <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> Harry would find the idea. Fudge is last mentioned in the series as one of the attendees at Dumbledore's funeral; his fate during Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry during the following year is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Now the story's {{surprise}} ending is sprung, {{which is}} so preposterous that readers will realize {{at this point that}} the entire story must be a tall tale (which Mr Mulliner has no shortage of). As one might guess, Montrose dispatches the gorilla, saves the baby, vanquishes Captain Fosdyke, and wins Rosalie's undying admiration, all with just a few seconds' interaction with the beast — but <b>how?</b> The <b>ridiculous</b> (but amusing) secret is uncharacteristic of Wodehouse, whose surprise endings typically appear quite credible. He does, however, very subtly foreshadow the secret when he notes, with dry humor, near the beginning of the story that the gorilla's contract grants him a salary of 750 dollars per week, and [...] "billing guaranteed in letters not smaller than those of ... the stars" [...] of the movie.|$|R

2500|$|Though using profanity on occasion, Butters {{does not}} indulge in foul-mouthed {{language}} {{as often as}} the other children on the show, instead preferring to use minced oaths; [...] "oh hamburgers" [...] is one he uses frequently, as well as [...] "gee whiz" [...] mostly in earlier seasons. Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters. His happy-go-lucky persona {{has been described as}} resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character, and is usually presented {{in stark contrast to the}} harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, including his mother's deranged attempt to murder him after discovering his father's bisexuality, as well as when his grandmother happens to be in town and constantly bullies him during her stay. Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents worry about their ability to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E
