At the opening of the 20th century the Canadian identity was just awakening and the need for national cultural and educational institutions was beginning to be discussed within the broader political arena.

He was also a vocal advocate of advertising any library, but particularly a national library where one had yet to be founded. More controversial at the time, he supported a collections management strategy of quality and not demand. In May 1918 Barnett wrote an article for the Ontario Library Review advocating a national library. [...] Unfortunately timing was not in his favour, and it was not until nearly 20 years after his death that the National Library of Canada was created by an Act of Parliament in 1953 and later as the Library and Archives of Canada.|$|E

Anatomic anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction was performed in this study with the aim to assess the clinical role of ALL in knee’s stability and <b>joint</b> <b>functions.</b> Sixty patients were recruited and divided into three groups to perform the operations of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction, anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction, and anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction + anterolateral ligament reconstruction, respectively.

Methods: 58 patients with patellar transverse fracture who accepted operative treatment in our hospital between August 2012 and December 2015 were collected and divided into open surgery group (n= 30) and arthroscopic surgery group (n= 28) according to the surgical approach.

Results: Differences in the knee <b>joint</b> <b>function</b> index levels {{were not statistically significant}} between two groups of patients before operation (P> 0. 05); 3 months after operation, the maximal knee joint flexibility and maximal extension levels of arthroscopic surgery group were higher than those of open surgery group (P< 0. 05); 3 d after operation, serum prostaglandin (PGI 2), dopamine (DA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), glucocorticoid (Cor), renin (R), angiotensin 1 (Ang 1), angiotensin 2 (Ang 2), epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE) and aldosterone (ALD) levels of arthroscopic surgery group were significantly lower than those of open surgery group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: To {{define a}} sub-set of {{functional}} goals and outcomes relevant {{to children and}} families living with cerebral palsy following treatment with botulinum toxin type A using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth. Methods: We identified treatment goals and treatment outcomes from medical case records in 2102 assessments of 239 children with cerebral palsy treated with botulinum toxin between 1994 and 2009.

40|$|Objective: to {{estimate}} {{a need for}} conservative rehabilitation treatment in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Material and methods. Data on the principles and procedures of rehabilitation treatment were analyzed in patients with JCA {{on the basis of}} 25 - year experience. The need for these packages of measures in 1999, 2008, and 2014 was compared. Standard procedures for joints at different sites were described. According to the degree of <b>joint</b> <b>functions,</b> there were rehabilitation treatment packages: corrective, mobilization, and general health-improving. Results and discussion. All patients with juvenile arthritis need rehabilitation (physical, psychological, and social). Comparison {{of the total number of}} patients who had received rehabilitation treatment in 1999, 2008, and 2014 showed a small trend towards its reduction. This is due to the smaller number of patients with dysfunctions and to the larger number of those without movement disorders who had received adequate treatment in early periods of the disease. The high percentage of patients having limited <b>joint</b> <b>functions</b> needs a mobilization package. Analysis of the data available in the literature and the authors' experience may lead to the conclusion that all patients with JCA need exercise therapy. The latter is a major procedure for physical rehabilitation and should be included in the standards for adjuvant treatment during basic medical therapy. Emphasis is laid on the importance of the early initiation of treatment to prevent incapacitating deformity at early stages of the disease. </p...|$|E
