60|$|GEORGE. And at once {{began to}} do it again! <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> delight in rows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] she begged. [...] "Don't, I can't bear {{any more}} of that. You don't know how horrible <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> <b>You</b> don't know--what fears I have had!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
60|$|At least, so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
60|$|I {{should be}} a fool <b>to</b> be that. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so natural, so horribly natural. He's young and nice-looking and cheery. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now {{inevitable}} {{that you should have}} fallen in love with him. You might be made for one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glenn, you {{distress}} me {{when you}} talk like this," [...] replied Carley, soberly. [...] "You did not use to talk so. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> are bitter against women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must speak}} of it," [...] I answered, sitting down again. [...] "I am your friend; <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> need one. What {{is the matter}} with your cousin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One night isn't like another," [...] mumbled Carter, [...] "but how am I to know? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> {{are making}} trouble for {{yourself}} {{as fast as}} you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a miracle had happened. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are}} other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France, [...] Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking [...] other dialects; And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I could know those men, I should become {{attached}} to [...] them, as I do to men in my own lands. O I know we should be brethren and lovers; I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did Dan's mother {{tell you}} that? Well, she's pretty shrewd. It's quite likely, Betty, quite likely. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> {{are not so}} quick witted as you used to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> {{lose sight}} of beauty by being so practical, that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch {{butterflies}} and rub the down off their beautiful wings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> have {{no right}} to be, if you are in earnest," [...] struck in Chester, who had been {{watching}} the scene in silence by Sir Charles's side.|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, but <b>it</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer {{is not a}} work of art in any sense; <b>it</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of {{a work of art}}; in truth, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and {{thoughtful}} sitting alone, [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are other}} men in other lands yearning {{and thoughtful}}, [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy, [...] France, Spain, [...] Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects, [...] And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if I could know those men I should become [...] attached to them as I do to men in my own lands, [...] O I know we should be brethren and lovers, [...] I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
60|$|I refuse <b>to</b> answer that. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{excessively}} impertinent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whiskey and water!" [...] said Aunt Martha with severity. [...] "I {{should think}} not. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> have {{had all the}} intoxicating liquors in this house that you would want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Are you on {{your way}} down, too? A little flutter. [...] . <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> haven’t been seen in your usual Paris haunts of late. Where have you been all this time?” ...|$|E
60|$|ST ERTH. You're deuced positive, sir. So far as I could {{understand}} it, {{there were a}} dozen ways {{you could have been}} robbed. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> value other men's reputations very lightly.|$|E
60|$|THE ELDER MISS WETHERELL. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so wicked: {{painting}} God's work.|$|R
60|$|There was, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> a reluctantly admiring note in his voice.|$|R
5000|$|During oral {{arguments}} before the three-judge appeals panel, Judge E. Grady Jolly remarked that [...] "For some reason, this one {{got out of}} hand <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>It</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the government overreacted here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} are pretty particular," [...] said Miss Petrie, [...] "and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> don't have much regard to intellect or erudition,--but fix things up {{straight}} according to birth and money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he grumbled, [...] "why {{they have}} shut us up together, or why Sotillo should have shut {{you up at}} all, since <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> have been fairly chummy up there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rest {{ought to}} do all of you a power of good," [...] came from his father. [...] "I declare, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> have been on the jump ever since you first went to Putnam Hall." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that young}} Bingo must have boosted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some purpose.|$|R
60|$|This Is Conington's translation, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be {{a little}} flat.|$|R
60|$|And <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{had heard}} those words from him before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please {{forgive me}} for everything," [...] said Brown in his most {{sympathetic}} tone, [...] "including spilling the wine. But <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> are not quite so easy about the flaming tower {{as you try to}} be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Near thine; for thine it is, love! Sweet, {{you look}} so {{beautiful}} to-day! <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> never yet looked half so fair. Those eyes are so brilliant, so very blue, so like the violet! There is nothing like your eyes!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And did {{you come}} to London, Mr. Smithers, {{expressly}} to acquaint me with this fact? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> had much better have obeyed my aunt's instructions at once, or go to her at Fulham, and consult with her on this subject." ...|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> you've come {{a little}} late, Rench,--after the event.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the man's iron repose was shaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do you know," [...] he continued, [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{more like}} five years? When I {{think of all}} that I've heard and all that I've done, and all that I've seen, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if <b>it</b> had took--as if it must have took--five years to have heard and done and seen it all in?" ...|$|R
