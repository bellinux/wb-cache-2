40|$|In {{the adult}} mongrel dogs, {{the process of}} wound healing at the defect of the cervicothoracic trachea, which was patched with the sternocleidomastoid muscle pedicle flap, and its {{usefulness}} for {{the reconstruction of the}} trachea, were studied. The dogs were sacrificed 3. 7, 14 and 30 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation. Macroscopically edema was seen 3 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation, but 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation it disappeared. Tracheal stenosis was not seen through all the healing stages. Microscopically firbroblast appeared and reepithelization was also observed 7 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation. Reepithelization was completed perfectly 30 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation. Hydroxyproline content decreased 3 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation, but increased to the normal range 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation. There was statistically significant difference in the increase of hydroxyproline contents between 3 days and 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation (p< 0. 01). The bursting pressure in the patched portion was measured by air inflation leak test. There was statisically significant difference in the increase of the bursting pressures between 3 days and 7 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> operation (p< 0. 01). The author concluded that the patching of the defect of the cervicothoracic trachea with the sternocleidomastoid muscle pedicle flap could be clinically used...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the critical period of weed control in corn, an experiment was conducted at Research Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in year 2000. The experiment consisted of two discrete periods, a weed-free and a weed infested period. The weed-free period consisted of removing all weeds till 4 th (19 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), 7 th (34 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), 11 th (48 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), 13 th (52 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), and 17 th (59 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), leaf growth stages and weed free check for growing season (123 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), and the critical time of weed infested consisted of removing all weeds from fourth (19 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), 7 th (34 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), 11 th (48 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), 13 th (52 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), and 17 th (59 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting), leaf growth stages and weedy infested check for growing season. All treatments were compared in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The results showed that by prolonging weed-infested period, dry matter and leaf surface area of weeds per square meter were increased, but by increasing weed-infested period, weed density was decreased. The lowest weed density (23 weed plants per m 2) was shown at infested all period of corn growing season. By passing the growing season, C 4 weed species such as red root pigweed and barnyard grass were dominant compared with C 3 weed species. At weed infested all period of corn growing season, red root pigweed had the highest dry matter (93 % of all weeds dry matter) and leaf surface area (86 % of all weeds leaf surface) compared with other weed species. At the first treatment of critical weed-free (19 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting) the regrowth of weeds were substantial which resulted in decreasing growth of corn. Grain yield of corn were significantly higher at 52, 59 and 123 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting in weed free treatments compared with 48, 52, 59 and 123 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting in weed infested treatments. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between other treatments. Based on the fitted sigmoid equation for both treatments at 10 % decreasing grain yield compared with control, the critical period of weed control in corn was obtained between 20 till 56 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> planting (fourth till fourteen leaf stage) at Mashhad climatic conditions...|$|R
