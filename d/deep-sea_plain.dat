40|$|Due to {{the good}} {{exposures}} and the already available, detailed stratigraphic and geological data, the Marnoso-arenacea Formation (MA) represents a unique opportunity {{for the study of}} the overall geometry and internal organization of slide bodies and related sedimentary structures. Submarine slides are common within the MA and involve sediments of various origin and degrees of consolidation. Slides are sandwiched between both <b>deep-sea</b> <b>plain</b> sediments and slope deposits. Attention is focused here on the large-scale bodies cropping out in the Romagna sector of the Marnoso-arenacea basin, between the Sillaro and the Marecchia valleys. They crop out extensively and represent unique opportunity to see how the internal structures of flow developed during the traslation and emplacement of the mass-transport bodies, in response to slope/basin morphology and the interaction with the substratum...|$|E
40|$|The Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) in the Pacific Ocean is {{characterized}} by organic carbon-starved sediments and meter-scale oxygen penetration into the sediment. Furthermore, numerous seamounts occur throughout its <b>deep-sea</b> <b>plain,</b> which may serve as conduits for low-temperature hydrothermal circulation of seawater through the oceanic crust. Recent studies in deep-sea environments of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have suggested and presented evidence of an exchange of dissolved constituents between the seawater flowing in the basaltic crust and the pore water of the overlying sediments. Through high-resolution pore-water oxygen and nutrient measurements, we examined fluxes and geochemical interactions between the seamount basaltic basement and pore waters of the overlying sediments at three sites located on a radial transect from the foot of Teddy Bare, a small seamount in the CCFZ. At three sites, located 1000, 700 and 400 m away from {{the foot of the}} seamount, we found that oxygen concentrations initially decrease with sediment depth but start to increase at depths of 3 and 7 m towards the basaltic basement. NO 32 - concentrations mirror the oxygen concentration profiles, as they increase with sediment depth but decrease towards the basement. We performed transport reaction modeling and determined at one site the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the pore water and the bottom water overlying the sediments, which indicated that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the pore water {{at the bottom of the}} sediment column is similar to the seawater Transport-reaction modeling revealed that (1) the diffusive flux of oxygen from the basaltic basement outpaces the oxygen consumption through organic matter oxidation and nitrification in the basal sediments and (2) the nutrient exchange between the sediment and the underlying basaltic crust occurs at orders-of-magnitude lower rates than between the upper sediment and the overlying bottom water. Our results suggest an upward diffusion of oxygen from seawater circulating within the seamount crust into the overlying basal sediments. The oxygen profiles presented here represent the first of their kind ever measured in the Pacific Ocean, as they indicate an upward flux of molecular oxygen from a basaltic aquifer, something that has so far only been documented - at one other location worldwide - the North Pond site in the Atlantic Ocean. We show that the diffusion of oxygen from the seamount basaltic basement into the overlying pore waters affects the preservation of organic compounds and helps to maintain a completely oxygenated sedimentary column at all 3 sites near the seamount...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} environments in the oceans, {{including}} <b>deep-sea</b> trenches, abyssal <b>plains,</b> volcanic seamounts, convergent, divergent, and transform plate margins.

40|$|The {{permanent}} metazoan meiofauna {{associated with}} vestimentiferan tubeworm aggregations from hydrocarbon seeps {{of the upper}} Louisiana slope in the Green Canyon (~ 550 m) and the lower slope in Atwater Valley (~ 2200 m) of the Gulf of Mexico was characterized. Meiofauna abundance, diversity, and community composition at genus level were compared between these seep sites, and with those of tubeworms from hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise (Gollner et al. 2007; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 337 : 39 â€“ 49). The abundance was not significantly different between the 2 seep sites, and was also {{similar to those found}} at vents. A total of 150 meiobenthic genera were identified from the cold seep sites. While no significant difference in univariate measurements of diversity was detected, a shift in community composition between the shallow and the deep seep site was found. The hot vent communities included a total of only 17 genera and the diversity measurements were significantly lower at vents than at seeps. Also, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was 97 % between the meiobenthic communities from seeps and vents. The genera richness was negatively correlated with maximum temperature and maximum sulfide concentration, and positively correlated with minimum pH value. We conclude that the harsh conditions tubeworms experience at vents compared to the moderate conditions at cold seeps, as well as the longevity of cold seeps surrounded by sedimented <b>deep-sea</b> <b>plains</b> but short-lived vents on basaltic mid-ocean ridges, might explain the contrasting diversity patterns...|$|R
40|$|Benthic marie {{systems of}} the Norwegian shelf belong to the most diverse cold water systems on marine shelves. At the same time these systems {{experience}} strong anthropogenic impacts and provide significant services and goods, which calls for a sustainable management based on an ecosystem approach. The MAREANO project (Marine AREA database for NOrwegian coasts and sea areas) aims at addressing the knowledge gaps on the seabed and environment as the base for a sustainable management. Therefore, {{large parts of the}} northern Norwegian shelf have been intensively studied with multibeam echosounder, providing detailed bathymetry data for terrain analysis and backscatter data, which aids sediment interpretation. The area has also been sampled by different biological gears (video, beam trawl, grab, epibenthic sled) to investigate benthic habitat distribution. Species diversity, abundance and biomass have been determined, and secondary production and productivity of macrozoobenthic organisms modeled. Here, we present results from data covering an area of 48 000 km 2 of the Norwegian continental margin between the Lofoten islands and North Cape and from the Norwegian and Barents Sea. The study area stretches from banks on the shelf (80 m depth) to the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>plains</b> (2750 m), and has been samples with 101 stations during seven cruises from 2006 - 2009. This dataset is unique in spatial coverage as it presents for the first time large-scale macrozoobenthic production on the Norwegian continental shelf. We will present spatial distribution of the macrozoobenthic production and productivity, together with an introductory analysis of the connections between different benthic biological characteristics (taxonomic, functional groups) and sediment as well as terrain parameters for benthic landscapes that have been defined for the same area using video analyses. For the first time, the outcomes will allow to estimate large-scale benthic production and productivity and therefore to evaluate high and low productive benthic regions on the Norwegian shelf...|$|R
40|$|Species diversity, phylogenetic affiliations, and {{environmental}} occurrence patterns of thiosulfate-oxidizing marine bacteria were investigated by using new isolates from serially diluted continental slope and <b>deep-sea</b> abyssal <b>plain</b> sediments collected {{off the coast}} of New England and strains cultured previously from Galapagos hydrothermal vent samples. The most frequently obtained new isolates, mostly from 103 - and 104 -fold dilutions of the continental slope sediment, oxidized thiosulfate to sulfate and fell into a distinct phylogenetic cluster of marine alpha-Proteobacteria. Phylogenetically and physiologically, these sediment strains resembled the sulfate-producing thiosulfate oxidizers from the Galapagos hydrothermal vents while showing habitat-related differences in growth temperature, rate and extent of thiosulfate utilization, and carbon substrate patterns. The abyssal deep-sea sediments yielded predominantly base-producing thiosulfate-oxidizing isolates related to Antarctic marine Psychroflexus species and other cold-water marine strains of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum, in addition to gamma-proteobacterial isolates of the genera Pseudoalteromonas and Halomonas-Deleya. Bacterial thiosulfate oxidation is found in a wide phylogenetic spectrum of Flavobacteria and Proteobacteria...|$|R
40|$|Although {{ferromanganese}} nodules on the {{deep-ocean floor}} {{were discovered in}} 1873 during voyages of HMS Challenger, their economic potential came to light only in 1965. By now, the 1970 's "Nodule Rush " has almost come to an end. Most of the pioneer countries in this field have realized that the present techno-economic situation is {{not in favor of}} nodule mining. Therefore, the UN registered Pioneer Investors appear to have preserved the demarcated nodule mine sites for future use. As a spin-off of that Nodule Rush, foreign and Indian scientists explaining the mystery of nodule carpets on the sea-floor have published several research papers. In this paper we attempt to discuss the chemistry, mineralogy, morphology and allied features of the oceanic ferromanganese deposits in relation to their genesis and growth. We also discus in brief the importance of seamount ferromanganese crusts both as resources and as recorders of the paleoceano- graphic events. Oceanic ferromanganese deposits occur mainly in two forms, as nodules and as encrustations; while the nodules form a carpet on the <b>deep-sea</b> abyssal <b>plains...</b>|$|R
