When Ramsey refused the supervisor’s request, she was fired from her job.

25|$|In California, union {{activities}} were based in Santa Cruz, where in 1977 the IWW engaged {{in one of}} its most ambitious campaigns of the 1970s: an attempt in 1977 to organize 3,000 workers hired under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) in Santa Cruz County. The campaign led to pay raises, the implementation of a <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure,</b> and medical and dental coverage, but the union failed to maintain its foothold, and in 1982 the CETA program would be replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act. The IWW would win some lasting victories in Santa Cruz, however, with successful campaigns at the Janus Alcohol Recovery Center, the Santa Cruz Law Center, Project Hope, and the Santa Cruz Community Switchboard.|$|E
25|$|Republican Party Senator Mark Hanna from Ohio, {{himself an}} owner of {{bituminous}} coal mines (not involved in the strike), sought to resolve the strike as it occurred {{less than two months}} before the presidential election. He worked through the National Civic Federation which brought labor and capital representatives together. Relying on J. P. Morgan to convey his message to the industry that a strike would hurt the reelection of Republican William McKinley, Hanna convinced the owners to concede a wage increase and <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure</b> to the strikers. The industry refused, on the other hand, to formally recognize the UMWA as the representative of the workers. The union declared victory and dropped its demand for union recognition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cases of}} Hattie Williams and Viola Watson {{highlighted}} {{the difficulties of}} labor organizing on Duke’s campus. Initially, unionization efforts {{had little effect on}} working conditions because of a historically unwelcoming environment for labor unions, and the resulting lack of recognition by the University’s entire population. At first, employees attained only minor improvements in pay, and a new <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure</b> easily manipulated by management and administrators. In the case of Hattie Williams and Viola Watson, members involved with Local 77 and African-American housekeepers who had worked for at least four years, were fired without warning in the winter of 1966. Both workers received no complaints about the quality of their work. However, both previously involved themselves in the Local 77 movement; Williams was a Union Steward and Watson had picketed for higher wages with the union. [...] They used the <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure</b> to reclaim their positions in the University. However, only Hattie Williams was returned to her job while Watson was denied permission to her previous position.|$|E

2500|$|Motivated by the {{struggle}} for social equality, {{more than a thousand}} students and faculty demonstrated on the campus quad, boycotting the dining halls.

However, the administration continued to refuse collective bargaining rights. Instead, they implemented the Duke University Employees Advisory Committee, a faculty committee that negotiated with nonacademic workers. This included the participation of “twelve technical and clerical worker representatives along with twelve service and maintenance worker representatives.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One problem some {{commentators}} have noted is that members-only collective bargaining creates problems of competition within the workplace. [...] Employers may not respond favorably when a proposed solution will {{force them to}} alter work rules and personnel policies across the entire workforce. [...] As one reviewer argued: [...] "Bargaining over wages for members only or a <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure</b> for members only may be possible. Many subjects will have an effect upon non-members and potentially all other non-represented employees. Such issues may adversely impact non-members {{who do not want}} representation." [...] On the other hand, the same problems—if they are problems—could also exist where voluntary recognition and bargaining occurs with a members-only minority union, which is unquestionably legal under the Act. [...] That was conceded by the General Counsel in the Dick's case Advice Memorandum.|$|E
2500|$|The Local 77 Statement of Policy {{pointed out}} the {{inconsistency}} of the present Duke policies ruling out previous segregationist practices, as discrimination still existed, and believed it was too easy “for lower Management to work in clear violation of the University’s avowed policy.” [...] The last step of the <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure,</b> a meeting between {{three members of the}} Personnel Policy Committee closely tied to the University, claimed to be “perfectly objective in rendering a final decision” for the Williams and Watson case. However, in his letter to university president Douglas Knight, Harvey proposed that “if Duke truly wishes to be fair in its dealings with employees, a disinterested third party should constitute the final appeal on grievances.” [...] The primary goal of Local 77 was to gain impartial arbitration as a way to settle disputes objectively, allowing the participation of a third party to discern final judgments.|$|E
40|$|Most {{employers}} installed {{sexual harassment}} <b>grievance</b> <b>procedures</b> and sensitivity training {{by the late}} 1990 s. It was personnel experts, not courts, legislatures, or lawyers, who promoted these antihar-assment strategies, drawn from the profession’s tool kit. Personnel succeeded because it was executives, not public officials, who defined professional jurisdiction, and executives proved susceptible to per-sonnel’s argument that bureaucratic routines could reduce legal risk. With each landmark in harassment law, more employers adopted the <b>grievance</b> <b>procedures</b> personnel advocated despite negative re-views from lawyers. Employers who consulted personnel experts {{were more likely to}} join the bandwagon; those who consulted law-yers were less likely. The case holds lessons for the evolution of professions, because executives play an increasing role in defining professional jurisdiction.

2500|$|Duke University {{demonstrated}} {{both the}} anti-union and racist attitudes of Durham while holding {{the power of}} a large corporation. Historically, blacks were confined to non- or semi-skilled jobs. [...] While this can be partially attributed to lack of proper qualifications, [...] Duke’s Vice President in charge of Business and Finance, Charles B. Huestis, openly admitted that Duke “practice wholesale racial discrimination in its hiring policies.” [...] The salaries of these non-skilled workers reflected additional inequality, as maids and janitors, all who were black, received wages between $1.15-1.50 per hour— well below the minimum wage of $1.60. [...] Workers were also disadvantaged in other regards, as the University had no <b>grievance</b> <b>procedure,</b> policy for summer layoffs, or job classification system. Furthermore, the University ignored the seniority system in terms of job advancement and firing procedures. Suppressing workers’ voices in the formation of workplace policies, Duke encouraged unskilled employees to simply make complaints, which their superiors then ignored. [...] Thus, the poor working conditions, low wages, racism, and desire to secure more authority and control in the workplace provided sufficient fuel for Duke workers to consider forming a union.|$|E
