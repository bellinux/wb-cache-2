500|$|Short and stocky, Hill was {{a gifted}} batsman who could score quickly when required. [...] Wisden {{described}} Hill as a [...] "specially brilliant batsman on hard pitches". He had an awkward crouched stance, gripping the bat {{low on the}} handle. This limited his forward reach and power and reduced his effectiveness when driving but he compensated for this with quick footwork. Hill's strong bottom hand and his keen eye allowed him to play the cut shot cleanly and with confidence and to hit powerfully on the leg side. [...] He preferred batting against fast bowling rather than slow and medium pace bowlers {{and he was a}} fearless exponent of the hook shot. [...] Hill had a tendency to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "nervous nineties", being dismissed six times between 90 and 99 in Test matches. This included a sequence in the 1901–02 series against England of 99, 98 and 97 in successive innings.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|The three Zero Escape {{games are}} narratively linked, with events of Zero Time Dilemma {{occurring}} between 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. Each {{game in the}} series follows a group of nine people who get kidnapped by masked individuals who call themselves [...] "Zero", and are locked inside a facility where {{they are forced to}} play a death game where the participants are locked inside rooms and have to solve puzzles in order to <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first two games, the death game {{is referred to as the}} Nonary Game, while the one in the third game is called the Decision Game. The characters do not at first appear to have anything in common, but throughout the course of the games, it is revealed that each was chosen for a specific purpose, including connections to previous narrative elements from the other games in the series. The characters attempt to escape from the facility, to identify Zero, and to learn of Zero's goal.|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs {{moved to}} Lawrence, Kansas in 1981, taking up {{residence}} at 1927 Learnard Avenue {{where he would}} {{spend the rest of}} his life. He once told a Wichita Eagle reporter that he was content to live in Kansas, saying, [...] "The thing I like about Kansas is that it's not nearly as violent, and it's a helluva lot cheaper. And I can <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country and fish and shoot and whatnot." [...] In 1984, he signed a seven-book deal with Viking Press after he signed with literary agent Andrew Wylie. This deal included the publication rights to the unpublished 1952 novel Queer. With this money he purchased a small bungalow for $29,000. He was finally inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 after several attempts by Allen Ginsberg to get him accepted. He attended the induction ceremony in May 1983. Lawrence Ferlinghetti remarked the induction of Burroughs into the Academy proved Herbert Marcuse's point that capitalistic society had a great ability to incorporate its one-time outsiders.|$|E
