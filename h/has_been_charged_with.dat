5|$|Within {{days of the}} murder, D.C. police {{alleged that}} the crime scene had been {{tampered}} with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky and Ward with obstruction of justice and conspiracy related to alleged tampering with the crime scene. The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. No one <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Wone's killing.

5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E
5|$|Barton's {{career and}} life have {{been marked by}} {{numerous}} controversial incidents and disciplinary problems {{and he has been}} convicted twice on charges of violence. On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 days of this prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach and for attacking three players {{on the final day of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E

5|$|In January 2012, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) gives Marsden {{a letter}} incriminating Phil {{in the death}} of a {{homeless}} man, who died when he torched the car lot in an insurance scam in 1994; she adds that Phil also murdered Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and Marsden thanks Denise for the information. Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella to jump off a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he must accept that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about Phil, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day of Phil's release he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up, and suggests that Ben may ultimately bring Phil down.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{the murder of his}} girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E
