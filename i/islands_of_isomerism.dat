40|$|We {{report the}} {{accurate}} prenatal diagnosis at 22 weeks gestation <b>of</b> right atrial <b>isomerism</b> {{in association with}} tricuspid atresia. Several distinctive sonographic features <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the right atrial appendages were present in this fetus: complex cardiac abnormality, ventriculoarterial discordance, juxtaposition of the aorta and the inferior vena cava to the right side, pulmonary atresia, and anomalous pulmonary venous return to the morphological right atrium. Tricuspid atresia, which is an extremely rare lesion within heterotaxy spectrum disorders, was present. Postnatal investigations confirmed all prenatally diagnosed abnormalities, with additional findings of pulmonary atresia with discontinuous pulmonary arteries and bilateral arterial ducts, asplenia, and bilateral eparterial bronchi. To our knowledge, tricuspid atresia in the setting <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the right atrial appendages has not previously been diagnosed or reported prenatally.

40|$|AbstractShort-term {{traffic flow}} {{forecasting}} for junction <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> road network {{which consists of}} freeway network and urban road network, is the key technology of traffic management and intelligent control. Real-time and reliability of short-term traffic flow forecasting {{is directly related to}} traffic management and collaborative control. There are various methods that have been established to forecast traffic flow, but most of the forecasting models are constructed according to analysis of the historical and current traffic flow series in selected sections or crossings, without considering the dynamic information of related traffic network. According to the traffic flow characters <b>of</b> junction <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> road network system, the paper analyzes the relationship between the traffic flow of a certain section with other section's flow, and calculates the dynamic correlation coefficient. Following, the paper selects input variables, and establishes the Radial Basic Function (RBF) neural network model for prediction on the basis of dynamic correlation coefficient. Finally, the paper takes the G 2 freeway and Beijing road network that consists of the junction <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> road network as an example to forecast the short-term traffic flow. The result of forecasting is very accurate, and the relative errors are within the 15 %. It indicates that the model could be used to forecast the short-term traffic flow for junction <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> road network system...|$|R

40|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (Shh) is a secreted morphogen {{necessary for}} the production of sidedness in the developing embryo. In this study, we describe the morphology of the atrial chambers and atrioventricular junctions of the Shh null mouse heart. We demonstrate that the essential phenotypic feature is <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the left atrial appendages, in combination with an atrioventricular septal defect and a common atrioventricular junction. These malformations are known to be frequent in humans with left isomerism. To confirm the presence <b>of</b> left <b>isomerism,</b> we show that Pitx 2 c, a recognized determinant of morphological leftness, is expressed in the Shhnull mutants on both the right and left sides of the inflow region, and {{on both sides of the}} solitary arterial trunk exiting from the heart. It has been established that derivatives of the second heart field expressing Isl 1 are asymmetrically distributed in the developing normal heart. We now show that this population is reduced in the hearts from the Shh null mutants, likely contributing to the defects. To distinguish the consequences of reduced contributions from the second heart field from those of left–right patterning disturbance, we disrupted the movement of second heart field cells into the heart by expressing dominant-negative Rho kinase in the population of cells expressing Isl 1. This resulted in absence of the vestibular spine, and presence of atrioventricular septal defects closely resembling those seen in the hearts from the Shh null mutants. The primary atrial septum, however, was well formed, and there was no evidence <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the atrial appendages, suggesting that these features do not relate to disruption of the contributions made by the second heart field. We demonstrate, therefore, that the Shh null mouse is a model <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the left atrial appendages, and show that the recognized associated malformations found at the venous pole of the heart in the setting <b>of</b> left <b>isomerism</b> are likely to arise from the loss of the effects of Shhin the establishment of laterality, combined with a reduced contribution made by cells derived from the second heart field...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{encapsulation}} complexes create spaces {{where two}} or more molecules can be temporarily isolated. When the mobility of encapsulated molecules is restricted, different arrangements in space are possible, and new forms <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> (“social isomerism”) are created: the orientation of one encapsulated molecule influences {{that of the other}} in the confined space. Expansion of a capsule's length is possible through addition of small-molecule spacer elements. The expanded capsules have dimensions that permit the observation <b>of</b> social <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> two identical guests, and they adopt arrangements that properly fill the host's space. The host also can adapt to longer guests by incorporating additional spacers, much as protein modules are added to a viral capsid in response to larger genomes.

40|$|The {{most complex}} {{combinations}} of congenital cardiac malformations {{are found in}} the setting <b>of</b> bodily <b>isomerism.</b> The question remains, however, as to whether evidence <b>of</b> cardiac <b>isomerism</b> is always {{to be found in the}} setting <b>of</b> bodily <b>isomerism,</b> also known as “heterotaxy. ” We have previously shown that, when assessed on the basis of the extent of the pectinate muscles relative to the atrioventricular junctions, there is always <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the atrial appendages in this setting. Doubt has been remained, however, as to whether these cardiac features can accurately be recognized during life. We have now encountered two patients showing features of the left and right bodily <b>isomerism.</b> Examinations <b>of</b> these patients made using computed tomography show that all features <b>of</b> <b>isomerism,</b> no matter how complex, can now be visualized during life. The images currently presented show, furthermore, that the features of the so-called “heterotaxy” can be seen during life, not only within the heart but also in all the thoracic and abdominal organs, albeit that the isomeric features are confined to the thoracic organs. Based on the images presented, we argue that if each system of organs is analyzed and described in independent fashion; then it is possible for clinicians to exclude any suggestion of ambiguity and to provide accurate descriptions of the overall arrangement. We further discuss the appropriate terminology to describe the entity we prefer to call isomerism, along with the indications and usefulness of computed tomography in revealing the anatomic features of the congenitally malformed heart...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{location}} of the sinus node {{is known to be}} at best abnormal, or at worst unknown, in patients with <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the morphologically left atrial appendage. In contrast, the sinus node is known to be an excellent histological marker of the morphologically right appendage, being duplicated in those with right <b>isomerism.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the study was to investigate this condition further in fetal human and mouse hearts. METHODS [...] Serial histological sections of the area anticipated to contain the sinus node were studied in hearts with <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the atrial appendages taken from 14 human fetuses and 13 iv/iv mice, using 12 mouse hearts with normally arranged or mirror imaged atrial chambers for controls. RESULTS [...] All hearts with <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the right appendages (two human and four mouse) had bilateral sinus nodes. The cases with <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the left appendages (12 human and nine mouse) showed absence of a recognisable sinus node except in four cases (19 %) in which a small remnant of the node was found. In three of these cases, it was related postero-inferiorly to the superior cavoatrial junction. CONCLUSIONS [...] The concept <b>of</b> <b>isomerism</b> <b>of</b> the atrial appendages is endorsed by findings on the morphology of the sinus node, this being the most reliable histological criterion for existence of a morphologically right atrium. A small proportion of hearts with left isomerism had a structure resembling the sinus node, but it was hypoplastic and displaced postero-inferiorly, distant from its expected position had the hearts possessed an incompletely formed morphologically right appendage...|$|R

40|$|A {{prenatal}} diagnosis <b>of</b> right atrial <b>isomerism</b> is often inferred through {{the recognition of}} a constellation of cardiac anomalies on the four-chamber view or by the detection of visceral heterotaxy and asplenia.
