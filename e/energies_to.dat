5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E

5|$|John Jeremy Thorpe {{was born}} in 1929, the son and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs. After school at Eton, he studied law at Trinity College, Oxford, where, having decided on a political career, he devoted his main <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> making a personal impact rather than to his studies. Rejecting his Conservative background, he joined the small, centrist Liberal Party, by the late 1940s a declining force in British politics but still offering a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician. He became secretary, and eventually president, of the university's Liberal Club, and met many of the party's leading figures. In the Hilary term (January–March) of 1950–51 Thorpe {{served as president of}} the Oxford Union.|$|E
5|$|Local {{interest}} in restoring the Middle Levels for navigation {{began to develop}} in 1949. The Fenlands Branch of the Inland Waterways Association was formed on 30 October 1949, and following assurances from the Ouse Catchment Board that they were planning to restore the river for navigation up to Bedford, the branch decided to devote their <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> the Middle Levels, which were weedy and heavily silted. Salters Lode lock was rebuilt in 1963, but passage along Well Creek was very difficult. The East Anglian Waterways Association and the Middle Level Watermans Club began campaigning {{for it to be}} dredged in 1964. The first major working party by volunteers on the system occurred in 1972, when the Well Creek Trust organised a project called 'Fenatic' in October, which involved draining the creek so that it could be cleared of rubbish. It was reopened for traffic in 1975.|$|E

The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E

5|$|The final {{episode of}} the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss {{government}} branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player (later hinted to be Artanis) initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while {{on a mission to}} arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead. A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment. The dark templar prove their worth when they use their <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them. Aided by Raynor's forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind's weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind's outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his command ship and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E

5|$|In December, {{the deputies}} {{of the other}} provinces convened by the {{circular}} of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party. However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.|$|E
