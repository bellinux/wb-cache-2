2500|$|Blood testing <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{test for}} allergies; however, it poses the same {{disadvantage}} and only detects IgE allergens {{and does not}} work for every possible allergen.

The score taken from the RAST is compared to predictive values, taken from {{a specific type of}} RAST. If the score is higher than the predictive values, a great chance the allergy is present in the person exists. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.|$|E

2500|$|Developments in {{landscape}} ecology illustrate the important relationships between spatial patterns and ecological processes. These developments incorporate quantitative methods that link spatial patterns and ecological processes at broad {{spatial and temporal}} scales. [...] This linkage of time, space, and environmental change can assist managers in applying plans to solve environmental problems. [...] The increased attention in recent years on spatial dynamics has highlighted {{the need for new}} quantitative methods that can analyze patterns, determine the importance of spatially explicit processes, and develop reliable models. [...] Multivariate analysis techniques are frequently used to examine landscape level vegetation patterns. [...] Studies use statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), or detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), for classifying vegetation. [...] Gradient analysis <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> determine the vegetation structure across a landscape or to help delineate critical wetland habitat for conservation or mitigation purposes (Choesin and Boerner 2002).|$|E

In Karpov–Csom, Bad Lauterberg 1977, (left-most diagram), GM Csom has thoroughly outplayed the reigning world champion, {{and is a}} knight and pawn ahead with a completely winning position. Karpov's last move, 49.Rd1–d7, {{looks to be a}} last gasp before resigning. Csom played the solid-looking 49...Nf8??, saving the attacked knight and attacking White's rook. But after Karpov's 50.Nf5!! (right-most diagram), Csom resigned. GM John Emms explains, [...] "Black is mated in all variations; for example: 50...exf5 51.Qh2+ Kg8 52.Qg3+ and Qg7# follows; 50...Nxd7 51.Qh2+ Kg8 52.Qg3+ Kh8 53.Qg7#; 50...Nf4 51.Rh7+ Nxh7 52.Qg7#." [...] Emms considers 50.Nf5!! one of [...] "The Most Amazing Chess Moves of All Time", while Tim Krabbé calls it one of the [...] "Most Fantastic Moves Ever Played". Instead of 49...Nf8??, Csom could have won with 49...Ng5! Now 50.Nf5!? would be met by 50...exf5 51.Qh2+ Kg8 52.Qh6 Re1+ 53.Kh2 (53.Kf2 Qf3#) 53...Rh1+! 54.Kxh1 Nf4+ 55.Rd5 Nxd5 and wins. If instead 50.Nh5!? Rg8 51.Nxf6 (or 51.Rg7 Nh4) Nh4! threatening 52...Qg2# (note that White cannot force mate with 52.Rh7+, since 52...Nxh7 gives discovered check by the rook).|$|E
