30|$|Equation (6) {{indicates}} that system inertia (i.e., {{the sum of}} the <b>inertia</b> <b>constants</b> of all generators) can affect the ROCOF. For a fault with a given size, the magnitude of the ROCOF is inversely proportional to system inertia. That is, the lower system inertia is, the larger the magnitude of the ROCOF is. The larger the magnitude of the ROCOF means the more severe frequency drop; thus, the lower system inertia can cause the more severe frequency drop, which may result in frequency instability.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{preserving}} dynamic security is different between the bulk power systems and MGs. In {{the case of}} the bulk power systems, the conventional synchronous generators are considered the source of the dynamics. Likewise, in MGs, the RESs are the host of dynamics. Moreover, most of the available methods for preserving the dynamic security of the bulk power systems are considered inefficient for MGs due to these methods are devised based on the features of the bulk power system, which are significant <b>inertia</b> <b>constant</b> and rather slow dynamics. Therefore, this research studies the dynamic security issue in the microgrids. In the MGs, the RESs exchange power to the MGs through inverters/converters. The power electronic interface-based RESs are static devices without any rotating mass so that the associated <b>inertia</b> <b>constant</b> is roughly zero. On the other hand, synchronous generators-based RESs are small-scale generators with noticeably low inertia constants [28]. Such a low <b>inertia</b> <b>constant</b> renders the MGs more vulnerable to the transients than the bulk power systems. Furthermore, the power generation from RESs are unpredictable and variable, results in more fluctuations in power flow and frequency in the MG, which significantly affects the power system operation. Also, the randomly changes in load power demand caused a bad response to the PCC voltage, active, and reactive powers transfer. To solve the dynamic stability problems, it must be determined the effective factors, which steer the MGs toward the insecurity. These factors include a low <b>inertia</b> <b>constant,</b> frequent fault occurrence, and inadequacy of existing protection schemes. Moreover, the performance of the protection system is one the most significant factors which imperils the dynamic security of the μGs. Therefore, the stability and protection coordination issues have become a center of interest especially for power system researchers. Hence, this research proposes an efficient coordination of secondary frequency control (i.e., LFC) and the digital OUFR for an islanded MG security considering high penetration of RESs.|$|E

40|$|A damage {{detection}} method is developed for nonlinear systems using model updating. The method uses a nonlinear discrete {{model of the}} system and the form of the nonlinear-ities to create an augmented linear model of the system. A modal analysis technique that uses forcing that is known but not prescribed is then used to solve for the modal prop-erties of the augmented linear system after the onset of damage. Due to the specialized form of the augmentation, the augmented system matrices may not be symmetric, also nonlinear damage causes asymmetrical damage in the updated matrices. A generalized minimum rank perturbation theory is developed to handle the asymmetrical damage sce-narios. The damage extent algorithm becomes an iterative process when damage occurs simultaneously in the mass and stiffness matrices. The method is demonstrated using numerical data from two nonlinear mass spring systems and a nonlinear truss. Various damage scenarios of the three nonlinear systems are used to explore the effectiveness of the method. The nonlinearities explored include cubic springs and Coulomb friction.

40|$|Abstract — Power {{generating}} plants need {{to operate}} synchronous power generators paralleled with local power grid {{for the purpose}} of real and reactive power exchanges and to have an uninterrupted operation of plant loads during grid outages. Failure to island generator system during grid outages results in generator feeding infinite grid. This results in sudden load surge on generator sets which could damage electro-mechanical systems and hence early detection and islanding the generator from grid is preferable. This paper presents a new technique for high speed detection of load surges using Kalman prediction algorithm. The paper also describes the conventional zero crossing detection algorithm. The paper describes both algorithms, analyses effectiveness of both conventional and Kalman prediction algorithms using MATLAB software. It is found Kalman prediction algorithm is able to detect load surges involving rotor angle changes from 2 º to 20 º in 1 ms compared to the conventional zero crossing approach which requires a minimum detection time of 12 ms. This fast detection encourages grid synchronized operation of generators with lower <b>inertia</b> <b>constants.</b> It is also analyzed and found that the effectiveness of the Kalman predictor algorithms is not affected significantly due to voltage harmonics...|$|R

The unique nature of the MicroGrid requires that the MicroGrid is stable in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode. In this paper, the major factors (such as control schemes of the flywheel energy storage system, types of load in the MicroGrid, location of the fault and <b>inertia</b> <b>constants</b> of motor load) influencing {{the stability of the}} MicroGrid are investigated. Three possible control strategies (PQ control, Droop control and Frequency/Voltage control) of the MicroGrid are described.
