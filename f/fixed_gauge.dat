40|$|During {{a one-year}} period, the {{variability}} of throughfall and the standard errors of the means associated with different gauge arrangements were studied in a lower montane rain forest in Puerto Rico. The following gauge arrangements were used: (1) 60 <b>fixed</b> <b>gauges,</b> (2) 30 <b>fixed</b> <b>gauges,</b> and (3) 30 roving gauges. Stemflow was measured on 22 trees of four different species. An ANOVA indicated that mean relative throughfall measured by arrangements 1 (77 %), 2 (74 %), and 3 (73 %) {{were not significantly different}} at the 0. 05 level. However, {{the variability of}} the total throughfall estimate was about half as high for roving gauges (23 %) as for <b>fixed</b> <b>gauges</b> (48 - 49 %). The variability of stemflow ranged from 36 % to 67 % within tree species and was 144 % for all sampled trees. Total stemflow was estimated at 4. 1 % of rainfall, of which palms contributed about 66 %. Comparative analysis indicated that while <b>fixed</b> and roving <b>gauge</b> arrangements can give similar mean values, least 100 <b>fixed</b> <b>gauges</b> are required to have an error at the 95 % confidence level comparable to that obtained by 30 roving gauges. © 2005 Elsevier B.
