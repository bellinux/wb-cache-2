5|$|According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's {{roof and}} siding were {{installed}} around 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by Stewart <b>Iron</b> <b>Works</b> in Cincinnati, Ohio, was installed around the church's cemetery. Electrical conduits {{were added to}} the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, heart pine plank floors were sanded and re-lacquered. Around 1990, the Stewart <b>Iron</b> <b>Works</b> fence and gate were restored by White’s Ornamental Ironworks.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{work had}} begun well before that date, however, and Ericsson's {{consortium}} contracted with Thomas R. Rowland of the Continental <b>Iron</b> <b>Works</b> at Greenpoint, Brooklyn on 25 October {{for construction of}} Monitors hull, with her keel being laid on that same day. The turret was built and assembled at the Novelty <b>Iron</b> <b>Works</b> in Manhattan, disassembled and shipped to Greenpoint where it was reassembled. The ship's steam engines and machinery were constructed at the DeLamater <b>Iron</b> <b>Works,</b> also in Manhattan. Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, who once served aboard Merrimack, was appointed Superintendent of the ship while she was undergoing construction. Although never formally assigned to the crew, he remained aboard her as an inspector during her maiden voyage and battle.|$|E
5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the hot blast furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee <b>Iron</b> <b>Works</b> was one of the first <b>iron</b> <b>works</b> to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{workers on}} Moss Jernverk were more anonymous, but {{typically}} for the advanced technology an <b>iron</b> <b>work</b> in that age was, {{most of them}} came from other countries - their names tell of Swedish and German origin. How important the skilled workers were for the <b>iron</b> <b>work</b> is shown in a letter Jacob von Hübsch wrote to the king on 27 December 1719 in which he states that, as the Great Northern War still was fought and the <b>iron</b> <b>work</b> was idle, he still had to pay his workers {{in order to keep}} them.|$|R

5|$|Though Parry {{had a great}} {{interest}} in music, he had no opportunity to study it until there was a temporary closure of the Rough and Ready <b>Iron</b> <b>Works.</b> Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the <b>iron</b> <b>works</b> was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught by one of the men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was forced}} to end his studies upon his father's death. While he volunteered for militia service in 1757 in {{response}} to French movements resulting in the siege of Fort William Henry, his unit received word while en route that the fort had fallen, and turned back. Even though the French and Indian War continued {{over the next several}} years, Allen did not apparently participate in any further military activities, and is presumed to have tended his farm, at least until 1762. In that year, he became part owner of an iron furnace in Salisbury. He also married Mary Brownson, a woman five years his senior, from the nearby town of Roxbury, in July 1762. They first settled in Cornwall, but moved the following year to Salisbury with their infant daughter Loraine. Allen bought a small farm and proceeded to develop the <b>iron</b> <b>works.</b> The expansion of the <b>iron</b> <b>works</b> was apparently costly to Allen; he {{was forced to}} sell off portions of the Cornwall property to raise funds, and eventually sold half of his interest in the works to his brother Heman. The Allen brothers sold their interest in the <b>iron</b> <b>works</b> in October 1765.|$|E

5|$|Allen wrote {{accounts}} of his exploits {{in the war}} that were widely read in the 19th century, as well as philosophical treatises and documents relating {{to the politics of}} Vermont's formation. His business dealings included successful farming operations, one of Connecticut's early <b>iron</b> <b>works,</b> and land speculation in the Vermont territory. Land purchased by Allen and his brothers included tracts of land that eventually became Burlington, Vermont. He was twice married, fathering eight children.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into a large}} family, Parry {{left school}} {{to work in the}} local coal mines when he was nine years of age.
