Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> recurrent disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the field trial were {{announced}} 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary {{of the death of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60–70% <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> PV2 and PV3, and 94% <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> the development of bulbar polio. Soon after Salk's vaccine was licensed in 1955, children's vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S, following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957. By 1961 only 161 cases were recorded in the United States.|$|E

5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> all {{clinically}} important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose {{cell wall}} contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Labrador Battery guns {{had limited}} effect {{during the battle}} and the rounds {{allocated}} to it were more armour-piercing cartridges rather than high explosive rounds which were more <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> the infantry.

5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E

40|$|The mother tinctures {{of desert}} were {{screened}} for antibacterial activity against bacterial strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mother tinctures were prepared by maceration process and antibacterial activity of different plants was evaluated and compared by measuring their zones of inhibition. The {{results indicated that}} Boerrhavia diffusa mother tincture had excellent activity only against Escherichia coli. Mother tincture of Chorozophora plicata showed highly <b>effective</b> results <b>against</b> Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas Echinops echinatus mother tincture showed highly effectiveness only against Salmonella typhi. Heliotropium europaeum mother tincture exhibited highly <b>effective</b> results <b>against</b> Bacillus subtilis in all concentrations. Tamrix aphylla presented maximum activity only against Bacillus subtilis in all three concentrations. Among the selected species Heliotropium europaeum, Chorozophora plicata and Tamrix aphylla were more <b>effective</b> plants <b>against</b> many microorganisms. However, Boerrhavia diffusa and Echinops echinatus were less <b>effective</b> plants <b>against</b> tested pathogenic bacteria...|$|R

There was too much tree cover for the British volleys to be <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach. As a disinfectant in water, chlorine {{is more than}} three times as <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> Escherichia coli as bromine, and more than six times as effective as iodine.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E

30|$|Gershenzon and {{coworkers}} [47, 48] suggested {{that in the}} natural world, high concentrations of defensive substances on the outer parts of plant bodies, such as terpenoids in glandular trichomes, could present a very <b>effective</b> barrier <b>against</b> herbivores.

5|$|Pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{a means of}} {{providing}} realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's Boeing B-29 Superfortress crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb. The pumpkin bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as the Fat Man plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic and handling characteristics. Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> actual targets.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are <b>effective</b> <b>against</b> herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
