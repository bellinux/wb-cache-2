5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers often {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} style and presentation, while criticising the gameplay. GamePro {{called it a}} [...] "rejuvenating, jaw-dropping experience". IGN said [...] "XIII has a great story-driven sheen, but at its core, it's weighed down by some occasional bewildering flaws, {{in addition to the}} lackluster weapons and simple combat". GameZone also criticised the combat, stating [...] "If not for the graphics to carry the game through, XIII would have been a boring game. Gunfights are {{the best part of the}} gameplay. It also happens to be the most unbalanced part". Edge said XIII had [...] "true artistic merit: <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> stale; every episode has been drawn with minute care and attention.

GameSpy criticised the graphics and the multiplayer mode, and concluded [...] "When it comes right down to it, XIII is a fine game...Just don't expect the FPS of the year because, sadly, this isn't it".|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the episode. Jane Simon of Daily Mirror said that [...] "White Bear" [...] lacked the [...] "instant emotional tug" [...] of the series opener. She commented that, {{a third of the}} way through the episode, she had lost hope that it would conclude effectively, [...] " [...] the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top [...] ", but that by the end she was positively surprised. Joyner praised it as [...] "stylistically ... breath-taking" [...] with [...] "intense action", but felt [...] "the themes come across as particularly flat" [...] and [...] "hardly original". He was disappointed until the twist, and concludes that Brooker has [...] "crafted an hour of television more bold and daring than I've seen in a long time". Jeffery said [...] "this is Black Mirror as full-blooded horror" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> boring, while criticized the characters and the final sequence as [...] "a little overlong and obvious". TheWrap staff was divided; while some found it has a good social critique, others considered it to be [...] "least effective when it goes for horror". Although Parker compared the first 45 minutes to [...] "a low-budget, low-quality version of 28 Days Later", full of [...] "horror movie clich√©s", he realised that was [...] "the whole point". He was positive to its societal criticism and wrote: [...] "So the reason it all felt like a rubbish horror movie for 45 minutes is because that's what it was, just with a real person in the centre of it." [...] It was ranked eleventh out of the thirteen episodes by Charles Bramesco of Vulture, who said its message is [...] "lost beneath a simplistic twist that pulls a switcheroo and [...] fails to do much else".|$|E
2500|$|Parts of {{the film}} are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that {{religion}} has {{to be involved in}} horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.|$|E

In July, Washingtonian magazine {{reported that}} Stevens had hired [...] "Washington's most powerful and expensive lawyer", Brendan Sullivan Jr., in response to the investigation. In 2006, during wiretapped conversations with Bill Allen, shortly after the VECO offices were searched and Allen agreed to cooperate with the investigation, Stevens expressed worries over legal complications arising from the sweeping federal investigations into Alaskan politics.

I hope to Christ <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> to that, and I don't think it will," [...] Stevens said. On the witness stand, [...] "Allen testified that VECO staff who had worked on his own house had charged 'way too much,' leaving him uncertain how much to invoice Stevens for when he had his staff work on the senator's house ... that he would be embarrassed to bill Stevens for overpriced labor on the house, and said he concealed some of the expense." ...|$|E

60|$|To-day, however, we have {{reversed}} this principle. We do despise vulgar compositions, {{and we do}} {{not ignore}} them. We are in some danger of becoming petty in our study of pettiness; there is a terrible Circean law in the background that if the soul stoops too ostentatiously to examine anything <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> up again. There is no class of vulgar publications about which there is, to my mind, more utterly ridiculous exaggeration and misconception than the current boys' literature of the lowest stratum. This class of composition has presumably always existed, and must exist. It has no more claim to be good literature than the daily conversation of its readers to be fine oratory, or the lodging-houses and tenements they inhabit to be sublime architecture. But people must have conversation, they must have houses, and they must have stories. The simple need for some kind of ideal world in which fictitious persons play an unhampered part is infinitely deeper and older than the rules of good art, and much more important. Every one of us in childhood has constructed such an invisible dramatis person√¶, but it never occurred to our nurses to correct the composition by careful comparison with Balzac. In the East the professional story-teller goes from village to village with a small carpet; and I wish sincerely that anyone had the moral courage to spread that carpet and sit on it in Ludgate Circus. But it is not probable that all the tales of the carpet-bearer are little gems of original artistic workmanship. Literature and fiction are two entirely different things. Literature is a luxury; fiction is a necessity. A work of art can hardly be too short, for its climax is its merit. A story can never be too long, for its conclusion is merely to be deplored, like the last halfpenny or the last pipelight. And so, while the increase of the artistic conscience tends in more ambitious works to brevity and impressionism, voluminous industry still marks the producer of the true romantic trash. There was no end to the ballads of Robin Hood; there is no end to the volumes about Dick Deadshot and the Avenging Nine. These two heroes are deliberately conceived as immortal.|$|E
60|$|The {{opening of}} a book goes for a great deal. The opening of Our Mutual Friend is much more instinctively {{energetic}} and light-hearted than that {{of any of the}} other novels of his concluding period. Dickens had always enough optimism to make his stories end well. He had not, in his later years, always enough optimism to make them begin well. Even Great Expectations, the saddest of his later books, ends well; it ends well in spite of himself, who had intended it to end badly. But if we leave the evident case of good endings and take the case of good beginnings, we see how much Our Mutual Friend stands out from among the other novels of the evening or the end of Dickens. The tale of Little Dorrit begins in a prison. One of the prisoners is a villain, and his villainy is as dreary as the prison; that might matter nothing. But the other prisoner is vivacious, and even his vivacity is dreary. The first note struck is sad. In the tale of Edwin Drood the first scene is in an opium den, suffocated with every sort of phantasy and falsehood. Nor is it true that these openings are merely accidental; they really cast their shadow over the tales. The people of Little Dorrit begin in prison; and it is {{the whole point of the}} book that people never get out of prison. The story of Edwin Drood begins amid the fumes of opium, and <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> out of the fumes of opium. The darkness of that strange and horrible smoke is deliberately rolled over the whole story. Dickens, in his later years, permitted more and more his story to take the cue from its inception. All the more remarkable, therefore, is the real jerk and spurt of good spirits with which he opens Our Mutual Friend. It begins with a good piece of rowdy satire, wildly exaggerated and extremely true. It belongs to the same class as the first chapter of Martin Chuzzlewit, with its preposterous pedigree of the Chuzzlewit family, or even the first chapter of Pickwick, with its immortal imbecilities about the Theory of Tittlebats and Mr. Blotton of Aldgate. Doubtless the early satiric chapter in Our Mutual Friend is of a more strategic and ingenious kind of satire than can be found in these early and explosive parodies. Still, there is a quality common to both, and that quality is the whole of Dickens. It is a quality difficult to define--hence the whole difficulty of criticising Dickens. Perhaps it can be best stated in two separate statements or as two separate symptoms. The first is the mere fact that the reader rushes to read it. The second is the mere fact that the writer rushed to write it.|$|E
