Methods: A total of 193 undergraduate students (97 medical students, 96 business students) answered survey questions including <b>goal</b> contents, <b>goal</b> characteristics (<b>goal</b> autonomy, <b>goal</b> attainability, social value of <b>goal)</b> and satisfaction on their majors.

Results: <b>Goal</b> content analysis showed percentage of social concern <b>goal</b> was higher in medical students (25. 8 %) than business students (6. 3 %), whereas percentage of wealth <b>goal</b> was higher business students (24. 0 %) than medical students (3. 1 %).
