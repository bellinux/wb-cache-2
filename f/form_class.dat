Each <b>form</b> (<b>class)</b> marches down Chapel Road in chronological order, starting with the oldest living alumni. In {{the back of this}} long column is the about-to-graduate Sixth Form.|$|E
60|$|From {{the three}} forms {{occurring}} in approximately equal numbers {{in a state}} of nature, and from the results of sowing seed naturally produced, {{there is reason to believe}} that each form, when legitimately fertilised, reproduces all three forms in about equal numbers. Now, we have seen (and the fact is a very singular one) that the fifty-six plants produced from the long-styled form, illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same <b>form</b> (<b>Class</b> 1 and 2), were all long-styled. The short-styled form, when self-fertilised (Class 3), produced eight short-styled and one long-styled plant; and the mid-styled form, similarly treated (Class 4), produced three mid-styled and one long-styled offspring; so that these two forms, when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same form, evince a strong, but not exclusive, tendency to reproduce the parent-form. When the short-styled form was illegitimately fertilised by the long-styled <b>form</b> (<b>Class</b> 5), and again when the mid-styled was illegitimately fertilised by the long-styled (Class 6), in each case the two parent-forms alone were reproduced. As thirty-seven plants were raised from these two unions, we may, with much confidence, believe that it is the rule that plants thus derived usually consist of both parent-forms, but not of the third form. When, however, the mid-styled form was illegitimately fertilised by the longest stamens of the short-styled (Class 7), the same rule did not hold good; for the seedlings consisted of all three forms. The illegitimate union from which these latter seedlings were raised is, as previously stated, singularly fertile, and the seedlings themselves exhibited no signs of sterility and grew to their full height. From the consideration of these several facts, and from analogous ones to be given under Oxalis, it seems probable that {{in a state of}} nature the pistil of each form usually receives, through the agency of insects, pollen from the stamens of corresponding height from both the other forms. But the case last given shows that the application of two kinds of pollen is not indispensable for the production of all three forms. Hildebrand has suggested that the cause of all three forms being regularly and naturally reproduced, may be that some of the flowers are fertilised with one kind of pollen, and others on the same plant with the other kind of pollen. Finally, of the three forms, the long-styled evinces somewhat the strongest tendency to reappear amongst the offspring, whether both, or one, or neither of the parents are long-styled.|$|E
60|$|The {{last point}} which need here be noticed is that, {{as far as}} the means of {{comparison}} serve, some degree of relationship generally exists between the infertility of the illegitimate union of the several parent-forms and that of their illegitimate offspring. Thus the two illegitimate unions, from which the plants in Classes 6 and 7 were derived, yielded a fair amount of seed, and only a few of these plants are in any degree sterile. On the other hand, the illegitimate unions between plants of the same form always yield very few seeds, and their seedlings are very sterile. Long-styled parent-plants when fertilised with pollen from their own-form shortest stamens, appear to be rather more sterile than when fertilised with their own-form mid-length stamens; and the seedlings from the former union were much more sterile than those from the latter union. In opposition to this relationship, short-styled plants illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the mid-length stamens of the long- styled <b>form</b> (<b>Class</b> 5) are very sterile; whereas some of the offspring raised from this union were far from being highly sterile. It may be added that there is a tolerably close parallelism in all the classes between the degree of sterility of the plants and their dwarfed stature. As previously stated, an illegitimate plant fertilised with pollen from a legitimate plant has its fertility slightly increased. The importance of the several foregoing conclusions will be apparent at the close of this chapter, when the illegitimate unions between the forms of the same species and their illegitimate offspring, are compared with the hybrid unions of distinct species and their hybrid offspring.|$|E
