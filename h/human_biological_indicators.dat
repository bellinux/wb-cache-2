40|$|Introduction: The need of {{effective}} sterilization method and their monitoring is necessary. <b>Biological</b> <b>indicators</b> are specific microorganisms with high resistance toward particular sterilization methods. Their processes include steam autoclave, dry heat sterilizer, ethylene oxide sterilizer. This article has considered various methods {{to monitor the}} effectiveness of different sterilization methods used in orthodontics. Materials and Methods: The parameters for comparison were the control and experimental instruments utilized in orthodontic treatment. The efficacy of sterilization was evaluated by comparison of bacterial growth obtained in monitoring by <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> and swab test method. Results: No spore growth was found when sterilization process was evaluated by <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> in comparison to swab test where spore growth was present. Instruments dipped in Bioclenz-G solution for 10 min showed spore growth, but no spore growth was seen in 10 h cycle. Discussion: The result of the study verifies the established effectiveness of <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> over conventional swab test method in monitoring various sterilization processes used in orthodontics. Bioclenz-G solution {{can be used as}} an effective cold sterilization method for sterilization. Conclusion: For evaluating the effectiveness of sterilization, <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> preclude the drawbacks of incomplete verification of destruction of all vegetation and inordinate delay in procurement of results {{as is the case with}} chemical indicators and lab culture, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. In dental offices, {{sterilization}} {{of instruments}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects of infection control. Autoclave effectiveness in killing microorganisms can be verified by spore tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sterilization procedures of private dental offices in Hong Kong, and to test the effectiveness of their autoclaves using <b>biological</b> <b>indicators.</b> Methods. Packages of an 18 -item questionnaire and two <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> were sent to 402 private dental practices in Hong Kong. They were instructed to complete the questionnaire, and perform a spore test in their autoclave using the <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> and return them for incubation. Results. One hundred and eighty-two practices responded, with a response rate of 45 %. Excluding three imcomplete questionnaires and four practices using dry heat oven, a total of 175 autoclaves were tested. Thirteen (7 %) of the autoclaves failed the initial spore test. Twelve of these practices performed a re-test, whereupon two (1 %) of the autoclaves failed again. Among these 175 autoclaves, 77 (44 %) were the Fuji Elite model. The commonest (n= 72; 41 %) packing material and method entailed sterilization pouches. Twenty-three (13 %) of the respondents used improper sterilization time/temperature conditions for processing the instruments. For autoclaves older than 1 year, only 38 % (n= 58) had been serviced in the last year. One hundred and nine (62 %) of the respondents used chemical indicators and only seven (4 %) used <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> to monitor sterilization. Conclusion. Autoclaves in private dental practice in Hong Kong should be regularly checked, and their effectiveness routinely monitored. The use of <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> to monitor the sterilization was uncommon and knowledge about proper autoclaves usage needs improving. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Recent efforts have been undertaken to include <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> of soil quality into regional/national monitoring networks. Objectives. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide a first dataset of six <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> and two eco-physiological quotients for two landscape units in Wallonia. These spatial units are characterized by homogeneous climate conditions, soil type, land-use and management (here, grasslands in the Ardennes, and croplands in the Loam Region). Method. Respiration potential, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, net nitrogen mineralization, metabolic potential of soil bacteria and earthworm abundance were measured at a total of 60 sites in two different landscape units (LSU). Variability within each LSU was studied. Data was synthesized through calculation of a comprehensive score and presentation as radar plots. Results. All selected <b>biological</b> <b>indicators</b> were significantly higher under grassland than under cropland soils, highlighting the biological indicators’ power of discrimination between main land use types. Variability within LSU depended on the <b>biological</b> <b>indicator</b> and was generally higher in grassland than in cropland soils.
