40|$|The {{economic}} and financial crisis 2007 / 08 revealed profound weaknesses of the {{economic and}} financial governance framework of the European Union (EU), amongst them the insufficient coordination of EU policies in the field of economic policy. In 2011, EU member states created the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> which aimed at better coordinating member states' economic and fiscal policies. Focussing on French value-added tax (VAT) and environmental taxation policy between June 2011 and February 2015, I analyse under which conditions the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> process leads to changes in national taxation policies. I develop a theoretical framework that draws on rationalist Europeanization theory to argue that usage of <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> impulses by domestic pro-reform actors is the central mediating variable to explain whether <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> impulses lead to changes in national policies. The analysis reveals that despite similar <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> impulses the degree of subsequent changes in French taxation policies varied significantly. Whereas environmental taxation policy was transformed substantially, VAT policy was only slightly modified. The different strength of domestic usage by French pro-reform actors provides an explanation for this variance: While in environmental taxation policy, a group of pro-reform actors actively used the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> impulses to push for substantial reforms, pro-reform actors did not make use of the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> impulses in the field of VAT policy...|$|R

There are three options that could reduce the tension between the EU level and the national level over the legitimacy of the <b>European</b> <b>Semester,</b> while increasing its effectiveness: (i) Brussels goes to capitals: the direct presence of European institutions in national parliaments and the European Parliament acting as a watchdog; (ii) Capitals go to Brussels: greater presence of national par-liaments at European level; (iii) a new treaty creating a soft political union with some fiscal capacity and a real shift in decision-making authority to the EU.

The introduction of the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> economic policy surveillance system has not resolved these problems.

40|$|Before the crisis, {{flexicurity}} was {{a leading}} European Union (EU) policy concept, which aimed to balance labor-market flexibility and security. The recent focus on austerity measures to reduce public deficits might be thought to have reduced attention to the ‘security’ component of flexicurity. Accordingly, a ‘farewell to flexicurity’ has been claimed to have occurred. This paper challenges that claim and explores the role of flexicurity within the <b>European</b> <b>Semester.</b> It analyses the <b>European</b> <b>Semester’s</b> policy goals between 2007 and 2016, {{as well as the}} country-specific recommendations (CSRs) to member states between 2009 and 2015.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{framework}} of “Europe 2020 ”, European Union Member States are subject to {{a new system of}} economic monitoring and governance known as the <b>European</b> <b>Semester.</b> This paper seeks to analyse the way in which national health systems are being influenced by EU institutions through the <b>European</b> <b>Semester.</b> A content analysis of the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was carried out. This confirmed an increasing trend for health systems to feature in CSRs which tend to be framed in the discourse on sustainability of public finances rather than that of social inclusion with a predominant focus on the policy objective of sustainability. The likelihood of obtaining a health CSRs was tested against a series of financial health system performance indicators and general government finance indicators. The odds ratio of obtaining a health CSR increased slightly with the increase in level of general Government debt, with an OR 1. 02 (CI: 1. 01, 1. 03; p= 0. 007) and decreased with an increased public health expenditure/total health expenditure ratio, with an OR 0. 89 (CI: 0. 84, 0. 96; p= 0. 001). The <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> process is a relatively new process that is influencing health systems in the European Union. The effect of this process on health systems merits further attention. Health stakeholders should seek to engage more closely with this process which if steered appropriately could also present opportunities for health system reform...|$|R

40|$|To {{reinforce}} ex ante {{coordination of}} EU Member States’ economic and fiscal policies, a new monitoring cycle has been introduced: the “European semester” – a six-month period every year during which national budgetary and structural policies will be reviewed to detect any inconsistences and emerging imbalances while major budgetary decisions {{are still under}} preparation. Technically, the <b>European</b> <b>semester</b> brings together various procedures for economic policy coordination, based primarily on Article 121 (and to lesser degrees on Articles 126, 136 and 148) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Specifically, the reform reinforces the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, introduces a new procedure for addressing macroeconomic imbalances, and places greater emphasis on monitoring the national fiscal frameworks, identifying macrostructural growth bottlenecks and detecting macrofinancial risks in the Member States. National fiscal and economic policies will be monitored in a coordinated and integrated manner rather than separately, and national policies will be aligned with integrated guidelines. The new approach is also intended to facilitate joint discussion of important economic policy priorities at EU level, thereby ensuring complementarity of national economic policy plans through policy guidance before Member States finalize their budgets for the following year. The results of such discussions and the definition of economic and fiscal policy priorities will then be effectively reflected in national policymaking, particularly in national budgets and structural reforms. The <b>European</b> <b>semester</b> thus follows an integrative approach that moves toward comprehensive, country-specific economic surveillance, in some cases {{with the possibility of}} imposing corresponding sanctions, which is in marked contrast to the “open method of coordination” used under the Lisbon agenda. Upon implementation of the “six-pack” of economic governance rules in January 2012, the already stringent monitoring requirements will be tightened even further. <b>European</b> <b>semester,</b> EU economic governance reform, macro coordination...|$|R

In {{order to address}} these questions, this discussion paper analyses national parliamentary participation in two budgetary cycles of the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> (2014 and 2015) in Austria, France, Germany, and Ireland. While in France and Germany, compliance within the <b>European</b> <b>Semester</b> has been subject to strong politicization, {{this has not been}} the case in Austria and Ireland. Moreover, strong politicization coincided with the contestation of country-specific recommendations among the parliamentary parties. The empirical analysis established that strong formal powers in budgetary matters constitute an important prerequisite allowing parliamentary parties to articulate their contestation. However, the willingness to comply depends most directly on whether the content of country-specific recommendations is coherent with the economic preferences of a political party, not the government–opposition cleavage. Wird compliance im Rahmen des Europäischen Semesters durch nationale Parteien politisiert? Falls ja, entlang welcher Konfliktlinien orientieren sich parlamentarische Debatten? Um diese Fragen anzugehen, analysiert dieser Artikel die Beteiligung nationaler Parlamente in zwei Budgetzyklen des Europäischen Semesters (2014 und 2015) in Österreich, Deutschland, Frankreich und Irland. Während in Deutschland und Frankreich compliance im Rahmen des Europäischen Semesters verstärkt Gegenstand von Politisierung war, trifft dies in Irland und Österreich nicht zu. Darüber hinaus wurden in den Fällen mit starker Politisierung verstärkt auch Anfechtungen der länderspezifischen Empfehlungen durch die parlamentarischen Parteien festgestellt. Die empirische Analyse zeigt, dass starke formale Befugnisse in Budgetangelegenheiten eine wichtige Voraussetzung für Parlamente darstellen, länderspezifische Empfehlungen anzufechten. Allerdings hängt die Bereitschaft, den länderspezifischen Empfehlungen zu folgen, in großem Ausmaß davon ab, ob diese inhaltlich mit der zugrunde liegenden ökonomischen Haltung der Partei übereinstimmt und nicht von der Kluft zwischen Regierung und Opposition. 1 Introduction 2 What factors account for consent or contestation of EU policy guidance? 3 Research design 4 Empirical findings EU policy guidance in Ireland and Austria: Explaining domestic consent Explaining domestic contestation of EU policy guidance in Germany and France 5 Discussion Reference...|$|R
