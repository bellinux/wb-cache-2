40|$|Corporate {{reporting}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina is traditionally focused on meeting the legislation frame {{for the financial}} reporting. Changes in business environment influence on business perspective of doing business but also on decision making process for wide range of corporate stakeholders. All the matters aforesaid contribute to the necessary changes in traditional financial reporting. Risk reporting is only a first step of corporate reporting process improvement. The institutional frames for risk corporate reporting are IFRS and relevant EU directives. This paper analyzes requirements for corporate risk {{reporting in}} EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further, authors will analyze present situation of meeting institutional requirements for corporate risk reporting in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the sample of listing companies on Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Stock Exchange- SASE and give some recommendation how to improve it.

40|$|This {{research}} monograph examines whether International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) {{are interpreted}} and applied in a consistent manner {{within and across}} countries, and questions the implicit assumption that accounting convergence will automatically lead to comparability in financial reporting. Its review of the accounting judgment and decision making research published in the five top-tier accounting journals over {{the last forty years}} shows that there is a limited number of studies that have examined the importance of consistency in interpreting and applying a single set of accounting standards. Furthermore, the monographs and reviews on audit judgment and decision making research published over the years have strengthened this strand of research in auditing by providing insights and suggesting avenues for future research. However, limited comprehensive reviews have been published so far for the research undertaken in the domain of accounting judgment. This research monograph provides empirical evidence on the factors that act as constraints on achieving the objectives of convergence of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> <b>1.</b> Introduction [...] 1. 1.

40|$|This paper {{exploits}} {{a natural}} quasi-experiment {{to isolate the}} effects that were uniquely due to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) : U. S. firms with a public float under $ 75 million could delay Section 404 compliance, and foreign firms under $ 700 million could delay the auditor’s attestation requirement. As designed, Section 404 led to conservative reported earnings, but also imposed real costs. On net, SOX compliance reduced {{the market value of}} small firms. THE SARBANES–OXLEY ACT (SOX) was passed in 2002 after a string of high profile corporate scandals.

Using a matched sample of 184 companies over an eight-year period from 2003 to 2010, we empirically examine whether firms that practice aggressive <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> {{are more likely to be}} involved in corporate fraud. We determine aggressive <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> by (<b>1)</b> conducting a time-series test of timely loss recognition and (2) using asymmetric timeliness of earnings models. Our results show that firms with fraudulent financial statements employ aggressive <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> during the two years prior to the occurrence of fraud. Specifically, we found that firms engaged in fraud have significantly less timely loss recognition and lower asymmetric timeliness of earnings compared to firms not engaged in fraud. The result is robust even after including various controls. We conclude that aggressive reporting provides an early sign of the potential for corporate fraud, and thus contributes towards efforts to deter fraud...|$|R
40|$|International {{convergence}} of accounting standards {{has resulted in}} researchers' greater interests in international accounting research, which often involves the translation from one language into other languages. A {{number of studies have}} been conducted to examine the cross-cultural and cross-national similarities and differences in accountants’ judgments on 'uncertainty expressions'. National culture has been a dominant variable in explaining differences in accountants' judgments in a significant number of cross-cultural and cross-national studies published in leading journals, such as Accounting, Organizations and Society (AOS). However, {{it has been argued that}} the employment of the culture concept has been an excuse for intellectual laziness (Patel, 2004). The differences in subjects' judgments may not be fully attributable to differences in national culture. One of the possible reasons for crosscultural and cross-national differences in judgments may attribute to language and translation. To address this gap in literature, a within-subject experiment was conducted among final year undergraduate accounting students from three Chinese universities. The objectives of this study are to examine the influence of translation and economic context, namely financial performance of corporations, on subjects' judgments on the concept of control, which is the essential criterion in preparing consolidated <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> <b>1</b> page(s...|$|R

40|$|Interim {{reports are}} summary {{statements}} {{that are usually}} prepared in semi-annual format in the UK. Until the EU’s Transparency Directive was put into practice in the UK in 2007, there was no legal necessity for companies to provide interim <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> (Note <b>1)</b> Instead such preparation was only a regulatory requirement of the London Stock Exchange. The responsibility on companies listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide these <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> was first prepared as an suggestion in 1964, {{to meet the requirements}} for updates by financial analysts (May, 1971). In 1973, this advice to provide the market with interim information became a requirement for the admission of stocks and securities to be listed on the stock Exchange (Lunt, 1982).

The reduced transaction costs and improved efficiency in rendering the information are, however, powerful and far-reaching consequences of the language.

Specifically, we examine price and volume reactions to <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> issued in: (<b>1)</b> {{the first and third}} quarters, which are unaudited; (2) the second quarter, which is subject to limited audit; and (3) the fourth quarter (the annual report) which is subject to a full audit. We conclude that unaudited first and third quarter <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> that include condensed income statements and balance sheets convey enough new information to the market to spur significant price and trading reactions. This conclusion holds before and after the first and third quarter reports were made mandatory in 1999. We also found that the incremental information content of the second quarter report dropped after 1999, presumably because part of its information content was usurped by the newly required first quarter reports. Finally, we found evidence that mandatory audited reports announcements spur more significant price reactions than mandatory unaudited <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> In contrast to evidence from other countries, we found that smaller firms' disclosures do not generate a larger reaction than large firms' disclosures. ...|$|R

Small in size, the LSC was founded during a period of intense technological change. Containerization was proceeding apace, and the attendant economies of scale favoured larger enterprises in stevedoring. Yet the LSC operated {{for more than a decade}} in this environment, with heightened competitive rivalry among increasingly capital-intensive firms. The LSC was profitable in seven of its twelve years but operated on a shoestring for much of that time.
