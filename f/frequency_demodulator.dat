The theory provides a delta–sigma model {{to account for}} the excellent signal-to-noise spectral density ratio in a parametric study of the sensitivity performance. Then, the experiments verify the sensing principle and the predicted performance. Accordingly, a prototype sensor with high sensitivity is realized for noncontact cardiopulmonary monitoring, achieving a long sensing distance without the need for a low-noise amplifier. The sensing distance can grow four times longer by doubling the operating frequency. Furthermore, the sensor using a swept frequency can eliminate the null detection points and the external radio interference. As an experimental result, the sensor, which is placed 4 m away from the subject, can reliably detect the heartbeat signal an the operating frequency of 3. 6 GHz and an output power level of 0 dBm.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a high frequency electromagnetic field on transport properties of ballistic electron channels is investigated theoretically. We are primarily concerned with submicron-width channels formed by split-gate depletion of a two-dimensional electron gas at a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure interface. The pronounced quantization in the transverse direction of such channels opens the possibility to manipulate propagating electrons by inducing transitions between transverse modes by means of electromagnetic fields. Our investigations are focused on resonant mode coupling effects in long channels, induced by monochromatic far-infrared (FIR) fields polarized in the transverse direction of the channel. Within a single-particle transmission approach we predict the developing of spatial oscillations in the population of transverse modes, on a length scale much longer than the de Broglie wavelength. These oscillations have their correspondence in Rabi oscillations in atomic and molecular beams and in many other phenomena which exploit the resonant behavior of a two-level system. Different arrangements for detecting and exploiting this non-equilibrium situation are examined. A constriction in the channel leads to a retardation and a possibility for reflection of excited modes, while a widening leads to an acceleration and a possibility for excited modes to pass potential barriers. Such mechanisms affect the transmission probability and therefore lead {{to a change in}} the conductance. Also photovoltaic effects are found which eliminates the need for an external power supply.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Displacement sensors are key {{components}} in the closed loop control of nanopositioning systems, producing repeatable motions with nanometer resolution. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) offer a miniaturised solution for implementing low cost and high speed nanopositioners with integrated sensors. Among the MEMS displacement sensing techniques, only the electrothermal and piezoresistive sensors can be implemented for this purpose within a reasonable footprint. The performance of the aforementioned sensors is severely influenced by their inherent high noise levels, which limits the displacement resolution of the MEMS nanopositioner. As such, this thesis presents several displacement sensing techniques to improve {{the performance of the}} MEMS nanopositioners. In the first approach, a readout circuit is presented to increase the sensitivity of the electrothermal sensors. The sensor is coupled to a ring oscillator power supply by a ratiometric interface in order to convert the small resistive changes (390 ~ 400 Ω) to the wide frequency variation (350 ~ 550 kHz). Subsequently, the <b>frequency</b> <b>demodulator</b> circuits are designed to produce a voltage output. The experiments are carried out on a 1 -Degree of Freedom (1 -DoF) nanopositioner with a thermal actuator. In addition to the high sensitivity achievement, the ring oscillator nonlinearity is designed to cancel the actuator nonlinearity to produce a linear input-output transfer function, which otherwise needs a lookup table for calibration and closed loop control. The MEMS sensors are fabricated in doped silicon that inherently generates the flicker and thermal noise. The second approach in this thesis consists of two distinct solutions to mitigate the noise contribution. The flicker noise is inversely proportional to the applied heating signal frequency. Hence, a new excitation and readout technique is presented to drive the sensor with a high frequency voltage. The experiments are successfully conducted on a 1 -DoF MEMS nanopositioner, which demonstrate an 8 dB flicker noise reduction, when compared to the conventional dc (direct current) excitation. In order to alleviate the thermal noise, a multiple sensor system is developed based on the averaging theory, according to which a combination of multiple independent signals contaminated with the uncorrelated noise results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The sensors are implemented around a 1 -DoF nanopositioner in order to produce independent measurements of the displacement in real time. The experimental results on three sensors demonstrate a 4 dB SNR enhancement, which is in close agreement with the theory. Electrothermal sensors can be operated in constant current (CC) or in constant voltage (CV) excitation modes. In the third approach, an analytic comparison of the two methods is presented. It is shown that from the SNR point of view, the benefits of operating a sensor in CC mode are only marginal. The analytical investigation is supported by experiments performed on sensors integrated into a silicon on insulator (SOI) MEMS nanopositioner with low noise read out circuits, which leads to a 0. 04 nm/√Hz displacement resolution for both excitation modes. A new 2 -Degree of Freedom (2 -DoF) MEMS nanopositioner with electrothermal sensors is also presented in this dissertation for the scanning stage of the atomic force microscope (AFM), which is a significant achievement towards the miniaturisation of low cost AFMs for high speed operation. The electrothermal sensors are integrated to the stage in order to provide displacement information for a feedback control loop, which should be otherwise provided by an external sensor, such as an interferometer. The images obtained by the controlled nanopositioner demonstrate a great quality enhancement compared to the open loop nanopositioner. Finally, a piezoresistive sensing technique is presented in this thesis as an alternative integrated small area solution. Compared to the existing piezoresistive sensors, it is fabricated in the standard SOI process without any customised fabrication step. The embedded sensor is designed and characterised for a 1 -DoF nanopositioner and exploits the differential architecture to achieve higher sensitivity, linearity and common mode interference rejection...|$|E

40|$|The Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is an {{important}} component of many electronic devices; it can be employed as a frequency synthesizer, for clock data recovery, and as amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>demodulators.</b> It is an inherently nonlinear closed loop feedback system; the nonlinearity is due mainly {{to the fact that the}} feedback loop comparator exhibits quantization-like effects at its output. The consequence of this nonlinearity is a lack of understanding of the behaviour of the PLL loop, particularly the behaviour and stability of high order PLL systems. This thesis presents a new design technique for high order Digital PLL (DPLL) systems with a charge pump phase frequency detector component, offering an alternative to the common design practice which is to analyze the DPLL using a linearised model of the analogue PLL. The linear model can only be justified for low order DPLL systems that are close to lock. This is due to the fact that as the DPLL systems loop order and complexity increases the linear model becomes increasingly inaccurate, thus high orders are considered risky. The benefit of a high order DPLL loop is a purer output signal with less jitter and therefore better spectral efficiency making them highly desirable. The design of high order DPLL systems is realised here by utilising three novel design techniques. First, the complexity of the high order system equation is reduced by introducing an approximation of charge on the loop filter capacitors. Second, the nonlinearity is modelled using a piecewise linear model, thus the complexity of the model is further reduced by determining the system stability and lock time from only the first few samples in state space. Finally, to reduce the number of design variables that are required as the loop order is increased, filter prototypes, which only require one parameter, are introduced with the result of optimally placing the system poles. The consequence of implementing the above methodologies is that the mathematical restriction on the system order can be overcome and the stability of high order DPLL systems can be accurately determined...|$|R

40|$|Keywords?Gspread {{spectrum}} communication, frequency hopping) The Spread spectrum {{technology is}} one of the best methods to combat the problems of security and multiple access capacity of satellite communications. Spread spectrum communication can be divided into two categories: direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS). DSSS is often used in the multiple access environments to enhance the capacity of the systems, Whereas the FHSS is often used to improve the security of communication systems. Both encryption/decryption and anti-interference technologies can be employed to achieve security destination. In this project, we focus on the design of anti-jamming receiver. The frequency hopping spread spectrum method is employed in our project. The modulation most commonly used with this technique is M-ary frequency shift keying (MFSK), where k=log 2 M information bits are used to determine which one of M frequencies is to be transmitted. The position of the M-ary signal set shifted pseudo randomly by the frequency synthesizer over a hopping bandwidth. To acquire a satisfactory anti-jam capability, a slow frequency-hopped system usually has to add an extra mechanism of protection-that is where forward error-control (FEC) coding comes into play. Frequency hopping systems are classed as slow-frequency hopping (SFH), which means there are several modulation symbols per hop, or as fast-frequency hopping (FFH), which means that there are several frequency hops per modulation symbol. For SFH, the shortest uninterrupted waveform in the system is that of the data symbol; however, for FFH, the shortest uninterrupted waveform is that of the hop. FFH has the characteristics of both time and frequency diversity to combat interference. Since frequency-hopping techniques operate over such wide bandwidths, it is difficult to maintain phase coherence from hop to hop. Therefore, such schemes are usually configured using noncoherent demodulation. In a conventional MFSK system, the data symbol modulates a carrier a fixed frequency carrier; in an FH/MFSK system, the data symbol modulates a carrier whose frequency is pseudo-randomly determined. In either case, a single tone is transmitted. The FH system can be thought of as a two-step modulation process even though it can be implemented as a single step whereby the frequency synthesizer produces a transmission tone based on the simultaneous dictates of the PN code and the data. Recently, a single FHSS demodulator can be replaced by the combination of many individual digital fixed <b>frequency</b> <b>demodulators.</b> This project will also investigate and compare the advantages/disadvantages of these two FHSS receiver. On the other hand, we will investigate the parameters such as hopping rate, acquisition scheme, detection mode, hopping sequence etc. of a frequency hopping communication system, to suggest a suitable FH receiver design for experimental payload of the future NSPO communication satellite with the main concern of anti-jamming capability. 關鍵詞：展頻技術、跳頻、隨著網際網路的發達，通訊網路的安全性與多工使用容量等問題日益複雜，而通訊品質保障與資料保密也日趨重要。展頻通訊是衛星通訊中克服上述問題最好的方法之一。展頻通訊的作法分為直序系統與跳頻兩種。直序系統的方法主要是用於多工方面的性能增進；而跳頻的方式則非常有助於通訊的安全性。在通訊安全性方面，主要有加解密(Encryption/Decryption) 和反干擾(Anti-Interference) 兩種作法，本計畫將集中在反干擾方面的設計。在反干擾部份，採取的方式是展頻通訊中跳頻(Frequency-Hopping) 的作法。跳頻的方式是以M倍頻率漂移鍵(MSFK) 的方式來對信號做調變，使一個頻帶的資料分散至M個頻率(Tone) 上，藉由頻率多向性(Frequency Diversity) 的方式使資料不致於因某些頻率受干擾而受影響，或者即使受到影響也能夠藉由頻道編碼(Channel Coding) 的方式回復(Recover) 過來。跳頻的作法分為快式(FFH) 與慢式(SFH) 兩種，其區分是以跳頻速率(Hopping Rate) /資料速率(Symbol Rate) 之大小來區分。快速跳頻（fast frequency-hopped, FFH）系統有頻率與時間 雙重向度(diversity) 的特性，因此有相當好的抗干擾（antijam, AJ）性能。而慢速跳頻（slow frequency-hopped, SFH）系統為了達到符合規格的抗干擾能力，通常需要額外的機制來強化系統效能，一種常用的方式就是使用錯誤更正碼（error-control coding）。快式跳頻的作法雖然可以使資料較不易因干擾而毀損，但是相對的也將使混波器(Synthesizer) 的設計因要使頻道快速改變而增加難度；相反的，慢式跳頻的作法則要考慮其是否會在某些干擾模式下，降低其通訊品質。近來，以每個通道都使用一個價格低廉的解調變器，以數目較多（數十個至上百個）的數位化解調變器取代單一大型的射頻解跳頻系統是近年來一個新的做法，此一做法已有太空規格產品問世，並可提供相同頻寬，並且可以簡化端點同步的工作。本計畫將評估與分析新舊方法，亦即以較多數量之數位化解調變器取代單一大型射頻解跳頻系統，並設計出適用於未來系統之最佳化組件。另外，對系統各個實作選擇項的可行性進行評估，對兼顧反干擾能力與多工性等能力，且適用於通訊衛星之實驗酬載(Experimental Payload) 的衛星通訊系統進行系統規劃，研究安全性通訊系統中各項參數(如hopping rate、acquisition scheme、detection mode、hopping sequence) 的調整對系統品質提升的程度...|$|R

The electromagnets are integrated in an alternative Wheatstone bridge and powered with alternative tension. This circuit allows the measurement of the electromagnet inductance variation, and as this variation {{is a function of}} the air gap, the displacement can be deduced. The effect of eddy currents is assessed in order to choose the suitable bridge <b>frequency.</b> Finally, a <b>demodulator</b> is used to obtain the tension proportional to the air gap value. The behavior is assessed experimentally. Experiments are carried out on a simple beam; clamped at one end and simply supported at the other. The displacements could be measured by using four eddy current sensors and the inductive sensor. The inductive sensor displacement and a modal approximation of the four eddy current sensors resulting from impact testing are compared.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThis {{paper will}} discuss the {{performance}} of pulse code modulation (PCM) /frequency modulation (FM) during frequency selective fading. Frequency selective fading occurs when the attenuation in part of the frequency band of interest {{is much greater than}} {{in the rest of the}} band of interest. The frequency selective fading model used in this paper assumes that two paths with different delays exist between the transmitter and receiver (multipath). The two-path model was simulated in the laboratory and the effects of frequency selective fading on the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and on the waveforms at the output of the FM demodulator were measured. A mathematical model was also used to predict the effects of frequency selective fading. The predicted waveshapes are compared with the laboratory data. A simple demodulator which alleviates the effects of frequency selective fading on PCM/FM at moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will be described. This demodulator is created by detuning the telemetry receiver by a frequency equal to approximately one-half of the intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth and using the receiver’s amplitude modulation (AM) detector output rather than the FM detector output. The performance of this offset AM demodulator will be compared with the performance of an FM <b>demodulator.</b> <b>Frequency</b> selective fades measured in real-world environments will be also presented...|$|R
40|$|A novel phase-locked {{coherent}} optical {{phase demodulator}} with feedback and sampling is presented and investigated for high-linearity microwave photonic links. The overall receiver concept is novel {{in terms that}} we use feedback loop for linear phase demodulation and optical sampling to achieve operation at high RF signal <b>frequencies.</b> The phase-locked <b>demodulator</b> {{is to be used}} for RF signal demodulation of optically phase-modulated analog links. We aim at operating the demodulator for short-range applications since the demodulator only recovers the phase. A new time-domain numerical model is developed and the calculated results are in good agreement with measurements. The effect of amplitude and timing jitter associated with the optical pulse source is also taken into account. Stochastic Euler scheme is used to solve stochastic differential equations associated with amplitude and timing jitter. Using the model, we investigate how loop gain, tracking phase-modulator nonlinearities and amplitude modulation influence the signal-to-intermodulation ratio (SIR) of the demodulated signal. Furthermore, in order to alleviate nonlinearities associated with the tracking phase modulator, we report on a novel cancellation technique. The proposed cancellation technique is input RF signal power and frequency independent leading to a significant increase in dynamic range of the coherent demodulator. This technique demonstrates that large values of the signal-to-intermodulation ratio of the demodulated signal can be obtained even though the tracking phase modulator is fairly nonlinear, and thereby relaxing the linearity requirements for the tracking phase modulator. The demodulator is capable of operating at high frequencies, by using optical sampling to downconvert the high-frequency input RF signal to the frequency range of the baseband loop. Using the model the effect of optical sampling on the signal demodulation is investigated. The simulation results show that the operation of the sampling demodulator resembles the operation of the baseband demodulator for very short optical pulses (> 2 ps). We also investigate how signal-to-noise-ratio of the demodulator is affected by timing and amplitude jitter of the pulsed optical source. Finally, experimental demonstration of the sampling loop using the phase-locked demodulator is presented. We show that an improvement of 14. 1 dB in spur-free-dynamic-range is obtained using the proposed phase-locked coherent demodulator compared to the open loop sampling...|$|R
