40|$|Abstract — Hyperspectral imaging is an {{important}} tool in various fields, notably <b>geosensing</b> and astronomy, and {{with the development of}} new devices, it is now also being applied also in medicine. Concepts and tools from signal processing and data analysis need to be employed to analyze these large and complex data sets. In this paper, we present several techniques which generally apply to hyperspectral data, and we use them to analyze a particular data set. With light sources of increasingly broader ranges, spectral analysis of tissue sections has evolved from 2 wavelength image subtraction techniques to Raman near infra-red microspectroscopic analysis permitting discrimination of cell types and tissue patterns. We have developed and used a unique tuned light source based on micro-optoelectromechanical systems (MOEMS) and applied algorithms for spectral microscopic analysis of normal and malignant colon tissue. We compare the results to our previous studies which used a tunable liquid filter light source. I...|$|E
40|$|Hyperspectral imaging is a {{promising}} tool for applications in <b>geosensing,</b> cultural heritage and beyond. However, compared to current RGB cameras, existing hyperspectral cameras are severely limited in spatial resolution. In this paper, we introduce a simple new technique for reconstructing a very high-resolution hyperspectral image from two readily obtained measurements: A lower-resolution hyperspectral image and a high-resolution RGB image. Our approach {{is divided into}} two stages: We first apply an unmixing algorithm to the hyperspectral input, to estimate a basis representing reflectance spectra. We then use this representation in conjunction with the RGB input to produce the desired result. Our approach to unmixing is motivated by the spatial sparsity of the hyperspectral input, and casts the unmixing problem as the search for a factorization of the input into a basis and a set of maximally sparse coefficients. Experiments show that this simple approach performs reasonably well on both simulations and real data examples. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{programming}} {{framework for the}} implementation of norm-aware multi-agent systems. The framework integrates the N- 2 APL normaware agent programming language with the 2 OPL organisation programming language. Integration of N- 2 APL and 2 OPL is achieved using a tuple space which represents both the (brute) state of the multi-agent environment and the detached norms and sanctions comprising its normative state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of an integrated framework for norm-aware MAS in which autonomous agents deliberate about whether to conform to the norms imposed by a normative organisation. The use of a tuple space makes it straightforward to integrate other system components. To illustrate the flexibility of our framework, we briefly describe its application in a novel normative application, a mixed reality game called <b>GeoSense.</b> We show how <b>GeoSense</b> game rules can be expressed as conditional norms with deadlines and sanctions, and how agents can deliberate about their individual goals and the norms imposed by the game. ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is {{well known}} for {{distributed}} real time systems for various applications. In order to handle the increasing functionality and complexity of high resolution spatio-temporal sensorydatabase, there is a strong need for a system/tool to analyse real time data associated with distributed sensor network systems. There are a few package/systems available to maintain the near real time database system/management, which are expensive and requires expertise. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a cost effective and easy to use dynamic real-time data repository system to provide real time data (raw as well as usable units) in a structured format. In the present study, a distributed sensor network system, with Agrisens (AS) and FieldServer (FS) as well as FS-based Flux Tower and FieldTwitter, is used, which consists of network of sensors and field images to observe/collect the real time weather, crop and environmental parameters for precision agriculture. The real time FieldServer-based spatio-temporal high resolution dynamic sensory data was converted into Dynamic Real-Time Database Management System (DRTDBMS) in a structured format for both raw and converted (with usable units) data. A web interface has been developed to access the DRTDBMS and exclusive domain has been created with the help of open/free Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools in Extendable Markup Language (XML) using (Hypertext preprocessor) PHP algorithms and with eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language (XHTML) self-scripting. The proposed DRTDBMS prototype, called <b>GeoSense</b> DRTDBMS, which is a part of the ongoing IndoJapan initiative ‘ICT and Sensor Network based Decision Support Systems in Agriculture and EnvironmentAssessment’, will be integrated with <b>GeoSense</b> cloud server to provide database (dynamic real-time weather/soil/crop and environmental parameters) and modeling services (crop water requirement and simulated rice yield modeling). GeoSense-cloud server has been developed with Opera-Unite for file sharing, web server (with cost effective web server tools Windows Apache MySQL PHP-WAMP and X -any operating systems Apache MySQL PHP and Perl –XAMPP), file upload, and web proxy functionalities. Currently, the <b>GeoSense</b> DRTDBMS is useful to the rural farming community for ubiquitous decision making in precision agriculture aspects. In future, this DRTDBMS system could be used in climate/environmental systems to understand the micro-climatic variations in real-time mode...|$|R
40|$|Institute {{has several}} ongoing, {{parallel}} development efforts {{that have a}} common goal of providing long-term multi-sensor measurements of ground motion and fluid flow on the seafloor. Instrument packages are being designed to operate in a low-power, autonomous mode, but a planned logger/controller will provide Ethernet connection to available cables to either a shore-based laboratory or a telemetered mooring. We describe here instrument deployments {{that have taken place}} {{in the last four years}} (corehole and broadband seismometers and chemical sensors) as well as plans for the immediate future. Corehole seismometers Seismometer development was initiated at MBARI in 1996 with the development of a short-period corehole seismometer, designed and fabricated by the JPL Microdevice laboratory (Stakes et al., 1998). This sensor package uses three standard 4. 5 -Hz geophones with an extended flat response to about 0. 8 Hz. The sensor package is placed into 2. 5 inch diameter boreholes drilled into basement outcrops to provide superior coupling and greatly reduced noise. A new low-power datalogger, the <b>GeoSense</b> LP 1, developed in 1997, can provide more than 24 GB of storage using less than 0. 3 watt of power, easily supporting a 12 -month deployment...|$|R
40|$|When {{creating}} set of orthophoto maps from mosaic compositions, using airborne systems, such {{as popular}} drones, {{we need to}} publish results of the work to users. Several steps need to be performed in order get large scale raster data published. As first step, data have to be shared as service (OGC WMS as view service, OGC WCS as download service). But for some applications, OGC WMTS is handy as well, for faster view of the data. Finally the data have {{to become a part}} of web mapping application, so that they can be used and evaluated by non-technical users. In this talk, we would like to present automated line of those steps, where user puts in orthophoto image and as a result, OGC Open Web Services are published as well as web mapping application with the data. The web mapping application can be used as standard presentation platform for such type of big raster data to generic user. The publishing platform – <b>Geosense</b> online map information system – can be also used for combination of data from various resources and for creating of unique map compositions and as input for better interpretations of photographed phenomenons. The whole process is successfully tested with eBee drone with raster data resolution 1. 5 - 4 cm/px on many areas and result is also used for creation of derived datasets, usually suited for property management – the records of roads, pavements, traffic signs, public lighting, sewage system, grave locations, and others...|$|R
