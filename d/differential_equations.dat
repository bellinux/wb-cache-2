5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial <b>differential</b> <b>equations.</b> For many classes of partial <b>differential</b> <b>equations,</b> such as linear {{elliptic}} equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial <b>differential</b> <b>equations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve <b>differential</b> <b>equations</b> {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order <b>differential</b> <b>equations,</b> in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order <b>differential</b> <b>equations.</b> Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E
