40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effect of {{settlement}} intentions on the structural, social, and cultural integration of recently arrived intra-EU migrants in the Netherlands. Hypotheses on differences in integration, both shortly after arrival and over time, are derived from the intergenerational immigrant integration model. Based on two waves from the New Immigrants to the Netherlands Survey, a multilevel growth model was estimated. Most differences were found with regard to the level of integration shortly after arrival. Migrants who <b>intend</b> to leave and those who <b>intend</b> to stay were found to differ most strongly from each other in terms of initial levels of structural, social, and cultural integration. Migrants who <b>intend</b> to stay had more contact with natives, were more proficient in Dutch, and consumed more host country media than migrants who <b>intend</b> to leave. On the other hand, migrants who <b>intend</b> to leave worked more hours per week than migrants who <b>intend</b> to stay. Differences over time were only found with regard to Dutch language proficiency. Migrants who <b>intend</b> to stay increased their proficiency stronger than migrant who <b>intend</b> to leave...|$|R

The study focuses on career motivators of <b>intending</b> entrepreneurs and the findings both support and refute previous literature. Among the findings: <b>intending</b> women were not more dissatisfied with their careers, and they did possess different career motivators and intentions than women who were not likely to become entrepreneurs. The difference between <b>intending</b> and non-intending women matched a similar pattern between <b>intending</b> and non-intending men...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the <b>intended</b> use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never <b>intended</b> for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several <b>intended</b> successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E

40|$|PLEASE SEE PUBLISHED VERSION I {{argue that}} <b>intending</b> and acting {{belong to the}} same genus: <b>intending</b> is a kind of doing {{continuous}} in structure with intentional acting. Future-directed <b>intending</b> is not a truly separate phenomenon from either the <b>intending</b> in action or the acting itself. Ultimately, all intentions are in action, or better still, in extended courses of action. I show how the intuitive distinction between <b>intending</b> and acting is based on modeling the two phenomena on the extreme and limiting cases of an otherwise continuous spectrum {{of the ways in which}} agents exercise rational active intelligent guidance in the pursuit of goals. I argue that diachronic intentional agency is better understood in terms of continuity and unity of courses of active and intelligent guidance, and that the distinction between <b>intending</b> to do something and doing it is only a derivative and context-dependent segmentation of these continuous courses of rational active intelligent guidance...|$|R
