Evaluate <b>Impulse</b> <b>Ratio</b> {{as a measure of}} weight distribution among supporting limbs throughout the early natural history of osteoarthritis and with local anaesthesia and analgesia. DesignThe distribution of weight bearing in the trot of 11 skeletally-mature dogs was analyzed before and after unilateral surgical intervention (cranial cruciate transection or distal femoral focal impact). The short-term effects of two analgesic treatments (intra-articular lidocaine and intra-dermal meloxicam) were then evaluated as an index of pain relief based on the redistribution of weight-bearing impulse between normal and injured limbs. ResultsImpulse Ratio was able to resolve weight redistribution between limbs in both long-term (weekly for over 400 days) and short-term (15  min intervals) joint evaluations. Joint pain relief from lidocaine administration could be reliably tracked over its brief acting time course. Meloxicam administration resulted in ambiguous results, where average weight bearing in the injured limb did not increase, but the variability of limb use changed transiently and reversibly.

This method allows us to measure and study the forces involved in gait (ground reaction forces). Ground reaction forces (GRFs) can be influenced by many factors, such as velocity and morphometric differences. The present study evaluated {{the effects of a}} force plate-specific training on the GRFs in Beagles. Eight healthy Beagles were used to obtain the measurements. Dogs were measured before (M 1) and after (M 2) the training regime. The conventional parameters peak, <b>impulse,</b> pelvic-thoracic <b>ratio</b> and symmetry index were evaluated for the Fz, Fy+, and Fy-.

No significant differences between M 1 and M 2 were found for the peak, <b>impulse,</b> pelvic-thoracic <b>ratio</b> and symmetry index. Significant decreases were found for all error parameters. It may be concluded that FPA provides reliable measurements without a training regime when assessing the conventional parameters. Incorporating a training regime in force plate studies may result in a reduction in variance and consequently, smaller differences in gait may be detected and a smaller number of measurements per dog may be needed to obtain reliable data...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a {{framework}} for determination of energy losses resulting from mechanical impacts of the kind that could occur during nuclear decommissioning of waste material. Measurements have been made of final translational and rotational velocities for impacts between projectiles of different length and a massive barrier. This enabled determination of experimental values of the impact coefficients and energy losses. It was found that the total energy losses could be accurately accounted for by the sum of those pertaining to the normal and tangential processes, thus indicating that these include any losses due to vibration. The results obtained clearly support an Amontons–Coulomb friction model and the previously held contention that there is a limiting value for the <b>impulse</b> <b>ratio</b> at low angles of barrier inclination. Although sliding surfaces are likely to be modified during impact, it is shown that any original contamination on the contacting surfaces results in a very large decrease in <b>impulse</b> <b>ratio</b> or friction coefficient.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the mechanics of}} the cross-country herringbone technique and to enhance the understanding of adaptations in kinematics and kinetics due to increasing velocity. Method: Eleven male elite cross-country skiers performed the herringbone technique at three different velocities; moderate, high and maximal. The slope covered a total distance of 50 m. The first 35 m, at ~ 7. 5 ° incline, was utilized for acceleration using the diagonal stride technique to reach the desired velocity, followed by an 8 m measuring section (~ 15 ° incline) using the herringbone technique. All trials were filmed synchronously using two video cameras placed perpendicular along the section and one moving panning camera. Two photocells were used in order to obtain average section times and velocities. All subjects used ski poles that were constructed for force measurements and the forces directed along the poles was recorded with a sampling rate of 1500 Hz. Vertical plantar pressure was recorded at a rate of 100 Hz using the Pedar Mobile System. The plantar pressure was further converted to plantar ("leg") force. Results: Cycle rate and cycle length increased synchronously from moderate to high velocity, whereas the increase from a high to a maximal velocity was achieved by a higher cycle rate. The poling and the leg thrust times decreased gradually as velocities increased, whereas the relative poling and leg thrust times were constant; ~ 50 % and ~ 40 %. From moderate to maximal velocities the peak pole forces increased by 74 %, in association with a 75 % shorter time to peak force. The peak leg force increased by 7 % from moderate to high velocity with no further changes at maximal velocity. The time to peak leg force decreased 24 %, from moderate to maximal velocity. The force <b>impulse</b> <b>ratio</b> between pole and leg remained constant at ~ 8 % from moderate to maximal velocity and the ratio for propulsion was ~ 30 % due to the higher relative propulsive components from the poles. Changes in joint kinematics across the velocities were negligible, except for the total body lean and the lower leg angle. The angle of the lower leg, at end of the push off, decreased with increased velocity and was negatively correlated to maximal pole/leg force, cycle length and maximal velocity. Strength parameters correlated positively to force distribution between upper and lower body, as well as to maximal velocity. Conclusions: The adaptation of herringbone velocity between moderate and high velocity was achieved by increased cycle rate and cycle length, whereas the adaptation from high to maximal velocity was achieved only by increased cycle rate.

5000|$|Restricted rocket staging {{is based}} on the {{simplified}} assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific <b>impulse,</b> structural <b>ratio,</b> and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage. Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage. This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design. One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system. Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific <b>impulse,</b> payload <b>ratios</b> and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages. However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment. The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number, as shown in the figure below. [...] In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.|$|R

When gap length is large, {{in the case of}} the positive impulse voltage (1. 21 * 43. 8 μs), flash over voltage between crossing cyliners is found to be nearly equal to that of the rod electrode. 　 4. <b>Impulse</b> <b>ratio</b> of the crossing cylinders is about 1. 2. 　 5.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} Hohmann Spiral Transfer (HST), an orbit {{transfer}} method previously {{developed by the}} authors incorporating both high and low-thrust propulsion systems, using the low-thrust system to perform an inclination change as well as orbit transfer. The HST {{is similar to the}} bi-elliptic transfer as the high-thrust system is first used to propel the spacecraft beyond the target where it is used again to circularize at an intermediate orbit. The low-thrust system is then activated and, while maintaining this orbit altitude, used to change the orbit inclination to suit the mission specification. The low-thrust system is then used again to reduce the spacecraft altitude by spiraling in-toward the target orbit. An analytical analysis of the HST utilizing the low-thrust system for the inclination change is performed which allows a critical specific <b>impulse</b> <b>ratio</b> to be derived determining {{the point at which the}} HST consumes the same amount of fuel as the Hohmann transfer. A critical ratio is found for both a circular and elliptical initial orbit. These equations are validated by a numerical approach before being compared to the HST utilizing the high-thrust system to perform the inclination change. An additional critical ratio comparing the HST utilizing the low-thrust system for the inclination change with its high-thrust counterpart is derived and by using these three critical ratios together, it can be determined when each transfer offers the lowest fuel mass consumption. Initial analyses have shown the HST utilizing low-thrust inclination change to offer the greatest benefit at low R 2 (R 2 - R 1) and large AI (AI > 30 º). A novel numerical optimization process which could be used to optimize the trajectory is also introduced...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hybrid propulsion transfer termed a Hohmann Spiral, incorporating low and high-thrust technologies, {{analogous to the}} high-thrust bi-elliptic transfer. To understand this transfer fully it is compared to a standard high thrust Hohmann and a bi-elliptic transfer. Two critical specific <b>impulse</b> <b>ratios</b> are derived independent of time that determine the point this novel transfer consumes the exact amount of fuel as the two compared transfer types. It is found that these ratios are valid for both a circular and elliptical starting orbit {{so long as the}} apogee of the elliptical orbit coincides with the target orbit radius. An expression representing the fuel mass fraction is derived dependent of time in order to allow a bound solution space. The final part of this paper investigates two orbit transfer case studies, one is a Geostationary Transfer Orbit to Geostationary Earth Orbit based on the Alphabus platform specification and the other is from Low Earth Orbit to an orbit near the Moon. It is found the thrust required to complete the former transfer in a specified duration of 90 days exceeds current technology and as such provides a technology requirement for future spacecraft. It is found however, for spacecraft of significantly smaller mass, in the region of 1000 kg, compared to Alphabus (Max. mass at Launch = 8100 kg), the transfer consumes the same fuel mass as a standard high-thrust Hohmann transfer with realistic low-thrust propulsion values (150 mN, 300 mN and 450 mN) within the set duration of 90 days. In addition, it is shown that utilising uprated thrusters (210 mN, 420 mN and 630 mN) a fuel mass saving can be made. This could provide a potential transfer alternative for future smaller spacecraft. The second case study is bound to a maximum thrust of 150 mN, but the mission duration is not specified to highlight the variation. It is found that the HST offers fuel mass savings of roughly 5 % compared to a standard high-thrust transfer and approximately 1. 5 % compared to a bi-elliptic transfer for different scenarios...|$|R
