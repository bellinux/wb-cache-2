25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to {{what they need to}} live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E
25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> cars and too much driving - {{it is about the}} entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

500|$|At the Labour {{conference in}} September 2013, Miliband {{highlighted}} his party's {{stance on the}} NHS and announced if elected Labour would abolish the bedroom tax. The conference included several 'signature' policies, such as strengthening the minimum wage, freezing business rates, building 200,000 houses a year, lowering the voting age to 16, {{and the provision of}} childcare by primary schools between 8am and 6pm. The policy that attracted the most attention was the commitment to help tackle the 'cost-of-living crisis' by freezing gas and electricity prices until 2017 to give time to 'reset the market' in favour of consumers. In January 2014 Miliband extended the concept of reform to include the 'big five' banks, in addition to the 'big six' utility companies, and discussed the impact of the cost-of-living on the 'squeezed middle' saying [...] "the current cost-of-living crisis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> people on tax credits, zero-hour contracts and the minimum wage.

500|$|However, the Expressionistic visual {{elements}} of the film are present {{not only in the}} main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy. As Brockmann writes, [...] "In the end, the film <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Dr. Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a [...] "dream logic of repetition" [...] that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.|$|E

[...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual."
