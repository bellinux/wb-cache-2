5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom,</b> implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2).

50|$|In a proton NMR {{spectroscopy}} result, 3-hexyne {{produces a}} triplet of integrated area 6H at a chemical shift of approximately 1.0 ppm and {{a quartet of}} integrated area 4H at approximately 2.2 ppm. The less deshielded triplet corresponds to the terminal methyl <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> that experience spin-spin splitting from the adjacent methylene <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms.</b> The quartet corresponds to the more deshielded methylene <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> that are spin-spin split by the adjacent methyl <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms.</b> The methylene <b>hydrogens</b> don't form a complex multiplet because the internal alkyne function that is adjacent to them does not contain any bonded <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> with which they can interact. The overall symmetry of the molecule causes both methylene bridges to contain <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> {{in exactly the same}} electronic environment.

5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom.</b> However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E

5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom,</b> and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E

5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E
5|$|The 18-valence {{electron}} rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species {{generated by}} this reaction demonstrates again {{the instability of}} the rhodocene moiety, in {{that it can be}} refluxed in toluene for months without 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocene forming but in oxidising conditions the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom)</b> to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom,</b> compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, {{has a single}} proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules.

5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex.

5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.

5|$|The first {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) {{is much higher}} than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom,</b> hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H− anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen. The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.|$|E
