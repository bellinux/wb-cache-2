25|$|The Tuileries Palace, {{city hall}} of Paris, {{and many other}} public {{buildings}} had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and {{he asked her to}} play the lead in a new play, Jean-Marie by André Theuriet. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theater and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> and asked when the rehearsals would begin.|$|E
500|$|After {{his death}} Huskisson's {{body had been}} moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> on which he had died to an upstairs bedroom. On arrival at the vicarage Emily Huskisson refused to allow the jury to view the body, insisting on being allowed to remain alone with her husband. Eventually {{she had to be}} {{forcibly}} removed from the room, and the jury went into the bedroom in small groups to view the body. As [...] "they did not think it necessary to look at the injured parts at all", they took only a brief glance at the body, and soon afterwards returned to the Grapes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} written and rehearsed at David Bowie's home in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion {{converted}} to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambiance [...] "like Dracula's living room". As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, the music was largely arranged by guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist/producer Tony Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on the album, biographer Peter Doggett quoted Visconti saying [...] "the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not." [...] In Doggett's narrative, [...] "The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which {{might or might not}} be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics." [...] Despite his annoyance with Bowie's fixation on married life during the recording of The Man Who Sold the World, Visconti still rated it as his best work with Bowie until 1980's Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps).|$|E
60|$|When {{the last}} foe had disappeared, Tip crawled <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> and {{assisted}} <b>the</b> Woggle-Bug to follow him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so flurried I couldn't {{make change}} {{to save my}} life," [...] gasped Miss Jerusha <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> whither she had fled.|$|R
6000|$|... “No! No!” protested Mr Verloc, busy {{fishing for}} his hat. But {{when he got}} it <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> he held it {{as if he did}} not know the use of a hat.|$|R
60|$|Alec rose slowly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> He faced Boulger with an {{indifference}} {{which was}} peculiarly irritating.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Mulready slid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{and threw}} {{herself on her}} knees with her hands clasped.|$|E
60|$|They had clambered down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and {{gathered}} round {{the bed with}} eager, interested eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} so, when I get you so often!' scornfully ejaculated Lancelot, drawing a {{dilapidated}} brioche <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and squatting on it, with his dancing eyes {{close to her}} sad ones.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad of you not {{to squawk}} and run; we {{depended}} on it, it's such fun to howl after you," [...] said Will and Geordie, rolling out <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in a promiscuous heap.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That I will,' said she, and Philip drew it <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> cushion, {{and began}} putting {{together}} his pocket gold pen. While {{he was doing}} this, she said, 'Will you write to me sometimes? I shall be so anxious {{to know how you}} get on.' ...|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} a slight snore came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> too. The man behind Cosy Moments slept.|$|E
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> {{suffused with}} emotion]. Papa! Don't you know me? I'm your daughter.|$|E
60|$|Marie of Reist {{rose with}} a sudden swift {{movement}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{where she had been}} lying.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have told}} the Duchess's {{character}} admirably, Mr. Podgers, and now you must tell Lady Flora's'; and in answer to a nod <b>from</b> <b>the</b> smiling hostess, a tall girl, with sandy Scotch hair, and high shoulder-blades, stepped awkwardly <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and held out a long, bony hand with spatulate fingers.|$|R
60|$|Miss Halcombe {{promised to}} comply with his request. He thanked her, nodded pleasantly, and left us, to go and {{establish}} himself in his own room. As {{he opened the door}} the cross-grained greyhound poked out her sharp muzzle <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and barked and snapped at him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ward had two naps {{the next}} day. He awoke <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second at twelve- thirty a.m., {{and in a}} {{somewhat}} disagreeable frame of mind rose and stretched himself. The house was very still. He took a small brown- paper parcel <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> and, extinguishing <b>the</b> lamp, put on his cap and opened the front door.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} another pause, {{at the end of}} which Mrs. Broughton got up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b>|$|E
60|$|Binkie {{had jumped}} down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> and was fawning round Dick's knee, and {{scratching}} at his boots.|$|E
60|$|And <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> {{her hands}} {{lying on her}} lap, she watched us enter, with her black, {{glittering}} eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "This beats me," [...] said Uncle Roger, when a fruitless hour had elapsed. [...] "I do {{hope that}} baby hasn't wandered {{down to the}} swamp. It seems {{impossible}} he could walk so far; but I must go and see. Felicity, hand me my high boots out <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> there's a girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Julia, with a stifled cry of rage, rushes at Grace, who is {{crossing}} behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> towards door. Charteris seizes her {{and prevents}} her <b>from</b> getting past <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> Grace goes out. Charteris, holding Julia fast, looks {{around to the}} door to see whether Grace is safely out of the room.) ...|$|R
60|$|Beetle {{snatched}} a crochet-work antimacassar <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shiny horsehair <b>sofa,</b> {{stuffed it}} into his mouth, and rolled out of sight.|$|R
60|$|Alvina carried up {{the loose}} bed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and {{slept on the}} floor before the fire in Madame's room.|$|E
6000|$|Her mother returned, {{and with}} a radiant countenance, Venetia sprang <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> 'There is good news; O mother! have they returned?' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} eyes and rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> {{accurately}} to an hour from the time when he had gone to sleep.|$|E
25|$|The {{debut of}} the Daleks {{in the second}} serial turned <b>the</b> {{programme}} <b>from</b> a children's series to a national phenomenon. It soon became a show that the whole family gathered to watch, with monsters that children viewed from between their fingers or <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> Scripts filled with far-out concepts compensated for the relatively low budget and unsophisticated special effects, laying the foundation for decades of stories to come.|$|R
60|$|They {{thought she}} was gone; but the next moment there she was with <b>the</b> two pillows <b>from</b> <b>the</b> library <b>sofa,</b> putting them under Philip's head, and making him comfortable; while he, {{overpowered}} by a fresh access of headache, had neither will nor power to object. She rang, asked for Mrs. Drew, and went.|$|R
50|$|Gaskell's {{short story}} was first {{published}} in serialized form in 1856 in Charles Dickens' popular weekly magazine Household Words. The three chapters appeared on the 13, 20, and 27 of December of that year. Gaskell had previously used the magazine to serialize her much longer works, Cranford and North and South in 1851-3 and 1855 respectively. It later appeared in Round <b>the</b> <b>Sofa</b> and Other Tales, an anthology by Gaskell which used an elaborate framing device to link the many different stories. In most publications of The Poor Clare since then, whilst <b>the</b> text <b>from</b> Round <b>the</b> <b>Sofa</b> has been used, the framing device has been omitted.|$|R
60|$|Emily's {{mind was}} far away from Mrs. Ellmother. She rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> with her hands held fast over her aching heart.|$|E
60|$|Felicity and Cecily {{were setting}} out a {{lunch in the}} pantry when we were all startled by a loud groan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b>|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{picked up}} his hat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> where it lay. Louise {{remained}} perfectly still, her breath coming quickly, her eyes lit with passion.|$|E
6000|$|She was on {{her knees}} drawing <b>the</b> doll's house <b>from</b> beneath <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> {{where it had been}} hidden away; and {{immediately}} I thought, [...] "I shall slip the insulting message into this." [...] But I did not, and I shall tell you why. It was because the engaging toy had been redecorated by loving hands; there were fresh gowns for all the inhabitants, and the paint on the furniture was scarcely dry. The little doll's house was almost ready for further use.|$|R
60|$|Van wasn't {{a dignified}} man at all, {{but as he}} said that with a sudden flash of his mild eyes, there was {{something}} in his face and manner that daunted Aunt Kipp more than the small fist belligerently shaken at her <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> <b>The</b> poor old soul was cross, and worried, and ashamed of herself, and being as feeble-minded as Sophy in many respects, she suddenly burst into tears, and, covering her face with the gay handkerchief, cried as if bent on floating the red ship in a sea of salt water without delay.|$|R
40|$|Artifacts in Banquet Hall, Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, circa 1907 - 1909. Caption reads: "Showing Washington's pew <b>from</b> Christ Church, <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> used by {{him while}} President, the chair used by Chief Justice John Jay, {{and a group}} of portraits of celebrated men of the Revolutionary period.
