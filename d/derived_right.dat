Although it has been approached from many different perspectives, a final conclusion has not been reached. In this paper I will offer {{a new way of}} thinking about intellectual property rights (IPRs), from a left-libertarian perspective. My thesis is that IPRs are not (natural) original rights, aprioric rights, as it is usually argued. They are <b>derived</b> <b>rights</b> hence any claim for intellectual property is weaker than the correlative duties attached to self-ownership and world-ownership rights, which are of crucial importance in any left-libertarian view. Moreover, IPRs lack priority in front of these two original rights and should be overridden by stronger claims of justice. Thus, as <b>derived</b> <b>rights,</b> IPRs should not benefit of strong enforcement like any original rights especially if it could be in the latters’ detriment...|$|R

We allow for two types of couples: one-breadwinner and two-breadwinner couples. Marriage pools both wage and longevity differences between men and women. Hence singles tend to have more extreme preferred tax rates than couples.

METHODS: Echocardiography and multifrequency bioimpedance analysis measurements and short synacthen tests were made in 20 stable and 25 acutely decompensated patients with cirrhosis. RESULTS: Both groups had similar clinical assessments, cortisol response and total body water (TBW), however the ratio of extracellular water (ECW) /TBW was significantly greater in the trunk (0. 420 1; 0. 004 vs 0. 404 1; 0. 005), and limbs (R leg 0. 41 1; 0. 003 vs 0. 398 1; 0. 003, P < 0. 05, and L leg 0. 412 1; 0. 003 vs 0. 399 1; 0. 003) with decompensated cirrhosis compared to stable cirrhotics, P < 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{starting}} {{hypothesis was}} that some perimembranous ventricular septal defects can be closed safely and effectively with a Bard Rashkind double umbrella introduced through a long transvenous sheath. DESIGN [...] A descriptive study of all patients who underwent attempted transcatheter umbrella closure of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect. Those patients selected for the study had symptoms of a ventricular septal defect and a perimembranous ventricular septal defect shown by transthoracic echocardiography. The morphological criteria used were a posterior perimembranous defect with a diameter of 0. 45, a Doppler <b>derived</b> <b>right</b> ventricular systolic pressure of > 50 mm Hg, and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio > 3 : 1. SETTING [...] A tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] 13 infants, children, and adolescents with a perimembranous ventricular septal defect aged 3 weeks to 16 years and weighing 1. 8 - 46 kg. INTERVENTIONS [...] A modified Rashkind ductal double umbrella was introduced through a long transvenous sheath and positioned {{on either side of}} the ventricular septal defect. Placement was guided by transoesophageal echocardiography. RESULTS [...] 10 out of 13 patients underwent successful partial or complete closure of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect. There were three placement failures. Two of these were associated with a ventricular septal defect too large for the umbrella device. In a third case the umbrella was opened in the left ventricular outflow tract necessitating surgical removal and closure of the ventricular septal defect. CONCLUSION [...] Transcatheter umbrella closure of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect is technically feasible and can be therapeutically successful, although the procedure is moderately difficult to perform and the mean procedure time is > 120 minutes. It is an alternative to surgery in some cases, but the overall results would not support its routine use even with the introduction of larger devices of the current design...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) complicating interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) {{may be associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the most widely used screening test for PH, may be inaccurate in up to 50 % of ILD patients. We evaluate the utility of TTE, in isolation and in combination with several non-invasive screening tests, for predicting the presence and severity of ILD-PH. Novel techniques, including non-invasive assessment of pulmonary blood flow and dual energy CT pulmonary angiography (DE-CTPA), were also evaluated for identifying pulmonary vasospasm in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods: In 265 consecutive patients with ILD and suspected PH, the predictive utility of the updated European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) TTE PH screening recommendations was evaluated against RHC testing. In a subgroup of 114 patients, combined non-invasive investigations (including TTE, respiratory function tests, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), vascular dimensions on CT, and 6 minute walk test) was assessed for predicting PH. Equations predicting the presence and severity of PH were then tested prospectively in a validation cohort. Results: In patients classified as ‘high probability’ of PH by ESC/ERS TTE criteria, PH was confirmed on RHC in 86 %. However, 40 % of patients were misclassified as ‘low probability’ of PH (tricuspid regurgitation velocity < 2. 8 m/s), when PH was confirmed on subsequent RHC. At regression analysis, TTE <b>derived</b> <b>right</b> ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (R 2 = 0. 37; p< 0. 01), BNP (R 2 = 0. 25; p< 0. 01), and main pulmonary artery diameter (mPA) on CT scan (R 2 = 0. 23; p< 0. 01) correlated most strongly with RHC measured mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), and a ‘best fit’ equation for predicting mPAP (tested in the validation cohort) was more strongly predictive of PH (with a receiver operating characteristic AUC of 0. 93) than any single non-invasive test in isolation. Conclusion: Current TTE screening recommendations are associated with a significant misclassification rate (40 %) in excluding ILD-PH. Combining RVSP, mPA diameter and BNP more accurately predicted mPAP, the presence of PH and the presence of severe PH, compared to any single test in isolation. While pulmonary vasospasm was detectable in a subgroup of SSc patients, extensive post-processing of DE-CTPA data precluded this as a clinically useful test at this time...|$|E

40|$|The cases {{annotated}} here seek {{to clarify}} the law {{in relation to the}} family rights of own citizens when returning to the Member State of origin (circular migration); or when exercising the rights to free movement in another Member State whilst residing in the Member State of nationality (frontier migration). This is a complex area of the law in a political minefield: the Court has, broadly speaking, been generous with the rights of family members; it is sufficient here to recall the case law on the <b>derived</b> <b>right</b> of residence of parents of migrant children in education. Yet, the cases annotated here are difficult because they are at the very boundary between national and European law: indeed it is this boundary that the Court was asked to clarify. In this respect, it is clear that Member States wish to retain regulatory prerogatives in relation to the rights of family reunification of own citizens: {{it is no coincidence that}} Article 3 (1) Directive 2004 / 38 provides that the Directive can only be invoked against a State different from that of nationality. However, if the political will is clear, the legal situation is more complex since, pre-Directive 2004 / 38, the Court had already declared that Union citizens could invoke the Treaty against their State of nationality when they establish a cross-border element; and that the refusal to grant family reunification rights could be construed as a barrier to movement. 5 Here, therefore, the Grand Chamber had to elaborate on the extent to which the primary Treaty provisions grant rights to returning nationals and to frontier workers, that is to say it had to elaborate on the conditions necessary to invoke the Singh and the Carpenter doctrines respectively. Both the Singh and the Carpenter doctrines have proven to be very contentious with the Member States; in particular, some governments do not welcome further incursions in their migration policies. Furthermore, following the introduction of Union citizenship it has become easier to satisfy some cross-border requirement: what then if Union citizens tried to rely on those doctrines too easily, without having established proper economic/cross-border credentials? The national family reunification regimes would be directly undermined, and indirectly harmonized, through the “clever” exploitation of EU law. This is the problem that the Court seemingly attempted to solve in the rulings in questions. And yet, the carefully tailored solutions seem to fit no one – far from clarifying the scope of application of the Carpenter and Singh doctrines, and the reasons underlying them, it creates a system which is both confused and legally irrational...|$|E
40|$|This article treats {{migration}} {{within the}} territory of the European Union (EU) Member States by Union citizens and their families; focusing on freedom of movement and education. Specifically, it will examine student maintenance grant eligibility in the host Member State, facilitative of student mobility in the EU, in accordance with primary and secondary EU legislation on freedom of movement of EU workers and of EU citizens. It is submitted that the interpretation of EU law by the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) in recent cases lacks coherency and consistency. Primary provisions of EU law prescribe the right freely to move and reside for economically active EU citizens, and for EU citizens of independent means inclusive of students, who do not become an unreasonable burden on the welfare system of the host Member State. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality between Member States has played a pivotal role in the interpretation by the Court of Justice of EU citizenship free movement rights. Secondary EU law reinforces the principle of equality of treatment with nationals of the host Member State in relation to the education of the children of EU citizen economic migrant workers. The Court of Justice in consecutive rulings has interpreted EU law expansively confirming independent residence rights for children of the migrant worker who are in education. A <b>derived</b> <b>right</b> then ensues for the primary carer of such children, irrespective of his or her nationality. As a result of two recent and controversial rulings of the Court, both independent and derived residence rights exist in the absence of financial self sufficiency. This, in spite of further secondary EU legislation agreed to by Member States requiring economically inactive migrant EU citizens and family members to have sufficient resources so as not to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance of the host Member State. Member States, moreover, have agreed expressly in the EU Citizenship Directive that they reserve the right not to pay maintenance grant /loan funding to EU citizen students who have crossed a border in order to study in that host Member State. These two recent rulings emphasise the importance accorded in EU law to the concept of the economically active EU migrant worker, despite a lack of sufficient means, and the associated Treaty principle of equality of treatment without discrimination on grounds of nationality for migrant EU workers. The ability to manage its own education system is stated expressly in the Treaties to be the responsibility of each individual Member State. The consequences of these rulings potentially will impact upon the public resources budgeted for schooling and thereafter higher University education inclusive of maintenance funding on the part of each host Member Stat...|$|E
