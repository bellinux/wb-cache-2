5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years.

5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E

5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 a year <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> the Duchess of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E

5|$|Braddock {{inherited}} {{much of her}} campaigning spirit <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Mary Bamber, {{an early}} socialist and trade union activist. After some years in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Braddock joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) on its foundation in 1920, but quickly became disillusioned with the party's dictatorial tendencies. She left the CPGB in 1924 and later joined the Labour Party.

5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|Koss {{arrives on}} board Enterprise {{to speak to}} his wife, T'Pol. He gives her an IDIC pendant <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who he {{explains}} is also a Syrrannite. The pendant projects a map showing a path across a desert on Vulcan called “the Forge”, which Archer believes will lead them to both T'Pau and T'Pol's mother. T'Pol and Archer leave the ship and begin to make the crossing, following the map. They soon encounter another traveller, calling himself Arev, who assists, but remains distrustful of them. A sand-fire storm kills Arev, but before he dies, he forcefully performs a mind meld with Archer to transfer his katra. After burying him, a focussed Archer leads T'Pol directly to the concealed T'Karath Sanctuary, where they are quickly captured.|$|E

Raci and her aunt rent a small room in Eastside Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The Duchess of York's Catholic secretary, Edward Colman, was, in 1678, falsely {{implicated in}} a fictitious plot against the King by Titus Oates. The plot, {{known as the}} Popish Plot, led to the Exclusionist movement, which was headed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. The Exclusionists sought to debar the Catholic Duke of York from the throne. Their {{reputation}} in tatters, the Yorks were reluctantly exiled to Brussels, a domain of the King of Spain, ostensibly to visit Lady Mary—since 1677 the wife of Prince William III of Orange. Accompanied by her not yet three-year-old daughter Isabella and Lady Anne, the Duchess of York was saddened by James's extra-marital affair with Catherine Sedley. Mary's spirits were briefly revived by a visit <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who was living in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Welles's alleged {{biological}} son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who {{was born}} out of wedlock to Welles and actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play Chimes at Midnight. This was the only significant amount of time that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was 16, Welles's eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who disapproved of Welles's influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles's youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of Chimes at Midnight.|$|E

5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey. On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to eat as much as they could. She remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers {{a message}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> after her initial {{report of the}} events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving her closure. Marlow then appears with Taylor and tells Ripley {{that he plans to}} {{overload}} the Anesidoras fusion reactor and destroy the station, thus ensuring that no aliens survive. In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an electric discharge while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown into the ship due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with no option but to open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift and unconscious in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother {{noticed that she}} was slow in learning to talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} congenital deafness after her grandmother identified the problem and took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893.
