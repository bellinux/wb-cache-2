50|$|Located at 140.8 km is a <b>drainway</b> and culvert. From a small culvert with a stone {{deck and}} mortared walls, a drain {{cut out of}} rock extends {{vertically}} {{over the top of}} the rock face.|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{temperatures}} for photosynthesis {{and growth}} were determined for thermal blue-green algae inhabiting the <b>drainway</b> {{of a small}} geyser in Yellowstone National Park. The sparse algal mat was exposed to high temperatures only during the brief, highly periodic eruptions of the geyser. Optimal temperatures for the algae were higher than the mean environmental temperatures; as a consequence the algae experienced temperatures optimal for photosynthesis and growth only during {{a small fraction of}} the time. A heat-treatment experiment indicated that the algae of this mat were resistant to the high temperatures that occurred during eruption, whereas organisms having the same optimal temperatures but inhabiting a thermally constant environment were more heat sensitive. The thermally fluctuating environment appears to limit the extent of algal growth...|$|E
40|$|A {{cultural}} resources {{survey was conducted}} at an organic vegetable farm in Travis County (185 acres) by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in February of 2012. The client proposes to construct a farm irrigation system that includes the drilling of water supply test wells, permanent wells, an underground pipeline, a re- regulation reservoir and associated <b>drainway,</b> a pump station, and an area {{in the center of}} the farm that will contain a cold storage facility, offices, and other facilities. Four high probability areas were identified, and sites were found at three of these areas. Site 41 TV 2402 is historic and was probably first occupied in 1906 when an unknown structure believed to be a house was constructed. Later, the land was used for dairy farming, row crop production, and most recently for hay production. This site has been totally destroyed, and a bridge that is believed to be associated with the 1906 structure is in poor condition. Site 41 TV 2402 and the bridge are in areas not associated with the proposed irrigation project and are not considered worthy of additional work or protection. Sites 41 TV 2403 and 41 TV 2404 are prehistoric, and they are located on the north and south banks of Dry Creek. These sites are described in this report as camps of unknown age and function. The presence of fragments of mussel shell at both sites, however, suggests that the procurement and consumption of this species of mussel was one of the activities conducted at these sites. The primary source of raw material for lithic artifacts in this area is believed to be gravels in the Colorado River. Copies of the report are on file at the THC, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA), and Johnson?s Backyard Garden...|$|E
50|$|No-till farming {{dramatically}} {{reduces the}} amount of erosion in a field. While much less soil is displaced, any gullies that do form will get deeper each year instead of being smoothed out by regular plowing. This may necessitate either sod <b>drainways,</b> waterways, permanent <b>drainways,</b> cover crops, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Gullies can be {{a problem}} in the long-term. While much less soil is {{displaced}} by using no-till farming, any drainage gulleys that do form will get deeper each year since they aren't being smoothed out by plowing. [...] This may necessitate either sod <b>drainways,</b> waterways, permanent <b>drainways,</b> cover crops, etc. Gully formation {{can be a}}voided entirely with proper water management practices, including the creation of swales on contour.|$|R
