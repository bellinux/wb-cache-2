500|$|... "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", {{the first}} song on the album, was written and {{produced}} by Madonna and Orbit, with additional writers including Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins. The singer's manager Guy Oseary had telephoned and asked Orbit for collaborating on the album. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, which included a demo version of the track. According to Madonna, {{she had been a}} fan of Orbit's work {{for a long time and}} was pleased with the demo. The song includes a sample from the song [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Follow</b> <b>the</b> Tigers" [...] by the San Sebastian Strings, a group created by both Kerr and McKuen. The vocal sample was of a man uttering the words [...] "you see", later confirmed by him to be actor Jesse Pearson. Both McKuen and Kerr received co-writing credits on [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] due to the inclusion of the sample, and also because thematically the track follows a plotline that transpired in [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Follow</b> <b>the</b> Tigers". Madonna was a great admirer of Collins' interior designing and had commissioned for designing a friend's night club located in Miami. He later ended up as one of the writers on the song.|$|E
