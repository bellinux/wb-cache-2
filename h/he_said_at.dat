5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

500|$|As a High Court judge Denning sentenced {{people to}} death, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time [...] "didn't worry [...] in the least". Denning {{maintained}} that for murder, death {{was the most}} appropriate penalty, and that in cases where mistakes had been made there was always an appeals system. In the 1950s there was growing opposition {{to the use of}} the death penalty, and a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate abolishing it. Denning told the Commission in 1953 that [...] "the punishment inflicted for grave crimes should adequately reflect the revulsion felt by the great majority of citizens for them".|$|E

One MK season-ticket holder interviewed by the Milton Keynes Citizen, a former Wimbledon F.C. fan based in London, suggested that [...] "AFC Wimbledon should drop Wimbledon from their name as they don't play in Wimbledon." [...] The leaders of Merton and Milton Keynes Councils met in Milton Keynes in April 2012 to discuss the campaign, and agreed to differ {{on the matter of}} a name change.

500|$|Bill Murray was {{considered}} for the voice role of James P. [...] "Sulley" [...] Sullivan. He screen tested for the role and was interested, but when Pete Docter was unable {{to make contact with}} him, he took it as a [...] "no". The voice role of Sulley went to John Goodman, the longtime co-star of the comedy series Roseanne and a regular in the films of the Coen brothers. Goodman interpreted the character to himself as the monster equivalent of a National Football League player. [...] "He's like a seasoned lineman in the tenth year of his career," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time. [...] "He is totally dedicated and a total pro." [...] Billy Crystal, having regretted turning down the part of Buzz Lightyear years prior, accepted that of Mike Wazowski, Sulley's one-eyed best friend and scare assistant.

Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the end of that series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this.
