A distraught Regina notes that Emma has done exactly what her mother did: unintentionally ruin her chance for happiness by naively trying to make things better. Reduced to tears, Regina ominously warns Emma that Marian <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> {{the only thing she}} brought back. Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal. The lid pops off and releases a blue liquid, which after a moment coalesces into none other than Elsa. She removes her gloves and unleashes an icy blast that destroys her former prison, before heading out of the barn, leaving a trail of frozen ground behind her.|$|E

500|$|George Washington Sears, {{an early}} {{conservationist}} who wrote under the pen name [...] "Nessmuk", {{was one of}} the first to criticize Pennsylvania lumbering and its destruction of forests and creeks. In his 1884 book Woodcraft he wrote of the Pine Creek watershed where A huge tannery ... poisons and blackens the stream with chemicals, bark and ooze. ... The once fine covers and thickets are converted into fields thickly dotted with blackened stumps. And, to crown the desolation, heavy laden trains of 'The Pine Creek and Jersey Shore R.R.' go thundering [...] almost hourly ... Of course, this is progress; but, whether backward or forward, <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> decided sixty years hence. Nessmuk's words went mostly unheeded in his lifetime and did not prevent the clearcutting of almost all of the virgin forests in Pennsylvania.|$|E
500|$|After two rainy {{summers in}} 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an {{exceptional}} drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry {{after the long}} hot summer of 1666. [...] A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone {{had the authority to}} override their wishes.|$|E
500|$|After the {{surrender}} of General John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga, Williams was exchanged on January 16, 1778. [...] During his imprisonment, Williams had been [...] promoted to colonel and given command of the 6th Maryland Regiment of the Maryland Line. [...] Shortly after his release, he stated {{in a letter to}} the governor of Maryland that the regiment contained [...] "...not above a hundred effective men... and that those are very indifferently clothed." [...] He further stated: [...] "I heartily desire to join the army as soon as possible but certainly it <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> reinforced by a regiment without a colonel than by a colonel without a regiment." [...] After joining Washington's army shortly before the Battle of Monmouth he learned that the regiment was noted for a looseness of discipline and was unable to stand with others in the line during battle. Soon after he took effective command, the 6th Maryland Regiment became known as the equal, if not superior, to any in the whole army.|$|E

She found the role {{opposite}} Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety found the film to be an [...] "amiable but creaky resurrection" [...] of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones [...] "hits the required single note with some spirit" [...] she was [...] "generally underused" [...] in it. Zeta-Jones returned to television the following year by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline.com found Zeta-Jones to be [...] "wonderfully cast" [...] and Sonia Saraiya of Variety praised her for providing [...] "the best turn in the show". Displeased with an [...] "unauthorized use of her name and identity" [...] in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} reformers, led by Mrs. Bowers, moves {{to have the}} red light {{district}} closed and force the girls out. District Attorney Osborne, believes that it will turn out poorly for the town and tries to persuade the reforms {{that it would be}} like scattering smallpox. He fails to persuade them and the law is passed. The film focuses on one of the prostitutes, Hattie Fenshaw, who is forced out from her place of vice. According to H. D. Fretz's review, Fenshaw is determined to let those at a prominent hotel know that [...] "women such as she <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> left alone", but is quickly recognized and evicted. At the hotel, Fenshaw makes an acquaintance of Bryant Harding who decides to keep her as his mistress and pays Fenshaw's rent in an apartment next door to one of the reformers, Mrs. Osborne. Fenshaw also charms Dudley Carleton, who breaks off his engagement to Betty Hamlin, the daughter of Harding, who uses her divorced mother's maiden name. Hamlin and Fenshaw meet through an introduction with Mrs. Bowers, and Hamlin, unaware of Fenshaw's character is telephoned by Fenshaw to come and sew for her to earn some money. Hal Harding, a college student with a desire to see the city, is introduced to Fenshaw during his father's absence. The cast assembles at Fenshaw's apartment when Hamlin arrives and interrupts Fenshaw's party with her ex-fiance and her brother, Hal. She is then introduced to her brother under and assumed name and is in the apartment when Bryant Harding returns. A fight breaks out and Harding nearly kills Carleton and knocks Fenshaw unconscious and shoots at his daughter, but misses. Alerted by the shot, the District Attorney, Mrs. Bowers and her reformer friends arrive and learn of Hattie Fenshaw's vice. Shorey's film review concludes with the presumption that Fenshaw returns to a place of [...] "legalized vice" [...] with Mrs. Bowers' permission.|$|E

2500|$|Morgan's {{intellectual}} {{experience in}} the federal WPA programs had both advantages and disadvantages {{for him as a}} historian. The independent nature of these programs encouraged his critical judgment and work ethic, forced him to work with a variety of people, and exposed him to a wide training ground on source development and research. However, it did not lead him to consider the larger meaning of the facts he gathered or to understand the philosophy and theory of history, as taught in an academic setting. In fact, during the trials of his career, he became quite antagonistic to academic requirements. In response to a negative academic review of a work by his friend DeVoto, he wrote: [...] "...the term ‘history’ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> redefined to mean, ’a species of writing produced by or enroute to a Ph.D.’ I have had enough troubles trying to break a path alongside this main-traveled road to know something of the snobberies at work here, {{and the ways in which}} the academic world and even the world of learning are geared to these attitudes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ennis William Cosby (April 15, 1969– January 16, 1997) was {{the third}} child and only son of American comedian Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille Cosby (née Hanks). He had two older sisters, Erika (born 1965) and Erinn (born 1966), and two younger sisters, [...] Ensa (1973) and Evin (1976). When Camille was due {{to give birth to}} Ennis, Cosby joked during a {{television}} special that, [...] "It <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> a boy, you hear, Camille?" [...] and Camille, off-screen, responded, [...] "Right!" [...] Ennis was born at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Los Angeles and grew up in Southern California, Pennsylvania and New York City. [...] He attended George School, a private boarding school outside Philadelphia, where he played football, basketball, lacrosse, and track and field. He suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia, which caused low grades and friction with his parents, both of whom had PhDs in education. Theo Huxtable, Bill Cosby's TV son on The Cosby Show, was based on Ennis, and this was reflected in storylines with Theo struggling in school until he was diagnosed with dyslexia. It was also written into the script that Cosby's character, Cliff Huxtable, had been wrong in blaming Theo for his poor grades; this mirrored Cosby's real life, as he had felt guilty for thinking Ennis had struggled academically because of a character flaw.|$|E

2500|$|Drosnin {{also made}} a number of claims and alleged {{predictions}} that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book [...] "The Bible Code II", published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an [...] "Atomic Holocaust" [...] that would allegedly {{be the end of the}} world. Another claim Drosnin makes in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction that they would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] was that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection). The only conspiracy theories about Yasser Arafat allegedly being murdered have been made by a few Palestinian figures, and have involved alleged poisoning that was supposed to have been on the orders of Israeli officials. The only alleged Palestinian collaboration in this conspiracy theory involve two leading Palestinian figures from the Palestinian Fatah movement; those are current Palestinian Authority and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Dahlan the former head of Fatah in Gaza. Writer Randy Ingermanson criticized Drosnin by stating that; [...] "And that's all they are, even for Drosnin – possibilities. He believes that the future is not fixed, and that the Bible code predicts all possible outcomes. Which makes it not much of a predictive tool, but again, he seems not to mind this very much. If you are laying bets based on Drosnin, you <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>be</b> willing to bet on all possible outcomes." ...|$|E
