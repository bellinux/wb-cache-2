25|$|In a wider sense, he was {{influential}} in three respects. Firstly his night scenes were highly original. His lighting effects in general were very subtle, and {{very different from}} those of Caravaggio. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively <b>gently,</b> <b>with</b> the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it.|$|E

The mid-1960s would also see Fitzgerald and Riddle collaborate {{on the last}} of Ella's Songbooks, devoted to the songs of Jerome Kern (Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Song Book) and Johnny Mercer (Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Song Book).|$|E
25|$|Once the yerba mate has settled, {{the mate}} is {{carefully}} {{brought to a}} near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very <b>gently</b> <b>with</b> a side-to-side motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space {{on one side of}} the gourd and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other.|$|E

25|$|When a tooth {{is picked}} up, it {{should always be}} grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger {{pressure}} on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off <b>gently</b> <b>with,</b> at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even {{with the use of}} a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment.|$|E

500|$|Tatiana and {{her older}} sister, Olga, were {{known in the}} {{household}} as [...] "The Big Pair." [...] According to a 29 May 1897 diary entry written by her father's distant cousin, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, she was given the name [...] "Tatiana" [...] as an homage to the heroine in Alexander Pushkin's novel in verse Eugene Onegin. Her father {{liked the idea of}} having daughters named Olga and Tatiana, like the sisters in the famous poem. Like their two younger sisters, the two older girls shared a bedroom and were very close to one another from early childhood. In the spring of 1901, Olga had typhoid fever and was confined to the nursery for several weeks away from her younger sisters. When she began to recover, Tatiana was permitted to see her older sister for five minutes but didn't recognize her. When her governess, Margaretta Eagar, told her after the visit that the sickly child she had been conversing so <b>gently</b> <b>with</b> was Olga, four-year-old Tatiana began to cry bitterly and protested that the pale, thin child couldn't be her adored older sister. Eagar had difficulty persuading Tatiana that Olga would recover. French tutor Pierre Gilliard wrote that the two sisters were [...] "passionately devoted to one another." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1909, {{the bell}} had made six trips, {{and not only}} had the {{cracking}} become worse, but souvenir hunters had deprived it of over one percent of its weight. When, in 1912, {{the organizers of the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, the city was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally decided to let it go as the bell had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to bring it to millions who might never see it otherwise. However, in 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride, the city installed a metal support structure inside the bell, generally called the [...] "spider." [...] In February 1915, the bell was tapped <b>gently</b> <b>with</b> wooden mallets to produce sounds which were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission which also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service. Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west. It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home; again, five million saw it on the return journey. Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after World War I, and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003. Chicago and San Francisco had obtained its presence after presenting petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of children. Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4million schoolchildren, for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Both efforts failed.|$|E
500|$|... "Liquor Store Blues" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews by most music critics. Tyrone S. Reid, {{considered the}} song {{one of the}} best in the album, [...] "You simply can’t get lyrics more droll or brainer than that." [...] The addition of Damien Marley made the track [...] "more alluring". DJ Gravy praised the fact that the song [...] "has a more authentic yard vibe, thanks to Black Chiney's Supa Dups", when comparing it to Mars and Travis McCoy's [...] "Billionaire". Slant Magazines Eric Henderson panned the song as [...] "sway <b>gently</b> <b>with</b> a hint of reggae swagger". Kevin Barber from the Consequence of Sound, who positively reviewed the album, wrote [...] "In return for all of his generous favors he has given other artists, they give back as well. Damien Marley joins him on the reggae jam". Idolator's writer Robbie Daw had a mixed opinion towards the song by writing that the recording [...] "isn’t nearly as infectious as [...] "Just The Way You Are", [...] it should still make for a fairly decent album track in what we’re hoping is a tasty plateful of catchy future singles". He found the tune to be [...] "reggae-tinged jam". Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "Liquor Store Blues" [...] was in a [...] "heavier dub zone with toaster Damian Marley" [...] furthering a personal matter [...] "the young singer should have stuck to the liquor store 'cause he was busted for cocaine in Vegas last month". Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine criticized the artist, saying [...] "After conquering the ladies who love weak pop music that is sung by a competent if boring singer, Bruno Mars has decided to try to carve off a chunk of Sublime's fans". He concluded by deeming the recording a [...] "faux reggae track". A writer for Rap-Up magazine commented that the recording's lyrics regard [...] "a quick escape from his bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events". Similarly, while reviewing the music video, Entertainment Weeklys, Brad Wete stated that the content of the lyrics saying [...] "Mars aims to [...] "get messed up today" [...] in hopes that he’ll [...] "be okay tomorrow"".|$|E

2500|$|Although what {{first comes}} to mind as the common domain of {{jellyfish}} is living well up off the ocean floor in the plankton, a few species of jellyfish are {{closely associated with the}} bottom for much of their lives (that is, they can be considered benthic). The upside-down jellyfish in the genus Cassiopea typically lie on the bottom of shallow lagoons where they sometimes pulsate <b>gently</b> <b>with</b> their umbrella top facing down. The tiny creeping jellyfish Staurocladia and Eleutheria (see section on Size, above) cannot swim and [...] "walk" [...] around on seaweed fronds or rocky bottoms on their tentacles. Most hydromedusae and scyphomedusae that live in coastal habitats find themselves on the bottom periodically, where they may stop swimming for a while, and certain box jellyfish species also rest on the sea bed in shallow water. Even some deep-sea species of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the stauromedusae are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.|$|E
2500|$|Forget for a {{few minutes}} that you are reading a copy of your evening paper. Allow your {{imagination}} to carry you to the gentle slope of a moon-lit Spanish hill. Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, fleecy clouds are drifting <b>gently</b> <b>with</b> the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as through [...] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is unobstructed by pillars. he balcony being of cantilever construction removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to sit behind one.|$|E
