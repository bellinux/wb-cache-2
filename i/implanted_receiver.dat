Phrenic nerve stimulation {{is a technique}} whereby a nerve stimulator provides electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve to cause diaphragmatic contraction. It consists of surgically <b>implanted</b> <b>receivers</b> and electrodes mated to an external transmitter by antennas worn over the <b>implanted</b> <b>receivers.</b> An external battery-operated transmitter sends radiofrequency energy to the receiver through an antenna, which {{is placed on the}} skin overlying the receiver. The receiver converts this energy into an electric current that is directed to the phrenic nerve in order to stimulate the nerve, thereby causing contraction of the diaphragm. The surgery can be performed via either a cervical or thoracic approach. Phrenic pacing provides ventilatory support for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency whose diaphragm, lungs, and phrenic nerves have residual function.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Ultrasonic {{transcutaneous}} {{energy transfer}} is an effec-tive method for powering implanted devices noninvasively. Never-theless, {{the amount of}} power harvested by the <b>implanted</b> <b>receiver</b> is sensitive to the distance and orientation of the external transmit-ting transducer attached to the skin {{with respect to the}} implanted receiving transducer. This paper describes an ultrasonic power transfer link whose harvested power is controlled by an inductive link. A small (5 μF) storage capacitor voltage, {{which is part of the}} implanted unit, is allowed to swing between 3. 8 and 3. 5 V using hysteretic control. The two control states are indicated by excita-tion (while the implanted storage capacitor voltage decreases) or the absence of excitation of an implanted coil that is magnetically coupled to an external coil attached to the skin surface. A 35 mW Ultrasonic Transcutaneous Energy Transfer link was fabricated using two piezoelectric transducers of equal size (Fuji Ceramics C- 2 PZT disc 15 mm × 3 mm) operated at a vibration frequency of 720 kHz. By applying the proposed hysteretic control, the captured power was effectively regulated for implantation depths of up to 85 mm.

40|$|Performing {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in patients who use implantable medical devices involve safety risks both for {{the patient and the}} implant. Hearing implants often use two permanent magnets, one implanted and one external, for the retention of the external transmitter coil to the <b>implanted</b> <b>receiver</b> coil to achieve an optimal signal transmission. The implanted magnet is subjected to both demagnetization and torque, magnetically induced by the MRI scanner. In this paper, demagnetization and a comparison between measured and simulated induced torque is studied for the retention magnet used in a bone conduction implant (BCI) system. The torque was measured and simulated in a uniform static magnetic field of 1. 5 T. The magnetic field was generated by a dipole electromagnet and permanent magnets with two different types of coercive fields were tested. Demagnetization and maximum torque for the high coercive field magnets was 7. 7 % +/- 2. 5 % and 0. 20 +/- 0. 01 Nm, respectively and 71. 4 % +/- 19. 1 % and 0. 18 +/- 0. 01 Nm for the low coercive field magnets, respectively. The simulated maximum torque was 0. 34 Nm, deviating from the measured torque in terms of amplitude, mainly related to an insufficient magnet model. The BCI implant with high coercive field magnets is believed to be {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) conditional up to 1. 5 T if a compression band is used around the skull to fix the implant.

Now that both links function, communication performance can be addressed. For example, noise problems with the received outlink signal that caused the PC program to lockup were just recently revealed and minimized by software "enhancements" to the Windows based PC program.

Recovery of outlink transmission did not reliably occur. The problem has been defined and implant software is being modified to better recognize noise from data by changing the timing associated with valid data packet identification and by better utilizing the error flags generated by the microcontroller's SCI circuits.

This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] has been shown that behavioral thresholds in cochlear implant patients are well correlated to the electrically evoked auditory brain stem response (EABR). 1 It is likely, therefore, that the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP), which is closely related to the EABR, will also show a similar correlation with behavioral threshold. Automatic measurement of a patient's ECAP would allow the patient's behavioral threshold level to be set automatically without any conscious input from him or her. It would offer the opportunity to greatly expedite the process of threshold setting and would be particularly useful in the case of young children, whose behavioral threshold levels can be difficult to judge. With this end in mind, an experimental system has been designed that allows the ECAP to be recorded with either scala tympani or extracochlear electrodes. The system, which uses a modified version of a standard cochlear implant, applies a biphasic stimulation pulse and records the ECAP a short time later. The recorded signal is transmitted by telemetry through the <b>implant</b> <b>receiver</b> coil to an external transmitter-receiver coil and is recovered and stored on computer. With the appropriate software it is then a relatively simple matter to determine the details of an evoked response. This paper presents the results of trials of the system on a guinea pig.

To limit the induced voltage, generally, low-voltage topologies utilize limiter circuits, voltage clippers or shunt regulators, which are power-inefficient methods. In order {{to overcome the}} voltage limitation and improve power efficiency, we propose an integrated chip high-voltage power receiver based on the step down approach. The topology accommodates voltages as high as 30 V and comprises a high-voltage semi-active rectifier, a voltage reference generator and a series regulator. Further, a battery management circuit that enables safe and reliable implant battery charging based on analog control is proposed and realized. The power receiver is fabricated in 0. 35 -μm high-voltage Bipolar-CMOS-DMOStechnology based on the LOCOS 0. 35 -μm CMOS process. Measurement results indicate 83. 5 % power conversion efficiency for a rectifier at 2. 1 mA load current.

This device was proposed to improve the ability of spinal cord stimulation to adequately overlap paresthesia to perceived areas of pain. Fifty-six patients with chronic, intractable neuropathic pain of the trunk and/or limbs more than three months' duration (average 105  months) were enrolled with follow-up periods at 4, 12, 26, and 52  weeks. All patients had a new paddle-type lead implanted with four electrodes, three of them aligned in a row perpendicular to the cord. Fifteen of these patients did not undergo permanent implantation. Of the 41 patients internalized, 20 patients chose conventional programming using an implanted pulse generator to drive four electrodes, while 21 patients chose a tripole stimulation system, which used radiofrequency power and signal transmission and an <b>implanted</b> dual-channel <b>receiver</b> to drive three electrodes using simultaneous pulses of independently variable amplitude. On average, the visual analog scale scores dropped more for patients with TTS systems (32 %) than for conventional polarity systems (16 %). Conventional polarity systems were using higher frequencies on average, while usage range was similar. Most impressive was the well-controlled "steering" of the paresthesias according to the dermatomal topography of the dorsal columns when using the TTS-balanced pulse driver. The most common complication was lead migration. While the transverse stimulation system produced acceptable outcomes for overall pain relief, an analysis of individual pain patterns suggests that it behaves like spinal cord stimulation in general with the best control of extremity neuropathic pain. This transverse tripole lead and driving system introduced the concept of electrical field steering by selective recruitment of axonal nerve fiber tracts in the dorsal columns. status: publishe...|$|R
