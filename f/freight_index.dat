40|$|The {{index method}} is {{significant}} among the individual methods of scientific research. This work intends to develop ways {{to analyze the}} usage of transport indices as indicators {{of the character of}} market activity in logistical infrastructure at different levels. Transport indices only developed in the past decade; nevertheless, they have already developed a large degree of diversity. This makes systematization, classification, and identification of their distinguishing features all necessary. By their nature, <b>freight</b> <b>indices</b> are largely similar to stock market indices, in that they both show the average changes in some observed phenomenon, and that they both aim to describe the general changes in a process involving many factors. The authors propose a transport <b>index</b> classification with <b>freight</b> <b>indices</b> set aside in a separate group, depending on their intended applications and possible uses. As a result, based on the empirical analysis of the transport index and the stock market index, the level of interconnection between logistical infrastructure and market activity in the Russian economy has been defined, by applying the GARCH model. On the other hand, applying this methodology to the USA’s statistical transport index and stock market index gave no results. This once again confirms the necessity of setting <b>freight</b> <b>indices</b> aside in a separate group, as well as the futility of performing analytical procedures with statistically heterogeneous indexes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present paper is to analyse the progress of data in shipping demand between 1993 and 2002 in the most important spanish ports, in the others words, those ports that are under State Ports protection, and their relation with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as <b>Freight</b> <b>Index.</b> The methodology {{that has been used}} to draw the shipping demand function up is the traditional one, due to we use added variables, i. e. they mean the global behaviour of a certain group of individuals. To prepare this paper, the demand account of sea transport services has been divided in three groups, in function of cargo types: General Merchandise, Solid Bulks and Liquid Bulks. The reason why we use this kind of division is that Principals Institutions in Sea Transport bring their statistics down in this way. Similarly, we pretend to analyse the evolution in the share of different cargos in the whole shipping demand in the period mentioned before (1993 / 2002). The particular demand function for each cargo type in a certain year {{is going to be in}} function of the GDP and the freight rate in that year. The <b>Freight</b> <b>Index</b> used depends on the cargo analysed. So, in case of general merchandise it has been used the liner <b>freight</b> <b>index,</b> since this cargo type use to be transported in liner terms. Usually, Freight Conferences fix prices in this navigation. In case of Solid and Liquid Bulks, we have chosen dry cargo and tanker cargo <b>freight</b> <b>index</b> respectively. The standard procedure to transport these kind of bulks is by "tramp" navigation. In "tramp" navigation, prices use to be fixed by time freight, when ships services are contracted for a limited period of time, or travel freight, when ship services are contracted for a particular trip. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} time-varying {{and constant}} hedge ratios, and investigates their performance in reducing freight rate risk in routes 1 and 1 A of the Baltic <b>Freight</b> <b>Index.</b> Time-varying hedge ratios are {{generated by a}} bivariate error correction model with a GARCH error structure. We also introduce an augmented GARCH (GARCH-X) model where the error correction term enters in the specification of the conditional covariance matrix. This specification links the concept of disequilibrium (as proxied by {{the magnitude of the}} error correction term) with that of uncertainty (as reflected in the time varying second moments of spot and futures prices). In- and out-of-sample tests reveal that the GARCH-X specification provides greater risk reduction than a simple GARCH and a constant hedge ratio. However, it fails to eliminate the riskiness of the spot position to the extent evidenced in other markets in the literature. This is thought {{to be the result of}} the heterogeneous composition of the underlying index. It seems that restructuring the composition of the Baltic <b>Freight</b> <b>Index</b> (BFI) so as to reflect homogeneous shipping routes may increase the hedging effectiveness of the futures contract. This by itself indicates that the imminent introduction of the Baltic Panamax Index (BPI) as the underlying asset of the Baltic International Financial Futures Exchange (BIFFEX) contract is likely to have a beneficial impact on the market. ...|$|E

This is achieved by applying a Box-Jenkins methodology to a BFI database covering a period following this pivotal change and comparing the properties of the resulting ARIMA model to those of a model previously estimated by applying the same methodology to data from an earlier period. On the basis of a range of criteria, the two models prove to be remarkably similar and the paper concludes that the behaviour of the BFI has not been radically altered even following this radical revision.

The tanker freight rate, which differs from the tramp freight rate, has only one peak season; it rises above its average from September or October, reaches its peak in December, then falls below average in January or February until reaching its trough in April. Interestingly, when the tramp freight rate rises above its average, from February or March to June or July, the tanker freight rate falls below its average.

To analyze the optimal timing for the container ship orders, container ship fleet development as a supply factor and the CSCT as a demand factor, both of which are components of CCFI, were simulated. After the first simulation, CCFI was simulated holistically. Based on the CCFI simulation results, it was possible to develop three optimal timing scenarios for ship order placement. The CCFI for October 2016 was in the initial entry status of a short-term rebound, which makes it possible for shipping companies to order ships without the risk of revenue loss.

40|$|The {{middle of}} the nineteenth century has long been a {{challenge}} to researchers of ocean freight rates. The data originating from the circulars of the London shipbroker firm of Angier Brothers have been the basis of much of the early work on pre-WWI freight rate movements, including the well-known Isserlis index published in 1938. These data only extend back to 1869, however.

The application of a new method of index construction to the freight rate data is suggested. This method has previously been successfully applied to construct price indices for property markets, where it is known as a ‘repeat sales index’. It is argued that this method may be applied to ocean freight rate data as well, because the property markets and the tramp shipping markets share the basic characteristics of the price information flow: prices of specific objects are usually available only at infrequent and irregular intervals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Intermodal freight {{transportation}} {{is defined as}} a system that carries freight from origin to destination by using two or more transportation modes. In this system, hubs are one of the key elements that function as transferring points of freight between different modes. The location of hubs {{is one of the most}} crucial success factors in intermodal {{freight transportation}} and needs to be considered very carefully as it has direct and indirect impacts on different stakeholders including investors, policy makers, infrastructure providers, hub operators, hub users, and the community. There have been several attempts to evaluate intermodal freight hub location decisions by using conventional multi-objective evaluation models. Only a few studies take community’s benefits into account next to the costs and it is difficult to assess the relationship between system level performance and the prefered solution for individual actors. This paper aims at developing an integral model for the evaluation of road-rail intermodal freight hub location decisions. The model comprises five dominant types of agents namely, hub operators, terminal operators, infrastructure providers, hub users, and communities. An agent based modeling approach is introduced to allow negotiation to happen in order to achieve a global objective. The paper outlines the methodology to be used. It presents a conceptual design and an illustrative case study for an agent based model for the decision making process for planning the location of intermodal <b>freight</b> hubs. <b>Index</b> terms: Agent-Based Model, intermodal freight hub, ontology, decision making, socio-technical system I I...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses econometric {{modelling}} and forecasting {{to investigate a}} number of important topics associated with economic and financial aspects of the global shipping market. The thesis is made up of five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the structure of the shipping market; it covers a wide range of topics, including the shipping sub-markets, shipping stock and shipping market information. It introduces the different types of freight rates involved, and discusses the economics behind the formation of spot and time-charter freight rates. It also introduces the new-build ship market and explains some of the different shipbuilding models. In addition, it discusses the market for second-hand ships. Finally, it reports and discusses the correlations of different shipping variables {{with each other and with}} the S&P 500 stock market index. Chapter 2 focuses on forecasting the freight rate for ship operators. Since time-charter rates depend on market participants’ expectations about future spot rates, under market efficiency the ship operator should not be able to make abnormal profits by choosing a specific chartering strategy. The chapter investigates whether this is true by exploring the economic value of freight rate forecasts, using a regression-based recursive switching approach based on two sets of macroeconomic and commodity data. The ship operator is assumed to allocate the ship between a trip-charter and time-charter market according to forecasts of the quarterly excess freight rate. The Handymax and Capesize classes of ship are analysed, the analysis showing that this type of investment strategy does not generate significantly abnormal profits for the Handymax class, but does for the Capesize class. Forecasting with commodity variables is more profitable than forecasting with macroeconomic variables. Chapter 3 quantifies and discusses the volatility of index returns in the dry bulk freight rate market for freight traders and investors. The daily <b>freight</b> rate <b>indexes</b> of three ship classes, Baltic dry index (BDI), Baltic Panamax index (BPI) and Baltic Capesize index (BCI) from 14 January 2000 to 14 January 2010 are analysed. Some of the findings from applying variations of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models suggest that the volatility of shocks is very persistent and that a unit root might exist in the conditional variance. No evidence of any asymmetry in the conditional variance is found. Volatility forecasting for one day ahead and multiple days ahead is also performed using a variety of ARCH models. At the end of the chapter the risk exposure of the <b>freight</b> rate <b>index</b> is assessed using the Value at Risk (VaR) technique. In Chapter 4 it is argued that if risk premiums are time-varying and correlated with macroeconomic variables, macroeconomic variables might have forecasting power for shipping stock returns. This issue is investigated using the recursive regression-based approach of Pesaran and Timmermann (1995) and it is concluded that allowing for different combinations of macroeconomic variables generally does not help forecasting. This may be because the model selection criteria do not seem to work efficiently when there is a structural break in the data. The model which includes all variables (AV) is found to be the best performing model. A data set is employed which includes four shipping stocks and the S&P 500 index for comparison, and this shows that a trading strategy using the AV model generates 93 % to 500 % more wealth than a buy-and-hold strategy. When the explanatory variables are analysed individually, the US Treasury bill and NYMEX oil price are shown to have the most forecasting power. Chapter 5 concludes the thesis. It presents a review of the original findings and puts forward recommendations for future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
