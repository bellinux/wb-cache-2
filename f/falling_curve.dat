50|$|A calculable {{model for}} {{creating}} the heavy isotopes from iron seed nuclei in a time-dependent manner was not provided until 1961. That work showed that the large overabundances of barium observed by astronomers in certain red-giant stars could be created from iron seed nuclei if the total neutron flux (number of neutrons per unit area) was appropriate. It also showed that no one single value for neutron flux {{could account for the}} observed s-process abundances, but that a wide range is required. The numbers of iron seed nuclei that were exposed to a given flux must decrease as the flux becomes stronger. This work also showed that the curve of the product of neutron-capture cross section times abundance is not a smoothly <b>falling</b> <b>curve,</b> as B2FH had sketched, but rather has a ledge-precipice structure. A series of papers in the 1970s by Donald D. Clayton utilizing an exponentially declining neutron flux {{as a function of the}} number of iron seed exposed became the standard model of the s-process and remained so until the details of AGB-star nucleosynthesis became advanced enough that they became a standard model based on the stellar structure models. Important series of measurements of neutron-capture cross sections were reported from Oak Ridge National Lab in 1965and by Karlsruhe Nuclear Physics Center in 1982and subsequently. These placed the s-process on the firm quantitative basis that it enjoys today.|$|E

30|$|The most {{significant}} result of both sampling methods {{is that the}} conductivity (µS cm− 1) increases with rising saturation levels. The highest PPP and drill dust conductivity was measured at c. 100 % saturation, but the area with the strongest gradients differs between the methods. The conductivities of the PPP samples strongly decrease between 100 and 50 % saturation, following then by a slightly <b>falling</b> <b>curve</b> down to 0 % saturation of the stone cubes. This progression may emerge because salt ions are much better mobilised in an almost fully saturated stone than under partially saturated conditions. The poultices insert water into the stone, which enables capillary transport to a certain depth. Stones with a poorly interconnected pore system attain lower saturation {{because a lot of}} large air-filled pores remain [11, 14]. Stones with well interconnected pores are able to reach a higher saturation degree, so the range of the transport induced by the poultice may reach deeper regions of the stone and more salt ions can be activated.|$|E

40|$|Concepts from {{statistical}} {{decision theory}} {{were used to}} analyse the detection problem faced by the body's immune system in mounting immune responses to bacteria of the normal body flora. Given that these bacteria are potentially harmful, {{that there can be}} extensive cross reaction between bacterial antigens and host tissues, and that the decisions are made in uncertainty, there is a finite chance of error in immune response leading to autoimmune disease. A model of ageing in the immune system is proposed that is based on random decay in components of the decision process, leading to a steep age dependent increase in the probability of error. The age incidence of those autoimmune diseases which peak in early and middle life can be explained as the resultant of two processes: an exponentially <b>falling</b> <b>curve</b> of incidence of first contact with common bacteria, and a rapidly rising error function. Epidemiological data on the variation of incidence with social class, sibship order, climate and culture can be used to predict the likely site of carriage and mode of spread of the causative bacteria. Furthermore, those autoimmune diseases precipitated by common viral respiratory tract infections might represent reactions to nasopharyngeal bacterial overgrowth, and this theory can be tested using monoclonal antibodies to search the bacterial isolates for cross reacting antigens. If this model is correct then prevention of autoimmune disease by early exposure to low doses of bacteria might be possible...|$|E

Dessa forma, este trabalho apresenta um estudo de comparação reológica entre iogurtes comerciais do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, em cujas formulações constam diferentes espessantes. Foram utilizadas três grandes marcas do mercado e, entre os espessantes utilizados, estão: goma guar, goma xantana, goma carragena, goma alfarroba e carboximetilcelulose. Previamente às análises reológicas, as amostras de iogurtes foram submetidas à determinação do pH, da acidez (expressa em ácido láctico) e da umidade. As curvas de fluxo e de viscosidade foram obtidas em reômetro rotacional Thermo Haake Mars com geometria placa/placa (35 mm de diâmetro), com variação de taxa de cisalhamento entre 0, 02 e 100 s- 1 (curva ascendente), e 100 e 0, 02 s- 1 (curva descendente), em um tempo total de 20 minutos. Foi determinada a histerese como a área entre as curvas e ajustados os modelos de Bingham, Casson, Herschel-Bulkley e Ostwald de Waele. Foram realizados também testes de tixotropia, pela medição da viscosidade em função do tempo a uma taxa constante de 100 s- 1, por 10 minutos. Estes foram ajustados pelo modelo de Weltman. Além disso, foram verificadas alterações no comportamento reológico em função da variação de temperatura (4 a 24 ºC), cujos resultados foram avaliados pela Equação de Arrhenius. Todas as amostras de iogurte analisadas apresentaram comportamento pseudoplástico e tixotrópico. Todos os modelos foram bem ajustados para as curvas de fluxo, exceto o modelo de Weltman, que não representou bem os testes de tixotropia. Yoghurt {{consistency}} and viscosity {{are two of}} the major factors involved in product quality and acceptance. Thus this paper presents a comparative study of the rheology of commercial yoghurts in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, whose formulations included different thickeners. Three major market brands were used and the thickeners included guar gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan gum, locust bean gum and carboxymethylcellulose. Before the rheological tests, samples of the yoghurts were submitted to the determination of pH, acidity (expressed as lactic acid) and moisture content. The flow and viscosity curves were obtained using a rotational Thermo Haake Mars rheometer with plate/plate geometry (diameter 35 mm), varying the shear rate from 0. 02 to 100 s- 1 (rising curve) and from 100 to 0. 02 s- 1 (<b>falling</b> <b>curve)</b> in a total time of 20 minutes. Hysteresis was determined as the area between the curves and fitted to the models of Bingham, Casson, Herschel-Bulkley and the Power Law. Thixotropy tests were also carried out by measuring the viscosity versus time at a constant rate of 100 s- 1 for 10 minutes. These were fitted to the Weltman model. Moreover, the changes in the rheological behaviour as a function of temperature (4 - 24 ºC) were observed, and the results evaluated using the Arrhenius equation. All the yoghurt samples showed pseudoplastic and thixotropic behaviour and all the models fitted the flow curves well, {{with the exception of the}} Weltman model, which did not represent the thixotropy tests well...|$|E
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} (BF) that {{converts}} iron ore into molten iron {{is an important}} component in iron-steel making. An improvement of the blast furnace fuel efficiency contributes to the reduction of energy consumption in the steel industry because this process represents about 70 % of the total energy input to this industry. The goal of the research is to improve the competitive edge of steel mills by developing the advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to optimize the gas and burden distributions inside a blast furnace for achieving the best gas utilization. A state-of-the-art 3 -D CFD model has been developed for simulating the gas distribution inside a blast furnace at given burden conditions, burden distribution and blast parameters. The comprehensive 3 -D CFD model has been validated by plant measurement data from an actual blast furnace. Validations of the sub-models are also achieved. ^ The burden distribution is direct related to efficiency and stable blast furnace operation. In this research, a mathematical model for estimating the burden distribution was developed with the combination of the <b>falling</b> <b>curve</b> sub-model, stock-line profile formation sub-model and burden descending sub-model. In a blast furnace, the burden descending velocity may be non-uniform along the radial direction due to the shaft angle and non-uniform consumption. The modifications on two existing burden descending models, i. e., geometric profile (GP) model and potential flow (PF) model are proposed to consider the non-uniform descending speed. The proposed non-uniform descending models are validated with published scaled blast furnace model results. Comparing to the original uniform descending model, the accuracy increases notably for the modified models with the non-uniform descending velocity. ^ The blast furnace burden consists of alternative layers of iron ore and coke. A novel methodology is proposed to efficiently model the effects of alternative burden layer structure on gas flow, heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions. Different reactions and heat transfer characteristics are applied for difference types of layer. ^ In addition, the layered CFD model accurately predicts the Cohesive Zone (CZ) shape where the melting of solid burden taking place. The shape and location of the CZ are determined by an iterative method based on the ore temperature distribution. A new methodology has been developed to determine the location and shape of the CZ, based on the burden temperature distribution and composition. In addition, an under-relaxation scheme has been developed to obtain layered CZ shape which explicitly considered the layer structure inside the CZ. ^ The user friendly software package named Blast Furnace Shaft Simulator (BFSS) has been developed to simulate the blast furnace shaft process. The BFSS software package has been used for the optimization of burden and gas distributions to maximize gas utilization with proper furnace permeability for given burden materials, productivities, and blast furnaces; and also to optimize the burden and gas distributions for high fuel injection rate and low coke rate. The research has significant benefits to the steel industry with high productivity, low energy consumption, and improved environment. Using the BFSS, it is possible to design, optimize, and trouble shoot the blast furnace operation. ...|$|E

Two of the galaxies are strong tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidates {{based on our}} luminosity-metallicity relation definition. We model the rotation curves of these galaxies. Our sample shows low mass-to-light ratios (M/L = 0. 73 +/- 0. 39 M(circle dot) /L-circle dot) as expected for young, star-forming dwarfs. One of the galaxies in our sample has an apparently strongly <b>falling</b> rotation <b>curve,</b> reaching zero rotational velocity outside the turnover radius of r(turn) = 1. 2 r(e). This may be (1) a polar ring galaxy, with a tilted bar within a face-on disc; (2) a kinematic warp.

40|$|Long period {{variable}} stars {{arise in the}} final stages of the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. They have periods of up to ~ 1000 d and amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of mass and radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the underlying stellar population. The overall number of long period variables in a population is directly related to their lifetime, which is difficult to predict from first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar mass-loss and convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not been previously taken into account when modeling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. Here we construct time-dependent stellar population models that include the effects of long period {{variable stars}}, and report the ubiquitous detection of this expected `pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-rich galaxy M 87. The pixel light curves display a variety of behaviors, including linearly rising and <b>falling</b> <b>curves,</b> semi-periodic curves, and sudden increases or decreases in the flux level. The observed variation of 0. 1 - 1 % is very well matched to the predictions of our models.
