We base our arguments on a case study of the “Not below 24, 000 ” movement among nurse students and newly graduated nurses for acceptable entry wages in Sweden.

Financial reporting quality {{is assumed to}} have three dimensions: earnings informativeness, accruals management, and real earnings management. Three key findings emerge from our analyses. First, IFRS adoption per se {{does not seem to}} affect financial reporting quality. Second, in countries characterized by weak enforcement, strong board-level monitoring appears to enhance financial reporting quality, thus suggesting a substitutive effect between firm- and country-level governance. Third, in countries characterized by strong enforcement, firms with strong board-level monitoring exhibit a higher level of financial reporting quality than firms with weak board-level monitoring, thus suggesting that country- and firm-level governance are complementary. Overall, our findings help bridge the gap in the debate about the effects of country- and firm-level governance on the quality of financial reporting and provide <b>further</b> <b>nuance</b> on prior IFRS adoption research...|$|E

In both Hirsi and CPCF asylum seekers were detained using military state powers, but the length of detainment varied significantly from 10 h in Hirsi to 1 month in CPCF. The Australian judges did state that the threshold of safety, closely linked to the principle of non-refoulement, is a requirement of Australian laws but with a close 4 – 3 judgement, concluded in favour of the Australian government, claiming the executive acted within the parameters of the Maritime Powers Act (2013), passed by the Australian government after the M 70 judgement.

40|$|Management {{consultants}} {{have been}} important, but hitherto largely unnoticed, {{features of the}} postwar British state. This thesis traces the emergence {{and development of the}} relationship between management consultancies and the British state. It seeks to answer three questions. First, why were management consultants brought into the machinery of the state? Second, how has state power been impacted by bringing profit-seeking actors into the machinery of the state? And third, how has the nature of management consultancy changed over time? The thesis demonstrates the role consultants played in major developments in the postwar period. The role of British consultants in helping to professionalise the civil service in the 1960 s is considered, and contrasted with the impact American consultants had in seeking to overturn perceived British decline in the 1970 s. Consultancies from accounting backgrounds turned their hands to attempts to automate major state operations in the 1980 s. Specific case studies interrogate how consultancies influenced the policy fields of health service reform and social security benefits. And the work of consultancies during New Labour’s public sector reforms and moves towards outsourcing of state services in the 1990 s and 2000 s is analysed. The history of the work of these varied consultancies helps to deepen and <b>further</b> <b>nuance</b> understandings of the nature of state power and the role of elite networks and governing circles in postwar Britain...|$|E

Many school-aged young people spend considerable periods of their out-of-school time playing computer games and there are potentially positive learning and literacy experiences {{to be gained from}} their playing, regardless of the game genre. Such experiences generate, and require, new understandings about learning and literacy. This paper proposes a methodology for exploring questions about the kinds of multiliteracies that are exhibited by young people playing computer games in out-of-school settings.

Drawing on the prior work of Gee (2003) and Bangert-Drowns and Pyke (2001), an initial protocol for recognising multiliteracies in the game-playing data is presented. To provide <b>further</b> <b>nuanced</b> explanations of the players' understanding of their multiliterate experiences, a discourse analysis methodology is conceptualised that combines membership categorisation analysis and critical discourse analysis.

40|$|This study {{examines}} a legal experiment {{that occurred during}} the height of the global financial crisis. As markets from the United States to Europe to the Global South shook, one country – the United Arab Emirates – found itself on the brink of economic collapse. In particular, in 2009 the U. A.

Recognizing that such a default would have cataclysmic reverberations across the globe, Dubai’s governmental leaders turned to a small group of foreign lawyers, judges, accountants, and business consultants for assistance. Working in a coordinated fashion, these external and internal actors soon imported into the Emirate a new regime of insolvency laws – and even an Anglo-American insolvency court – to help resolve Dubai’s financial troubles.

40|$|Going beyond Orientalism in its {{examination}} of novels dealing with British colonisation in the West, {{as well as}} the East Indies, the postcolonial frame of my thesis develops recent theorisations of the Romantic ‘stranger’. Analysing a range of novels from the much anthologised Mansfield Park (1814), to less well-known narratives such as John Thelwall’s The Daughter of Adoption (1801) and Sir Walter Scott’s Saint Ronan’s Well (1823), my thesis seeks to account for a model of ‘colonial cosmopolitanism’ within fiction of the period. Considering the cosmopolitan dimensions of the transferential rhetoric of slavery, my thesis explores the ways in which, Jane Austen, Amelia Opie and Maria Edgeworth consider the position of women in domestic society through a West Indian frame. Demonstrating the need for reform both at home and abroad, such novels are representative of a fledgling cosmopolitanism that is often overlooked in current criticism. In seeking to account for ‘colonial cosmopolitanism’ as a new model for reading fiction composed during the Romantic period, my thesis attempts to add <b>further</b> <b>nuance</b> to current understandings of sympathetic exchange during the process of British colonisation. In chapters four and five I will develop my analysis of novels dealing with colonial expansion in the Caribbean to consider novels which deal with the Indian subcontinent. Although stopping short of questioning colonial expansion, discourses of ‘colonial cosmopolitanism’, as my thesis demonstrates, provided a foundation for humanitarian and cultural engagement which was mutually transformative for both the coloniser and the colonised...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of work, knowledge, and responsibilities between {{doctors and nurses}} is a longstanding object of interest for medical sociologists. Whereas the strategies through which nurses and doctors construct their professional boundary have been thoroughly examined, {{little is known about}} why the regulation of the medical-nursing boundary varies across care settings. In the article, I argue that this gap in knowledge can be attributed to insufficient examination of the 'negotiation context', namely the features of the social and organisational environment that directly affect doctor-nurse boundary negotiations. Adopting a negotiated order perspective, and drawing data from a hospital ethnography, the article describes the different ways of constructing the medical-nursing boundary (separating, replacing, and intersecting) which were observed in three different care settings (a neurology ward, a neurosurgical ward, and an intensive care unit). Constant comparison of the observed interactional patterns led to the identification of three factors that significantly affected the construction of the medical-nursing boundary, specifically: patients' state of awareness, the type of clinical approach adopted by nurses and doctors, and the level of acuity on the ward. The article advances our knowledge of the medical-nursing boundary by shedding light on its flexible and contextual nature and by adding <b>further</b> <b>nuance</b> to the boundary-blurring/boundary-reinforcing dichotomy. New features of the 'negotiation context' are identified that enable more convincing explanations of why the medical-nursing boundary varies across care settings.

40|$|For over 40 years, {{the term}} moral panic and concept {{to which it}} is adjoined have been used {{throughout}} the socio-criminological literature as a means of describing collective overreactions to perceived wrongs. Since the 1980 s, the concept has also been criticized for its inability to adapt to differing moral viewpoints and research paradigms. To address these criticisms and question the significance of moral panic’s continued use, this paper works to redefine the concept from its theoretical foundation to practical employment. A contextual-constructionist/post-positivist approach is, first, used to weigh claims of fact against an imperfect understanding of ‘the truth’. Moral panic is then defined as a means of describing collective, corrective-intended behaviour based on an irrational belief that exaggerates the threat posed by a social problem. To test and <b>further</b> <b>nuance</b> this definition, the Parliament of Canada’s decision to pass four bills that introduced or amended section 172. 1 (luring a child) of the Criminal Code of Canada is deconstructed. Using a Historical Dialectic-Relational Approach to analyze the transcripts of House of Commons and Senate debates and committee meetings related to bills C- 15 A, C- 277, C- 2, and C- 10, the concept of moral panic is found to be an appropriate means of describing certain forms of collective behaviour. An outline of how members of parliament spoke, during the legislative process, of the media, expert witnesses, Internet child lurers, and victims of child sexual abuse provides additional context. The paper concludes by arguing that the moral panic concept can be mobilized {{in a way that is}} theoretically justifiable, adaptable to differing moral viewpoints, and of practical use...|$|E

More precisely, examining how the regulatory framework and policies regarding refugees' and migrant situation effects practical implementation. The research questions raised are; - How are refugees and other migrants' rights in Greece respected, from a legal, political and moral perspective? What impact can racism have on the treatment of refugees and other migrants? A contextual analysis of ideas through an analysis of the political programs/agendas was used and contrasted, through theories concerning racism, nationalism and globalization to <b>further</b> <b>nuance</b> the situation concerning refugees' rights. Furthermore the study is analyzed through a HR perspective or more precisely through relevant conventions, regulations and EU directives. The conclusions are that Greece has laws and policies regarding migration, however these regulations have major flaws concerning their practical outcome. Improvements have been made to the migration system constituted of new government agencies intended to meet EU-standards, concerning the management of the asylum process. Unfortunately these improvements have been found wanting. Globalization is challenging the national and regional laws. EU and its regulations concerning asylum, does not take into account differentiated contextual realities concerning EU´s member states. People generally intend to travel through Greece and are consequently sent back to Greece by other EU states, without significant support it becomes problematic to handle this volume of people. The European Union’s protectionist policies create barriers and make access to the region more difficult, meanwhile people of other nationalities flee or migrate in hope of a more secure and humane existence. With xenophobia on the rise (both politically and socially) migrants face further difficulties, for instance fear of deportation can make the reporting of hate crimes to the authorities complicated to say the least...|$|E

All interviewees regard their organizations as being market and entrepreneurially oriented. Three studied aspects (external factors, 7 EM tenets and cultural orientation of EM) have produced results accounting for how EM is actually being used by participating organizations today. What has been found is that the EM, market and entrepreneurial orientation intentions of participating organizations are higher than actual behavior. What is more is that interviewees’ environments are relatively stable, reducing the immediate urgency of EM activities. Nevertheless, what has been most important is that results indicate that the use of current events, strategic partnerships, market research, shared value emphasis, communication effectiveness, media exploitation, innovative campaigns that creates values for sponsors as well as having viral effect and constant communication through updates of the social achievements to donors are current ways in which these organizations market their respective causes entrepreneurially. What has also been uncovered is that these organizations are more inclined to being risk averse than risk taking in their marketing practices. In addition, the EM tenet resource leveraging {{comes in the form of}} utilizing other organizations, firms, people, popular figures, typified by collaboration and mutual exchange in which value is created for both parties.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the recent phenomenon of West Africans leaving the African continent and seeking work in Spain. By the year 2003, a barely noticeable blip on the screen of the age-old phenomenon that is migration became a conspicuous trend. Depending on one's perspective this trend is either a natural flow of people from one region to another, or it is an alarming turn of events that needs immediate global attention. However, when it involves significant loss of life - as does the sea journey of the poorest aspirants - surely all who ponder the migrant question would agree that this qualifies as a crisis.

Partial onset seizures may be without (simple partial) or with (complex partial) altered consciousness, or secondary generalization, but the pharmacotherapeutic selections are {{the same for all}} seizures in this group. Within the generalized onset seizures, however, individual types (myoclonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, tonic, absence) have differential pharmacologic responses. The syndromic “epilepsy ” categorization combines the specific seizure types and other characteristics including age, family history, results of neurologic examination and imaging and EEG, and provides information on prognosis and responsiveness to the otherwise appropriately selected drug therapy. 3 Careful history supplemented by observations of others, along with the results of EEG, imaging studies, and neurologic examination, are successful i...|$|R
5000|$|Sound {{is heard}} through space. But this {{defining}} {{of sound and}} space is <b>further</b> <b>nuanced</b> by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has {{become a source of}} interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer’s concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe [...] "a total appreciation of the sonic environment," [...] and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand [...] "the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change,". In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real.|$|R
