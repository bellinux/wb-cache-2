5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, <b>epidote</b> and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E

25|$|The Bowning Deformation {{caused the}} north–south {{faulting}} and long folding {{in the area}} surrounding the ACT. This deformation was connected with the attachment of the terrane to the continent. During this stage metamorphism occurred. In the Canberra Graben and Cullarin Block, metamorphism mostly reached the upper greenschist stage, with shallow burial and temperature below 350°C. This changed the volcanics and sediments with sericitisation, saussuritisation, conversion of plagioclase to albite, and conversion of biotite to chlorite, titanite, <b>epidote</b> and opaque minerals. On the western margin in southwest Belconnen, Duffy, and Kambah in the Laidlaw and Walker Volcanics the temperature was lower and prehnite-pumpellyite facies was achieved.

50|$|Unlike {{many other}} dating techniques, fission-track dating is uniquely suited for {{determining}} low-temperature thermal events using common accessory minerals over {{a very wide}} geological range (typically 0.1 Ma to 2000 Ma). Apatite, sphene, zircon, micas and volcanic glass typically contain enough uranium to be useful in dating samples of relatively young age (Mesozoic and Cenozoic) and are the materials most useful for this technique. Additionally low-uranium <b>epidotes</b> and garnets {{may be used for}} very old samples (Paleozoic to Precambrian). The fission-track dating technique is widely used in understanding the thermal evolution of the upper crust, especially in mountain belts. Fission tracks are preserved in a crystal when the ambient temperature of the rock falls below the annealing temperature. This annealing temperature varies from mineral to mineral and is the basis for determining low-temperature vs. time histories. While the details of closure temperatures are complicated, they are approximately 70 to 110 °C for typical apatite, c. 230 to 250 °C for zircon, and c. 300 °C for titanite.|$|R
30|$|VP/VS {{relationship}} {{becomes very}} complex (Fig.  1 b) when the large anisotropy typical of hydrated minerals and rocks is {{taken into account}} (Bezacier, et al. 2010 a; Bezacier, et al. 2010 b; Mainprice and Ildefonse 2009). Large seismic anisotropy of hydrated minerals is a primary cause of anisotropy in deformed rocks of subduction zones. In foliated serpentinites, the combination of intrinsic mineral anisotropy due to the layered structure of phyllosilicates and their strong alignment in deformed rocks due to the plate-shaped crystals results {{in a range of}} VP/VS ratio spanning most of that of typical subduction zone rocks (Bezacier, et al. 2010 a). Anisotropy of blueschists is also marked because of alignment of anisotropic amphiboles and <b>epidotes</b> (Bezacier, et al. 2010 b). Absolute velocities and VP/VS ratio are also drastically decreased by the presence of overpressurized fluids (Peacock, et al. 2011). Finally, in addition to modifying absolute velocities and VP/VS ratio, the presence of fluids or magmas damps seismic waves because of fluid motion in porosity and can be tracked by mapping seismic attenuation (Nakajima 2014).|$|R
25|$|The Breton {{peninsula}} appeared {{during the}} Cadomian Orogeny, which formed its northern coastline, between Guingamp and Fougères. The southern part emerged during the Hercynian orogeny. At the same time, an intense volcanic activity left large quantities of granite. Between the Cadomian and Hercynian periods, the region was submerged several times and the sea left fossils and sedimentary rocks, mostly schist and sandstone. Because {{of the absence of}} limestone, soils in Brittany are usually acid. The Armorican massif straightened and flattened several times during the formation of the Pyrenees and the Alps. Changes in sea levels and climate led to a strong erosion and to the formation of more sedimentary rocks.

Isotope ratios of the basalts are very heterogeneous because of an input of oxygen, hydrogen, and strontium from seawater.

In the A 1 -Fe-Mn series, b increases almost linearly over the range of (Fe, Mn) contents, with Mn causing alarger increase than Fe, whilst a and c increase over the range 0 to 0. 9 (Fe, Mn), and then decrease.

30|$|This study applies an {{approach}} {{similar to the}} original method suggested by Reed and Spycher (1984) and revisited by Spycher et al. (2014), Peiffer et al. (2014) and Palmer et al. (2014). Equilibration temperatures are calculated for feldspars (K-feldspars and albite), SiO 2 polymorphs (quartz or chalcedony), phyllosilicates (muscovite, paragonite, biotites, kaolinite), zeolites and <b>epidotes</b> based on concentrations of major constituents Na, K, Ca, Si, Al, Fe, Cl, alkalinity and sulfate. Magnesium phases are excluded intentionally, since dilution of geothermal fluids with superficial, Mg-rich waters will significantly bias reservoir temperature estimations, by overestimating equilibration temperatures for magnesium minerals. The determination of the critical parameters, such as in situ pH and aluminum concentration is done differently than in the above named studies. Contrasting the methods of Spycher et al. (2014) and Palmer et al. (2014), we determine in situ pH as a sum parameter via a sensitivity analysis (“In situ pH value” section), thus accounting for measurement errors {{as well as for}} degassing and speciation-driven processes, which potentially affect the pH. The same applies for aluminum concentrations (“Aluminum concentration” section). Differing from the FixAl method proposed by Pang and Reed (1998), the here presented approach determines the aluminum concentration by minimization of the equilibrium misfit for all considered alumino-phases not by forced equilibrium of one single mineral. Numerical calculations were conducted using PhreeqC version 3.1. 4 (Parkhurst and Appelo 2013) and thermodynamic data of Delany and Lundeen (1991).|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of detrital minerals in sediments {{has become a}} powerful tool for provenance studies, particularly in the last decades with the improvement of analytical techniques for mineral grains. Major and trace element contents of igneous and metamorphic minerals can reveal the characteristics of their original sources, mainly with respect to their geochemical affinity, geotectonic setting and the physical parameters that controlled their crystallization. The proportions of major elements in pyroxenes and amphiboles can be used for the identification of their igneous or metamorphic origin, for the definition of their magmatic affiliation, and for the discussion of the probable tectonic setting where they were generated. Metamorphic and igneous zircons can be distinguished by REE patterns or U and Th contents. Magmatic zircons from different geotectonic settings can show different concentrations of REE, Nb, Hf and Y. Magmatic garnets from granites typically show high Mn contents, and can be distinguished from metamorphic ones or from garnets of ultramafic rocks mainly through their major element composition. Compositional zoning of garnets are indicative of their metamorphic or igneous character. Magmatic, metamorphic and hydrothermal <b>epidotes</b> can be distinguished by their {{chemical composition}}, as well. Several other minerals, such as apatite, tourmaline, rutile, titanite, and feldspars can indicate, through their chemical composition, the probable rock that could have produced them.

40|$|The Anarak Metamorphic Complex, {{localized}} in Central Iran, is {{a fossil}} accretionary wedge composed of several tectonometamorphic units. Some of these, the Chah Gorbeh, the Morghab and the Ophiolitic complexes, contain mafic rocks {{that have been}} metamorphosed at high-pressure–low-temperature conditions. Such units have been stacked together and later refolded during {{the final stages of}} exhumation. Structural analysis at the mesoscale recognized at least three deformation events. Microstructural analyses, mineral chemistry and thermodynamic modelling reveal that the mafic schists followed contrasting P–T paths during their tectonometamorphic evolutions. In the schists of the Chah Gorbeh and Ophiolitic complexes an early greenschist-facies stage was later overprinted by blueschist-facies phase assemblages with suggested peak conditions of 390 – 440 °C at 0. 6 – 0. 9 GPa for the meta-basalt within the Ophiolitic Complex and 320 – 380 °C at 0. 6 – 0. 9 GPa for the blueschists of the Chah Gorbeh Complex. P–T conditions at metamorphic peak were 410 – 450 °C at 0. 78 – 0. 9 GPa for the Morghab blueschists, but they are reached before a greenschist-facies re-equilibration. Compositional zoning of amphiboles and <b>epidotes</b> of this greenschist-facies stage suggests a renewed pressure increase {{at the end of this}} metamorphic stage. Based on these data we reconstructed a clockwise P–T path for the Morghab mafic schists and a counter-clockwise path for the Chah Gorbeh blueschists and ophiolitic meta-basalts.

Based {{on the existence of}} stable hydrothermal alteration, the upflow of hot, neutral-chloride brine in Lagunao is postulated to occur beneath the area bounded by Ticala Fault in the northwest and Lagunao Fault in the northeast. The outflow regions, on the other hand are the areas northeast of Lagunao Fault and northwest of Ticala Fault where fluid flow is mainly horizontal and deep such that relict alteration at shallow levels remains extant.

40|$|The Bellviksberg deposit in the Dorotea area {{is part of}} the sandstone-hosted lead-zinc {{deposits}} occurring {{all along}} the eastern front of the Scandinavian Caledonides in Precambrian to Lower Cambrian sandstone deposited uncomformably on the deeply eroded Precambrian basement (Laisvall, Vassbo, etc). The Bellviksberg deposit occurs in the Ström Quartzitic Nappe that shows décollement structure and thrusting directly over the Alum Shales formation of the Autochthon. The goal of this thesis is to give a reinterpretation of the Bellviksberg deposit on a geological and genetic point of view. It also aims to give guidelines for the exploration of the Bellviksberg deposit and the Dorotea area in general. Thus, most of the cores of the deposit have been logged. Thin and polished-sections were made to help the interpretation work. Within this nappe two lithologies have been identified which names are introduced here: the Varangerian Tillite and the Lower Cambrian Sandstone. The Varangerian Tillite is characterised by an overall greenish colour due to clay minerals coating quartz grains. It is composed of interbedded quartzitic sandstones and conglomerates with well-rounded quartz grains. Other minerals such as feldspar, <b>epidotes</b> and muscovite constitute only 1 - 2 % of the mineralogical assemblage. This formation is interpreted as being of glacio-fluvial origin from a reworked sediment. The Lower Cambrian Sandstone overlaying the Varangerian Tillite hosts the mineralization. It is composed of interbedded fine and coarse grained quartzitic sandstone. The coarser grained units are poorly sorted, less compacted than the fine grained units and contain preferably organic matter with associated pyrite. Graphite- rich sandstone and siltstone members can be present within the Lower Cambrian Sandstone Formation. This formation is interpreted as being from deltaic origin dominated by fluvial action. The nappe hosting the Bellviksberg mineralization is composed of many thrust sheet stacked on each other with inverse faults striking - 20 °N to 0 °N and small scale folds. A preliminary resource estimation results in 1. 66 Mt of 5. 35 % Pb, 0. 23 % Zn and 21 g/t Ag. The main part of the mineralization, galena-dominated, occurs in the less tectonically disturbed part of the Bellviksberg area and mostly in the coarser grained units that are usually richer in organic matter and less compacted. The host-rock is then thought to have been the main source of sulphurs that fixed metals carried by basinal brines transported during the Scandian Event of the Caledonian orogeny. Redox or pH controls for the precipitation of metals are suggested although a redox control is slightly favoured. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals to}} the geology and {{petrogenesis}} of the Identidade greenstone belt, located between Xinguara and Rio Maria towns, SE of Pará state. The data {{of this area}} permitted {{the discussion of the}} tectonic evolution of the gravite greenstone terrain of the Rio Maria region {{in the context of the}} Província Mineral de Carajás, SE of the Amazonian craton. The greenstone studied compose a synformal belt in the WNW-ESE direction, corresponding to one metavolcanic pile, formed predominantly by ultramafic schists (UM), basalts (BAS) and gabbros (GB) at the base, and hypabyssal dacitic rocks (DAC - ca. 2. 94 Ga, Pb/Pb) at the top. The whole was intruded by metaplutonic rocks of Mesoarchean ages, the older one being quartz diorites, followed successively by granodiorites, trondhjemites / tonalites and leucogranites. The gneissic basement (GN - outcroping toward north and recognized for having an older fabric Sn- 1 /D 1), the greenstone and the metagranitoids were intruded by hypabyssal rhyolitic (ca. 1. 60 Ga, Rb/Sr) and basic dykes at the end of the Paleoproterozoic. The greenstone presents igneous structures and textures still recognized, although obliterated near the contacts with the metagranitoids and shear zones. The ultramafics occur as tremolitites, tremolite - talc schists and talc schists; the amphibole is very elongated and thin, commonly in parallel arrays, interpreted as ghosts of spinifex textures. The basalts are massive or pillowed and frequently variolitic. They show different degrees of recrystallization, with some relicts of hyalophitic, pilotaxitic and traquitoid textures. Clinoamphibole (actinolitic hornblende), <b>epidotes</b> and plagioclase (albite - andesine) are the most abundant minerais. The gabbros may be massives to porphyritics (plagioclase phenocrysts), still with some relicts of subophitic and granophyric textures. The dacites are porphyritic, with phenocrysts of quartz and plagioclase (oligoclase), besides hornblende and mafic clots (biotite, chlorite, opaque minerais, <b>epidotes,</b> sphene, apatite) in the less evolved samples. Concerning the metagranitoids, the leucogranites and trondhjemites have chloritized biotite, whereas the granodiorites and some tonalites comprise biotite or biotite + hornblende (also in quartz diorites). The greenstone and the metagranitoids were affected by one event of heterogeneous, ductile deformation, that evolved to mylonitic zones. The structural framework of the area is marked by a planar fabric (Sn//Sm/D 2) in the WNW-ESE to E-W direction, with moderate to strong dips in a divergent fan. E-W, WNW-ESE or NW-SE stretching lineations, meso and asymmetric S-C microstructures, mica and clinoamphibole fishes, and rotation of o and i porphyroclasts indicated one megastructure resulting from a binary system with NW-SE shortening direction. The actual geometry of the greenstone would be derived from a dextral transpression, with the greenstone forming a positive flower structure. The transpressional regime favored the grow of transtensional cites and subsequent emplacement of granitic plutons on the NW contact, and extensional crenulation cleavage (Sn+ 1 /D 2) on the SW of the greenstone. Strain measurements displayed a ca. 60 % shortening, subhorizontal extension of ca. 60 to 500 % parallel to the greenstone trend, and vertical extension of ca. 101 to 280 %. The strain ellipsoid may be oblate to prolate, with changes in density and rotation of the axis of maximum stretching (X) toward the mylonitic zones. The inversion of the deformation permitted the reconstruction of the original shape of the greenstone, that would be also elongated WNW-ESE, but with lesser eccentricity than today. These data, together with the quartz petrofabric, suggested that the deformation has been accommodated by pure and simple shear mechanisms, the final framework resulting essentially from the later. The last event (D 3) are represented by faults and fractures which also affected the felsic and basic dykes. The paragenesis of the main metamorphic event (Mn/M 2) is represented by static recrystallization, which modified some textures and almost ali minerais within the greenstone. The minerais formed phases were bluish green amphibole (actinolitic hornblende), <b>epidotes,</b> sphene and quartz in BAS and GB; tremolite, talc and chlorite in UM. The metagranitoids show transformations of plagioclase (saussurite, fine white mica), amphibole (to biotite and/or sphene) and biotite (to chlorite). The coexistence of hornblende + plagioclase (An> 17) and/or actinolitic hornblende + chlorite in metabasic rocks shows that this event was of low pressures and temperatures in the transitional field of the greenschist and amphibolite facies. This episode should reflect a regional crustal heating produced by the plutonism at the end of the Mesoarchean, that obliterated the previous associations of ocean floor metamorphism. Slightly coeval to subsequently, it occurred one event of extensive dynamic recrystallization (Mm/M 2) in the greenschist facies, specially within shear zones and lithological contacts. In these places, there are evidences of fluid incoming (schistose blastomylonites and abundant quartz veins) and remobilization of chemical elements (Al, Fe, Ca, K, Na, Rb, Sr, Zr). Finally, under lower PT conditions, it occurred a less expressive event related to crenulation cleavages and forming chlorite, <b>epidotes</b> and quartz (Mn+ 1 /M 2). The M 2 event, as well as the one detected only in GN (M 1 under amphibolite facies), was of ductile nature and cleary distinguished from the last one (D 3 /M 3). The later was placed at the end of the Paleoproterozoic, being of hydrothermal character and associated to high crustal structures. The progressive evolution of the M 2 metamorphism with its thermal peak predating the deformation suggested a counterclockwise P-T-t path, corresponding to the metamorphic evolution of Phanerozoic marginal basins. Some chemical analysis of the metavolcanic rocks permitted the definition of magmatic series and a discussion of petrogenetical modeling. It was possible to recognize three geochemical series, that is, from the older to the younger, komatiitic (UM), tholeiitic (BAS and GB) and calc-alkaline (DAC). The first one corresponds to peridotitic komatiites with MgO> 18 weight % (volatile-free basis), with an enrichment trend in Al, such as in Geluk and Munro, and less calcic than the Barberton one. The light rare earth element patterns are irregular with (La/Sm) N ratios between 0. 42 and 4. 2 and negative Eu anomalies. The heavy rare earth elements seem less affected by post-eruptive processes, being plate or slightly fractionated (1. 0 quartz>hornblende>K-feldspar, with subordinated amount of biotite, magnetite, sphene, allanite and zircon. The source of the dacitic magma would be a tholeiite metamorphosed to the garnet amphibolite facies and somewhat enriched in light rare earth elements. The geodynamical model proposed admit the existence of a gneissic basement prior to 2. 96 Ga. Between 2. 96 and 2. 90 Ga, the interplay of high geothermal gradients and lithospheric extension was responsible for extensive rifting, forming marginal basin systems, where extruded the komatiitic and tholeiitic rocks. At 2. 94 (?) - 2. 90 Ga, the DAC were generated from partia' melting of oceanic crust in subduction zone settings, and evolved by low pressure fractional crystallization. The same mechanisms that generated the DAC are extended also to the calc-alkaline plutonism, this one being responsible for the structural inversion of the greenstone, crustal thickening and final shape of the granite - greenstone terrain (dextral transpression ca. 2. 88 - 2. 86 Ga). The region still suffered a late episode (end of Eoarchean, 2. 69 - 2. 50 Ga) of (re) heating, registered only in sorne mineral, without any evidente of deformation and/or metamorphism. Finally, it occurred the intrusion of felsic (1. 60 Ga, Rb/r) and basic dykes at the end of the Paleoproterozoic. The correlation with the actual understanding of the Província Mineral de Carajás permitted envisage that the Rio Maria granite - greenstone terrain was then configured at the moment of implantation of the Itacaiúnas Supergroup (ca. 2. 76 Ga) and alkaline granitic plutonism at the Serra dos Carajás. So the sinistrai transpression that inverted that supergroup would correspond to a newer event, very distinct as regards as the dextral transpression of the Rio Maria region. CAPES - Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorCNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoFINEP - Financiadora de Estudos e ProjetosEste trabalho trata da geologia e petrogênese do "greenstone belt" Identidade, situado entre as cidades de Xinguara e Rio Maria, SE do Estado do Pará. Os dados obtidos permitiram discutir a evolução geodinâmica do terreno granito - "greenstone" da região de Rio Maria, inserindo-a no contexto da Província Mineral de Carajás (PMC), SE do cráton Amazônico. O "greenstone" em lide compõe um cinturão "sinformal" direcionado WNW-ESE, correspondendo a um pacote metavulcãnico, com xistos ultramáficos (UM), basaltos (BAS) e gabros (GB) na base, e, no topo, rochas hipabissais dacíticas (DAC - ca. 2, 94 Ga, Pb/Pb). O conjunto foi intrudido por metaplutônicas Mesoarqueanas, os tipos mais precoces sendo quartzo dioríticos, seguidos sucessivamente por granodioritos (com enclaves máficos), trondhjemitos / tonalitos e leucogranitos.

60|$|I will {{describe}} the Campana of Quillota, which stands only fifteen {{miles from the}} Pacific, as an instance {{of one of these}} outlying masses. This hill is conspicuous from rising to the height of 6,400 feet: its summit shows a nucleus, uncovered for a height of 800 feet, of fine greenstone, including <b>epidote</b> and octahedral magnetic iron ore; its flanks are formed of great strata of porphyritic claystone conglomerate associated with various true porphyries and amygdaloids, alternating with thick masses of a highly feldspathic, sometimes porphyritic, pale-coloured slaty rock, with its cleavage-laminae dipping inwards at a high angle. At the base of the hill there are syenites, a granular mixture of quartz and feldspar, and harsh quartzose rocks, all belonging to the basal metamorphic series. I may observe that at the foot of several hills of this class, where the porphyries are first seen (as near S. Fernando, the Prado, Las Vacas, etc.), similar harsh quartzose rocks and granular mixtures of quartz and feldspar occur, as if the more fusible constituent parts of the granitic series had been drawn off to form the overlying porphyries.|$|E
60|$|Proceeding up the ravine, we come {{to another}} mass [R] of andesite; and beyond this, we again have a very thick, {{stratified}} porphyritic formation [S], dipping at a small angle eastward, and forming the basal part of the main Cordillera. I did not ascend the ravine any higher; but here, near Castano, I examined several sections, of which I will not give the details, only observing, that the porphyritic beds, or submarine lavas, preponderate greatly in bulk over the alternating sedimentary layers, which have been but little metamorphosed: these latter consist of fine-grained red tuffs and of whitish volcanic grit-stones, together with much of a singular, compact rock, having an almost crystalline basis, finely brecciated with red and green fragments, and occasionally including a few large pebbles. The porphyritic lavas are highly amygdaloidal, both on their upper and lower surfaces; they consist chiefly of claystone porphyry, but with one common variety, {{like some of the}} streams at the Puente del Inca, having a grey mottled basis, abounding with crystals of red hydrous oxide of iron, green ones apparently of <b>epidote,</b> and a few glassy ones of feldspar. This pile of strata differs considerably from the basal strata of the Cordillera in Central Chile, and may possibly belong to the upper and gypseous series: I saw, however, in the bed of the valley, one fragment of porphyritic breccia-conglomerate, exactly like those great masses met with in the more southern parts of Chile.|$|E
60|$|In {{several places}} in {{the lower part of}} the series, but not everywhere, thick masses of a highly feldspathic, often {{porphyritic}}, slaty rock occur interstratified with the porphyritic conglomerate; I believe in one or two cases blackish limestone has been found in a similar position. The feldspathic rock is of a pale grey or greenish colour; it is easily fusible; where porphyritic, the crystals of feldspar are generally small and vitreous: it is distinctly laminated, and sometimes includes parallel layers of <b>epidote</b> (This mineral is extremely common in all the formations of Chile; in the gneiss near Valparaiso and in the granitic veins crossing it, in the injected greenstone crowning the C. of Quillota, in some granitic porphyries, in the porphyritic conglomerate, and in the feldspathic clay-slates.); the lamination appears to be distinct from stratification. Occasionally this rock is somewhat curious; and at one spot, namely, at the C. of Quillota, it had a brecciated structure. Near the mines of Jajuel, in a thick stratum of this feldspathic, porphyritic slate, there was a layer of hard, blackish, siliceous, infusible, compact clay-slate, such as I saw nowhere else; at the same place I was able to follow for a considerable distance the junction between the slate and the conformably underlying porphyritic conglomerate, and they certainly passed gradually into each other. Wherever these slaty feldspathic rocks abound, greenstone seems common; at the C. of Quillota a bed of well-crystallised greenstone lay conformably in the midst of the feldspathic slate, with the upper and lower junctions passing insensibly into it. From this point, and from the frequently porphyritic condition of the slate, I should perhaps have considered this rock as an erupted one (like certain laminated feldspathic lavas in the trachytic series), had I not seen in Tierra del Fuego how readily true clay-slate becomes feldspathic and porphyritic, and had I not seen at Jajuel the included layer of black, siliceous clay-slate, which no one could have thought of igneous origin. The gentle passage of the feldspathic slate, at Jajuel, into the porphyritic conglomerate, which is certainly of aqueous origin, should also be taken in account.|$|E
40|$|Se estudió una sucesión sedimentaria del Pleistoceno tardío-Holoceno temprano de la Formación La Invernada, al oeste de la Sierra de Comenchigones. Con el objeto de establecer la distribución y evolución de los paleoambientes sedimentarios se realizó un análisis de facies que permitió identificar siete facies que fueron agrupadas en cuatro asociaciones de facies. La mismas son características de ambientes de abanico terminal, fluvial y eólico que respondieron al control ejercido por el clima. Se determinó la existencia de dos etapas sedimentarias diferentes: la primera etapa se caracteriza por la depositación en forma conjunta de mantos loéssicos y sistemas de abanicos terminales progradantes, bajo condiciones de clima árido a semiárido. La segunda etapa de sedimentación corresponde a un sistema fluvial de baja sinuosidad, con implantación de vegetación en los canales abandonados y en las áreas de interfluvios procesos de pedogénesis. Este paleoambiente se desarrolló bajo condiciones más frías y de mayor humedad que en el período anterior. El análisis mineralógico de la fracción arenosa indican que, a pesar de no existir variaciones composicionales mayores, hubo tres fuentes de provisión de sedimentos: rocas del basamento cristalino (orógeno de Sierras Pampeanas), volcanitas ácidas y sedimentos cenozoicos retrabajados. This work {{is aimed}} at {{analyzing}} the sedimentology and paleoenviroment of the Late Pleistoceneearly Holocene deposits outcropping along several creeks which drain the eastern foothills of the southern Sierra de Comechingones. To investigate the vertical and spatial relationships between fluvial and aeolian deposits, 18 detailed vertical sections were logged and complemented with several architectural panels and discontinuity surface tracing along 30 km in a NNW-SSE trend (Fig. 1). The facies analysis was accompanied by mineralogical characterization of the sand-sized grain fraction (0. 062 mm) and the fossil register. The climatic factors were considered to define the paleoenviromental model. The succession studied is part of La Invernada Fm (Cantú, 1992), presents a maximum thickness of 15 m and overlie discordantly over older quaternary sediments assigned to either Pampeano Fm (Frenguelli, 1955) or Conchancharava Fm (Cantú, 1992). Bones and isolated fossil pieces indicating Lujanense Mammal Age were found within the studied sediments. These fossils belong to the Pampeano and Central Domain, {{and most of them}} were interpreted to belong to browsers and grazers. The mineral constituents within the sand fraction are uniform in all deposits studied. However, in considering individual minerals, the observation of differences in the advance of weathering and morphometric properties suggest that at least two populations of minerals coexist within every sample. The light minerals, including quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and volcanogenic components (volcanic fragments) make up most of each sample (up to 98 %). Whereas heavy minerals usually appear in low concentration, they show a wide spectrum given by combinations of pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, lithoclast, garnet, apatite, turmaline, oxides, <b>epidotes,</b> and olivines. Mineral constituents reveal the existence of three sources of clastic sediments: crystalline basement rocks (Sierras Pampeanas), acid volcanic rocks, and Cenozoic recycled sediments. Seven sedimentary facies (Table 1) were identified, one of them of aeolian nature and the others related to fluvial systems. According to the characteristics observed the facies were grouped in four facies associations (AF- 1, AF- 2, AF- 3 y AF- 4). Facies association 1 (AF- 1) : constituted by facies A and B or A and C, forms lens-shaped bodies bounded by sharp erosive limits; occasionally, the limits present irregular shapes. This association has been recognized regionally, and is interpreted as channel fills which were high-energy flows rapidly loosing energy, usually known as ephemeral flows (facies A and B) and hyperconcentrated sandy flows (facies C). Sometimes, this association consists only of amalgamated units of facies C. Considered individually, each channel fill represents, thereof, either a unique event or several episodes of channelised floods under ephemeral flow conditions close to the feeder zone. Facies association 2 (AF- 2) : involves facies B, C, and E continuously covering hundreds of meters, and usually accumulates to form tabular bodies. This association is separated by erosional surfaces that define sharp limits (Photo 8). It has been interpreted to represent a system of braided channels draining the distributing zone of a terminal fan. Recurrence of events led to the stacking of units conforming tabular bodies. Facies Association 3 (AF- 3) : composed by facies E and F; constitutes tabular units, and within each of them the facies represent cycles generated under highly variable flow conditions and quick loss of energy (Photo 10). This facies association represents a distal terminal fan environment. Facies Association (AF- 4) : This includes mainly facies D y G. It normally presents a thickness ranging from 2 m to 10 m. This association locally passes to lenticular bodies of the D facies (Photo 9). The facies G corresponds to aeolian sheet deposits (loess), whereas facies D shows the presence of paleosoils formed under saturated environments in zones of impeded drainage. Spatial relationships between both facies (D and G), dissimilar lithological features found in each facies, and the particular geometric configuration of facies D, lead to infer the development of low sinuosity channels contemporary with the loess deposition. The installation of vegetation suggests the association underwent a change in the redox levels that produced the precipitation of iron carbonate and oxide, while the fluctuation of the phreatic level controlled the variations in the Eh and pH lines. The formation of hematite-rich rizhoconcretions implies that the pH value should have varied between 7 and 8 whereas the Eh line may have fluctuated within the range 0. 0 and + 0. 1. The distribution and geometry of the facies associations indicate that the paleoenvironmental evolution went through two distinct stages. The first stage is characterized by an intense aeolian aggradation process with formation of thick aeolian sheets (facies G). The lateral variation of facies associations results from the development of a terminal fan system (AF- 1, AF- 2 AF- 3) synchronously with the deposition of loess (facies G). In several columns it has been observed an upward transition from non-channeled flows to braided channels with multilateral relationships, an evidence that demonstrates the progradation of the system (Fig. 6 a, photo 11). The development of these terminal fan systems happened on a palaeosurface of low gradient (between 2 ° and 5 °E), under arid or semiarid climatic conditions, typical of extraglacier areas. The presence of fauna fossils that include big herbivores, indicates the preponderance of a semiarid regime not so rigorous, as it allowed the coexistence of browsers and grazers The second stage is represented by the AF- 4, corresponding to the implantation of a low sinuosity system, of which sectors of abandoned channels are registered (facies D), with profuse vegetal colonization and pedogenetic processes typical of poorly drained areas. The presence of a sandy fluvial system strongly fits in the loessic mantels and with a design stack architectural it suggests an amplification of the area of tributary to the system, with the incorporation of new areas sources under conditions of low generation of accommodation space. The paleoenvironmental evidences and the sandy nature of the channels included in the loessic sections, suggest changes in the sediment supplyaccommodation space relationship that can be associated with a contemporary change in the base level...|$|R
60|$|The {{prevailing}} rock is a purplish or greenish, porphyritic claystone conglomerate. The embedded fragments vary in {{size from}} mere particles to blocks as much as six or eight inches (rarely more) in diameter; in many places, where the fragments were minute, the signs of aqueous deposition were unequivocally distinct; where they were large, such evidence could rarely be detected. The basis is generally porphyritic with perfect crystals of feldspar, and resembles that of a true injected claystone porphyry: often, however, it has a mechanical or sedimentary aspect, and sometimes (as at Jajuel) is jaspery. The included fragments are either angular, or partially or quite rounded (Some of the rounded fragments in the porphyritic conglomerate near the Baths of Cauquenes, were marked with radii and concentric zones of different shades of colour: any one {{who did not know}} that pebbles, for instance flint pebbles from the chalk, are sometimes zoned concentrically with their worn and rounded surfaces, might have been led to infer, that these balls of porphyry were not true pebbles, but had originated in concretionary action.); in some parts the rounded, in others the angular fragments prevail, and usually both kinds are mixed together: hence the word BRECCIA ought strictly to be appended to the term PORPHYRITIC CONGLOMERATE. The fragments consist of many varieties of claystone porphyry, usually of nearly the same colour with the surrounding basis, namely, purplish-reddish, brownish, mottled or bright green; occasionally fragments of a laminated, pale-coloured, feldspathic rock, like altered clay-slate are included; as are sometimes grains of quartz, but only in one instance in Central Chile (namely, at the mines of Jajuel) a few pebbles of quartz. I nowhere observed mica in this formation, and rarely hornblende; where the latter mineral did occur, I was generally in doubt whether the mass really belonged to this formation, or was of intrusive origin. Calcareous spar occasionally occurs in small cavities; and nests and layers of <b>epidote</b> are common. In some few places in the finer-grained varieties (for instance, at Quillota), there were short, interrupted layers of earthy feldspar, which could be traced, exactly as at Port Desire, passing into large crystals of feldspar: I doubt, however, whether in this instance the layers had ever been separately deposited as tufaceous sediment.|$|E
60|$|The {{upper half}} of this gypseous {{formation}} is mainly formed of the same calcareous clay-shale rock, but without any gypsum, and varying extremely in nature: it passes from a soft, coarse, earthy, ferruginous state, including particles of quartz, into compact claystones with crystallised oxide of iron,--into porcellanic layers, alternating with seams of calcareous matter,--and into green porcelain-jasper, excessively hard, but easily fusible. Strata of this nature alternate with much black and brown siliceo-calcareous slate, remarkable from the wonderful number of huge embedded logs of silicified wood. This wood, according to Mr. R. Brown, is (judging from several specimens) all coniferous. Some of the layers of the black siliceous slate contained irregular angular fragments of imperfect pitchstone, which I believe, as in the Uspallata range, has originated in a metamorphic process. There was one bed of a marly tufaceous nature, and of little specific gravity. Veins of agate and calcareous spar are numerous. The whole of this gypseous formation, especially the upper half, has been injected, metamorphosed, and locally contorted by numerous hillocks of intrusive porphyries crowded together in an extraordinary manner. These hillocks consist of purple claystone and of various other porphyries, and of much white feldspathic greenstone passing into andesite; this latter variety included in one case crystals of orthitic and albitic feldspar touching each other, and others of hornblende, chlorite, and <b>epidote.</b> The strata surrounding these intrusive hillocks at the mines of Los Hornos, are intersected by many veins of copper-pyrites, associated with much micaceous iron-ore, and by some of gold: in the neighbourhood of these veins the rocks are blackened and much altered. The gypsum near the intrusive masses is always opaque. One of these hillocks of porphyry was capped by some stratified porphyritic conglomerate, which must have been brought up from below, through the whole immense thickness of the overlying gypseous formation. The lower beds of the gypseous formation resemble the corresponding and probably contemporaneous strata of the main Cordillera; whilst the upper beds in several respects resemble those of the Uspallata chain, and possibly may be contemporaneous with them; for I have endeavoured {{to show that the}} Uspallata beds were accumulated subsequently to the gypseous or Neocomian formations of the Cordillera.|$|E
