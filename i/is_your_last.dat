2500|$|... {{and from}} the Gospel of Luke, {{the parable of the}} Rich man and Lazarus (...) [...] The text is based on Johann Rist's hymn in 16 stanzas [...] "", using 12 of the stanzas. The hymn, {{reflecting}} death and eternity, is well suited to match the parable of the rich man who has to face death and hell. It is subtitled [...] "" [...] (A Serious Consideration of Endless Eternity). The text of three stanzas is kept unchanged, 1, 8 and 12, used for movements 1, 7 and 11. An unknown author rephrased the other stanzas of the chorale to recitatives and arias, generally alternating and using one stanza for one cantata movement. The poet combined two stanzas, 4 and 5, to form movement 4. He used the lines [...] "" [...] (Perhaps this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> day, no one knows when he might die) from stanza 9 in movement 9 which is otherwise based on stanza 10. In movement 10 he inserted a hint at the Gospel. In general, he stays close to the text, which is characteristic for the early cantatas in Bach's second annual cycle. The poet was possibly Andreas Stübel, who died in 1725, a possible explanation why Bach did not complete the full cycle, but ended on Palm Sunday.|$|E
2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
2500|$|While many of O'Brien's {{professional}} advisors {{and managers}} {{pushed for the}} Fox deal, O'Brien's desire to one day perhaps take over The Tonight Show after Leno made it a difficult decision (O'Brien, like many baby-boomer comedians, had grown up idolizing Carson's incarnation). Chernin warned O'Brien that waiting around for Leno to leave would be [...] "only an invitation to long-term disappointment, and potentially a path toward undermining a promising career." [...] Nevertheless, O'Brien signed the deal with NBC in March 2002; the contract extended him through 2005 and most significantly contained an [...] "explicit Prince of Wales clause" [...] that solidified the official line of succession: If anything were to happen to Leno, O'Brien would step in. O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards [...] "sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of The Tonight Show. Facing the prospect of attempting to keep both Leno and O'Brien, Zucker made the final call on Leno's deal: [...] "Yes, we’ll extend your deal. But this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> contract. Time {{to hand over the}} keys." [...] The plan would extend Leno four additional years, after which he would give The Tonight Show to O'Brien.|$|E
