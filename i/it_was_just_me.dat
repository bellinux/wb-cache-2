Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that looks {{a little bit like a}} mundane government building. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> as well, with four static cameras and all the sensors." ...|$|E
40|$|I have {{to admit}} that writing this {{editorial}} has been especially difficult. There are a number of reasons for the difficulty, but foremost was my feeling that I needed to be positive and uplifting, offering hope for environmental sanity and biodiversity conservation. Unfortunately, I found this very limiting and every effort at writing seemed to sink into another diatribe of ?gloom and doom?. I hope <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and not a true reflection of the State of the Environment in the Pacific. After all, there is much to be thankful for...|$|R

Maybe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>me,</b> but <b>it</b> seems only a short time ago people were caught up in the excitement of the new millennium and all that this would bring for them personally and also what type of society we would be living in.

2500|$|After much thought, I {{decided to}} take this way out. It took more thought than anyone can think possible. It started about a week ago, when I {{began to think of}} a {{way to get out of}} this. Running away would not do any good, the police would find me where ever I went and would bring me back to it all. No, Mother and Daddy are not to blame, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> If I had done what they told to do this would have never happened. Studying instead of playing around, going out with the people in my age group instead of staying home and dreaming...." ...|$|R
500|$|Describing the song's {{origins in}} an {{interview}} with National Public Radio (NPR), Shields said that the writing and recording of [...] "City Girl" [...] was [...] "very simple, in the sense that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> teaching Brian the chord structure and Brian just jamming along to it." [...] The duo recorded an instrumental rehearsal version of the song, after which Shields said there was [...] "no point in rerecording it." [...] He later wrote lyrics and recorded vocals for the song but emphasised that {{there was no need for}} [...] "elaborations [...] overdubs." [...] Shields described this method of recording as a [...] "slapdash approach", noting that there was no [...] "point in labouring over something … because you don't know what's going to work".|$|E
2500|$|Later, of his {{performance}} that series, Payton said [...] "You’ve {{got to get}} back at Jordan, you can’t back down on him. If you do, he's like a wolf, he's going to eat everything. He knew I wasn’t going to back down. I had to realize or see if he is really about being a dog, about this neighborhood stuff. I went at him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> being me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{many have}} assumed that EPMD {{produced}} the music on the album because of their executive production credit, Weston stated [...] "in the studio back then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me,</b> Skoob, Chris, and Derek, and that was it. EPMD didn't produce us, we were just with their production company. A lot of people forget that." [...] Weston referred to Charity, {{who died in the}} year 2000, as [...] "the brains of the operation, definitely... He was definitely the boss and the real executive producer of the first album. We'd have meetings at his crib in Brooklyn and he was running things." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the March {{issue of}} Golf World (UK) in 2008, Poulter was quoted saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I really respect every {{professional}} golfer, but I know I haven't played to my full potential {{and when that}} happens, <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and Tiger." ...|$|R

2500|$|Snow Patrol {{was one of}} {{the acts}} at the iTunes Festival, which was held {{throughout}} July. The band played on 5 July, and was the co-headlining act for the day. The performance was released as a digital EP on the iTunes Store as [...] The band later co-headlined Oxegen 2009 in July along with newly re-formed Blur.

After the band's concert at the Street Gig in Dettenheim, lead singer Gary Lightbody broke a rib in a go-karting accident. Lightbody was livid with himself: [...] "I had my very best idiot trousers on in Germany at the Street gig and we did a go-kart track in Dettenheim. I did say beforehand that I shouldn’t go on them as firstly I shouldn't be in charge of anything that can go over 20miles an hour and secondly I am the most accident-prone idiot in the western world. Did I heed my own advice? Did I fuck! So on I went and crash after crash later; finishing on a particularly nasty one that put took me to hospital where I discovered I have a broken rib. Sweet." [...] He made a full recovery and resumed touring in a few days. Months later, in October 2009, Lightbody revealed the [...] "truth" [...] behind his crash, admitting that he can't drive. He went on the explain the exact details of what had happened: [...] "At the very last corner, I skidded to miss Jonny (Quinn) and I smashed {{into the side of the}} wall and actually came out of the go-kart. It was hilarious - for everyone who was watching. Everyone thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> being me, 'Ah...leave him, he's fine.' But, an hour later, I was in hospital. It was good actually having a real injury rather than all the ones I make up in my head." [...] He also admitted his bandmates didn't believe he was actually hurt, as he was a [...] "drama queen".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Windy City Media Group, Stefani said [...] " [...] was so perfect for my story-for what I was feeling in my own personal life-that I didn't even get it as a feminist anthem. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> about <b>me!</b> I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> feeling me."

5000|$|Jim Walker (2007): “At The Manor {{we wanted}} a live drum sound, {{and so we had}} to use the old billiard room. It was set up so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and Rotten eye to eye, as I drummed and he sang.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Mallman {{wanted to}} build on his 78.6 hour “Marathon 3” {{performance}} but believed he was reaching the limit {{of what could be}} accomplished in a conventional performance and venue. “I had to abandon my body at a certain point, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> holding <b>me</b> back.” Initially he drew plans for a machine that would move his arms up and down mechanically before moving on to focus on generating sounds from his body’s involuntary systems. “For me, it’s about exploring the back of the mind in music.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just so. I'm afraid <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Only, <b>just</b> let <b>me</b> {{see if she}} is all right. Ay!' and then, after a gaze, a fond {{touch or}} two, an irrepressible sigh strangled in the midst, 'lock her up again! You ain't by any chance going home to-morrow?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... There {{was a big}} applause, then he took me over to the piano. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and him. Elvis wasn't looking too good.

[...] Indeed, I knew it well, one of those ballads that just about {{everyone}} had a crack at in the sixties." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the 2014 {{election}} campaign, Seymour {{released a}} campaign video online which Seymour and the Act party have described as going viral after it received around 35,000 views.

5000|$|He {{said his}} {{sexuality}} should not prevent him becoming leader, saying, [...] "It {{would be very}} sad if people who have always been single or who are homosexual felt that their sexuality prevented them from holding high office. I hope that my party and {{the great majority of}} the British public would agree with that... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> There <b>are</b> lots of people who have tried to keep their private lives private.

5000|$|Artist Jim Mooney once recalled, She was wonderful! You’d go to DC and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a business-like {{thing and}} I'd {{come out of}} there and I'd feel, 'Oh, God, I need a drink'. {{laughter}} I'd go to Marvel and I'd come in and Flo would say, 'Hello, Jim!

30|$|I {{felt like}} they <b>were</b> there <b>just</b> to teach us what we were {{supposed}} to know and if we didn’t grasp it then it wasn’t their problem.

5000|$|The song is {{underscored by}} moody strings and its lyrics about acting numb to prevent {{emotional}} pain. Björk wrote {{it from the}} main character's point of view: [...] "In the film, he had a girlfriend who just {{wanted him to be}} happy and in love and he just couldn't get his head around it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> trying to imagine what he would say to her.

5000|$|Richard Wright: Great Gig in the Sky? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> {{playing in}} the studio, playing some chords, and {{probably}} Dave or Roger saying [...] "Hmm&hellip; that sounds nice.

So then I wrote the music for that, {{and then there was a}} middle bit, with Clare Torry singing, that fantastic voice. We wanted something for that bit, and she came in and sang on it.|$|E
5000|$|Andrews {{considers}} himself primarily a guitar player, but Kelly {{told him he}} did not want any guitar in the movie. So, Andrews taught himself to play piano. It {{is part of the reason}} that the score is, as Andrews describes, so simple. [...] "The film was pretty low budget so my portion of the money was pretty thin. I couldn't hire anyone, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> I played everything; piano, mellotron, mini marimba, xylophone, ukulele, organ. I also brought in two female vocalists Sam Shelton and Tori Haberman." [...] "In a way," [...] he says, [...] "your faults become your trademark." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mitchell & Ness almost went {{bankrupt}} in 1983. Owner Peter Capolino told the Detroit Free Press, [...] "By 1983 all the expansion I had done {{had gone to}} hell.
