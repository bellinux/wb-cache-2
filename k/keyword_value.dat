40|$|We discuss two semi-independent {{calibration}} {{techniques used}} to determine the inflight radiometric calibration for the New Horizons Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC). The first calibration technique compares the measured number of counts (DN) observed from a number of well calibrated stars to those predicted using the component-level calibration. The ratio of these values provides a multiplicative factor that allows a conversation between the preflight calibration to the more accurate inflight one, for each detector. The second calibration technique is a channel-wise relative radiometric calibration for MVIC's blue, near-infrared and methane color channels using Hubble and New Horizons observations of Charon and scaling from the red channel stellar calibration. Both calibration techniques produce very similar results (better than 7 % agreement), providing strong validation for the techniques used. Since the stellar calibration described here can be performed without a color target in the field of view and covers all of MVIC's detectors, this calibration was used to provide the radiometric <b>keyword</b> <b>values</b> delivered by the New Horizons project to the Planetary Data System (PDS). These <b>keyword</b> <b>values</b> allow each observation to be converted from counts to physical units; a description of how these <b>keyword</b> <b>values</b> were generated is included.

40|$|One of the {{important}} challenges faced by designers of online communities is eliciting sufficent contributions from community members. Users in online communities may have difficulty either in finding opportunities to add value, or in understanding {{the value of their}} contributions to the community. Various social science theories suggest that showing users different perspectives on the value they add to the community will lead to differing amounts of contribution. The present study investigates a design augmentation for an existing community Web site that could benefit from additional contribution. The augmented interface includes individualized opportunities for contribution and an estimate of the value of each contribution to the community. The value is computed in one of four different ways: (1) value to self; (2) value to a small group the user has affinity with; (3) value to a small group the user does not have affinity with; and (4) value to the entire user community. The study compares the effectiveness of the different notions of value to 160 community members. Author <b>Keywords</b> <b>Value</b> of contributions, recommender systems, identity...|$|R

40|$|Questions {{of human}} values often arise in HCI {{research}} and practice. Such {{questions can be}} difficult to address well, and a principled approach can clarify issues of both theory and practice. One such approach is Value Sensitive Design (VSD), an established theory and method for addressing issues of values in a systematic and principled fashion in the design of information technology. In this essay, we suggest however that the theory and at times the presentation of VSD overclaims in a number of key respects, with the result of inhibiting its more widespread adoption and appropriation. We address these issues by suggesting four topics for next steps in the evolution of VSD: (1) tempering VSD’s position on universal values; (2) contextualizing existing and future lists of values that are presented as heuristics for consideration; (3) strengthening the voice of the participants in publications describing VSD investigations; and (4) making clearer the voice of the researchers. We propose new or altered approaches for VSD that address these issues of theory, voice, and reportage.

The difference between average monthly returns was significant during all tested time periods and market situations using both long-only and long/short portfolios. The newly introduced FCF profitable value strategy proved to be a better predictor of future stock returns than the profitable value strategy. The FCF profitable value strategy presents also an improvement over the FCF yield strategy.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and describe the perceived value drivers (benefits and sacrifices) in outsourced service provision in public transportation. The authors focus on the suppliers’ perception of value creation for customers and value creation in a business-to-business relationship. Design/methodology/approach – In-depth interviews are conducted with 26 managers and employees participating in a business-to-business relationship concerning what create value following the critical incident technique. Findings – The results show that perceived benefits and sacrifices are related to the product, the service and the relationship. In addition, there are certain prerequisites in the public transportation system that inhibit value creation, and much value is destroyed in the business relationships before it reaches the passengers. Research limitations/implications – This paper reveals a need to find new quality strategies for the improvement and assurance of value creation in outsourced service provision. The value drivers identified originate from the suppliers’ view. Practical implications – Managers should acquire knowledge regarding the value they create or destroy, both within their organisation and in their business network, and thus ultimately for their customers. Moreover, drivers that destroy value should be identified, measured, analysed, and managed. Originality/value – The paper contributes to a better understanding of the difficulties in creating value when service provision has been outsourced. <b>Keywords</b> <b>Value</b> analysis, Outsourcing, Transportation, Quality management Paper type Research pape...|$|R
40|$|Attributing {{a dollar}} <b>value</b> to a <b>keyword</b> is an {{essential}} part of running any profitable search engine advertising campaign. When an advertiser has complete control over the interaction with and monetization of each user arriving on a given <b>keyword,</b> the <b>value</b> of that term can be accurately tracked. However, in many instances, the advertiser may monetize arrivals indirectly through one or more third parties. In such cases, it is typical for the third party to provide only coarse-grained reporting: rather than report each monetization event, users are aggregated into larger channels and the third party reports aggregate information such as total daily revenue for each channel. Examples of third parties that use channels include Amazon and Google AdSense. In such scenarios, the number of channels is generally much smaller than the number of <b>keywords</b> whose <b>value</b> per click (VPC) we wish to learn. However, the advertiser has flexibility as to how to assign keywords to channels over time. We introduce the channelization problem: how do we adaptively assign keywords to channels over the course of multiple days to quickly obtain accurate VPC estimates of all keywords? We relate this problem to classical results in weighing design, devise new adaptive algorithms for this problem, and quantify the performance of these algorithms experimentally. Our results demonstrate that adaptive weighing designs that exploit statistics of ter...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} role played by a {{voluntary}} professional association as a carrier of mimetic and normative institutional pressures in the institutionalization of new governance practices among family businesses. They observe how a change in guiding values within family businesses is led by an institutional champion actively involved in the professional association. This institutional champion bridges the gap between micro-level change at the firm level and the professional association’s macro-level discourse. This study makes several contributions to both family business research and institutional theory. <b>Keywords</b> <b>values,</b> family business, institutional theory, professional associations, institutional champion There seems to be growing awareness and agreement that family firms constitute a unique form of business organization (Zahra & Sharma, 2004). Recent argu-ments suggest an increasing institutionalization of the family business. Mimetic, coercive, and normative forces (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Scott, 2001) are pressuring family businesses to become similar to one another, for instance, through the adoption of spe-cific governance structures, processes, and policies (Melin & Nordqvist, 2007). It follows that the family business can be considered a special form of business organization subject to similar forces, constituting an “organizational field, ” that is, a recognized area of insti-tutional life (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983).

This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{construct}} composite index, which is a linear combination of several variables, by deriving weights on the criterion of Shapley value (from cooperative game theory) that a constituent variable has in making the composite index.   In practice it is found oftentimes that the most common method of principal component analysis {{has a tendency to}} ignore (or poorly weigh) those constituent variables that do not have strong correlation with the sister variables. This elitist nature of PCA forces a compromise upon the analyst’s desire and need to incorporate those weakly correlated (but theoretically and practically important) variables into the composite index. In that case, one must construct a composite index that is more inclusive in nature. The Shapley value based composite index meets that requirement. <b>Keywords.</b> Shapley <b>value,</b> Composite index, Principal Component Analysis, Inclusive indices, Global optimization. JEL.
