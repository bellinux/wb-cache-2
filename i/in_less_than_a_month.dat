5|$|<b>In</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> the Japanese {{repaired}} {{the causeway}} and invaded the Singapore island easily. Soon {{after the war}} ended in 1946, the town became the main hotspot for Malay nationalism in Malaya. Onn Jaafar, a local Malay politician who later became the Chief Minister of Johor, formed the United Malay National Organisation party on 11 May 1946 when the Malays expressed their widespread disenchantment over the British government's action for granting citizenship laws to non-Malays in the proposed states of the Malayan Union. An agreement over the policy was then reached in the town with Malays agreeing with the dominance of economy by the non-Malays and the Malays' dominance in political matters being agreed upon by non-Malays. Racial conflict between the Malay and non-Malays, especially the Chinese, is being provoked continuously since the Malayan Emergency.|$|E

5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, {{she will}} lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, {{from a few}} hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can {{have as many as}} four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E

5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now founded as id Software, {{used some of}} these games to {{prototype}} ideas for their own games, including in late spring of 1991 Keen Dreams, which they used to develop new systems for their next set of major episodes of the series. They did not initially {{want to do a}} Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping to improve the next full set of games for Apogee. The team reprised their roles from the first game, and prototyped an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. Once the parallax scrolling and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> even as the team simultaneously worked on another game.|$|E
