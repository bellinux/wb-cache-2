25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to be able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one <b>is</b> <b>counting</b> persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E
500|$|When Brady Hoke {{took over}} as Michigan head coach for the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS {{football}} season, Kovacs impressed him quickly. Kovacs {{was one of the}} first five players named as a starter for the 2011 team. In the September 3, 2011 season opener against Western Michigan at Michigan Stadium, Kovacs forced a fumble that was recovered and advanced for a touchdown. Although the game was ended by mutual agreement in the third quarter due to inclement weather, Kovacs recorded 10 tackles, including two sacks. He was named the Lott Trophy impact player of the week. [...] At first, the stats for the game were considered official by the Big Ten Conference and the University of Michigan, but the NCAA has vacated the statistics for this game because three quarters were not completed. However, at the conclusion of the regular season, the NCAA reversed course and ruled that since the game <b>is</b> <b>counting</b> for win-loss record, the statistics will be counted by the NCAA. On September 10, against Notre Dame, during the first night game ever played at Michigan Stadium, he talied an interception, and eight tackles. [...] When it became evident that the defense had improved markedly from the prior season, he and fellow safety Thomas Gordon were credited as being the [...] "leaders of the defense". [...] On October 8, against Northwestern, Kovacs posted two solo tackles for a loss, both on fourth down. Kovacs suffered a knee injury that sidelined him for the October 29 game against Purdue. Kovacs had been one of twenty quarterfinalists for the Lott impact player of the year. Kovacs was named as one of 10 semifinalists for the 2011 Burlsworth Trophy on November 22. Following the 2011 Big Ten Conference football season, he earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention recognition from the media and was selected as the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award recipient for the Michigan program. Kovacs earned 2011 Fall Academic All-Big Ten recognition along with 10 teammates. In the January 3, 2012 Sugar Bowl 23–20 overtime victory against Virginia Tech, he led the team with 11 tackles. Kovacs finished among the conference leaders in several statistics: sacks/game (.33, 17th), tackles/game (6.2, 30th) and fumbles forced/game (.17, t-9th).|$|E
