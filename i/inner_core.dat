5|$|The {{center of}} {{circulation}} emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that morning. Passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation, {{and it had}} weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h). However, several hours over the warm waters of the western Gulf provided the energy needed for Emily to regenerate, and by midnight wind speeds were increasing. The increase in wind speed stalled, but the storm continued to become better organized. Emily started to show very symmetrical outflow, but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center. However, the outer wind radii subsided in the end, and the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> prevailed. The result was a rapid strengthening of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> {{on the evening of}} July19. The pressure dropped about 30millibars and the winds went from 90mph (145km/h) to more than 125mph (200km/h), all within a few hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> may be {{expected}} to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other heavy elements. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing. Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which may end the {{growth of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the magnetic field of the Earth will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years. The loss of the magnetosphere will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly hydrogen, from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life.|$|E
40|$|The flow {{environment}} in <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> of water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) microfluidic double emulsions {{has a significant}} impact on industrial applications of such systems. For example, in the case of shear sensitive cells compartmentalised in the cores, high shear conditions may be deleterious. This study reports on the flow characteristics of w/o/w <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> in comparison to those in single water-in-oil (w/o) microdroplets of equal size moving in the same microchannel, resolved by means of micro-particle image velocimetry (??PIV). The multiphase flow system employed in the study had a viscosity ratio, ??, between aqueous and oil phase of the order of unity (?? = 0. 78) and both single droplets and <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> of double emulsions filled the channel. This configuration resulted in a weak recirculating flow inside the w/o single droplet: the measured flow field exhibited a uniform low velocity flow field in the central region surrounded by small regions of reversed flow near the channel walls. This flow topology was maintained in the <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> of w/o/w double emulsions for intermediate capillary numbers (Ca) ranging from 10 ??? 3 to 10 ??? 2, and core morphologies varying from large plugs to pancake cores. The core morphology affected the magnitude and distribution of the velocity in the droplets. The similarity in the flow topology resulted from the fact that <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> were located {{at the back of the}} outer droplet in such a way that inner and outer interfaces were in contact for over half of core surface area and separated only by a thin lubricating film. Both single droplets and <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> exhibited a narrow shear rate distribution characterised by small regions of maximum shear confined near the channel walls. Shear rate magnitude values were found to be an order of magnitude lower than those in the channel and hence capable of reducing stresses in flow cytometry to far below reported values for cell damage. Hence, it can be concluded that double emulsions are suitable candidates to substitute single droplets in flow cytometry to protect the screened items and are compatible with the commercial flow cytometry systems...|$|R

5|$|From September 9 to September 11, Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm only to regain hurricane intensity three more times; during this time it moved very slowly and erratically in a northeasterly direction. The NHC continued to struggle to predict Ophelia, with the forecasts generally calling for a landfall {{on the east coast}} of the United States. The forecasters indicated there was a possibility that Ophelia could strengthen further to Category 3 strength, though they felt this was unlikely. On September 12, the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards North Carolina, while still moving only slowly and fitfully. It dropped below hurricane strength again when the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> of convection collapsed, possibly due to passing over cooler water that it upwelled earlier in its track. Ophelia then regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. After the collapse of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> of convection, the hurricane acquired an unusually large eye over 115miles (185km) across and soon reached its peak strength with 85mph (140km/h) winds. The northern and western eyewall passed over the coastal areas of North Carolina throughout September 14–15, but the strongest winds remained offshore.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
40|$|A facile {{approach}} of forming stable polymeric complexes by the two-stage phase transition of the graft copolymer comprising poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) as the backbone and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) as the grafts in water was illustrated. Rather loose and hydrated polymeric aggregates with a characteristic hydrophobic multicore structure, {{achieved by the}} first-stage thermally induced phase transition of PNIPAAm grafts, underwent the core structure rearrangement (including multicore fragmentation and fusion) upon the second-stage dehydration of mPEG grafts at 90 degrees C. This was followed by hydrogen-bond pairings of mPEG and PNIPAAm chain segments with unionized AAc residues acting as an effective protective shell against potential hydration of the hydrophobic <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> during the annealing process. The polymer complexes thus obtained show surprisingly enhanced hydrophobicity of <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> at 25 degrees C in water and excellent stability of the morphological structure {{in response to the}} temperature disturbance.

Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5–6feet (1.4–1.8m), with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet (5.5m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35feet (10.5m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800feet (250m) inland.

5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify.

5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4.

Due to land interaction with Oman, the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6.

40|$|Abstract The {{efficacy}} of applications of water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsions moving in microchannels is significantly {{impacted by the}} flow conditions in the <b>inner</b> aqueous <b>cores.</b> For example {{in the case of}} shear sensitive cells transported in the cores, high shear conditions may be deleterious. This study reports on the flow topology inside w/o/w cores determined by means of micro-particle image velocimetry (μPIV) and compares it to the flow in single water-in-oil (w/o) microdroplets with equal sizes moving in a rectangular microchannel. The multiphase flow system employed in the study had a viscosity ratio, λ, between oil and aqueous phase of the order of unity (λ = 0. 8) and both single and compound droplets filled the channels. This configuration resulted in a weak recirculating flow inside the w/o single droplet: the measured flow field exhibited a uniform low velocity flow field in the central region surrounded by small regions of reversed flow near the channel walls.

40|$|At {{semiarid}} Charters Towers, north Queensland, Australia, {{the importance}} of Aedes aegypti (L.) in wells was assessed {{in relation to the}} colonization of surface habitats during the wet season. From April to July 1999, 10 wells (five positive for Ae. aegypti) were monitored to assess their status and larvae population numbers therein. All surface containers located within a 100 m radius of each well were removed, treated with s-methoprene or sealed to prevent the utilization of these containers by mosquitoes. These <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> were surrounded by outer zones for a further 100 m in which surface containers were left untreated but all subterranean habitats were treated. Ovitraps were monitored monthly in the <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> for 36 wk from August 1999 to April 2000 and differences in the proportions of ovitraps positive for Ae. aegypti and Ochlerotatus notoscriptus (Skuse) were analyzed by logistic regression. Analysis of the proportions of ovitraps positive for Ae. aegypti near positive wells indicated significantly greater colonization from November to March (the wet season), compared with those situated near Ae. aegypti negative wells. As Oc. notoscriptus were not produced from subterranean sites, comparisons of the proportions of ovitraps positive for Oc. notoscriptus in positive and negative <b>inner</b> <b>cores</b> provided an indication of the relative productivity of the uncontrolled surface containers in the outer zones. Differences in the utililization of ovitraps by Oc. notoscriptus among positive and negative cores were observed during only one month (March), when oviposition was greater in ovitraps in the negative cores, compared with the positive cores. Best subsets linear regression analysis of the proportion of ovitraps positive for Ae. aegypti against meteorological variables (rainfall, mean wind speed, mean relative humidity, mean minimum, and maximum temperature) during the week of ovitrapping indicated that minimum temperature and wind speed accounted for 63. 4 % of the variability. This study confirms that for semiarid towns such as Charters Towers, the practice of treating {{a relatively small number of}} key subterranean habitats during winter will significantly affect Ae. aegypti recolonization of surface container habitats during summer, the period of greatest risk for dengue...|$|R
