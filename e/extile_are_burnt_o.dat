40|$|To {{reduce the}} massive CO 2 {{emission}} from coal-fired power plants, oxy-fuel combustion {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most effective and promising technologies to fulfil this goal. In this process, coal <b>is</b> <b>burnt</b> in pure <b>O</b> 2 rather than air. So, the resultant flue gas is mainly CO 2 and H 2 O, making subsequent CO 2 capture and sequestration feasible. Unfortunately, the CO 2 gas has been found to be very corrosive to the steels of the critical heat exchanging components in boilers, resulting in severe oxidation and carburisation degradation. In addition, increased operation temperatures to improve boiler heat efficiency becomes necessary to meet continuously increasing energy demand, e. g. in advanced ultra-supercritical power generation. Under these circumstances, nickel-based alloys should be considered as alternative candidate materials owing to their superior creep strength and corrosion resistance at higher temperatures, compared with iron-based alloys. However, little is known about the corrosion behaviour of Ni-based alloys in CO 2 -rich gases at high temperatures associated with oxy-fuel technology. This paper investigated the effect of temperature on corrosion of model Ni-Cr binary alloys of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 wt% in Ar- 20 vol. % CO 2 gas at 650, 700 and 800 oC...|$|R

5000|$|In February 1481, {{in what is}} said to be {{the first}} auto-da-fé, six Marranos <b>were</b> <b>burnt</b> alive in Seville.

Not all Maranos executed by being burnt at the stake seem to have <b>been</b> <b>burnt</b> alive. If the Jew [...] "confessed his heresy", the Church would show mercy, and he would be strangled prior to the burning. Autos-da-fé against Maranos extended beyond the Spanish heartland. In Sicily, in 1511-15, 79 <b>were</b> <b>burnt</b> at the stake, while from 1511 to 1560, 441 Maranos were condemned to be burned alive. In Spanish American colonies, autos-da-fé were held as well.
