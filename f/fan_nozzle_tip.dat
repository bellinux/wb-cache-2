40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center {{recently}} completed an experimental study {{to reduce the}} jet noise from modern turbofan engines. The study concentrated on exhaust nozzle designs for high-bypass-ratio engines. These designs modified the core and <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> individually and simultaneously. Several designs provided an ideal jet noise reduction of over 2. 5 EPNdB for the effective perceived noise level (EPNL) metric. Noise data, after correcting for takeoff thrust losses, indicated over a 2. 0 -EPNdB reduction for nine designs. Individually modifying the <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> did not provide attractive EPNL reductions. Designs in which only the core nozzle was modified provided greater EPNL reductions. Designs in which core and <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> were modified simultaneously provided the greatest EPNL reduction.

A spray pyrolysis system was specially designed and built for this study. The influence of <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size on {{the properties of the}} produced powder was examined. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size was 1 mm, the particle size distribution was more uniform than when other <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> sizes were used and the average particle size of the powder was about 15 nm. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size increases to 2 mm, the average particle size increases to roughly 20 nm, and the particle size distribution becomes more uneven. When the tip size increases to 3 mm, particles with an average size of 25 nm and equal to or less than 10 nm coexist and the particle size distribution becomes much more uneven. When the tip size increases to 5 mm, large particles with average size of 50 nm partially exist, mostly consisting of minute particles with average sizes in the range of 15 ~ 25 nm. When the tip size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm, the XRD peak intensities greatly increase while the specific surface area decreases.

The design is based on the theories of gas dynamics and the aim is to convert the potential energy of high stagnation gas pressure into effective kinetic energy such that a high momentum gas jet with uniform and tidy boundary could be obtained. The designed supersonic nozzle consisted of four sections: stable, convergent, throat and divergent. Each of these sections are designed strictly based on gas dynamic theories. The behavior of the exit jet and the distance of normal shock under condition of stagnation gas pressure ranging from 4 to 16 bar were investigated by computer simulation. The behavior of the exit jet in boundaryless condition as well as in slots of controlled dimensions were observed by Shadowgraphy.

The main objective of this thesis to perform a computational study of pure gasoline fuel sprays structure development where it covers to parts; to determine the pure gasoline fuel spray angle and spray penetration depth characteristics using sing-hole port fuel injector (PFI) and to determine the impact of different injection pressure on the spray structure of pure gasoline fuel. The spray simulations are done completely by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ANSYS CFX software with three <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter; 0. 2 mm, 0. 3 mm and 0. 4 mm. The Computational Aided Design (CAD) model for each nozzle was drawn using the SolidWorks software, the nozzle is attached with 110 mm bore and 125 mm stroke combustion chamber. In the ANSYS CFX software, the ready CAD model is imported into the design modeler and under goes meshing process with fine relevance center, 4 m min size, 4 m max face size and 8 m max size. There are three types of boundary conditions applied to the meshed geometry model, the first is inlet boundary condition with various injection pressure of 100 bar, 150 bar, 200 bar and 250 bar. Opening boundary condition is then place at the combustion chamber with atmospheric pressure value that is 101325 Pa and the third boundary condition is wall. The iteration calculation is solved until the convergence approached to the desired residual value {{and the result is}} obtained and analyzed. The first comparison made is between penetration depth versus injection pressure and the other is between spray angle versus injection pressure, the results are then compared between nozzle diameter for each injection pressure. The results show that as the injection pressure increased, the penetration depth is also increased as well as the spray angle.

40|$|Gas {{atomization}} process, especially Closed Coupled Gas Atomization (CCGA) is a {{very efficient}} processing method to produce ultra fine, spherodised metal powders. In this process, the high-pressure gas jet is used to disintegrate the molten metal stream in to the spherical powders. Due to hydrodynamic and thermal interaction between high-pressure gas jet and molten metal stream especially near melt delivery nozzle, this technique is very complex and challenging for atomization industries. Melt delivery nozzle design {{is one of the}} key factors to control powders properties. The optical Schlieren technique and analogue water atomizer along with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical methods are practical methods for observing the single or two-phase flow of gas-metal interaction during CCGA.

This prototype exploits the potential of smart materials to significantly improve the performance of existing aircraft engines by introducing new inherent capabilities for shape control, vibration damping, noise reduction, health monitoring, and flow manipulation. The novel design employs two different smart materials, a shape-memory alloy and magnetorheological fluids, to reduce the nozzle area by up to 30 percent. The prototype of the variable-area <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> implements an overlapping spring leaf assembly to simplify the initial design and to provide ease of structural control. A single bundle of shape memory alloy wire actuators is used to reduce the nozzle geometry. The nozzle is subsequently held in the reduced-area configuration by using magnetorheological fluid brakes. This prototype uses the inherent advantages of shape memory alloys in providing large induced strains and of magnetorheological fluids in generating large resistive forces. In addition, the spring leaf design also functions as a return spring, once the magnetorheological fluid brakes are released, to help force the shape memory alloy wires to return to their original position. A computerized real-time control system uses the derivative-gain and proportional-gain algorithms to operate the system. This design represents a novel approach to the active control of high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines.

Moreover, the application of this technology showed higher efficiency on fall armyworm control, reaching a 100 % level 15 days after spraying, in the V 10 growth stage of the plants. The hollow cone nozzle increased the spray deposit level on the corn plants compared with the flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle,</b> at growth stage V 4. However, the flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle,</b> combined with air assistance technology, was more effective for controlling fall armyworm in the same growth stage (V 4), although the hollow cone nozzle increased the deposit levels on the plants. All the technologies tested in the study promoted a reduction of plant damage from fall armyworm attack. Corn productivity {{is directly related to}} the control efficiency of fall armyworm...|$|R
