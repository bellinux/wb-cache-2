The recorded potentials represent the differences in voltage between the active and reference electrodes. The ground electrode serves as zero.

50|$|Corrosion is a {{major issue}} with neural {{electrode}}s. Corrosion can occur because electrode metals are placed in an electrolytic solution, where the presence of current can either increase the rate of corrosion mechanisms or overcome limiting activation energies. Redox reactions are a mechanism of corrosion {{that can lead to}} dissolution of ions from the electrode surface. There is a base level of metal ions in tissue, however, when these levels increase beyond threshold values the ions become toxic and can cause severe health problems. In addition, the fidelity of the electrode system can be compromised. Knowing the impedance of an electrode is important whether the electrode is used for stimulation or recording. When degradation of the electrode surface occurs because of corrosion, the surface area increases with its roughness. Calculating a new <b>electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> to compensate for the change in surface area once implanted it is not easy. This computational flaw can skew data from recording or pose a dangerous obstacle limiting safe stimulation.|$|E
50|$|One {{conducting}} polymer coating that has shown promising results {{for improving the}} performance of neural electrodes is polypyrrole (PPy). Polypyrrole has great biocompatibility and conductive properties, {{which makes it a}} good option for the use in neural electrodes. PPy has been shown to have a good interaction with biological tissues. This is due to the boundary it creates between the hard electrode and the soft tissue. PPy has been shown to support cell adhesion and growth of a number of different cell types including primary neurons which is important in neural implants. PPy also decreases the impedance of the electrode system by increasing the roughness on the surface. The roughness on the electrode surface is directly related to an increased surface area (increased neuron interface with electrode) which increases the signal conduction. In one paper, polypyrrole (PPy) was doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) to electrochemically deposit a polypyrrole coating on the electrode surface. The film was coated onto the electrode at different thickness, increasing the roughness. The increased roughness (increased effective surface) leads to a decreased overall <b>electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> from about 400 kΩ (bare stent) to less than 10 kΩ (PPy/PSS coating) at 1 kHz. This decrease in impedance leads to improved charge transfer from the electrode to the tissue and an overall more effective electrode for recording and stimulating applications.|$|E
50|$|Microneurography {{is based}} on {{tungsten}} needle electrodes which are inserted through the skin and into a nerve. Anaesthetics are not required because surprisingly the procedure is not very painful. The tungsten microelectrodes have a shaft diameter of 100-200 μm, a tip diameter of 1-5 μm, and they are insulated to the tip with an epoxy resin. <b>Electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> varies between 0.3 and 5 MΩ at 1 kHz as measured initially. However, the impedance tends to decrease during experiment and is usually below 1 MΩ while impulses are recorded. Nerve discharges are determined by voltage differences between the intra-neural electrode and a reference needle electrode in the vicinity. The 2 electrodes are connected to an amplifier with a high input impedance and an appropriate band-pass filtering, often 500 to 5000 Hz. Signals are monitored {{on a computer screen}} and stored on a hard disc for off-line analysis. Any peripheral nerve that can be reached may be a target for microneurographical recordings, although so far only arm, leg, and facial nerves have been exploited. In order to locate the nerve, electrical stimulation through a needle electrode or ultrasonic monitoring is often used. Weak electrical shocks are delivered either through the recording electrode or through a separate stimulation needle while neural response is observed, either a muscle twitch or a cutaneous sensation reported by the subject.In ultrasonic monitoring a linear, high frequency ultrasound probe is used.The microelectrode is then inserted 1-2 cm from the probe, ideally in a 90° angle to the ultrasonic beam. This generates the best wave reflection and image. Ultrasonic approach accurately locates the depth of the nerve and identifies surrounding anatomical structures of interest, such as blood vessels and bony structures, which may affect the placement of a microelectrode. A particular advantage is that the ultrasonic approach visualizes the electrode and the nerve at the same time, thereby facilitating electrode manipulation to reach the nerve. Once the electrode tip is in the nerve, small adjustments are required, first, to penetrate the sheath of an individual fascicle and, second, to take the tip to contact nerve fibers of the kind you are interested to explore, be it multi-unit sympathetic activity or single unit activity of either a myelinated afferent or a small unmyelinated fibres. The search procedure requires considerable skill and patience as it may be very tedious particularly with small nerves or nerves located deep below the skin surface.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} reaction {{models are}} discussed which describe the oxygen exchange reaction at the Au, O 2 (g) /yytria stabilized zirconia interface.

The real charge transfer coefficients change from c = a = 1 to apparent values of c = 0. 5 and c = 1. 5.

40|$|SUMMARY: Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} of myoelectrode amplifiers for prosthetic {{control is}} important for safe operation in electrically noisy conditions. Factors affecting susceptibility to interference (impedance, common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and isolation) were studied using a commercial amplifier. INTRODUCTION: Electrical interference can enter the system either directly between the active electrodes as a differential signal, or via the common electrode as a common mode signal. The direct path is susceptible to interference due to the high gain of the amplifier. Shielding and electrode geometry design can help reduce the effects. A notch filter is generally used to reduce greatly the amplifier gain at mains frequency, though harmonics are still passed. Common mode interference is mitigated by the normally very high CMRR of the amplifier; however, common mode signals can also be converted to differential signals through imbalances in <b>electrode</b> <b>impedances</b> (Winter and Webster, 1983; Scott and Lovely, 1986). Common mode interference mainly enters via the power and output leads of a myoelectrode amplifier, so effective isolation should reduce the effect. METHODS: Two Otto Bock 13 E 125 active myoelectrodes {{were used for the}} investigations. Sinusoidal signals of different frequencies were applied in differential and common mode configurations and the output measured. The myoelectrode and measuring equipment were all battery powered to avoid conductive mains interference. Connection to the electrode contacts was through an assembly of spring-loaded platinum contacts, and the myoelectrode was shielded from the external environment in a die-cast box. Measurements were made with different balanced and unbalanced input impedances to represent the skin interface. The measurements were made with the myoelectrode alone and also in combination with an isolation amplifier (Burr-Brown ISO 124), and a d. c. -d. c. converter (Murata MEA 1 D 0505 SC) to provide isolated power. RESULTS: The d. c. input impedance and intrinsic CMRR of the myoelectrode amplifier were extremely high by design (> 40 M? and > 90 dB). The response to differential signals was greatest at 200 Hz to 1 kHz, with a sharp notch at 50 Hz. The CMRR was significantly reduced for a. c. signals if the <b>electrode</b> <b>impedances</b> were unbalanced. As the amplifier gain was non-linear and frequency dependent, a protocol was followed where the imbalance in <b>electrode</b> <b>impedances</b> was adjusted to give the same output as a known differential input. Thus the effect of impedance imbalance could be separated from the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier. The results obtained fitted the Winter-Webster model with input capacitances of 400 pF. The centre earth electrode was found to be strongly coupled to the 0 V lead at a. c. via a capacitance of 1 ?F. Isolating the amplifier improved the rejection of common mode signals introduced via the 0 V lead. There was a 20 dB increase in CMRR with the isolation components used. CONCLUSION: Common mode interference can enter via the leads of a myoelectrode amplifier. Even if the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier is very high, common mode is converted to an interfering differential signal if the <b>electrode</b> <b>impedances</b> are unbalanced. This is very likely to be the case, due to differences in skin contact. It has been demonstrated that the common mode route can be blocked by an isolating amplifier and dc-dc converter, though at the expense of extra complexity and the need to power these components. Practical implementations may come from developments in low power circuitry for applications such as wireless sensor networks. REFERENCES: Winter B. and Webster J.

In this study, we present a correction procedure to remove <b>electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> effects from SIP measurements to improve the accuracy of broadband complex electrical resistivity measurements. The first step in this correction procedure is to estimate the <b>electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> using a measurement with reversed current and potential electrodes. In a second step, this estimated <b>electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> is used to correct SIP measurements based on a simplified electrical model of the SIP measurement system. We evaluated this new correction procedure using SIP measurements on water because of the well-defined dielectric properties. It was found that the difference between the corrected and expected phase of the complex electrical resistivity of water was below 0. 1 mrad at 1 kHz {{for a wide range of}} electrode impedances. In addition, SIP measurements on a saturated unconsolidated sediment sample with two types of potential electrodes showed that the measured phase of the electrical resistivity was very similar (difference < 0. 2 mrad) up to a frequency of 10 kHz after the effect of the different electrode impedances was removed. Finally, SIP measurements on variably saturated unconsolidated sand were made. Here, the plausibility of the phase of the electrical resistivity was improved for frequencies up to 1 kHz, but errors remained for higher frequencies due to the approximate nature of the <b>electrode</b> <b>impedance</b> estimates and some remaining unknown parasitic capacitances that led to current leakage.
