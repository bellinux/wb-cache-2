2500|$|The first concerted Mongol {{invasion}} of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons {{along with other}} more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats. Jin scholar Liu Qi (劉祈) recounts in his memoir, [...] "the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [...] advanced." [...] The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (huo jian 火箭) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket. Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, [...] "From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (震天雷). Whenever the [...] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes." [...] A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the History of Jin: [...] "The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an <b>iron</b> <b>vessel</b> filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li , burning an expanse of land {{more than half a}} mu , and the fire can even penetrate iron armor." [...] A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: [...] "When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time." [...] Furthermore, he wrote, [...] "When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away." ...|$|E

I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight, from his often standing at his door.

Bob carried {{in his left hand}} one of those iron models of sugar-loaf hats, before mentioned, into which he emptied the jug, and the pointed end of which he thrust deep down into the fire, so leaving it for a few moments while he disappeared and reappeared with three bright drinking-glasses. Placing these on the table and bending over the fire, meritoriously sensible of the trying nature of his duty, he watched the wreaths of steam, until at the special instant of projection he caught up the <b>iron</b> <b>vessel</b> and gave it one delicate twirl, causing it to send forth one gentle hiss. Then he restored the contents to the jug; held over the steam of the jug, each of the three bright glasses in succession; finally filled them all, and with a clear conscience awaited the applause of his fellow-creatures.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} brought {{us into the}} midst of the Atlantic solitudes--out of smoke-colored {{sounding}} into fathomless deep blue; no ships visible anywhere over the wide ocean; no company but Mother Carey's chickens wheeling, darting, skimming the waves in the sun. There were some seafaring men among the passengers, and conversation drifted into matter concerning ships and sailors. One said that [...] "true as the needle to the pole" [...] was a bad figure, since the needle seldom pointed to the pole. He said a ship's compass was not faithful to any particular point, but was the most fickle and treacherous of the servants of man. It was forever changing. It changed every day in the year; consequently the amount of the daily variation had to be ciphered out and allowance made for it, else the mariner would go utterly astray. Another said there was a vast fortune waiting for the genius who should invent a compass that would not be affected by the local influences of an iron ship. He said there was only one creature more fickle than a wooden ship's compass, and that was the compass of an iron ship. Then came reference to the well known fact that an experienced mariner can look at the compass of a new <b>iron</b> <b>vessel,</b> thousands of mile from her birthplace, and tell which way her head was pointing when she was in process of building.|$|E

6000|$|Five miles {{further on}} {{we arrived at}} the tents of the Phipun, whose wife was {{prepared}} to entertain us with Tartar hospitality: magnificent tawny Tibet mastiffs were baying at the tent-door, and some yaks and ponies were grazing close by.

Salted and buttered tea was immediately prepared in a tea-pot for us on the mat, and in a great caldron {{for the rest of the}} party; parched rice and wheat-flour, curd, and roasted maize* [Called [...] "pop-corn" [...] in America, and prepared by roasting the maize in an <b>iron</b> <b>vessel,</b> when it splits and turns partly inside out, exposing a snow-white spongy mass of farina.

The flour was the favourite food, of which each person dexterously formed little dough-balls in his cup, an operation I could not well manage, and only succeeded in making a nauseous paste, that stuck to my jaws and in my throat. Our hostess' hospitality was too exigeant for me, but the others seemed as if they could not drink enough of the scalding tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was in {{the winter}} of 1878 that I was on the Bay of Bengal, on my way to Calcutta, and about five hundred miles distant from that city. I was not on my own ship, but was {{returning}} from a leave of absence on an American steamer from San Francisco to Calcutta, where my vessel, the United States frigate Apache, was then lying. My leave of absence would expire in three days; but although the General Brooks, the vessel I was aboard of, was more of a freight than a passenger vessel, and was heavily laden, we would have been in port in good time if, two days before, something had not happened to the machinery. I am not a machinist myself, and don't know exactly what it was that was out of order, but the engine stopped, and we had to proceed under sail. That sounds like a slow business; but the Brooks was a clipper-built vessel with three masts and a lot of sails--square sails, fore-and-aft sails, jib sails, and all that sort of thing. I am not a regular sailor myself, and don't know the names of all the sails; but whatever sails she could have she did have, and although she was an <b>iron</b> <b>vessel,</b> and heavily freighted, she was a good sailer. We had a strong, steady wind from the south, and the captain told me that at the rate we were going he didn't doubt that he would get me aboard my vessel before my leave ran out, or at least so soon afterward that it wouldn't make any difference.|$|E
6000|$|About a mile south {{we could}} see, {{rising above the}} rocks, the masts of the British brig which the St. John had {{endeavored}} to follow, which had slipped her cables and, by good luck, run {{into the mouth of}} Cohasset Harbor. A little further along the shore we saw a man's clothes on a rock; further, a woman's scarf, a gown, a straw bonnet, the brig's caboose, and one of her masts high and dry, broken into several pieces. In another rocky cove, several rods from the water, and behind rocks twenty feet high, lay a part of one side of the vessel, still hanging together. It was, perhaps, forty feet long, by fourteen wide. I was even more surprised at the power of the waves, exhibited on this shattered fragment, than I had been {{at the sight of the}} smaller fragments before. The largest timbers and iron braces were broken superfluously, and I saw that no material could withstand the power of the waves; that iron must go to pieces in such a case, and an <b>iron</b> <b>vessel</b> would be cracked up like an egg-shell on the rocks. Some of these timbers, however, were so rotten that I could almost thrust my umbrella through them. They told us that some were saved on this piece, and also showed where the sea had heaved it into this cove, which was now dry. When I saw where it had come in, and in what condition, I wondered that any had been saved on it. A little further on a crowd of men was collected around the mate of the St. John, who was telling his story. He was a slim-looking youth, who spoke of the captain as the master, and seemed a little excited. He was saying that when they jumped into the boat, she filled, and, the vessel lurching, the weight of the water in the boat caused the painter to break, and so they were separated. Whereat one man came away, saying:-- ...|$|E
