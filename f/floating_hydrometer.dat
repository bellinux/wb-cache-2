5000|$|Since the <b>floating</b> <b>hydrometer</b> is in static equilibrium, the {{downward}} gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force {{acting on the}} hydrometer is simply its weight, mg. From the Archimedes buoyancy principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer {{is equal to the}} weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by g, which {{in the case of the}} reference liquid is ρrefVg. Setting these equal, we have ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{elevator}} paradox {{relates to}} a hydrometer placed on an [...] "elevator" [...] or vertical conveyor that, by moving to different elevations, changes the atmospheric pressure. In this classic demonstration, the <b>floating</b> <b>hydrometer</b> remains at an [...] equilibrium position. Essentially, a hydrometer measures specific gravity of liquids independent of barometric pressure. This {{is because the}} change in air pressure {{is applied to the}} entire hydrometer flask. The submerged portion of the flask receives a transmitted force through the liquid, thus no portion of the apparatus receives a net force resulting from a change in air pressure.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} kept in brackish water aquaria. It is a shoaling fish that needs to be in groups of three and can grow up to 12 inches, but more commonly 8 inches in aquaria. The biggest requirement for this fish is that as a juvenile it resides in mild brackish water, but travels downstream to ocean, which means as it grows, it needs to be acclimated to increasing specific gravity or salinity. To mimic this in the home aquarium, it should be started at 3-4 tablespoons of marine salt per gallon of water for juveniles. An extra tablespoon would then be added monthly during water changes, the salt should always be dissolved completely in a separate container. It should be continued until about a cup of marine salt per gallon is being added, which is the normal marine salinity. To be more accurate, a swing handle or a <b>floating</b> <b>hydrometer</b> should be used to accurately measure the specific gravity, that needs to be raised by 0.002 every month, starting from 1.008 for juveniles to 1.023-1.024 for adults. It may be kept with other marine fish in an FOWLR marine aquarium, provided it is large enough.|$|E

50|$|The <b>{{hydrometer}}</b> is then <b>floated</b> in {{a liquid}} of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, Δx, is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped {{slightly in the}} green liquid; hence its density is {{lower than that of}} the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the <b>hydrometer</b> <b>floats</b> in both liquids.|$|R
