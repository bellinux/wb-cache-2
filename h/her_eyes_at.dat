5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Male Model" [...] targets {{the male}} {{role models for}} female rock bands, while [...] "Pompeii" [...] explores soul-searching themes such as one's losses and anxieties. [...] "Youth Decay" [...] was {{described}} by PopMatters as a song that [...] "grapples with adult disbelief {{of the problems of}} youth and the manifestations of it in terms of eating disorders and silence." [...] It features fast punk rock guitar work. The lyrics to [...] "#1 Must-Have" [...] reference images of the riot grrrl scene in the mainstream media. It was written when Tucker was preparing for an interview about the subject, held by the EMP Museum in Olympia, Washington. The song also alludes to the misogyny that took place at the Woodstock music festival in 1999, where several women were raped. Similarly, the song [...] "Was It a Lie?" [...] is a protest against how violence is used as entertainment in the media. [...] "The Professional" [...] aims at music journalism and contains heavy drum work, while [...] "Ironclad" [...] features [...] "fuzzed-out riffs and pounding fills". Other songs such as [...] "Leave You Behind" [...] and [...] "The Swimmer" [...] feature soft melodies and harmonies. [...] "You're No Rock n' Roll Fun" [...] was described as [...] "easy moving, beach punk rock music". [...] "Milkshake n' Honey" [...] was considered to be the band's funkiest song. Pitchfork commented that the song [...] "spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin rolls <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the type of denizens in The Sun Also Rises." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} it, and though <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> first were listless, they still seemed fascinated.|$|E
60|$|Frances glanced <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} with {{an apparent}} desire to hear more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Delafield, let me {{make you}} acquainted with Mr. Morton," [...] said Maria, glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> the former {{in a manner that}} he understood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure I do {{not think}} so," [...] {{returned}} Charlotte, timidly glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother; [...] "besides, I feel bound in honour to remember your original intention." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} that Meriem opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>At</b> the sight before her they went wide.|$|E
60|$|He saw the {{hardening}} of her lips, {{the flash}} in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> {{the mention of}} Somerfield's name.|$|E
60|$|The Princess opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> {{the sound}} of her maid's approach. She turned her head impatiently toward the door.|$|E
60|$|But Nan was {{too busy}} to talk. She deftly searched the girl's pocket and found the notebook. The {{shorthand}} writing caught <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> once but the characters were unknown to her.|$|R
60|$|She took up her pencil without {{removing}} the jewels, and {{still looking at}} them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> these little fountains of pure color.|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess, my love," [...] said Miss Emmerson, glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> Katherine, [...] "that I had {{different}} views for ourselves next winter: has not Miss Miller a married sister living in town?" ...|$|R
60|$|She opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> last. Sydney Barnes came a step nearer, but Wrayson {{pushed him}} once more roughly away.|$|E
60|$|He had a {{momentary}} {{glimpse of her}} face. There were tears in <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>At</b> the sight, his self-control snapped.|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} sighed. She rolled <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Waddington {{in a manner}} which {{was meant to be}} languishing.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Frost's joy {{was still}} undimmed. It {{was almost a}} trance of gladness, {{trembling}} in her smile, and overflowing in <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>at</b> every congratulation and squeeze of the hand from her friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{speak of}} {{him as if he}} were your mistress, Major Dunwoodie," [...] {{observed}} the smiling spinster, glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> niece, who sat pale and listening, in a corner of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have read}} the article," [...] said Mrs. Bloomfield, after glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> the periodical, [...] "and I must say that I take sides with Mr. John Effingham in his opinion of its character." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{last words}} were almost a wail. I was {{relieved}} {{to see that the}} tears were in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> last.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Montgomery dropped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> this, and sat {{for some}} time gazing at the straw matting which covered her floor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I?' said Arthurine, {{staring at}} it, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> their fullest extent. 'I! fifty pounds! Mr. Foxholm! What does it mean?' ...|$|E
60|$|Charlotte glanced <b>her</b> mild <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the speaker, {{but made}} no reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be {{too late}} to follow such advice," [...] Mrs Wyllys gravely replied, glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> the silent Gertrude as she spoke. [...] "But tell me more of this {{extraordinary}} vessel. Roderick, you were not born to fill the station in which I find you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Yeobright {{strained}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>at</b> last {{said that}} she did perceive him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take me along, Gabe," [...] said Olly, {{flashing}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> her sister, {{and then}} turning to Gabriel with a quivering upper lip.|$|E
60|$|He had muttered {{the word}} half aloud and she {{suddenly}} opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>At</b> first she seemed bewildered. Then {{she smiled and}} sat up.|$|E
60|$|Razumov {{gazed down}} at her with silent, scrutinizing attention. Her puffy yellow countenance was working with emotion. She screwed up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> him entreatingly.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kybird {{shook his}} head, and, {{catching}} <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> winked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with much significance.|$|R
60|$|Jill {{looked out}} of the corner of <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> Derek. He was still {{occupied}} with the people in front. She turned to the man on her right. She was not the slave to etiquette that Freddie was. She was much too interested in life to refrain from speaking to strangers.|$|R
60|$|She stopped, {{and tears}} filled <b>her</b> soft <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the scene she had conjured up.|$|R
60|$|He spoke so kindly, {{and with}} such a fervent tremor in his voice, that the tears gushed into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> {{the sound of his}} words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! If you please, miss," [...] said Charley in a whisper, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> their roundest and largest. [...] "You're wanted at the Dedlock Arms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you really}} make that up yourself?" [...] said Mrs Jehoram, {{sparkling}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> him, [...] "as you went along. Really, it is wonderful! Nothing less than wonderful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I {{should not}} have dreamt," [...] glancing <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> a mirror, [...] "of being thought envious without better cause. But let us go to the old lady; she is making a feast {{in the other room}} which might have dined all your troop when you had one." ...|$|R
60|$|Catherine opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> gazing <b>at</b> him, and {{she could}} give no better promise than what he read there.|$|R
60|$|She swayed for {{a moment}} as though she would have fallen, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> looked <b>at</b> me full of fear.|$|R
