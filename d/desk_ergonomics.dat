I paid attention to pupils of the first and second years of primary school, because they present a high-risk group due to the sudden passage from a spontaneous physical activity to a long-term static strain at school. The aim {{of the study was to}} map the suitability of ergonomic parameters of school furniture for pupils of the first and second years of primary school and to assess its influence on the development of poor posture. I focused on the chair height, the seat depth, the backrest and the worktop height and angle. I also wanted to examine teachers' awareness on the issue of school furniture, the proper seating posture and possibilities to compensate the static strain of children. The research group consisted of 146 pupils of the first and second years of randomly selected primary schools in České Budějovice. The theoretical part was elaborated by the document content analysis, the research was done in three steps. First, the quantitative interview method through questionnaires distributed to the parents of respondents was used. This was followed by investigations in classes and the last step was to answer additional questions to teachers and the school management. The results show that 88 % of respondents use ergonomically unsuitable furniture, there is a greater incidence of negative findings in the furniture of the first year pupils in all investigated parameters, except low chairs and worktops, but these are only present in inconsiderable numbers. A significant association was found between sub-standard school furniture and pains in the back, head, arms and legs, leading to the formation and development of poor posture. Teachers´ awareness of this issue is good, but in my opinion it is inadequate in terms prevention. Early preventive measures can affect the condition of the movement apparatus in adulthood. Family and school should be the first involved. But an equally important role should be played by pediatricians and professionals in the public health protection, who should act not only as an inspection, but mainly as an advisory body. Therefore, it is important to increase the awareness of the general public and teachers on work chair and <b>desk</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> the proper seating posture and possibilities for a long-term static strain compensation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} about {{designing}} a desktop <b>desk</b> using <b>ergonomics</b> technique {{in order to}} avoid or minimize the chance of developing Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSD) among the workers. MSD happens due to the product or tools that is not ergonomics. MSD starts to develop when a workers is doing a job repeatedly. The problem statement for this study is the musculoskeletal disorder that occurs when the action was doing statically for a long period time and repetitive. There are three objectives for this study. The first objective {{of this study is to}} design a desktop <b>desk</b> with <b>ergonomics</b> approach using Solidworks. The preliminary design will be design using Solidworks. The second objective is to simulate the designed desktop table using Algor. This is to analyze the force affecting the desktop when it is subjected to the force and its deformation value. This study also uses the algor to simulate the critical part like the vertical structure that supports the desktop desk. The third objective is to analyze the bending moment of the desk. First stage of this study was collecting data via literature review and find out the problem that occur in the desk that have been designed. This design will be upgraded and modified to overcome and ensure that the same problem not occur again in the future. In the end, this study is targeting to overcome the musculoskeletal disorder problem that has been a nightmare to the human being...|$|R
