5|$|Spirited Away {{contains}} critical {{commentary on}} modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as {{a representation of}} the shōjo, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act {{was largely}} ineffective, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> {{as the first}} piece of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until the Factories Act 1961.|$|E
50|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{multiple}} {{sightings of}} massive turtles on Great Herring Pond.

They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> floating down stream from Little Herring Pond, under Carters Bridge.|$|R
60|$|Occasionally they {{overhauled}} {{a fishing}} boat, and endeavoured to obtain {{news of the}} two squadrons; but beyond the fact that Fieschi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> steering north some days before, and that no signs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> of Pisani's returning fleet, they could learn nothing.|$|R

5|$|An {{alcoholic}} and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, {{and a few}} landscapes and historical scenes. He worked successfully in the Edo period, and carried those traditions into the Meiji period. To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians, this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as a significant achievement during a transitional period of great social and political change in Japan's history.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the period}} Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the European Renaissance in art, {{architecture}} and literature and produced a developed educational system. This period <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> one in which a clear national identity emerged in Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be particularly significant in the period of the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the listed species, a distinctive Charadrius plover known as the white-faced plover <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in Thailand in recent years. It is at present unclear {{whether it is a}} new species or a subspecies of Kentish plover.|$|E
60|$|As I {{have told}} you, Farmer Brown's boy <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{all about the}} {{neighborhood}} asking at each farmhouse if anything <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> of Bowser. Of course nothing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> of him, and so at last Farmer Brown's boy felt sure that something dreadful had happened to Bowser in the woods.|$|R

5|$|In the Philippines, P. labiata {{does not}} prey on ants, but is preyed {{on by the}} ants Oecophylla smaragdina and Odontomachus sp. (species uncertain), and a solitary Odontomachus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> attacking a P. labiata. In a test the ant Diacamma vagans usually killed single-handed a P. labiata.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{was born}} with a bipartite patella, where the kneecap remains as two {{separate}} bones instead of fusing together in early childhood, but was not diagnosed until the age of 16. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> holding his knee due to the pain caused by the condition and has pulled out of events because of it.|$|E
5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of Burmese pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial American alligator populations in the Everglades may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on young alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> on overall American alligator populations.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{scientists}} {{are convinced that}} the observed signatures are caused by a ring system. No rings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in images, which puts a very low limit on dust-sized particles. Furthermore, a ring of boulders would be expected to generate dust that would likely <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in the images.|$|R

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as crucial {{to an increase}} in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created friction between the Catalan nationalist supporters, who wish to secede from Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E
5|$|The class {{continued}} {{to operate with}} British Railways until withdrawn during 1961 and 1962. Only {{one example of the}} class – the first engine, Lord Nelson itself – has been saved from scrapping.

5|$|The theatre {{itself is}} said to be haunted by several ghosts {{including}} the Grey Lady, who was an actress centuries ago.

5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the ground, where it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> catching butterflies in midair.|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> assisting the X-Men at X-Haven with helping refugee mutants. Anole along with Glob, Martha and Ernest are under the tutelage of Colossus in training to become more experienced X-Men.|$|E
5|$|Washington's defeat {{revealed}} his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw troops that fled in disorder {{at the first}} shots. However, his daring nighttime retreat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> by some historians {{as one of his}} greatest military feats. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|A WiiWare launch {{title in}} all regions, it was {{released}} on March 25, 2008 in Japan, May 12, 2008 in North America, and May 20, 2008 in Europe. The game costs 1500 Wii Points. Reviews of the game were generally favorable, and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> {{as one of the}} most innovative games released on the WiiWare service. A followup, , was announced at a Nintendo keynote speech at the Game Developers Conference 2009, and was a tower defense game that was also met with positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
