40|$|Abstract Background <b>Dimeticone</b> 4 % lotion {{was shown}} to be an {{effective}} treatment for head louse infestation in two randomised controlled trials in England. It is not affected by insecticide resistance but efficacy obtained (70 - 75 %) was lower than expected. This study was designed to evaluate efficacy of <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % lotion in a geographically, socially, and culturally different setting, in rural Turkey and, in order to achieve blinding, it was compared with a potential alternative formulation. Methods Children from two village schools were screened for head lice by detection combing. All infested students and family members could participate, giving access to treatment for the whole community. Two investigator applied treatments were given 7 days apart. Outcome was assessed by detection combing three times between treatments and twice the week following second treatment. Results In the intention to treat group 35 / 36 treated using <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % had no lice after the second treatment but there were two protocol violators giving 91. 7 % treatment success. The alternative product gave 30 / 36 (83. 3 %) treatment success, a difference of 8. 4 % (95 % CI - 9. 8 % to 26. 2 %). The cure rates per-protocol were 33 / 34 (97. 1 %) and 30 / 35 (85. 7 %) respectively. We were unable to find any newly emerged louse nymphs on 77. 8 % of <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % treated participants or on 66. 7 % of those treated with the alternative formulation. No adverse events were identified. Conclusion Our results confirm the efficacy of <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % lotion against lice and eggs and we found no detectable difference between this product and <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % lotion with nerolidol 2 % added. We believe that the high cure rate was related to the lower intensity of infestation in Turkey, together with the level of community engagement, compared with previous studies in the UK.

40|$|Abstract:  Epidermal {{parasitic}} skin diseases (EPSD) {{are common}} in the tropics and sub-tropics. They are caused by mites, lice and other blood-sucking insects. In resource-poor countries they are associated with considerable morbidity. Hitherto, EPSD are treated with insecticides with a neurotoxic mode of action. The efficacy of this treatment is variable, and the development and spread of resistant mites and lice is alarming. A new concept for treating EPSD is presented {{which is based on}} the topical application of <b>dimeticones,</b> silicone oils of low viscosity which rapidly kill insects and mites by a physical mode of action. They creep into the respiratory system and block oxygen supply. The physical mode of action makes the development of resistant parasite strains very unlikely. Due to their safety and efficacy, <b>dimeticones</b> are promising candidates for population-based intervention programmes targeted against EPSD in resource-poor settings...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a <b>dimeticone</b> {{formulation}} {{has been}} shown to be effective at preventing Schistosoma cercariae infecting skin, while DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a highly effective insecticide, {{has been shown}} to have activity against cercariae. Seven formulations, 3 containing DEET, were prepared and applied to excised human skin in Franz cells for 1 h. Schistosoma cercariae were applied for 30 min at 1 and 24 h, and the number that penetrated the skin calculated (n = 9). DEET could not be incorporated into the <b>dimeticone</b> formulation, yet it remained the most effective at preventing cercarial penetration, both 1 and 24 h after application. The ointments that contained DEET did prevent penetration but their mode of action was due to the toxicity of DEET against the cercariae. The persistence of the protection afforded by the <b>dimeticone</b> formulation after washing suggests that the formulation may be interacting with the stratum corneum to prevent cercarial recognition of skin...|$|E
40|$|Background. Malathion 0. 5 % {{has been}} the most {{prescribed}} pediculicide in the United Kingdom for around 10 years, and is widely used in Europe and North America. Anecdotal reports suggest malathion treatments are less effective than formerly, but this has not been confirmed clinically. This study was designed to determine whether malathion is still effective and if 4 % <b>dimeticone</b> lotion is a more effective treatment for head louse infestation. Methodology/Principal Findings. We designed this study as an assessor blinded, randomised, controlled, parallel group trial involving 58 children and 15 adults with active head louse infestation. Each participant received two applications 7 days apart of either 4 % <b>dimeticone</b> lotion, applied for 8 hours or overnight, or 0. 5 % malathion liquid applied for 12 hours or overnight. All treatment and check-up visits were conducted in participants ’ homes. Cure of infestation was defined as no evidence of head lice after the second treatment. Some people were found free from lice but later reinfested. Worst case, intention to treat, analysis found <b>dimeticone</b> was significantly more effective than malathion, with 30 / 43 (69. 8 %) participants cured using <b>dimeticone</b> compared with 10 / 30 (33. 3 %) using malathion (p, 0. 01, difference 36. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval 14. 7 % to 58. 2 %). Per protocol analysis showed cure rates of 30 / 39 (76. 9 %) and 10 / 29 (34. 5 %) respectively. Irritant reactions were observed in only two participants, both treated with malathion. Conclusions/Significance. We concluded that, although malathion liquid is still effective for some people, <b>dimeticone</b> lotion offers a significantly more effective alternative treatment for most people.

40|$|Abstract Background Infestation {{with the}} human head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) occurs worldwide. Existing {{treatment}} options are limited, and reports of resistance to commonly used pediculicides have been increasing. In this trial we assessed the efficacy of a product containing a high (92 %) concentration of the silicone oil <b>dimeticone</b> (identical in composition to NYDA ®), as compared to a 1 % permethrin lotion. Methods Randomized, controlled, observer blinded clinical trial. Participants were recruited from a poor urban neighbourhood in Brazil where pediculosis capitis was highly prevalent. To minimize reinfestation during the trial, participants (145 children aged 5 – 15 years with head lice infestations) were transferred to a holiday resort outside the endemic area {{for a period of}} 9 days. Two applications of <b>dimeticone</b> or 1 % permethrin were done, seven days apart. Outcome measures were defined as cure (absence of vital head lice) after first application and before and after second applications, degree of itching, cosmetic acceptability, and clinical pathology. Results Overall cure rates were: day 2 – <b>dimeticone</b> 94. 5 % (95 % CI: 86. 6 % – 98. 5 %) and permethrin 66. 7 % (95 % CI: 54. 6 % – 77. 3 %; p Conclusion The <b>dimeticone</b> product is a safe and highly efficacious pediculicide. Due to its physical mode of action (interruption of the lice's oxygen supply of the central nervous system), development of resistance is unlikely.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Dimeticone</b> 4 % lotion is an {{effective}} and widely accepted treatment for head louse infestation. However, it is a highly mobile fluid that some people find difficult to apply and is mainly left on the hair for 8 hours or overnight. User preference is for a more manageable and viscous product {{that can be used}} with a short application time. Findings This proof of concept study in 41 people investigated <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % liquid gel, a product that is easier to apply than the lotion, applied for 15 minutes on two occasions a week apart. We found that head lice were eliminated from all participants following the first application of product. We did not find lice of any stage on any participant during four post treatment assessments and particularly, unlike other treatments, no young nymphs on days 1 and 6 prior to the second treatment, indicating ovicidal as well as pediculicidal activity. Conclusions <b>Dimeticone</b> 4 % liquid gel has demonstrated efficacy greater than other similar products and the evidence obtained indicates elimination of head louse infestation with a single 15 minute application.

40|$|Background: Treatment of head lice using {{physically}} acting preparations {{based on}} silicones is currently replacing insecticide use due to widespread resistance to neurotoxic agents. It has been postulated that some products act by asphyxiation, although the limited experimental {{evidence and the}} anatomy of the louse respiratory system suggest this is unlikely. Results: Observation over several hours of lice treated using 4 % high molecular weight <b>dimeticone</b> in a volatile silicone base showed that, although rapidly immobilised initially, the insects still exhibited small movements of extremities and death was delayed. One common effect of treatment is inhibition of the louse's ability to excrete water by transpiration through the spiracles. Inability to excrete water that is ingested {{as part of the}} louse blood meal appears to subject the louse gut to osmotic stress resulting in rupture. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with X-ray microanalysis to detect silicon showed <b>dimeticone</b> lotion is deposited in the spiracles and distal region of the tracheae of lice and in some cases blocks the lumen or opening entirely.

Here we assessed in a comparative bioassay the ex vivo efficacy of "NYDA ® sensitiv", a new two-phase dimeticone-based pediculicide {{similar to a}} product established on the market, but without fragrances. Methods We compared efficacy of the new product to a positive <b>dimeticone</b> control group, a sample of four other insecticidal and natural head lice products marketed in Germany, and an untreated control. In a bioassay, lice were exposed ex vivo to products and examined for activity for up to 24 hours, following a standard protocol. Results After 6 and 24 hours, 13. 7 and 88. 5 % of untreated control lice did not show major vital signs. In contrast, no lice showed major vital signs 5 minutes after treatment with the new product or the control <b>dimeticone</b> group (NYDA ®). This effect persisted at all observation points (100 % efficacy). Efficacy of 0. 5 % permethrin (Infectopedicul ®) ranged between 76 and 96 % in evaluations between 5 min and 6 hours. All lice treated with a coconut-based compound (mosquito ® Läuseshampoo) did not show major vital signs after 5 min, but mortality was only 58 % after one hour. Pyrethrum extract (Goldgeist ® forte) showed an efficacy of 22 - 52 % between 5 min and 3 hours after treatment; after 6 hours, 76 % of lice were judged dead. An oxyphthirine ® -based compound (Liberalice DUO LP-PRO ®) killed 22 - 54 % of lice in the first 6 hours. Conclusions The two-phase <b>dimeticone</b> compound NYDA ® sensitiv is highly efficacious. The removal of fragrances as compared to an established <b>dimeticone</b> product did not affect in vitro efficacy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{conducted}} a study to evaluate efficacy and safety of <b>dimeticone</b> 4 %, a lotion with no conventional insecticide activity, to cure lice infection and to prevent spread of infestation/reinfestation by prophylaxis of classmates. Methods: The study is carried out between April 2008 and June 2008 in Petranova International Institute in Rome. A total of 131 children, aged 3 to 13 years (median age: 7 years) {{were included in the}} study. All participants received treatment with <b>dimeticone</b> 4 % that was applied both to children with the infestation, to cure it, and to all classmates, to prevent the spreading of the infestation. They have been controlled after 7 and 30 days from the application of <b>dimeticone.</b> Results: At baseline we found a positivity of lice infestation in 23 / 131 children (17. 6 %), whereas 108 / 131 (82. 4 %) children were free from lice. After 7 days of treatment with <b>dimeticone</b> 4 %, 7 / 23 (30. 4 %) positive children still had lice infestation, with a cure rate of 69. 6 % (16 / 23). At 30 days 26 / 131 children (19. 9 %) were infested: 15 children were lice free at baseline whereas 11 had lice at both evaluations; the cure rate amounted to 52. 2 % (12 / 23). The reinfestation rate (percentage of positive children that showed negativity at baseline) was 5. 3 % (7 / 131) at 7 days and 11. 5 % (15 / 131) at 30 days. Conclusion: The lower reinfestation rate showed in our trial suggests that this approach could be effective in reducing spreading of head lice in small communities.

40|$|Background: Tungiasis (sand flea disease) {{is caused}} by the {{penetration}} of female sand fleas (Tunga penetrans, Siphonaptera) into the skin. It belongs to the neglected tropical diseases and is prevalent in South America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Tungiasis predominantly affects marginalized populations and resource-poor communities in both urban and rural areas. In the endemic areas, patients {{do not have access to}} an effective and safe treatment. A proof-of-principle study in rural Kenya has shown that the application of a two-component <b>dimeticone</b> (NYDA®) which is a mixture of two low viscosity silicone oils caused almost 80 % of the embedded sand fleas to lose their viability within 7 days. Methods: In this study we compared the efficacy of two distinct modes of application of NYDA®; one targeted application to the area where the parasite protrudes through the skin and one comprehensive application to the whole foot. Results: Independent of the two modes of application, the <b>dimeticone</b> caused more than 95 % of embedded sand fleas to lose all signs of viability within 7 days. The targeted application killed embedded sand fleas more rapidly compared to when the whole foot was covered. The proportion of viable lesions at day two were 7. 0 versus 23. 4 % (p < 0. 01) and at day five 3. 9 versus 12. 5 % (p < 0. 02).

40|$|Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is a {{neglected}} tropical disease, prevalent in resource-poor communities in South America and sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is caused by}} an inflammatory response against penetrated female sand fleas (Tunga penetrans) embedded in {{the skin of the}} host. Although associated with debilitating acute and chronic morbidity, there is no proven effective drug treatment. By consequence patients attempt to remove embedded sand fleas with non-sterile sharp instruments, such as safety pins, a procedure that represents a health threat by itself. In this proof-of-principle study we compared the topical application of a mixture of two dimeticones of low viscosity (NYDA) to the topical application of a 0. 05 % solution of KMnO 4 in 47 school children in an endemic area in rural Kenya. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed during a follow up period of seven days using viability signs of the embedded parasites, alterations in the natural development of lesion morphology and the degree of local inflammation as outcome measures. Seven days after treatment, in the <b>dimeticone</b> group 78 % (95 % CI 67 – 86 %) of the parasites had lost all signs of viability as compared to 39 % (95 % CI 28 – 52 %) in the KMnO 4 group (p, 0. 001). In the <b>dimeticone</b> group 90 % (95 % CI 80 – 95 %) of the penetrated sand fleas showed an abnormal development already after 5 days, compared to 53 % (95 % CI 40 – 66 %; p, 0. 001) in the KMnO 4 group.

40|$|Abstract: Resistance of head lice to {{insecticides}} with a neurotoxic mode of action, such as permethrin and malathion, {{is increasing}} in incidence and geographic extent. As a consequence, physically acting pediculicidal products have emerged. Dimeticones are synthetic silicone oils of {{low surface tension}} and can therefore coat most surfaces, thus also killing head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) by physical means. Considering this mode of action, the development of head lice resistance {{in the future is}} very unlikely. In this review, ex vivo and clinical evidence on the efficacy of dimeticones against head lice is presented. Besides the high adulticidal and excellent ovicidal ex vivo efficacy, clinical efficacy of high concentrated <b>dimeticone</b> has been shown. We conclude that dimeticone-based products are a safe and effective option for those patients who prefer not to use pediculicides with a neurotoxic mode of action, especially in areas where resistances of head lice against permethrin and malathion-based products have been reported, or are suspected...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInsecticide {{treatment}} {{resistance is}} considered to be a major factor in the increasing number of infestations by head lice. The large insecticide selection pressure induced by conventional topical pediculicides has led to the emergence and spread of resistance in many parts of the world. Possible mechanisms of resistance include accelerated detoxification of insecticides by enzyme-mediated reduction, esterification, oxidation that may be overcome by synergistic agents such as piperonyl butoxide, alteration of the binding site, e. g. altered acetylcholinesterase or altered nerve voltage-gated sodium channel, and knockdown resistance (kdr). Clinical, parasitological and molecular data on resistance to conventional topical pediculicides show that treatments with neurotoxic insecticides have suffered considerable loss of activity worldwide. In particular, resistance to synthetic pyrethroids has become prominent, probably because of their extensive use. As other treatment options, including non-insecticidal pediculicides such as <b>dimeticone,</b> are now available, the use of older insecticides, such as lindane and carbaryl, should be minimized, owing to their loss of efficacy and safety concerns. The organophosphorus insecticide malathion remains effective, except in the UK, mostly in formulations that include terpineol...|$|E

The use of medicinal products has been obtained from questionnaires sent out when the study children were 4 weeks, 54, 78 and 91 months old. Results The data included prescription, over-the-counter and complementary and alternative medicines. Around threequarters of study children were exposed to some form of medicinal product before 8 weeks of age. Dermatological preparations were the most commonly used products in young babies.

40|$|O alisamento químico é o método mais empregado para melhorar a penteabilidade e a estilização de cabelos afro-étnicos. O cabelo é composto basicamente de três partes: cutícula, córtex e medula. O {{principal}} constituinte é uma proteína, a queratina. O tratamento com agente alcalino, redutor e/ou oxidante, provoca modificações nessa estrutura, ocasionando danos que podem ocorrer na camada superficial (cutícula) ou em toda a fibra, atingindo inclusive o córtex e modificando as propriedades físico-químicas do cabelo, pois o torna mais quebradiço, frágil, sem brilho, áspero e com mais dificuldade para ser penteado e desembaraçado. O emprego de agentes condicionadores auxilia na melhora dos atributos físicos e sensoriais do cabelo tornando-o mais resistente e facilitando o manuseio. Neste estudo foi preparado um creme-base alisante com tioglicolato de amônio acrescido de agentes condicionadores pré-escolhidos e adicionados no momento do uso. A formulação-base foi submetida ao estudo de estabilidade física por dois meses. Foram realizados testes de: quantificação da perda de proteína equivalente em albumina, empregando-se o método de Lowry modificado por Peterson; penteabilidade e tração de ruptura.

Chemical hair relaxing is {{the most}} common used method to improve combability and styling on afro-ethnic hair. The hair is basically composed of three parts: cuticle, cortex and medulla. The main basic element is a protein, the keratin. The treatment with an alkaline reducing agent and/or an oxidant agent causes modifications in this structure, and related damages that can occur in the superficial layer (cuticle) through ali the fiber, reaching the cortex and modifying the physical-chemical properties of the hair. In that case, the hair becomes more fragile, it has no shine, gets rough and it is very difficulty to comb and to detangle it. Conditioning agents can improve the physical and sensorial attributes of the hair, thus allowing it to become more resistant and making it easier to take care of. In this study a hair straightener cream-base with ammonium thioglycolate was prepared and the selected conditioning agents added at the moment of the use.
