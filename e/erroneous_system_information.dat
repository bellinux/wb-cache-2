40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the Bechtel Jacobs Company, LLC (BJC) Lessons Learned for system design as it relates to safety basis documentation. BJC has had to reconcile incomplete or outdated <b>system</b> description <b>information</b> with current facility safety basis for a number of situations in recent months. This paper has relevance in multiple topical areas including documented safety analysis, decontamination & decommissioning (D&D), safety basis (SB) implementation, safety and design integration, potential inadequacy of the safety analysis (PISA), technical safety requirements (TSR), and unreviewed safety questions. BJC learned that nuclear safety compliance relies on adequate and well documented <b>system</b> design <b>information.</b> A number of PIS As and TSR violations occurred due to inadequate or <b>erroneous</b> <b>system</b> design <b>information.</b> As a corrective action, BJC assessed the occurrences caused by systems design-safety basis interface problems. Safety systems reviewed included the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) Fluorination System, K- 1065 fire alarm system, and the K- 25 Radiation Criticality Accident Alarm System. The conclusion was that an inadequate knowledge of system design could result in continuous non-compliance issues relating to nuclear safety. This was especially true with older facilities that lacked current as-built drawings coupled with the loss of 'historical knowledge' as personnel retired or moved on in their careers. Walkdown of systems and the updating of drawings are imperative for nuclear safety compliance. System design integration with safety basis has relevance in the Department of Energy (DOE) complex. This paper presents the BJC Lessons Learned in this area. It will be of benefit to DOE contractors that manage and operate an aging population of nuclear facilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is a {{successful}} method for refuting properties of <b>erroneous</b> <b>systems.</b> Initially applied to discrete systems only, BMC could be extended to more complex domains like linear hybrid automata. The increasing complexity coming along with these complex models, but also recent optimizations of SAT-based BMC, like excessive conflict learning, reveal a memory explosion problem especially for deep counterexamples. In this paper we introduce parametric data types for the internal solver structure that, {{taking advantage of the}} symmetry of BMC problems, remarkably reduce the memory requirements of the solver. ...|$|R

It was assumed that readers of instructions construct both a procedural and a system mental model, and that the latter enables the readers to infer possible missing information in procedural instructions. Moreover, it was assumed that <b>system</b> <b>information</b> would increase the cognitive load during reading and practicing, and that it would affect the appreciation of the instructions as well as the self-efficacy of the reader. The participants in the experiment read instructions and practiced with a fictitious machine before performing a number of tasks and answering a questionnaire. The results indicate that <b>system</b> <b>information</b> increased the cognitive load during reading and decreased self-efficacy, while the instructional text with <b>system</b> <b>information</b> was judged as more difficult.

The class of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> can be generated from the subclass of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> {{in the sense that}} the category of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Because qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> correspond to the qualitative domains of Girard (Theoret.

We show how constructions on qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (such as product and function space) can be "translated" to constructions on continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Among other things, we prove that the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is weak Cartesian closed.
