25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{estimates that}} up to 12,000 {{people have been killed}} in the violence, with many more dying from disease and malnutrition as a direct result of the conflict. Nearly two million civilians have been forced to flee their homes, living in <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> (IDP) camps and within the safety of larger settlements, sleeping on street corners and in other public spaces. The problems of the camps have been expatiated by the government ordering villagers into the camps on pain of being classified as rebels and on occasion shelling those villages who refused to relocate.|$|E

2500|$|MSF {{has been}} active in Uganda since 1980, and {{provided}} relief to civilians during the country’s guerrilla war during the [...] However, the formation of the Lord's Resistance Army saw the beginning of a long campaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abductions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or child soldiers. Faced with more than 1.5million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, polio, cholera, ebola, and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents. Mental health is also an important aspect of medical treatment for MSF teams in Uganda since most people refuse to leave the IDP camps for constant fear of being attacked.|$|E

40|$|<b>Internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> {{are faced}} with several problems, such as sexual violence, and deserve {{appropriate}} intervention, especially {{in view of the}} increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other infections in Nigeria. This study attempts to assess interventions offered by governmental authorities and organizations to <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> and to identify gaps in services as well as to identify what needs to be strengthened. Method: The author reviewed relevant published and unpublished documents and collected data by interviews with semi-structured questions. Twenty-five organizations and government and police departments and 55 <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> were interviewed. Results: None of the organizations, including governmental institutions, provided social services or assistance in prevention of HIV/AIDS to <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons.</b> The main services provided by 17 (68 %) organizations to 43 (78. 2 %) of <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> were provision of food, clothing and money, but these were provided on an ad hoc basis. Only 3 organizations (12 %) included spiritual counseling and resolution of communal conflicts in their services. Conclusion: The fact that most organizations, including the government, do not have services for <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> indicates lack of support for <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons.</b> The government should be urged to include these people in most prevention services, including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. This should help reduce the national prevalence of HIV/AID...|$|R
40|$|The {{crisis of}} <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> {{constitutes}} {{one of the}} world’s most worrisome humanitarian crises. With the Boko Haram insurgency attacks, the number of <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> {{in the northern part}} of the country rose tremendously. In addressing this crisis in the country, efforts of the government have not been pleasing and encouraging. This paper is therefore set to interrogate the extent to which the <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> affect human security in northern Nigeria. Forced migration and social inclusion theories were the theoretical frameworks adopted for the study while it relies on primary and secondary sources of data for analysis. Findings of the study reveals that measures of the government in addressing the crisis of <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> in the country is on ad-hoc basis with no solid and durable solution in view. In addition, the crisis of <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> hinders immensely the developmental process of the region. The paper therefore advocates for the inclusion of the <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> persons’ affairs at the local government level thereby establishing offices for the representatives of these <b>displaced</b> <b>persons.</b> The increments of funds to enhance and protect human security amongst the citizens are alternative measures in addressing the crisis of <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>persons</b> in the country thereby enhancing human security in the region...|$|R
2500|$|As the RPF {{captured}} {{the capital of}} Kigali, the military of France set up a safe zone in southwest Rwanda in June 1994 in what was dubbed [...] "Opération Turquoise". It was ostensibly done to stop the genocide, but the French/European forces prohibited the entry of RPF forces that were already stopping the genocide and the Hutus who fled there included militants {{and members of the}} ousted government, as well as Hutu civilians. The French soon ended their intervention, leading to the flight of 300,000 people from the Zone Turquoise west towards the Zairean town of Bukavu in July and August, while a further 300,000 remained in <b>internally</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> camps. On 18 July 1994, RPF forces {{captured the}} northwestern town of Gisenyi and declared a new government with Pasteur Bizimungu as president and Kagame in the newly created position of vice-president. Gisenyi {{was the center of the}} provisional government and its fall caused over 800,000 Rwandans to cross into Goma, Zaire over four days in late July. This outflow was also highly organized, with administrative structures simply transferred across the border.|$|E
