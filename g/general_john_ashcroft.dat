In 2001, she became the political anchor at Headline News, covering daily political stories and, post-9/11, she filed one of the last interviews given by the mujahadeen Abdul Haq.

25|$|Buchanan was {{the first}} woman and {{youngest}} person ever in Pennsylvania's history to be appointed to this position, and she has been viewed by some, such as former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and former U.S. Attorney Fred Thieman, as one of the more controversial U.S. Attorneys in the history of Pennsylvania. Under Attorneys <b>General</b> <b>John</b> <b>Ashcroft</b> and Alberto Gonzales, Buchanan continuously held two key Justice Department posts, splitting time between Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh up until her resignation as Acting Director of the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women in December 2007.

25|$|After {{one of the}} Justice Department's longest-running {{and most}} {{controversial}} terrorism investigations, federal prosecutors filed an indictment on February 21, 2003 which charged Al-Arian with racketeering for Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ).

Attorney <b>General</b> <b>John</b> <b>Ashcroft</b> hailed the vastly expanded powers of the Patriot Act as fundamental to the indictment. Arab American groups condemned the indictment as persecution for Al-Arian's advocacy of Palestinian causes. Local community activists, Iraq war protesters, and Muslim-Americans held demonstrations regularly on Al-Arian's affair in the weeks following the indictment. Al-Arian labeled his arrest a consequence of post-9/11 hysteria at a public pronouncement {{in front of a}} courthouse rally by his supporters.|$|E

He supported former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 2008 presidential election, and the American Bar Association mentioned Thompson again as a possible Attorney General or Supreme Court justice during a potential John McCain administration.|$|R

5000|$|At a {{screening}} at the Starz Denver film festival in December 2009, {{and again in}} an interview with Progressive Voice, Doggart called for the prosecution of ten Bush Administration officials: President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice (as NSA and chair of the Group of Principals who authorized the torture techniques), Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Vice-President Dick Cheney, CIA bosses George Tenet and Porter Goss, General Geoffrey D. Miller (commander at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo), Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Attorney <b>Generals</b> <b>John</b> <b>Ashcroft</b> and Alberto Gonzales. In February 2010, Doggart presented {{a screening}} of the film at New York's Revolution Books with human rights organizations World Can't Wait and War Criminals Watch. Screenings in Minnesota were also organized by Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent turned whistle-blower, who called the film [...] "a must-see documentary". The campaign continued through social networking sites and interviews in the press, radio [...] and on PBS but has so far failed to secure its objective of Rice's arrest, prosecution and imprisonment. Efforts to this end were escalated in May 2010, following the announcement that Rice was to play a concert with Aretha Franklin. Doggart responded to this by corralling a group of human rights activists, including Rowley, War Criminals Watch, and Down With Tyranny, to pressure Franklin and the Philadelphia Orchestra to dump her from the concert billing, and to encourage either a citizen's arrest, or one instigated by Attorney General Eric Holder. These protests continued at a Denver University awards dinner, where Madeleine Albright presented the 2010 Josef Korbel Outstanding Alumni Award to Rice, while activists warned guests outside that [...] "there's a war criminal in the area".|$|R

On 18 September 2006, a Canadian public enquiry presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities. In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria {{knew he would be}} tortured by intelligence agents. US Attorney <b>General</b> <b>John</b> <b>Ashcroft,</b> Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director Robert Mueller were all named in the lawsuit. In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.|$|E
25|$|In an {{associated}} case, Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (2011), Abdullah al-Kidd, an American citizen and convert to Islam, {{was arrested in}} 2003 and held for 16 days in maximum security prisons. He was under supervised release (house arrest) for 13 months. The federal government was holding him as a material witness against Al-Hussayen. After finally being released, al-Kidd sued Attorney <b>General</b> <b>John</b> <b>Ashcroft</b> personally, in {{a case in which}} he was represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). They said that they knew of 70 other Muslim men who had been similarly detained in the early years following the 9/11 attacks. In 2009 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful detention of al-Kidd.|$|E

40|$|AGSF, a {{non-profit}} gun policy research group, examined government data on firearm prosecutions and violent crimes {{during the first}} three years of the Bush administration's signature gun enforcement initiative, known as "Project Safe Neighborhoods," a project that has funneled more than $ 1 billion into gun enforcement efforts across the country. The AGSF report shows that despite this increase in spending, prosecutions for most types of firearm offenses are declining or remain below pre-Bush administration levels, and 20 of the 22 major federal gun laws are enforced so infrequently that they might as well not exist. Last year, for example, the Justice Department brought only: - 188 cases for gun trafficking, despite the recovery of 300, 000 guns showing signs of trafficking. This represents a 5 percent decline in prosecutions from 2002 levels. - 32 cases against corrupt gun stores, even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) has concluded that "dirty dealers" are the leading source of firearms recovered in gun trafficking operations. Prosecutors in 29 states that are home to 50, 675 licensed dealers filed not even one case against a gun retailer in 2003. - 532 cases for lying on a firearms background check form [...] an 8 % decrease [...] even though more than 126, 000 people submitted false information on the forms and despite Attorney <b>General</b> <b>John</b> <b>Ashcroft's</b> emphasis on pursuing these cases. - 5 cases for illegally selling a gun to a minor, even though more than 30, 000 gun crimes were committed by youths age 17 or under; - 234 cases for possessing or selling a stolen firearm, despite nearly 40, 000 stolen guns being recovered by law enforcement and returned to their rightful owner; and - 89 cases for possessing or selling a firearm with an obliterated serial number [...] a sign that the gun was sold illegally [...] despite the fact that police recover thousands of guns with missing serial numbers each year during criminal investigations. The overall number of federal firearm prosecutions has increased in each of the last four years, rising from 7, 124 in 2000 to 11, 864 in 2003. Ninety-four percent of the increase, however, comes from prosecutions under just two statutes: one that outlaws possession of guns by convicted felons and another that makes the use of a gun in the commission of a violent felony or drug crime a separate federal offense in addition to any violation of state law...|$|R
