5|$|The {{cover for}} Thriller {{features}} Jackson {{in a white}} suit that belonged to photographer Dick Zimmerman. The gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at Jackson's leg, which Zimmerman reported the singer mostly kept away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> fearing he would be scratched. Another picture from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, {{was used for the}} 2001 special edition of Thriller.|$|E
5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, at {{an event}} at the Serpentine Pavilion in London celebrating the launch of Freedom, Franzen's glasses were stolen <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> by a gate-crasher, who jokingly {{attempted}} to ransom them for $100,000 before being apprehended by police elsewhere in Hyde Park.|$|E

500|$|That {{night the}} Division began to {{withdraw}} in Operation Berlin. [...] Many men shaved and blackened {{their faces and}} Cain [...] removed a week's growth of beard <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> drying himself on his dirty, blood-soaked Denison smock. [...] After successfully crossing the Rhine, this led Brigadier 'Pip' Hicks to comment [...] "there's one officer, at least, who's shaved". Cain's reply was [...] "I was well brought up, sir." [...] Cain made sure all of his men were over the river by dawn, before he himself crossed in an old boat.|$|E
500|$|According to Abu Rahma, {{six minutes}} of his footage {{focused on the}} al-Durrahs. France2 {{broadcast}} 59seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift his hand away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Enderlin said he had cut this scene {{in accordance with the}} France2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes ("agonie"), which he said was [...] "unbearable" [...] ("J'ai coupé l'agonie de l'enfant. C'était insupportable... Cela n'aurait rien apporté de plus). In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word agony, not agonie. If he were editing the footage again, he said in 2005, he would include that scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{line for}} the H2WHOA! ride reproduces the {{staircases}} in the lithograph Ascending and Descending by M. C. Escher. The way Krusty removes the clown make-up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> resembles the way the Joker removes his make-up in the 1989 film Batman. When Homer announces he is going on a diet, he says: [...] "As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again!", {{a reference to the}} famous line [...] "As God is my witness... I'll never be hungry again!" [...] from the film Gone with the Wind. Homer exercises in a way similar to how Rocky exercises in the 1976 film Rocky. The music that plays as Homer approaches the scale is the main theme from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. A copy of Andy Warhol's painting Campbell's Soup Cans is visible at the art gallery.|$|E

500|$|The name of {{the episode}} is a {{reference}} to the 1989 comedy film Weekend at Bernie's, in which two young insurance executives try to convince people that their deceased boss is alive. The last part of the episode, in which Homer and Smithers believe that they have killed Burns, is based on the film's plot. While under the influence of marijuana, Homer shaves his beard, causing blood to pour out <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> To Homer, the blood looks like psychedelic rainbows, and the song that plays during the scene is [...] "Wear Your Love Like Heaven" [...] by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. When speaking at the Phish concert, Homer stands in front of a large picture of himself. The scene is {{a reference to the}} 1941 drama film Citizen Kane, in which the main character Charles Foster Kane makes a political speech in front of a large picture of himself. In another scene, Homer and Smithers smoke marijuana in order to find Mr. Burns' jokes funny. While high, Smithers wears a suit similar to one worn by American actress and singer Judy Garland. While talking to Homer, Smithers forgets to take Mr. Burns out of his bathtub. Horrified, Smithers thinks that the unconscious Mr. Burns has drowned. The scene is a reference to [...] "The Big High", an episode of the television crime drama Dragnet in which a married couple accidentally drown their baby while they are smoking marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|During filming in the {{extremely}} hot summer months, Yuen Wah suffered {{as he was}} not allowed to remove the plastic <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> After several hours in the make-up chair, he would spend the working day unable to move, talk or eat properly. Ironically, Ricky Lau cut out many of Yuen's footage from the finished film, as he felt that too many vampire hopping would slow down the pace.|$|E
2500|$|The crowd {{stood and}} applauded {{for almost two}} minutes. Gehrig was visibly shaken as he {{stepped away from the}} microphone, and wiped the tears away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with his handkerchief. Babe Ruth came over and hugged him as a band played [...] "I Love You Truly" [...] and the crowd chanted, [...] "We love you, Lou". The New York Times account the {{following}} day called it [...] "one of the most touching scenes ever witnessed on a ball field", that made even hard-boiled reporters [...] "swallow hard." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kenji is Hisao's {{neighbor}} in the dorms, who is legally blind, {{being unable to}} see {{anything more than a}} few inches <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He appears to be a hikikomori and very anti-social, claiming to be the [...] "last sane man in an insane world." [...] He often rants about feminist conspiracy theories, claiming that feminists are evil and want to rule the world (these feelings are revealed to stem from his feeling tired after having intercourse with his ex-girlfriend a year before the story starts), among other pointless subjects, possibly rivaling Rin's [...] "uniqueness" [...] in that aspect. Kenji's route is the bad ending of Act 1 if the player does not choose one girl to befriend over the course of Act 1.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens voluntarily {{subjected}} {{himself to}} a filmed demonstration of waterboarding in 2008, an experience which he recounted in Vanity Fair. He was bound on a horizontal board with a black mask over his face. A group of men said to be highly trained in this tactic, who demanded anonymity, carried out the torture. Hitchens was strapped to the board at the chest and feet, face up, and unable to move. Metal objects were placed {{in each of his}} hands, which he could drop if feeling [...] "unbearable stress". The interrogator placed a towel over Hitchens' face, and poured water on it. After 16 seconds, Hitchens threw the metal objects to the floor and the torturers pulled the mask <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> allowing him to breathe. In his article on the topic, he stated [...] "Well, then, if waterboarding does not constitute torture, then {{there is no such thing}} as torture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Porter's {{mother died}} in 1952, and his wife died from {{emphysema}} in 1954. By 1958, Porter's injuries caused a series of ulcers on his right leg. After 34 operations, {{it had to be}} amputated and replaced with an artificial limb. [...] His friend Noël Coward visited him in the hospital and wrote in his diary, [...] "The lines of ceaseless pain have been wiped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face....</b> I am convinced that his whole life will cheer up and that his work will profit accordingly." [...] In fact, Porter never wrote another song after the amputation and spent the remaining six years of his life in relative seclusion, seeing only intimate friends. He continued to live in the Waldorf Towers in New York in his memorabilia-filled apartment. On weekends he often visited an estate in the Berkshires, and he stayed in California during the summers.|$|E

2500|$|According to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, [...] "Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll." [...] Being {{the first}} popular singer {{to make a}} {{spectacular}} event out of singing a song, he became a rock star before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience. He would {{run up and down}} the runway, and across the stage, [...] "teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience", often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the [...] "perspiration would be pouring <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and the entire audience would {{get caught up in the}} ecstasy of his performance". According to music historian Larry Stempel, [...] "No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway." [...] Author Stephen Banfield agreed, writing that Jolson's style was [...] "arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical".|$|E
2500|$|Rapier was {{promoted}} to Sergeant-Major of the battalion, in which capacity he fought in the Battle of Williamsburg and in the Seven Days battles. During the Battle of Frayser's Farm, June 30, 1862, part of the Seven Day's campaign, he was blinded temporarily by a shell exploding inches <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> In August, his battalion was divided and his company became Company E of the Confederate States Zouave Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers. On August 12, this organization became part of Starke's Brigade of Taliaferro's Division. Rapier continued to serve as sergeant major. He then saw action at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Battle of Antietam and Fredericksburg, before his battalion was transferred to southeastern Virginia. In January, he {{was promoted}} to first lieutenant and adjutant of his battalion. In March, it is reported that Secretary Mallory offered him a commission in the Confederate Marine Corps, but Rapier did not initially accept it. However, several weeks later he took the examination, passed and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, dated July 11, 1863.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} {{about the history of}} American screenwriting, Marc Norman wrote that the Ince studio, where Sullivan was the lead writer, was the first to use the {{screenplay}} as the blueprint for the entire production, marking a departure from earlier productions in which the [...] "screenplay" [...] was simply [...] "a one-page précis of the film's narrative." [...] Indeed, Sullivan's scripts detailed locations, the number of actors, costumes, and even the blocking of the shoot. [...] Norman pointed to the following excerpt from the Hell's Hinges script {{as an example of the}} directorial detail contained in Sullivan's work:"SCENE L: Close-Up on Bar in Western SaloonA group of good western types of the earlier period are drinking at the bar and talking idly -- much good fellowship prevails and every man feels at ease with his neighbor -- one of them glances off the picture and the smile fades <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> to be replaced by the strained look of worry -- the others notice the change and follow his gaze -- their face reflect his own emotions -- be sure to get over a good contrast between the easy good nature that had prevailed and the unnatural, strained silence that follows -- as they look, cut." ...|$|E

2500|$|Austin {{spoke about}} Bret Hart, {{challenging}} him constantly and taunting him relentlessly. Hart finally accepted Austin's challenge {{and returned to}} the WWF in October 1996. At Survivor Series, in a match to determine the number-one contender to the WWF Championship, Hart pinned Austin when Hart used the turnbuckle to push himself backwards while locked in the Million Dollar Dream and pinned Austin (this match would go on to create the foundations for the eventual year-long feud between the two). The match came hot on the heels of an incident broadcast live on Raw Is War, which saw Austin [...] "break into" [...] Brian Pillman's house, with Pillman holding a gun. During the 1997 Royal Rumble match, Austin was originally eliminated by Bret Hart, but the officials did not see it, and he snuck back into the ring and eliminated Hart by throwing him over the ropes, winning the match himself. This led to the first-ever pay-per-view main event of Austin's WWF career at , after Shawn Michaels suffered a knee injury and left the WWF Championship suddenly vacant. Austin was eliminated early from the four-way match at In Your House 13 for the title after injuring his own knee, but was involved in the finish which saw Hart win his fourth WWF Championship, which he lost the next night on Raw Is War to Sycho Sid due to Austin's interference, continuing his feud with Hart. At WrestleMania 13, Hart defeated Austin in a Submission match with Ken Shamrock as a special referee. During the match, Austin had been cut and was bleeding profusely <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> but he still refused to tap out when Hart locked in his Sharpshooter. Austin finally passed out from blood loss, still held in the Sharpshooter, and lost the match. After the bell, Hart continued to hold the Sharpshooter on Austin, who despite his wounds refused any assistance back to the locker room, thus turning Hart heel and Austin babyface in a rare double-turn. However, Austin portrayed an anti-hero instead of a traditional babyface. Austin eventually got his revenge on Hart in the main event of , in a match to determine the number-one contender to The Undertaker's WWF Championship. Austin won when Hart was disqualified due to assistance from The British Bulldog, earning him a title match against The Undertaker at [...] Austin faced Hart once again in a street fight on the April 21 episode of Raw Is War, injuring his opponent's leg with a steel chair during the bout. The match was ruled a no contest, but Austin proceeded to beat Hart while he was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance. At A Cold Day In Hell, Austin had The Undertaker down with the Stone Cold Stunner, but distracted by timely interference on the part of Brian Pillman, Austin's old tag team partner, who rang the bell before Austin got the cover, Undertaker then nailed Austin with a Tombstone Piledriver and achieved the victory off the distraction.|$|E
