25|$|It was {{announced}} on August 14, 2013, that bus-issued transfers (magnetic strip paper cards) {{would continue to}} be <b>issued</b> <b>for</b> <b>cash</b> fares paid on buses, but that these transfers would not work at SkyTrain or SeaBus station fare gates, which require the Compass Card. This means that a bus rider paying cash is required to pay a second fare to transfer to SkyTrain or SeaBus. Those transit users paying cash but beginning their trips at a SkyTrain or SeaBus station are not subject to this second fare because they are issued paper-based Compass Tickets which are accepted as valid transfers on TransLink buses.|$|R

Mattel's investment in Western soon soured. In fiscal 1983 (ending January 31, 1983) Western had sales of $246 million with an operating loss of $2.4 million after a $7.5 million charge relating to closing the Poughkeepsie printing plant. Mattel had its own financial <b>issues</b> and, strapped <b>for</b> <b>cash,</b> sold Western in December 1983 to Richard A. Bernstein, a New York City real estate investor, for $75 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities later thought to be $40 million. Bernstein reincorporated the firm as the Western Publishing Group; Western Publishing Co., now a subsidiary, continued to be based in Racine.|$|R
50|$|The lettres de cachets {{issued in}} the king's name were {{likewise}} nullified. The {{war of words}} was thereby retracted on both sides. Troops raised by the Parlement were to be disbanded and the King's {{to be returned to}} their customary garrisons. The Bastille and the Paris Arsenal, which had been seized by the forces of the Parlement, were to be returned to royal control. As for the envoy from the archduke Leopold, Philip IV’s representative in the Spanish Netherlands, who was offering Habsburg aid, poised to invade the north of France as a result of negotiations {{on the part of the}} prince de Conti, he was to be sent away from Paris without a response from the Parlement. Conti, a prince of the blood who was at the head of the noble faction that still claimed to represent the Parlement de Paris, was pardoned, as well as all those others who had taken part; all were to be free of prosecution for their roles, if they would declare for the settlement within four days. A general pardon was <b>issued</b> <b>for</b> all <b>cash</b> taken or property sold during the insurrection.|$|R
2500|$|Testifying {{before the}} House of Commons Ethics Committee on December 13, 2007, Mulroney said the <b>cash</b> {{payments}} were <b>for</b> lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from Thyssen industries, a company Schreiber represented.

Mulroney said he never had a written contract, made written reports, or <b>issued</b> receipts <b>for</b> the <b>cash</b> payments. Mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash. Mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing. He admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety. Mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as [...] "a near death experience" [...] and said his family had suffered greatly.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{shareholders}} of ordinary companies, mutual fund shareholders do not sell their shares ? they redeem {{them from the}} <b>issuing</b> funds <b>for</b> <b>cash.</b> We argue that this unique form of exit almost completely eliminates mutual fund investors 2 ̆ 7 incentives to use voting, boards, and fee liability. Investors will almost never become active in their funds even if the investors are large and sophisticated and even if most of the mutual fund market is not competitive. We also catalogue a number of unintended and harmful ways in which exit distorts voting, boards, and fee liability. Exit interacts with voting, for example, to make firing managers impossible and to prevent investors from receiving notice of fee increases. Exit also interacts with fee liability to cause recoveries {{to go to the}} wrong investors and to discourage investors from moving to lower-fee funds. Though exit gives investors a powerful tool to protect their interests, the net effect of exit on many investors is ambiguous, because investors who do not use their rights to leave underperforming funds cannot expect activism by other investors to improve the funds. Ultimately, exit causes mutual funds to look more like products than like ordinary companies. Voting, boards, and fee liability therefore have limited value, and whatever benefits they now achieve could be achieved more effectively and at lower cost by product-style regulation that applies automatically without investor action or that prompts investors to use exit rights effectively...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDespite {{the growing}} {{importance}} of the debit card in most developed countries, there are relatively few academic studies that analyze the impact of such evolution on the demand <b>for</b> <b>cash.</b> Beyond data availability, this research {{is complicated by the}} fact that the debit card provides two services <b>for</b> consumers - <b>cash</b> withdrawal and payment - that have contrasting effects on cash holdings and cash usage. Using micro-level data, we estimate the impacts of both services on the demand <b>for</b> <b>cash</b> by comparing the cash holdings and cash usage of three populations, namely non-cardholders, ATM-only cardholders, and debit cardholders. Controlling for various individual and network characteristics as well as a possible endogeneity issue, we find that the negative effect of the payment service on the demand <b>for</b> <b>cash</b> dominates the positive effect of the cash withdrawal service resulting in an overall negative impact of the debit card on the demand <b>for</b> <b>cash...</b>|$|R
