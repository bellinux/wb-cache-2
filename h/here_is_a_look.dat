In 1934, when hotel keeping in India was in its infancy, M. S. Oberoi became the first Indian national to enter the hotel field by acquiring Clarkes Hotel in Simla. Previously, hotels in India were owned by British and Swiss families and catered mainly to British residents. M. S. Oberoi expanded his group of hotels, and in 1965, he introduced the first five-star deluxe hotel in India-the Oberoi Inter-Continental in New Delhi. He also began international expansion in the ’ 60 s, opening the Soaltee Oberoi in Kathmandu and managing the historic Mena House hotel in Cairo. Today, Oberoi operates hotels in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Australia, and Iraq. In addition to the hotels, Oberoi Hotels has a substantial in-flight catering business, operates airport restaurants, has an expanding export company, and runs one of India’s largest travel agencies, Mercury Travels. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the Oberoi hotel chain and family...|$|E

He couldn't trim the sheet to save himself, he nearly capsized several times in squalls, and, once again, by blunderingly jibing over; he didn't know what <b>a</b> centre-board <b>was</b> for, nor did he know that in running a boat before the wind one must sit in the middle instead of on the side; and finally, when we came back to the wharf, he ran the skiff in full tilt, shattering her nose and carrying away the mast-step.

In HoFH, LDL-C levels exceed 800 mg/dL beginning in infancy, leading to premature coronary heart disease. Current guidelines for the treatment of FH recommend at least a 50 percent reduction in LDL-C levels, with statins as the preferred initial treatment in both adults and children. While patients with HeFH usually respond very well to statin treatment, the response rate in HoFH is usually less predictable.

During what would be the final days for some, he offered his ministry not from a pulpit but on the battlefields [...] in hot landing zones and rice paddies, in hospitals, aboard ship, and knee-deep in mud. He even found time for baptisms in the muddy Mekong River. "You've never really lived until you've almost died," writes Johnson, one of the youngest army chaplains at the time. Through his compelling narration, he takes us into the hearts of frightened young boys and the minds of experienced men. In Combat Chaplain, we live for eight and one-half months with Johnson as he serves in the field with a small unit numbering 350 men. The physical price can be counted with numbers [...] ninety-six killed and over nine hundred wounded.

It will still be useful to identify the root and quality of <b>a</b> chord. It <b>is</b> more important, however, to think of chords as collections of scale degree numbers or do-re-mi solfege syllables related to the tonic. Depending on the type of chord in which it is used, each scale degree likes to behave in different ways. We will identify these behaviors by their classification, called a scale-degree function. Harmonic Functions More than any other pitch, the bass note will determine the harmonic function of a chord. A harmonic function tells us how a chord behaves as part of the normal syntax of a phrase. All chords may be classified as tonic (T), subdominant (S), or dominant (D). Tonic chords are relatively stable, contain at least scale degree 1 or 3, and tend to be used {{at the beginning and end}} of a piece of music. Subdominant chords tend to push forward toward cadence points and frequently contain scale degree 4 or 6. Dominant chords are relatively unstable and contain at least scale degree 5 or 7.

40|$|I {{initially}} {{started to}} look at Chinese landscape painting when {{it was suggested that}} my paintings looked and felt vaguely similar to traditional Chinese painting. The more I looked and read about these images the more I felt myself drawn to them. Apart from the obviously impressive painterly qualities I was impressed by the self-evident belief in the relevance of their painting not only on a cultural level but as a means to self discovery and enlightenment. These paintings meant something to both artist and viewer and the contemplation and understanding of nature (landscape) <b>were</b> <b>a</b> key to this understanding. For a long time I had been bemoaning the fact that landscape in art today seemed to <b>be</b> dismissed as <b>a</b> 19 th century irrelevancy when it most definitely was not to me. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> chance to <b>look</b> at <b>a</b> time when the landscape was of utmost importance to the wellbeing of a culture, to understand what it was that made this the case, and to see if what I myself was obtaining from the landscape had any precedent and ultimately, I suppose, any relevance to the late 20 th century. Having said this, I myself have serious problems with the vast majority of today's landscape painting which seems not to be about the land but rather an idea of what the land might be or mean. There is no serious involvement with the land itself which is neatly packaged away as 'a construct of the mind'. Chinese art, especially of the Sung period, seemed at least to be acknowledging that something could be learnt from interaction with the land. This is how I felt myself to be relating to the land; I needed physically to be in it in order to experience it. I have decided to concentrate on several works from the Northern and Southern Sung periods. I have limited myself to these six as they seem to me to be representative of the general style of this time. In an essay of this length it seems preferable to concentrate in some depth on the main styles of painting rather than to skim over many of them, while including the transitional paintings, those reviving previous styles and those individualists working in isolation from mainstream culture. I intend to provide a brief background to the Sung period in its historical context while drawing attention to the cultural relevance of landscape painting at this time...|$|R

5000|$|A taciturn, white-blonde Virginian bricklayer, and {{the husband}} of Mildred. On the {{character}} of Richard, Nichols stated, [...] "Richard speaks in a clipped manner, then it's the way he holds his head {{in front of the}} rest of the body, how self-conscious he seemed in front of the camera. He'd laugh and quickly cover his lips over his tobacco-stained teeth. He's a bricklayer ... they're hunched over all day long, and they turn their bodies into these assembly lines for laying brick. What I gave Edgerton, in terms of coherent character on the page, he added specificity." [...] When describing Richard, Edgerton stated that he [...] "... <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quiet hero, and sometimes quiet dignity speaks louder than the typical movie hero who's all too eager to fight." [...] He spoke of some of the challenges in portraying Richard, such as the Virginian accent, in which he stated, [...] "The importance of the story itself, not to treat it with kid gloves but to maintain a reverence for the truth, for the responsibility we felt toward these real people. And conveying so much with so few words was one of the biggest challenges." [...] To capture the physical quality of Richard, Edgerton bleached his hair, adopted a receding hairline, and wore prosthetic teeth. He spoke of the influences in Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (1988), recommended by Nichols, which assisted in his finding of Richard's accent. He was drawn to Nichols' version of the character, as according to him he was: [...] "just shut down and emasculated and weathered by this situation" [...] while Edgerton noted the version was keeping more in line with the man in Buirski's The Loving Story (2011). Both Nichols and Edgerton felt the main challenge of bringing Richard to the screen was the question of where he fell on the intellectual spectrum, as Richard was not well educated nor naturally gifted, and may not have understood the case's complexities or its social ramifications, with both actor and director holding conversations on the subject. Edgerton spoke of Richard, the difficulty in holding an accent with a taciturn approach, while referring to roles of the past: [...] "With a character like John Connolly of Black Mass (2015), you really get to fly on the rhythm of an accent, and the rhythm <b>is</b> so much <b>a</b> part of what <b>an</b> accent <b>is.</b> When you don’t have much to say, it’s hard to latch onto that cadence." [...] Edgerton also involved himself in bricklaying to prepare for the role, and while speaking of his experience he remarked that he began to fully understood Richard's posture: [...] "Suddenly it made sense because of the mechanics of his work ... <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man who <b>looked</b> awkward in his own body because he was so used to conserving energy. A man who slumped because he spent his days hunched over a pile of bricks." [...] In an interview with People, Edgerton spoke of Richard and Mildred's daughter Peggy: [...] "Peggy is as shy as her father and we were really just hoping for her acceptance and her blessing, which I think we got. One day on set she called me ‘Daddy’ and it was like the greatest blessing I’ve ever had." ...|$|R
