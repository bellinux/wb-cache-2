Beginning in the 11th century, knighthood developed a religious character. Prospective knights underwent rigorous religious rituals {{in order to be}} initiated. An initiate had to fast, confess his sins, was given a symbolic bath, had his hair cut to represent humility, and he spent a night praying, his weapons upon an altar representing the dedication of his weapons to the Church and God. Advancements in metallurgy allowed inscriptions and pictures of holy symbols to be engraved on helmets, swords, shields, and other <b>equipment.</b> The <b>symbols</b> allowed for a physical reminder to knights and military men that God was supporting their efforts, providing protection to those soldiers as well as the assurance of a victory over their enemies.|$|R

Currently, with the increased range of Internet search websites and its high number of access, a few images and symbols which connote or denote medical sites can be seized from a simple search.

When not represented by these instruments, the doctor is very portrayed and remembered by the exercise of their profession. Although there is controversy about the figure of the medical professional, is customarily stigmatization and constant media appeal to pass the idea of a professional distance, the doctor is seen as someone who often comforting or is in close contact with your patient...|$|R
