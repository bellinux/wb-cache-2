5|$|Like the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament (1999), the game includes almost every character from past Tekken games, {{giving it the}} largest playable roster in a Tekken game to date. Players can choose either a team of two characters on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> a solo character. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been positively received by critics, earning averaged review scores {{in the range of}} 82-83% at both GameRankings and Metacritic for the PlayStation 3, Wii U and Xbox 360 versions, as well as several fighting-game-of-the-year awards.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} backed by both an six-member {{instrumental}} band and a complement of ten backup dancers (five male and five female). The band would sometimes split up and perform with one member to <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> corner of the stage, but {{for much of the}} show, they performed to one side at a time, circling the stage (often as part of the choreographed dancing) throughout each song. The backup dancers sometimes performed for opposite side of the stage as the band. A video feed of the show was shown on video screens circling the overhead lighting rig.|$|E

2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament of the PBB {{consisted of}} five powered turrets, equipped with Browning [...]50 M2 machine guns. They were {{installed in the}} nose, in the tail, on the upper fuselage just aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, and in two waist positions at the rear fuselage. Except for the waist guns, the turrets had two guns each. Offensive armament could consist of up to 20,000lb of bombs in internal bomb bays in the wing center section (five bays on <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> of two Mk.13 or Mk.15 torpedoes slung under the wing center section.|$|E
2500|$|Tennis {{is played}} on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77m) long, and [...] wide for singles matches and [...] for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is {{required}} in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can {{be no more than}} [...] The net is [...] high at the posts and [...] high in the center.

2500|$|Lomborg {{considers}} {{pollution from}} different angles. He notes that {{air pollution in}} wealthy nations has steadily decreased in recent decades. He finds that air pollution levels are highly linked to economic development, with moderately developed countries polluting most. Again, Lomborg argues that faster growth in emerging countries would help them reduce their air pollution levels. Lomborg suggests that devoting resources to reduce the levels of specific air pollutants would provide the greatest health benefits and save {{the largest number of}} lives (per amount of money spent), continuing an already decades-long improvement in air quality in most developed countries. [...] Concerning water pollution, Lomborg notes again that it is connected with economic progress. He also notes that water pollution in major Western rivers decreased rapidly after the use of sewage systems became widespread. Concerning waste, Lomborg notes once again that fears are overblown, as the entire waste produced by the United States in the 21st century could fit into a square 100 feet thick and 28km along <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 0.009% of the total surface of the United States.|$|E

50|$|Footwraps are {{typically}} square, rectangular or less often triangular. They measure about 40 cm on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> if square <b>or</b> about 75 cm on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> if triangular. Thinner cloth may be folded {{to produce a}} square, rectangular or triangular shape after folding. Russian army footwraps were made of flannel for use in winter and of cotton for use in summer.|$|R
50|$|A fully grown box {{jellyfish}} can {{measure up to}} 20 cm along <b>each</b> box <b>side</b> (<b>or</b> 30 cm in diameter), and the tentacles can grow up to 3 m in length. Its weight can reach 2 kg. There are about 15 tentacles on each corner. Each tentacle has about 500,000 cnidocytes, containing nematocysts, a harpoon-shaped microscopic mechanism that injects venom into the victim. Many different kinds of nematocysts are found in cubozoans.|$|R
50|$|Small wheels {{used for}} steering, either one to <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> a single unit either {{in front of}} or behind the vehicle. It {{is a matter of}} debate as to whether such a vehicle would still {{properly}} be called a monowheel.|$|E

50|$|As well, {{the wars}} with Philip of France and James of Majorca {{furnished}} material for new sirventesos and {{during this period}} the sirventes was converted into a convenient tool of political propaganda in which <b>each</b> <b>side</b> could, directly <b>or</b> allegorically, present its case and procure sympathy propitious to its cause.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 km3 {{means one}} cubic {{kilometre}} or {{the volume of}} a cube that measures 1000 m on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> 109 m3 (as opposed to 1000 cubic meters, which is the volume of a cube that measures 10 m on each side).|$|E
50|$|To further {{balance the}} forces {{and spread out}} strain, a single large {{flywheel}} can be balanced by two half-size flywheels on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> the flywheels can be reduced in size to be a series of alternating layers spinning in opposite directions. However this increases housing and bearing complexity.|$|E
5000|$|Brunoise is {{a culinary}} knife cut {{in which the}} food item is first julienned and then turned a quarter turn and diced again, {{producing}} cubes of about 3 mm or less on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/8-inch dice. In France, a [...] "brunoise" [...] cut is smaller, 1 to 2 mm on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/16-inch dice. Some typical vegetables for a brunoise are carrots, celery, leeks, and turnips. The diced vegetables are blanched briefly in salty boiling water and then submerged in salted ice water {{for a few seconds}} to set the color. The brunoise is used as a garnish in many dishes; it is often used to garnish consommé. A brunoise should be consistent in size and shape, as this helps to create a pleasing and professional presentation.|$|E
25|$|Club cricket, by far {{and away}} the widest form of cricket played worldwide, is largely amateur, but still formal, cricket, with the teams {{organised}} into leagues. The games are sometimes limited-overs, with each innings usually lasting between twenty and fifty overs. Other matches are played to time restrictions. Restrictions in overs or time may be placed on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> individually, <b>or</b> they may stipulate the total length of the match. The latter more traditional case is often known as declaration cricket.|$|R
50|$|In shogi, Double Wing Attack {{or simply}} Wing Attack or Centre Game (相掛かり aigakari) is a Double Static Rook (相居飛車) opening {{in which both}} sides play Static Rook (居飛車) by {{directly}} advancing their rook pawns (歩) forward toward their opponent's bishop (角) with the first several moves on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> being identical <b>or</b> very similar.|$|R
50|$|In {{marsupials}} and placental mammals, {{the uterus}} becomes lined by an endometrium, {{and is more}} developed than in egg-laying amniotes. In many placental mammals, the uteri of <b>each</b> <b>side</b> become partially <b>or</b> wholly fused into a single organ, although in marsupials they remain completely separate. In mammals, {{the portion of the}} oviduct above the uterus {{is referred to as the}} Fallopian tube.|$|R
50|$|False {{balance is}} a media bias in which journalists present an issue {{as being more}} {{balanced}} between opposing viewpoints than the evidence supports. Journalists may present evidence and arguments {{out of proportion to}} the actual evidence for <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> may omit information that would establish one side's claims as baseless.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{field has}} at least one marker at each corner, on the centre line at each side, and 10 metres from each back line on each side. The goals consist of a marker on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> some {{mechanism}} at least half a metre deep to catch the ball [...]|$|E
50|$|With the canting keel {{handling}} the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering {{can be managed}} separately with a foil (or pair of foils, either on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> fore and aft), such as daggerboards. This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats, with about half the weight usually required for ballast.|$|E
50|$|In osteichthyes, {{the gills}} contain 4 gill arches on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the head, two on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> for chondrichthyes <b>or</b> 7 gill baskets on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the fish's head in Lampreys.In fish, the long bony {{cover for the}} gill (the operculum) {{can be used for}} pushing water. Some fish pump water using the operculum. Without an operculum, other methods, such as ram ventilation, are required. Some species of sharks use this system. When they swim, water flows into the mouth and across the gills. Because these sharks rely on this technique, they must keep {{swimming}} in order to respire.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{commemorative}} plaques {{similar to}} those used in Europe are called historical markers. These vary in colour and design by state. The National Trust for Historic Preservation or the U.S. government, through the National Register of Historic Places, can bestow historical status, with a small bronze marker affixed to the building. Other markers are erected by state historical commissions and similar authorities, local governments or civic groups. These can also be affixed to the building, but are frequently free-standing markers with the text on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> -- <b>or,</b> in larger instances, beginning on one side and continuing to the other.|$|R
50|$|Double Wing Attack (相掛かり aigakari) is a Double Static Rook opening {{where both}} sides play Static Rook {{with the first}} several moves on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> being {{identical}} <b>or</b> very similar. Both sides advance their bishop pawns to the e rank. Then, golds are moved to defend each bishop's head. Afterwards, pawns on both rook files exchange. Then, the joseki branches off into several different josekis and strategies.|$|R
