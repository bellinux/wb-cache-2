40|$|The {{nonlinear}} collapse {{behavior of}} long cylindrical shell structures {{subject to a}} bending load only or combined bending and uniform normal pressure loads is studied using the STAGS computer code. Two modes of nonlinear collapse are investigated to determine maximum strength. One mode of collapse is described by circumferential <b>flattening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> cross section, while the other mode is represented by axial wrinkling {{in the region of}} maximum compression. Results compare favorably with available published data for cylinders loaded by pure bending, and results are presented for combined loads which have not been previously reported. The collapse loads obtained in this study show that current design criteria are conservative except for a narrow range of length-to-radius ratios and pressures...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{reported}} in the literature are reproduced using numerical simulations to investigate {{the early stages of the}} breakup of water cylinders in the flow behind normal shocks. Qualitative features of breakup observed in the numerical results, such as the initial streamwise <b>flattening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the formation of tips at its periphery, support previous experimental observations of stripping breakup. Additionally, the presence of a transitory recirculation region at the cylinder’s equator and a persistent upstream jet in the wake is noted and discussed. Within the uncertainties inherent to the different methods used to extract measurements from experimental and numerical results, comparisons with experimental data of various cylinder deformation metrics show good agreement. To study the effects of the transition between subsonic and supersonic post-shock flow, we extend the range of incident shock Mach numbers beyond those investigated by the experiments. Supersonic post-shock flow velocities are not observed to significantly alter the cylinder’s behavior, i. e., we are able to effectively collapse the drift, acceleration, and drag curves for all simulated shock Mach numbers. Using a new method that minimizes noise errors, the cylinder’s acceleration is calculated; acceleration curves for all shock Mach numbers are subsequently collapsed by scaling with the pressure ratio across the incident shock. Furthermore, we find that accounting for the cylinder’s deformed diameter in the calculation of its unsteady drag coefficient allows the drag coefficient to be approximated as a constant over the initial breakup period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} capturing images of books with a handheld 3 D stereo camera, which performs dewarping to produce images that are flattened. A Fujifilm consumer grade 3 D camera provides a highly mobile and low-cost 3 D capture device. Applying standard computer vision algorithms, camera calibration is performed, the captured images are stereo rectified, and the depth information is computed by block matching. Due to technical limitations, the resulting point cloud has defects such as splotches and noise, which {{make it hard to}} recover the precise 3 D locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> points on the book pages. We address this problem by computing curve profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depth map and using them to build a <b>cylinder</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pages. We then employ meshes to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>flattening</b> and rendering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> model in virtual space.

At low-incident wave frequencies, although <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> to <b>the</b> wavelength were small, <b>the</b> oscillating <b>cylinder</b> had little influence on the flow field. <b>The</b> numerical responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> were in very good agreement with the experimental data. As <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming wave increased, the diffraction effect caused by <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> became significant, and <b>the</b> simulated responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> were slightly weaker than those <b>of</b> experiment.
