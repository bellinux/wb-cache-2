40|$|International audienceStudies were {{conducted}} on 41 five yr-old common beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings collected in an old-growth beech wood (Fontainebleau <b>forest,</b> <b>biological</b> <b>reserve</b> of La Tillaie, France), under varying humus and light conditions, following gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillar injuries. Aerial and subterranean parts of each sapling were described by means of 34 parameters and environmental conditions at the microsite, where each sapling was excavated, were characterized by 23 parameters. The development of beech saplings is strongly affected by microsite conditions. An increase in sapling size was associated with darkness of the A-horizon, typical of zones with poor mineralization of organic matter. Light conditions were more important in influencing {{the development of the}} root system than that of the aerial parts. Rooting depth was shallower and rate of mycorrhiza development by the black ascomycete Cenococcum geophilum was lower in microsites receiving incident light during the morning than in those never receiving incident light during this period. Results are discussed in the frame of survival of young beech individuals in varying environmental conditions, when submitted to competition by other vegetation and adverse climate conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceForty plots were {{selected}} in an old-growth beech <b>forest</b> (<b>Biological</b> <b>Reserve</b> of La Tillaie, Fontainebleau State Forest, France), {{to embrace the}} whole range of site conditions and phases of vegetation dynamics. Soils are sandy, thus the nutrient status of the topsoil is very poor except when trees have access to an underlying limestone layer. The study was focused on the role of calcium in the sustainability of the beech ecosystem. Calcium is mostly redistributed through leaf litter accretion and the activity of litter-consuming organisms, but other sources are fallen wood and uprooted mounds. In each of the 40 plots, earthworm species were sampled, and measurements were taken in order to describe humus profiles, growth of adult trees, litter quantity and quality, and access to lime. Densities of soil-dwelling earthworms, calcium content of beech leaf litter, height of tallest tries and depth of the limestone layer were correlated, indicating a gradient of soil fertility which mainly results from long-term interactions between soil organisms and trees in varying geological conditions. Possible causal relationships and implications of calcium turnover for nature conservation were discussed in the light of existing knowledge...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The major {{objective}} of this work was to map the research units and the infrastructure available in the Embrapa Cerrados experimental farm in Planaltina, Federal District. More than 190 identities were observed and mapped {{through the use of}} GPS portable receiver with an accuracy of about five meters. The UTM coordinates obtained by the GPS were stored in a Geographical Information System (GIS) to generate polygons, lines and points of those identities. A set of these GPS coordinates were also used as the control points for georreferencing the thematic maps founds in the Atlas od CPAC) soils, slope, geomorphology, natural vegetation, <b>forest</b> resources and <b>biological</b> <b>reserves).</b> This study showed that the use of GPS receivers and the resources available in a GIS software package are sufficient to conduct experimental farm mappings with required precision and detail for their management. 200...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{study of}} natural post-fire {{succession}} {{was carried out}} in a disturbed vegetation around fragments of the Atlantic Rain <b>Forest</b> (National <b>Biological</b> <b>Reserve</b> of Poço das Antas (22 ° 30 ’- 22 ° 33 ’S, 42 ° 15 ’- 42 ° 19 ’W), Rio de Janeiro State). All the pre-fire individuals of Cecropia and Trema in the area were numbered with plastic labels. In order to check for the presence of new sprouts and mortality, two other censuses were carried out, at 3 and 12 months after the fire. The dominant species were: Pteridium aquilinum, Panicum maximum, Trema micrantha and Cecropia glazioui. Few days after the passage of fire, grasses and ferns spread their area, while the stands of Trema and Cecropia were completely burned. Most of individuals of Cecropia produced some sprouts while most of individuals of Trema died. However, a great number of seedlings of Trema were recruited while only one single seedling of Cecropia were observed during a period of one year. Most of these seedlings died through the year while the sprouts were already reproducing. The uses of Cecropia in places where fire is recurrent could be more appropriate because of its higher chance of survival and faster recovering ability afte...|$|R
40|$|The {{areas of}} {{conservation}} and {{settlement of the}} Amazon have suffered {{a significant increase in}} the rate of deforestation. The conversion of forests into areas for other uses creates a variety of impacts on biodiversity. The research aimed to analyze the behavior of deforestation in the southeastern of the state of Para, covering areas of the northeastern city of Sao Felix do Xingu and west of the municipalities of Maraba and Parauapebas. We considered all existing units of Conservation (Indigenous Lands, National <b>Forests</b> and <b>Biological</b> <b>Reserves)</b> and settlements of the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). This study has been done from data of PRODES with the acquisition of images from the years of 1997 to 2003. The data were adjusted to the vectors of the Conservation Units. The overlap of these vectors on the images in the program ArcGIS allowed an intersection between the polygons that comprise the area of study and data from deforestation to calculate the percentage of deforestation in these areas. With this information has been generated a database on the deforested area, the potential for partial and total deforestation. Thus, the database could be spatialized and consultations could be done selecting only the information that is requested. Pages: 6289 - 629...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{analysed}} pollen and charcoal in a lake-sediment core from Laguna Zoncho, a small mid-elevation lake in southernmost Costa Rica. The record provides {{evidence of}} 3000 years of human occupation, forest clearance, agriculture and {{fires in the}} area. Laguna Zoncho is located 2 km from the Las Cruces Biological Station, and results are relevant to understanding the likely extent of prehistoric disturbance within the premon-tane rain <b>forests</b> of this <b>biological</b> <b>reserve.</b> Pollen grains of Zea mays in the basal sediments of the Zoncho core constitute the oldest botanical evidence of maize cultivation in southern Costa Rica. The presence of maize pollen in almost every sample analysed indicates nearly continuous occupation of the lake basin for 3000 years. Charcoal abundances and percentages of pollen grains and spores of forest and disturbance taxa fluctuate strongly downcore, reflecting variable intensities of past human impact. Forest clearance and burning by indigenous people were most marked between 3240 and 460 cal. yr BP. Sediments deposited subsequently indicate forest regeneration and few, if any, fires. However, indigenous cultivation of maize continued {{on a small scale}} until European settlement in the twentieth century...|$|R
40|$|During the micrometeorological {{experiment}} {{carried out}} during the WETAMC Campaign (from 26 / 01 to 10 / 03) measurements of solar radiation were made on a tropical <b>forest</b> environment, at <b>Biological</b> <b>Reserve</b> of Jaru, RO (10 0 05  S; 61 0 56  W). Short wave radiation flux were collected using Kipp & Zonen pyranometers and photosintetically active radiation flux (PAR), using LICOR quantum sensors, {{on the top of}} a 60 m tower, and at 5 levels (35, 30, 25, 15, 10 and 5 meters) inside the canopy, by a set of 12 pyranometers and 12 quantum sensors, distributed on three sides (South, East and West) of the tower. The behaviors of incident short wave radiation and PAR were studied along the vertical profile for days with different cloud cover. Results showed that, on average, the solar radiation did not present substantial percentile differences from one level to another, when comparing days with different cloud cover. In other words, independently on days cloudiness condition, the percentile profile of solar radiation inside the forest presented approximately the same percentile extinction coefficient.
