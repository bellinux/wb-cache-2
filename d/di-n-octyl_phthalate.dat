METHODS: Dust samples from the child’s bedroom were collected. A total of 102 children (2 – 7 years of age) had symptoms of wheezing, rhinitis, and/or eczema in preceding 12 months (cases), and 82 were nonsymptomatic (controls). The dust samples were analyzed for their content of dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and <b>di-n-octyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DnOP).

The MNPs were 20 nm in diameter and had a high magnetic saturation value (52 emu g(- 1)), which endowed the sorbent with a large surface area and the convenience of isolation from water samples. Phthalate esters could be extracted by the interior octadecyl groups through hydrophobic interaction. The hydrophilic porous chitosan polymer coating promoted the dispersion of MNPs in water samples, and improved the anti-interference ability of the sorbent without influencing the adsorption of analytes. The main factors affecting the adsorption of phthalate esters, including the pH of the solution, humic acid, sample loading volume, adsorption time, and desorption conditions, were investigated and optimized.

Three phthalate esters (di-methyl phthalate [DMP], di-iso-butyl phthalate [DIBP], and <b>di-n-octyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> [DNOP]) were chosen as model chemicals because they represent a gradient of lipophilicity but are otherwise structurally similar. Overall, the more lipophilic phthalates (DIBP and DNOP) {{were found to have}} higher concentrations in tissues than the less lipophilic DMP. Significant differences in tissue concentrations between DIBP and DNOP were tissue-dependent, suggesting that delivery to a site of action following exposure is not only a simple function of lipophilicity. In dermal treatments, DMP usually had fewer detections (except in ventral skin samples), suggesting that lipophilicity (log Kow. 2) is a requirement for uptake across the skin. In general, tissue residues were greater in oral treatments than dermal treatments (significant in adipose and liver tissue), but differences were driven strongly by differences in DMP which {{did not appear to be}} absorbed well across skin. When differences in tissue residue concentrations between oral and dermal exposure did occur, the difference was not drastic. Taken together these results suggest tha...|$|E
40|$|The hepatic {{effects of}} {{phthalate}} esters and related compounds on peroxisomal and microsomal enzyme activities were investigated in the intact animal and in primary hepatocyte cultures. In vitro studies {{with a series}} of phthalate monoesters demonstrated structure activity differences in the induction of the specific peroxisomal marker KCN-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation and also of carnitine acetyltransferase. These effects could be reproduced in vivo, and potency differences were also observed between di(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and its straight-chain isomer, <b>di-n-octyl</b> <b>phthalate.</b> In in vivo studies, DEHP, mono(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, and clofibrate/clofibric acid produced large increases in liver size and peroxisomal enzyme activities in Sprague-Dawley rats and Chinese hamsters, but had less effect in Syrian hamsters. These effects could be largely reproduced in vitro where good responses were obtained with rat and Chinese hamster hepatocytes, but either little or no effect with Syrian hamster and Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig hepatocytes. Both DEHP and clofibrate appeared to induce similar form(s) of microsomal cytochrome P- 450 which exhibited a high specificity towards lauric acid hydroxylation. With a range of hypolipidemic agents, including phthalate monoesters, a good correlation was observed between the induction of peroxisomal and microsomal enzyme activities in rat hepatocyte cultures. These results thus demonstrate a good relationship between the in vivo and in vitro effects of phthalate esters and related compounds and suggest that hepatocyte cultures may be useful for further studies on the hepatic effects of peroxisome proliferators...|$|E
40|$|Soils at {{depths of}} 0 cm to 10 cm, 10 cm to 20 cm, and 20 cm to 40 cm from 37 {{vegetable}} greenhouses in Shandong Peninsula, East China, were collected, and 16 phthalic acid esters (PAEs) were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All 16 PAEs could be detected in soils from vegetable greenhouses. The total of 16 PAEs (Σ 16 PAEs) ranged from 1. 939 mg/kg to 35. 442 mg/kg, {{with an average}} of 6. 748 mg/kg. Among four areas, including Qingdao, Weihai, Weifang, and Yantai, the average and maximum concentrations of Σ 16 PAEs in soils at depths of 0 cm to 10 cm appeared in Weifang, which {{has a long history of}} vegetable production and is famous for extensive greenhouse cultivation. Despite the different concentrations of Σ 16 PAEs, the PAE compositions were comparable. Among the 16 PAEs, di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), <b>di-n-octyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DnOP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were the most abundant. Compared with the results on agricultural soils in China, soils that are being used or were used for vegetable greenhouses had higher PAE concentrations. Among PAEs, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP) and DnBP exceeded soil allowable concentrations (in US) in more than 90 % of the samples, and DnOP in more than 20 %. Shandong Peninsula has the highest PAE contents, which suggests that this area is severely contaminated by PAEs...|$|E

The settled dust {{samples were collected}} from thirteen indoor environments from Palermo city. A fast and simple method using Soxhlet and GC–MS analysis has been optimized to identify and quantify the phthalates. Total phthalates concentrations in indoor dusts ranged from 269 to 4, 831 mg/kg d. w. (d. w. = dry weight). The data show a linear correlation between total PAEs concentration and a single compound content, with {{the exclusion of the}} two most volatile components (DMP and DEP) that are present in appreciable amounts only in two samples. These results suggest that most of the PAEs identified in the samples of settled dust originate from the same type of material. This evidence indicates that, in a specific indoor environment, generally is not present only one compound but a mixture having over time comparable percentages of PAEs. Consequently, for routine analyses of a specific indoor environment, only a smaller number of compounds could be determined to value the contamination of that environment. We also note differences in phthalate concentrations between buildings from different construction periods; the total concentration of PAEs was higher in ancient homes compared to those constructed later. This is due to a trend to reduce or remove certain hazardous compounds from building materials and consumer goods. A linear correlation between total PAEs concentration and age of the building was observed (R = 0. 71) ...|$|E

Further characterization of MNP coated poly(phenyl-(4 -(6 -thiophen- 3 - yl-hexyloxy) -benzylidine) amine) (P 3 TArH) was conducted using TEM and FESEM. Among those nanocomposites, MNP coated P 3 TArH has shown higher determination capabilities of phthalates. The adsorption behaviour of di(2 - ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) onto the MNP coated P 3 TArH showed fast kinetics, occurred heterogenously on the adsorption sites and exothermic. The activation energy determined found was - 40. 6 kJ mol− 1 K− 1, indicated the process is physisorption.

40|$|Introduction: Phthalates are organic {{lipophilic}} compounds {{which are}} mainly used as plasticizer {{to increase the}} flexibility of plastic polymers. Another application {{is the use of}} phthalates in printing inks and adhesives. Human exposure occurs mainly via food intake and can cause a wide range of negative health effects (e. g. disruption of the endocrine system). In this study, the effect of cooking at home on phthalate concentrations in various foodstuffs was investigated. Methods and materials: Food products that are eaten regularly by the Belgian population – i. e. potato, rice, pasta, carrot, cauliflower, onion, paprika, minced meat, pork chop and salmon – were purchased from Belgian shops. In most cases, several cultivars, varieties and/or packaging types of a food product were bought. Food samples were boiled, steamed, fried, deep-fried and/or grilled in a way a normal Belgian household would do. Phthalate concentrations were determined in uncooked as well as in cooked food products via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Eight phthalates were taken into account: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) and <b>di-n-octyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DnOP). Results: DMP, DnBP, DCHP and DnOP were rarely present (less or equal than/to 50 % detectable) in the investigated food samples. On the other hand, DEP, DiBP, BBP and DEHP were regularly detected, but differences in detection frequencies were noticed between uncooked and cooked food samples. For example, DEHP was determined in all uncooked foods, but after cooking, this compound was detectable in only 65. 4 % of the samples. Phthalate concentrations in food usually declined after cooking, which is demonstrated in Figure 1 for DiBP in pasta samples. Furthermore, differences in phthalate concentrations were observed between cultivars, varieties and/or packaging types of a certain food product (see also Figure 1). Conclusions: In general, cooking processes at home cause a decline in phthalate concentrations in food.

40|$|Replacement of a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} traditional, aqueous reaction medium in biotechnology by an organic medium is a promising technique to broaden the scope and range of biotechnological processes. This seems especially to be true for the conversion of non-polar substances. The high capacity of solvents for sparingly water-soluble substrates and products could reduce the required volume of the reaction mixture significantly, and may also lead to less substrate and/or product inhibition in the aqueous biocatalyst phase, when these mechanisms are involved. Furthermore, {{the use of an}} organic solvent could shift reaction equilibria favourably and facilitate down-stream processing. In chapter 1 a general review is presented of non-aqueous solvent systems in biocatalytic processes. Special attention is paid to two-liquid-phase systems, involving water-immiscible solvents. Several facets of these biphasic systems have been studied in this thesis using the epoxidation of propene by gel-entrapped Mycobacterium cells as a model. After the description of the throughout this work employed techniques of gas-analysis automatization and of substrate-level control (chapter 2), the far-reaching consequences of the solvent choice are treated in chapter 3. Many solvents cause rapid inactivation of the free, propene-epoxidizing cells. This appears also to be the case if the cells are immobilized in calcium alginate. However, the support material prevents direct cell-organic solvent contact and the associated aggregation and clotting of cells, mostly accompanied with loss of activity. High activity retentions of the immobilized cells relate to low polarities and high molecular weights of the used solvents. The polarity, as expressed by the Hildebrand solubility parameter, is also useful for describing the solvent capacity for one of the two substrates, oxygen, and for the product, propene oxide. The capacity for propene is less well described by the Hildebrand solubility parameter, but also less relevant, as the capacity of the solvents for propene is always about two orders of magnitude higher than that of water, and thus limitation of the rate by unsufficient supply of propene is less likely to occur. It is stressed that optimization of the solvent polarity is necessary, as the requirement of a high activity retention conflicts with the need for a high solvent capacity for the polar propene oxide. Optimization of the polarity will also be likely in case of other types of two-liquid-phase bioconversions. External and internal-diffusion limitations, which are to be expected when using cells entrapped in a hydrophilic: gel, are quantified in chapters 4 and 5. With negligible product inhibition, satisfactory predictions of the mass-transfer effects on the intrinsic Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the immobilized cells are obtained by using a simple pore-diffusion model (chapter 4). Internal diffusion is found to severely limit the epoxidation rate. A more complex model for the intrinsic epoxidation kinetics has been derived for modelling of mass-transfer rates in case of product inhibition (chapter 5). The microkinetic model defined in chapter 4 is integrated in a macrokinetic model to describe the behaviour of a packed-bed immobilized-cell reactor (chapter 6). Depletion of the limiting substrate, oxygen, {{along the length of the}} bioreactor can be prevented by using an organic solvent, n-hexadecane, as the transport medium. It is argued that this finding may eliminate the need for a separate gas phase in the fixed-bed reactor. Model predictions of the oxygen conversion in the bioreactor at various degrees of external and internal-diffusion limitation, at various liquid space times and with water or n-hexadecane as the continuous phase are in good agreement with experimentally obtained values. In chapter 7 some other, main limitations of the epoxide production in the packed-bed organic-liquid-phase/immobilized-cell reactor are quantified. Product inhibition is reduced by absorption of the inhibitory epoxide in a cold <b>di-n-octyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> phase. The stability of the immobilized cells is increased by supplying the cells alternately with propene and a co-substrate (ethene). About 50 g dry weight of cells in a 1. 7 dm 3 packed-bed reactor were used, which produced ~ 1. 5 g chiral propene oxide; two third of the epoxide was absorbed in the octyl phthalate phase. Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis a general discussion is presented. The significance of optimization of the solvent polarity and of the interphase polarity, i. e. the polarity of the phase between biocatalyst and organic solvent is underlined. In case of entrapment in prepolymers, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance of the gel can be optimized with respect to polarities of substrates and products. Several features of hydrophilic and hydrophobic gels are compared. A quantitative illustration is given concerning the design on a technical scale of a fixed-bed organic-liquid-phase/immobilized-cell reactor. The advantages of using solvents with a high substrate capacity (often oxygen in case of aerobic processes) are demonstrated...|$|E
