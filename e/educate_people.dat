40|$|Using {{detailed}} {{time use}} data for Germany {{a positive correlation}} is found between the level of schooling education and time investments in informal education. Two hypotheses explain this observation: (1) highly <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> have higher opportunity costs of their leisure time and thus prefer leisure activities which add to their market productivity (wage effect) and (2) highly <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> have a preference for ?high quality? leisure (taste effect). The demand for informal education is derived in a household production model accounting for both explanations. An empirical investigation finds evidence for both effects with the taste effect being the more important effect. Highly <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> accumulate human capital through their specific leisure time use. This increases the skill-gap between higher and lower <b>educated</b> <b>people...</b>|$|R

5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were to <b>educate</b> <b>people</b> in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives.

In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E

5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To <b>educate</b> <b>people</b> about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E

25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities.

With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, it {{has been}} found that older people as well as less <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> are happier and consume more {{relational}} goods. This may be an issue of choice, where they are less capable of doing solo activities, and are generally more dependent on a framework of people. Therefore, relationships are more vital, and thus they reap the rewards of relational good. Others have suggested that older people are happier due to an improved level of emotional intelligence. As for less <b>educated</b> <b>people,</b> findings about relational goods being more widely consumed within that demographic supports statistical evidence that shows that less <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> aren't necessarily less happy. This is an economical issue as choice and happiness are often correlated. While education significantly improves choice in material goods, the traditional yardstick for happiness, it does less to improve your options in relational goods, and may in fact reduce your options as more <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> tend to work longer hours, thus leavingless time for relationships.|$|R
