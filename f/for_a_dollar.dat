5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E

He then advertised the cartridge on Usenet and in a catalog for video game store Video 61, ultimately selling around 25 cartridges.

25|$|A {{real estate}} holding company had taken {{possession}} of the property since it was never developed as an airport. It then leased parcels to dairy farmers. The federal government purchased the acreage for $60,000 in 1941. The Bureau of Public Roads used the site between 1943 and 1953 to test road surfaces. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory took over in 1954 for communications research. In 1955, the Virginia National Guard used the land for an antiaircraft base.

Some of these characters have included the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, and characters from the Goosebumps series by author R. L. Stine. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers made appearances in the park during the first seasons of the television series but then vanished. Disney had ownership of the Power Rangers franchise through its purchase of Saban Entertainment until May 2010 when Saban purchased the franchise back and were regular members of the park's cast of characters during that time.

500|$|Haywood seemed most {{comfortable}} with a philosophy arrived at through the hard-scrabble experiences of the workers. He {{had the ability to}} translate complex economic theories into simple ideas that resonated with working people. He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, [...] "If one man has a dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> he didn't get." [...] While Haywood respected the work of Marx, he referred to it with irreverent humor. Acknowledging his scars from dangerous mining work, and from numerous fistfights with police and militia, he liked to say, [...] "I've never read Marx's Capital, but I have the marks of capital all over me." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 1877, Linderman {{requested}} Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint James Pollock to [...] "instruct Mr. Morgan {{to prepare}} without delay, dies for a silver dollar, the designs, inscriptions, and arrangement thereof {{to be the}} same as the enclosed impression for the Half Dollar and numbered '2' substituting the words 'one dollar' in place of 'half dollar'". Linderman also ordered Pollock to [...] "instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same." [...] Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, [...] "I have now to state for your information, that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra {{developed}} {{an interest in}} music, particularly big band jazz, at a young age. He listened to Gene Austin, Rudy Vallée, Russ Colombo, and Bob Eberly, and [...] "idolized" [...] Bing Crosby. Sinatra's maternal uncle, Domenico, gave him a ukulele for his 15th birthday, and he began performing at family gatherings. Sinatra attended David E. Rue Jr. High School from 1928, and A. J. Demarest High School in 1931, where he arranged bands for school dances. He left without graduating, having attended only 47 days before being expelled for [...] "general rowdiness". To please his mother, he enrolled at Drake Business School, but departed after 11 months. Dolly found Sinatra work as a delivery boy at the Jersey Observer newspaper, where his godfather Frank Garrick worked, and after that, Sinatra was a riveter at the Tietjen and Lang shipyard. He performed in local Hoboken social clubs such as The Cat's Meow and The Comedy Club, and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey City. In New York, Sinatra found jobs singing for his supper or for cigarettes. To improve his speech, he began taking elocution lessons <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> each from vocal coach John Quinlan, {{who was one of}} the first people to notice his impressive vocal range.|$|E

500|$|The first {{permanent}} European {{settlers in}} the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century. The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like key limes and pineapples. John James Audubon visited Elliott Key in 1832. Colonel Robert E. Lee surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849. At {{the end of the}} American Civil War in 1865, a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to Cuba. Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for John C. Breckinridge during his flight to Cuba. The former United States vice president, Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey. Few people lived in the park area until 1897, when Israel Lafayette Jones, an African-American property manager, bought Porgy Key for $300 US. The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there, clearing land to grow limes and pineapples. In 1911 Jones bought [...] Totten Key, which had been used as a pineapple plantation, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> an acre, selling in 1925 for $250,000. Before Israel Jones' death in 1932 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast.|$|E
500|$|The Mint struck over 125 {{million of}} the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than {{doubling}} its largest annual production <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what CoinAge magazine termed [...] "near-heroic measures {{on the part of}} the Mint", the piece did not circulate. [...] In a 1974 article for CoinAge, numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, [...] "the circulation value of the coin has been nil". Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors. Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected. More than 11 {{million of the}} 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof. In May 1972, Treasury Secretary John Connally, testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as [...] "just unconscionable", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.|$|E
500|$|The American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition {{was open}} from July2 to August4, 1923. [...] The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in Exposition Park, {{just to the}} east of the brand-new Los Angeles Coliseum, where every evening a {{complimentary}} show for exposition visitors, [...] "Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs", was given. [...] Admission to the fair was fifty cents, though fairgoers could purchase a coin <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> at the box office and enter without further charge. [...] After the first week, organizers realized the public was not interested in the historical theme, but was there to see favorite movie stars. Exhibitors accordingly greatly expanded the space devoted to movie attractions, but the exposition was a financial failure. Those in charge of the fair had hoped to attract a million visitors; the actual attendance was about 300,000, many of whom were teenagers given complimentary admission in the final two weeks of the fair. With the fair flirting with insolvency throughout its run, officials hoped the planned visit of President Warren Harding on August 6 would increase gate receipts, but Harding fell ill in San Francisco and died on August 2. According to Pike in his article, [...] "its effect on the industry [...] hard to measure. [...] However, if Hollywood owes its current status in any way to the event, then it was quite a success indeed." ...|$|E
