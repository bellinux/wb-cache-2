500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{used his}} press conference before the match to look ahead to the new season. He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic." [...] He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{goodness}} me!" [...] cried Monica, the smaller, the drier, and {{the more}} wizened of the pair. [...] "What do you call that, Bertha? <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> four batter puddings." ...|$|E
60|$|Fanny, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} we'd bitten off {{as big a}} piece of cake as we can chew with any comfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the jolliest thing that's {{happened}} since we left England. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if the}} sun were breaking through the clouds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if {{you wanted}} making a head shorter. You're a darned sight too fresh. Who {{do you think you}} are, anyway?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno what t' {{say to you}} folks, 'cause I'm up in the air. This money may be genooine, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a counterfeit," [...] and {{he held up a}} new ten-dollar bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd hev to," [...] {{admitted}} Joe. [...] "That's why I 'asked ye {{how about}} it. Jes' now <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I ain't hired at all. The black man said he'd gimme a dollar fer the trunks, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s a {{wonderful}} thing to me," [...] said Mr. Negget in a low voice to his pipe, [...] "as they should come to a house with a retired policeman living in <b>it.</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> somebody that ain’t got much respect for the police." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{the same}} name, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if this}} Uncle Barney, as they call him, might be some {{relative}} of Ruth's family," [...] said Fred.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say {{for certain}} yet, sir, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if she}} is French. I don't think that the sails are English cut anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the way <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> too," [...] whispered Fred. [...] "They {{must have}} got wind {{in some way}} of our being up around their place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll be jiggered! <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> as if you'd {{come down}} here tryin' to be awful too good. I wish I had money enough to buy a glass case to put you in. I reckon I could sell the lot up to the museum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is my rowboat," [...] {{announced}} the farmer, pointing {{to where the}} craft was tied fast to a large tree. [...] "You can use {{it if you want}} to, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> rather a hopeless matter to try to do anything while the river is raging like this. You had better wait until it calms down a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no detective," [...] {{he remarked}} to Jolnes as {{he raised the}} piece of theatre {{programme}} to his nose, [...] "but {{it seems to me}} that instead of a ring having been wrapped in this paper it was one of those round peppermint drops. And this piece with the address on <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the end of a seat coupon--No. 12, row C, left aisle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} this," [...] he said. [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I'll {{have to hold}} these Rover {{brothers}} until they can clear themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if <b>it</b> was a {{reflection}} of light {{from one of the}} windows at the back there. There it is again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was that a infernal machine?" [...] {{whispered the}} bewildered Jem to the mate. [...] "Why, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> just like one o' them tins o' corned beef." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care who}} it was built by," [...] said Peter, [...] "and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> any other castle, only larger. All I know {{about it is that}} I am to be tried there for {{knocking}} that ruffian on the head--and that perhaps this is the last we shall see of each other, as probably they will send me to the galleys, if they don't do worse." ...|$|E
60|$|SUNDAY.--It is {{up there}} yet. Resting, apparently. But that is a subterfuge: Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is {{appointed}} for that. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a creature that {{is more interested in}} resting than in anything else. It would tire me to rest so much. It tires me just to sit around and watch the tree. I do wonder what it is for; I never see it do anything.|$|E
60|$|When she had gone, I said to Elsie, 'That is odd {{about the}} bangle. State of health might affect it, I suppose. Though <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a surface deposit of sulphide.' I {{knew nothing of}} chemistry, I admit; but I had {{sometimes}} messed about in the laboratory at college {{with some of the}} other girls; and I remembered now that sulphide of silver was a blackish-looking body, like the film on the bangle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here, fellows, {{and see if}} you {{can tell}} what Joe is doing. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if there was a big lot of smoke from the galley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon they're goin' {{to bring}} their siege-guns with 'em this time. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> much as if a big crowd was gatherin' {{in the rear of}} the line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir--it's funny," [...] Ransome {{was evidently}} puzzled. [...] "He hasn't spoken a word, {{and his eyes}} are shut. But <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more like sound sleep than {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty business, ain't it?" [...] he continued; [...] "Dyvis on the lush? Must say I {{thought you}} gave it 'im A1 to-day. He didn't {{like it a}} bit; took on hawful after you were gone.--' 'Ere,' says I, ''old on, easy on the lush,' I says. ''Errick was right and you know it. Give 'im a chanst,' I says.--' 'Uish,' sezee, 'don't you gimme no more of your jaw, or I'll knock your bloomin' eyes out.' Well, wot can I do, 'Errick? But I tell you, I don't 'arf like it. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the Sea Rynger over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be that, as not unfrequently happens, {{the child}} has been stolen {{for the sake of}} his clothes. In that case he will {{probably}} be heard of before very long. Or it may be a case of blackmail. Someone, possibly an acquaintance of one of the servants, may have known that the child, as the grandson and heir of General Mathieson, would be a valuable prize, and that, if he could be carried off, his friends might finally be forced to pay a considerable sum to recover him. I must say that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a planned thing. One of the confederates engages the silly woman, his nurse, in a long rambling talk; the other picks the child quietly up or entices him away to the next corner, where he has a cab in waiting, and drives off with him at once. However, in neither case need you fear that the child will come to serious harm. If he has been stolen {{for the sake of his}} clothes the woman will very speedily turn him adrift, and he will be brought home to you by the police in rags. If, on the other hand, he has been taken for the purpose of blackmail, you may be sure that he will be well cared for, for he will, in the eyes of those who have taken him, be a most valuable possession. In that case you may not hear from the abductors for some little time. They will know that, as the search continues and no news is obtained, his friends will grow more and more anxious, and more ready to pay handsomely for his return. Of course it is a most annoying and unfortunate business, but I really do not think that you have any occasion to feel anxious about his safety, and it is morally certain that in time you will have him back, safe and sound. Now how is your uncle? I hope that he shows signs of rallying?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, commented: [...] "The law {{essentially}} {{is a practical}} thing. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the English law, English injunctions, look increasingly impractical in the modern world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{all these}} fancy dogs ever have {{the matter with}} them. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I might do {{business}} with this man. I'll get his address from Mitchell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, sir; but I {{have come}} to think {{differently}} since then, and now I'm going for a soldier, because <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if the colonists would speedily worst the king." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} our best {{plan would be}} to shoot young Bingo in on him after dinner one night. Melting mood, I mean to say, and all that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thompson compares Killy to F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby: although, {{unlike that}} character, Killy's dollars are earned honestly, the author concludes while {{watching}} Killy's selling of himself that [...] "nothing in his narrow, high-powered experience can {{allow him to}} understand how I can watch his act and say that <b>it</b> <b>looks,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> a very hard dollar - maybe the hardest." ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 2006, Slate editor Jack Shafer {{investigated}} {{reports of}} [...] "pharming parties" [...] {{and concluded that}} there was little evidence indicating that such a phenomenon is popular, growing, or even real. Shafer wrote, [...] "If pharm parties are a trend, they're the best-hidden and least-talked about one in the country." [...] He noted that [...] "It goes without saying that pharm parties may be very real and very everywhere. It's a big country. But <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> pharm party is just a new label the drug-abuse industrial complex has adopted to describe the decades-old tradition of pill parties." ...|$|E
5000|$|With {{all of the}} {{concerns}} over who controls the “Social Web” (We’ve addressed {{some of these problems}} before in Free Software Magazine) - regarding the Google+ name policy and other privacy issues, Facebook’s questionable ethics, and the overall danger of controlled networks. I think it is extremely important for a more decentralized, more democratic, more open, and more free solution to succeed in the interest of personal freedom on the internet. And <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> Diaspora {{is an essential part of}} that solution, so I’m endorsing it now, even though it’s not entirely “ready”.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither do I; but that's the way <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Must {{be nice to}} {{be where}} there's grass, so's you can {{get up in the}} mornin' an' run 'round in the fields." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Dick, I don't {{take much}} stock in those fellows," [...] was Tom's comment. [...] "They {{are good at}} talking, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if they didn't {{know where they were}} at." ...|$|R
60|$|The way Tobin put it, it {{did seem}} to corroborate the art of prediction, though <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that these {{accidents}} could happen to any one at Coney without the implication of palmistry.|$|R
