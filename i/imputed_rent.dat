50|$|<b>Imputed</b> <b>rent</b> is an {{estimate}} in economic {{theory of the}} rent a house owner {{would be willing to}} pay to live in his or her own house. <b>Imputed</b> <b>rent</b> can thus serve as an important measure between home owners and tenants. <b>Imputed</b> <b>rent</b> is the economic theory of imputation applied to real estate: that the value of a good is more a matter of what the buyer is willing to pay than the cost the seller incurs to create it. In this case, market rents are used to estimate the value to the property owner. Thus, for example, if one could rent a similar property for less than the costs, one is losing money on the deal and vice versa.

As the tax treatment of housing will disproportionately create tax savings for the top deciles of the income distribution, we quantify how the tax deductibility contributes to the heavily skewed distribution of wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Although the tax treatment of owner occupied housing alone is unlikely to produce the extreme wealth concentration at the far right tail of the distribution, we argue that it is re-enforced by a bequest motive.

The market value approach is used to derive an estimate of imputed rental income, which is added to disposable income. The results indicate that in 1998 - 99, <b>imputed</b> <b>rent</b> had an equalising distributional impact, except {{at the very top of}} the distribution. This finding is robust with respect to changes in some of the assumptions that underlie it.

Analysis of the changing distributional impact of <b>imputed</b> <b>rent</b> between 1993 - 94 and 1998 - 99 indicates that while the effect was equalising in both years, it is not possible to determine whether the impact became more or less equalising over the period.

40|$|We {{construct}} a quantitative general equilibrium lifecycle model with housing tenure decisions {{to investigate the}} degree to which wealth inequality in the United States is affected by the preferential tax treatment of home-ownership. Favorable tax treatment of owner occupied housing in the form of home mortgage interest and property tax deductibility, and the untaxed nature of <b>imputed</b> <b>rents,</b> provides a financial incentive for home-ownership over renting as well as an incentive to "over-consume" housing since houses are not fungible. Since the favorable tax treatment of housing disproportionately creates tax savings for the upper quantiles of the income distribution, we quantify how it contributes to the heavily right skewed distribution of wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. We consider a revenue-neutral government response to the counter factual experiments of removing the current tax structure on housing. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in terms of distributional effects, removing all of the preferential tax treatments results in an aggregate increase in welfare. However, we do not find any reduction in inequality. We also find that while some re-allocation toward financial assets occurs, households primarily increase their consumption when <b>imputed</b> housing <b>rents</b> are taxed and the property tax deduction is removed. Thus housing tax policy may be effective at encouraging more overall saving through housing assets. Mortgage interest deductibility Housing taxation Wealth Inequality...|$|R
