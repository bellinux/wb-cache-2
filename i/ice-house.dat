25|$|Unlike {{the system}} obtaining under State control, when hauls wore left on deck until all {{operations}} ended, the method adopted was to place each haul of fish straight {{into a separate}} <b>ice-house,</b> and, to prevent-crushing of the lower layers of fish, each <b>ice-house</b> is divided into sections by removable shelves. This system also obviates the use of grappling hooks, which formerly tore {{the flesh of the}} fish, and so made large quantities unsaleable. Under the new system loading into the baskets is affected by a simple inclination of the shelves. Mr. Creamer, general manager of the Coastal Trawling Company, which controls the Koraaga, pointed out yesterday that the reduction of handling to a minimum must ensured the good condition of all fish. The ‘Koraaga, moreover, should show a profit with even moderate catches. The weakness of the State trawling enterprise was, in his opinion, the large administrative and storage expenses. The Coastal Trawling Company has entirely eliminated the latter. Arrangements were made for the landing of fish at the markets in as fresh a condition as possible. Voyages were cut short; bonus systems were introduced, which made it worthwhile for the crews to see that no damage was done in the stowage or unloading of their hauls. Unnecessary handling was obviated by all discoverable devices.|$|E
2500|$|On June 19, 1861, Trenchard {{was given}} {{command of the}} supply ship , {{formerly}} the Eagle, a 236 foot side-wheel steamer built for the Charleston Line. Eight [...] guns were installed, while her bows were heavily plated with iron. An <b>ice-house</b> and other fittings were also added {{to her at the}} Brooklyn Navy Yard.|$|E

6000|$|... "Who am I? I am Bill Cameron, {{the owner}} of these <b>ice-houses,</b> that's who I am! And I know you, in spite of them tomfoolery dresses you've got on. You're boys from Oak Hall." ...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Ice-House</b> (bunker like building) on {{the lower}} avenue was the {{original}} [...] "refrigerator" [...] for the old manor house. The river would have been blocked during the winter and blocks of ice cut {{and placed in the}} pit {{at the end of the}} building. Food was then stored in layers of straw, and the building sealed up. The building was accessed during summer by way of a hatch in the roof of the building.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can't buy 'em. But it's as festive as an <b>ice-house.</b> There's a {{friendly}} native {{coming down the}} aisle. He's your man, Hale, {{if you want the}} news.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; an odd one. But it {{confirms}} the obvious theory of body-snatching. Of course, fishers are early risers, {{and they went}} trampling about confusedly. But they did find curious tracks. We have isolated some of them, and even managed to carry off a couple. We dug round them, and lifted them. A neighbouring laird, Mr. Maitland, lent his <b>ice-house</b> for storing these, and I had one laid down {{on the north side}} of this house to show you, if the frost held. No <b>ice-house</b> or refrigerator here, of course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, we'll {{give you}} the famous slide for life!" [...] cried Buster, {{and pointed to the}} upper portion of one of the <b>ice-houses,</b> where a big wooden slide led {{downward}} into the Leming River.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I heard a yellin' {{around the}} <b>ice-houses,</b> and I {{told my wife}} I'd dress and come over {{and see what it}} meant. Hope you ain't done no damage," [...] the man continued, {{somewhat}} anxiously.|$|R
60|$|Some narrow stairs led to {{the upper}} portion of the <b>ice-houses,</b> and blindfolded as they were, the victims were forced to mount these and were then taken to {{a room in the}} back of one of the buildings.|$|R
60|$|He {{struggled}} violently, but {{the cadets}} placed {{him on the}} grass and sat on him. Then one, who had run down to the <b>ice-house</b> for a piece of ice, came up.|$|E
6000|$|... "She didn't know I {{was shut}} {{up in the}} <b>ice-house,</b> but she found me. I know she'll come," [...] {{returned}} Robby, so trustfully, that Nan felt relieved, and sat down by him, saying, with a remorseful sigh, ...|$|E
60|$|Ethelberta {{might have}} fallen dead with the shock, so terrible and hideous was it. Yet she did not. She neither shrieked nor fainted; but no poor January {{fieldfare}} was ever colder, no <b>ice-house</b> more dank with perspiration, {{than she was}} then.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not a {{question}} of the worth of the lanterns," [...] said Dave. [...] "We mustn't leave them here because of the danger of fire. If we left them, and the <b>ice-houses</b> burnt down, we'd have a nice bill to pay!" ...|$|R
2500|$|To build Budweiser as a {{national}} beer, Busch created a network of rail-side <b>ice-houses</b> and launched the industry’s first fleet of refrigerated freight cars. However, throughout his life, he referred to his beer as [...] "dot schlop" [...] and preferred wine to drink.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} old {{windmills}} that {{were no longer}} required were converted to other uses such as barns, stores, <b>ice-houses,</b> look-out towers and dovecotes. Monkton is a typical example of a vaulted tower mill, as are those at Dunbarney, Gordonstoun and Ballantrae.|$|R
60|$|With caution Dave, {{followed}} by Phil and Shadow, approached the <b>ice-house,</b> {{and climbed up}} one of the ladders nailed {{to the side of the}} building. Then they ventured out on a corner of the slide, and secured two of the lanterns.|$|E
6000|$|... "A good idea, Eda; but I fear {{we would}} need a stove to keep us warm. It strikes me {{it will make a}} capital <b>ice-house</b> in spring to keep our fresh meat in. It will last long after the snow is melted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{suppose they}} do," [...] he said. [...] "And when the {{aboriginal}} <b>ice-house,</b> {{or whatever the}} ridiculous {{thing is that they}} have discovered, gives out, I suppose that they can come to a reasonable man and ask him for a little money to buy bread and butter." ...|$|E
60|$|Nat {{had been}} forced to join the other victims, and the seven were marched a {{distance}} of a quarter of a mile. The crowd came out {{on the bank of the}} river, at a spot where several <b>ice-houses</b> had recently been erected.|$|R
50|$|There is {{documentary}} evidence, {{mostly in}} private diaries, for {{instance of the}} Earl of Malmesbury, that the gentry colluded in smuggling activities; Tregonwell's smuggling connections, however, remain entirely speculative. Underground rooms were often used as <b>ice-houses,</b> as the only available form of refrigeration; it is largely wishful thinking that links such structures with smuggling. When Bournemouth was mostly heathland, it was small gravelly hollows surrounded by gorse bushes which {{were most likely to}} be used as hiding places, as contraband made a swift journey inland.|$|R
50|$|Fisher came to Ashland in 1867 and {{operated}} a sawmill and lumberyard {{at the foot}} of 17th Street. He had his men cut ice from the Ohio River that winter, when it froze over, packed it in sawdust and dispensed it to Ashland residents, who made <b>ice-houses</b> for storage. He was also a contractor and house-builder, operated a livery stable on Greenup Avenue, opened {{and operated}} the first dime store in the city, served as a conductor on the A. C. & I. Railroad, and was overseer of a poor house.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{all black}} in the <b>ice-house,</b> and I was so scared I didn't call her, but she saw me; and she will see me now, no matter how dark it is," [...] {{returned}} confiding Rob, standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who be you?" [...] demanded Bill Cameron, {{and peered}} at the shipowner's son curiously. [...] "Well, I declare, if it ain't the young man as stopped the runaway hoss fer my wife! Glad to see you!" [...] And the <b>ice-house</b> man shook hands cordially. [...] "Up to some secret fun, I suppose." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{more the}} Dean, that grave divine, Shall keep {{the key of}} my (no) wine; My <b>ice-house</b> rob, as heretofore, And steal my {{artichokes}} no more; Poor Patty Blount[3] no more be seen Bedraggled in my walks so green: Plump Johnny Gay will now elope; And here no more will dangle Pope.|$|E
60|$|This {{little book}} {{describes}} a visit {{up to the}} Arctic regions, {{that was supposed to}} have taken place long before the book was written, in other words {{in the early part of}} the nineteenth century. The purpose of the journey was to get near to the North Pole, which was considered to be surrounded by a large area of ice-free water. The vessel in which they sailed became beset by ice, and could not be moved. They met with Esquimaux, and saw how they survived, how they killed walrus, how they caught birds, and how they lived in their <b>ice-houses,</b> or igloos. They also had several encounters with polar bears, and musk-ox.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the death}} of Eberhard Anheuser in 1880, Busch became {{president}} of the business, and became wealthy due {{to the success of the}} brewery. He envisioned a national beer with universal appeal. His work was distinguished by his [...] "timely adoption of important scientific and technological innovations, an expansive sales strategy geared largely toward external domestic and international population centers, and a pioneering integrated marketing plan that focused on a single core brand, Budweiser, making it the most successful nationally-distributed beer of the pre-Prohibition era."To build Budweiser as a national beer, Busch created a network of rail-side <b>ice-houses</b> and launched the industry’s first fleet of refrigerated freight cars. However, throughout his life, he referred to his beer as [...] "dot schlop" [...] and preferred wine to drink.|$|R
5000|$|The ice {{industry}} was soon established on the lake, and, in 1849, Thomas Andrews purchased the entire lake and mill property to {{further developed the}} ice business. Large ice houses were erected south of the Boston Road in the present City Yard, and a runway was constructed across the road for the ice. This ice industry eventually developed {{into one of the}} most important in the region. The ice was all taken for the New York City and Brooklyn markets by the Brooklyn Ice Company, being transported by boats which landed at a dock adjoining the <b>ice-houses.</b> Recognized for the purity of its waters, the lake became known as [...] "Crystal Lake", with its ice marketed as [...] "Crystal Lake Ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} Susan {{came to me}} with a pleased countenance and said, [...] "I put the butter and the milk in that pit last night, and the butter's just as hard and the milk's as sweet {{as if it had been}} kept in an <b>ice-house.</b> But the place is as cold as an <b>ice-house,</b> sir, and unless I am mistaken, there's ice in it. Anyway, what do you call that?" [...] And she took from a little basket a piece of grayish ice as large as my fist. [...] "When I found it was so cold down there, sir," [...] she said, [...] "I thought I would dig a little myself and see what made it so; and I took a fire-shovel and hatchet, and, when I had scraped away some of the gravel, I came to {{something}} hard and chopped off this piece of it, which is real ice, sir, or I know nothing about it. Perhaps there used to be an <b>ice-house</b> there, and you might get some of it if you dug, though why anybody should put it down so deep and then cover it up, I'm sure I don't know. But as long as there's any there, I think we should get it out, even if there's only a little of it; for I can not take everything down to that pit, and we might as well have it in the refrigerator." ...|$|E
60|$|The boys {{turned back}} in the {{direction}} of their camp, talking about the affair and glad that they had had no worse trouble in getting back their things. In the meantime Kiddy Leech walked on, fast at first and then more slowly, until Rocky River was reached. Here he came to a dilapidated building once used as an <b>ice-house</b> and sat down on a bench in the sun to rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} such {{a scene of}} wreckage," [...] she said. [...] "It looks like a Western town after a cyclone. I think {{the best thing you}} can do is to have this dreadful litter cleared up, the ground {{smoothed}} and raked, the wall mended, and the roof put back on that little house, and then if we can make anybody believe it is an <b>ice-house,</b> so much the better." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{house was}} {{regularly}} and substantially built of clean grey freestone throughout, in that plainer fashion of Greek classicism which prevailed at the latter {{end of the}} last century, when the copyists called designers had grown weary of fantastic variations in the Roman orders. The main block approximated to a square on the ground plan, having a projection in the centre of each side, surmounted by a pediment. From each angle of the inferior side ran a line of buildings lower than the rest, turning inwards again at their further end, and forming within them a spacious open court, within which resounded an echo of astonishing clearness. These erections were in their turn backed by ivy-covered <b>ice-houses,</b> laundries, and stables, the whole mass of subsidiary buildings being half buried beneath close-set shrubs and trees.|$|R
50|$|Bats favor larger hibernacula {{where large}} groups may roost together, {{including}} natural caves, mines, cellars, {{and other kinds}} of underground sites and man-made structures, like <b>ice-houses.</b> Within these hibernacula, the bats are still highly tuned to environmental factors. Little brown bats in northern latitudes hibernate for up to 8 months during the winter, and leave their roosts in the warm spring weather when insect prey is plentiful again. Bats gauge the outside temperature by being attuned to the airflow at the hibernacula entrance, which is driven by temperature differences between inside and outside the hibernacula, allowing bats to leave when the temperature begins to warm. Some hibernacula are shared between multiple species, such as common pipistrelles roosting with soprano pipistrelles. Behavior other than hibernating can also occur at hibernacula; common pipistrelles produce most of their mating calls and mate with each other in and near their hibernacula.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Iranian {{architecture}} is shaped in {{related to its}} Hot - Dry climate and has provided interesting answers to the Iranian 2 ̆ 7 s needs. In this climate, most of the buildings are constructed by mud or sun - dried bricks. There are so many facilities that Iranian architecture has provided for better living such as: Wind - Catcher (which exhausts warm air from buildings during the day), Cisterns (which have a cylindrical store place in {{the depth of the}} earth for storing the cold fresh water during the hot seasons), Ice - Houses with walls behind which water in shallow channels friezes at nights, etc. The great heritage of Iranian architecture and traditions are still not known until now. The cons- tructing traditions of vernacular architecture in Iran, reveals the mystery of using natural energy sources that reduce the need to fossil fuel. Among different Iranian cultural heritage, <b>Ice-Houses</b> are selected as the main subject of this article. <br /...|$|R
