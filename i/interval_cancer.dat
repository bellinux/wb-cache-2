To evaluate the impact of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> on the effectiveness of endoscopic screening, the survival rates of patients with <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> were analyzed. We performed gastric cancer-specific and all-causes survival analyses of patients with screen-detected cancer and patients with <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> in the endoscopic screening group and radiographic screening group using the Kaplan-Meier method. Since the screening interval was 1 year, <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> was defined as gastric cancer detected within 1 year after a negative result. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the risk factors associated with gastric cancer-specific and all-causes death. A total of 1, 493 gastric cancer patients (endoscopic screening group: n = 347; radiographic screening group: n = 166; outpatient group: n = 980) were identified from the Tottori Cancer Registry from 2001 to 2008. The gastric cancer-specific survival rates were higher in the endoscopic screening group than in the radiographic screening group and the outpatients group. In the endoscopic screening group, the gastric cancer-specific survival rate of the patients with screen-detected cancer and the patients with <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> were nearly equal (P = 0. 869). In the radiographic screening group, the gastric cancer-specific survival rate of the patients with screen-detected cancer was higher than that of the patients with <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> (P = 0. 009). For gastric cancer-specific death, the hazard ratio of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> in the endoscopic screening group was 0. 216 for gastric cancer death (95 %CI: 0. 054 - 0. 868) compared with the outpatient group.

40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} the <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence, its determinants and the episode sensitivity in the Norrbotten Mammography Screening Programme (NMSP). Setting Since 1989, women aged 40 – 74 years (n 55, 000) {{have been invited}} to biennial screening by the NMSP, Norrbotten county, Sweden. Methods Data on 1047 invasive breast cancers from six screening rounds of the NMSP (1989 – 2002) were collected. We estimated the invasive <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates, rate ratios and the episode sensitivity using the detection and incidence methods. A linear Poisson-model was used to analyse association between <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence and sensitivity. Results 768 screen-detected and 279 <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> cases were identified. The rate ratio of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> decreased with age. The 50 – 59 year age group showed the highest rate ratio (RR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 41 – 0. 65) and the 70 – 74 year age group the lowest (RR 0. 23, 95 % CI 0. 15 – 0. 36).

40|$|Breast cancer {{screening}} {{is important for}} the early detection of breast cancer. Tumors that become symptomatic in the screening interval are known as <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> but the reasons for their rapid progression are unknown. Estrogen receptor expression is lower in <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> suggesting that they may have reduced hormonal responsiveness. To investigate this hypothesis we have measured the expression of the estrogen receptor and three estrogen-responsive genes (cathepsin D, progesterone receptor, and TFF 1) in screen-detected and <b>interval</b> breast <b>cancers.</b> The expression of the protease cathepsin D was not associated with estrogen receptor in either group of tumor. Progesterone receptor expression was highly correlated with that of the estrogen receptor in both groups of tumors but it was not expressed at significantly different levels in the two groups of tumors. Expression of TFF 1, a cellular motogen, was correlated with estrogen receptor in screen-detected but not <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> and was expressed at markedly higher levels in interval breast tumors, the group that expresses lower levels of estrogen receptor. <b>Interval</b> <b>cancers</b> are characterized by high levels of expression of TFF 1 and/or Ki 67 suggesting that cell migration and cell division play important roles in the rapid progression of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> The observation that TFF 1 expression in <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> tends to be estrogen-independent and that <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> have reduced estrogen receptor expression suggests they may have a reduced response to hormone therapy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{development}} and progression of true <b>interval</b> breast <b>cancers</b> (tumors that truly appear after a negative screening mammogram) {{is known to}} be different from screen-detected cancers. However, the worse clinical behavior of true <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> is not fully understood from a biologic basis. We described the differential patterns of gene expression through microarray analysis in true <b>interval</b> and screen-detected <b>cancers.</b> METHODS: An unsupervised exploratory gene expression profile analysis was performed on 10 samples (true <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> = 5; screen-detected cancers = 5) using Affymetrix Human Gene 1. 0 ST arrays and interpreted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed in a validation series of 91 tumors (n = 12; n = 79) by immunohistochemistry and in 24 tumors (n = 8; n = 16) by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in true <b>interval</b> and screen-detected <b>cancers,</b> respectively. RESULTS: Exploratory gene expression analysis identified 1, 060 differentially expressed genes (unadjusted P < 0. 05) between study groups. On the basis of biologic implications, four genes were further validated: ceruloplasmin (CP) and ribosomal protein S 6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 2 (RPS 6 KB 2), both upregulated in true interval cancers; and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and transforming growth factor beta receptor III (TGFBR 3), downregulated in true <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> Their differential expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, consistent with mTOR pathway overexpression in true <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> CONCLUSIONS: True <b>interval</b> and screen-detected <b>cancers</b> show differential expression profile both at gene and protein levels. The mTOR signaling is significantly upregulated in true <b>interval</b> <b>cancers,</b> suggesting this pathway may mediate their aggressiveness. IMPACT: Linking epidemiologic factors and mTOR activation may be the basis for future personalized screening strategies in women at risk of true <b>interval</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Screening using fecal {{occult blood}} testing (FOBt) reduces {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) mortality, but the test has low sensitivity. A 'missed' cancer may cause psychological harms in the screened population that partially counteract {{the benefits of}} early detection. - Methods: 311 people diagnosed with CRC: i) after a negative FOBt result (<b>interval</b> <b>cancer),</b> ii) a positive result (screen-detected cancer), or iii) in regions where screening was not offered, completed questions on quality of life (FACT-C), depression (CES-D), perceived diagnostic delay, and trust in the results of FOBt screening. 15 withheld consent to data matching with medical records, leaving a sample size of 296. - Results: Controlling for demographic and clinical variables, patients with an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> reported poorer quality of life (difference in means = 6. 16, p = 0. 03) and more diagnostic delay (OR: 0. 37, p = 0. 02) than patients with screen-detected disease, with no differences in depression. No differences were observed between the <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> group and the group not offered screening on these measures. Patients with an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> reported the lowest levels of trust in FOB testing. Conclusions: An <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> has adverse effects on trust in FOBt but does not result in worse psychological outcomes compared with people diagnosed in areas with no screening programme.

40|$|The {{nationwide}} {{breast cancer}} screening programme in The Netherlands for women aged 50 – 69 started in 1989. In our study we assessed the occurrence and stage distribution of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> in women screened during 1990 – 1993. Records of 0. 84 million screened women {{were linked to}} the regional cancer registries yielding a follow-up of at least 2. 5 years. Age-adjusted incidence rates and relative (proportionate) incidences per tumour size including ductal carcinoma in-situ were calculated for screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers,</b> and cancers in not (yet) screened women, comparing them with published data from the UK regions North West and East Anglia. In total 1527 <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> were identified: 0. 95 and 0. 99 per 1000 woman-years of follow-up in the 2 -year interval after initial and subsequent screens respectively. In {{the first year after}} initial screening <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> amounted to 27 % (26 % after subsequent screens) of underlying incidence, and in the second year to 52 % (55 %). Generally, <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> had a more favourable tumour size distribution than breast cancer in not (yet) screened women. The Dutch programme detected relatively less (favourable) invasive cancers in initial screens than the UK programme, whereas the number of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> confirms UK findings.

40|$|In a {{population-based}} mammography screening, 129, 731 examinations {{were carried}} out among 36, 000 women aged 40 - 74 {{in the city of}} Turku, Finland, in the period 1987 - 94. Women older than 50 were screened at 2 -year intervals, and those younger than 50 at either 1 -year or 3 -year intervals, depending on their year of birth. Screen-detected breast cancers numbered 385 and, during the same time period, 154 women were diagnosed with breast cancer outside screening in the same age group in the same city, and 100 <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> were detected. Two hundred and fifty (67 %) of the screen-detected cancers were of post-surgical stage I compared with 45 (45 %) of the <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> and 52 (34 %) of the cancers found outside screening (P< 0. 0001). However, among women aged 40 - 49 the frequency of stage I cancers did not differ significantly among screen-detected <b>cancers,</b> <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> and cancers found outside screening (50 %, 42 % and 44 % respectively; P= 0. 73). Invasive <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> were more frequent among women aged 40 - 49 if screening was done at either 1 -year (27 %) or 3 -year intervals (39 %) than in older women screened at 2 -year intervals (18 %; P= 0. 08 and P= 0. 0009 respectively).

40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{population-based}} screening program, we aimed to evaluate the major mammographic features and clinicopathological characteristics of breast tumors at diagnosis and the associations between them, focusing on tumors with the worst prognosis.

We included all <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> and a sample of screen-detected cancers, whether invasive or in situ. We compared tumor-related information and breast density for different phenotypes (Triple-negative (TN), HER 2 +, Luminal B and Luminal A) in screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> We used Chi-square or Fisher's exact test to compare major mammographic features of invasive versus in situ tumors, of screen-detected versus <b>interval</b> <b>cancers,</b> and of different types of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> We included 2582 tumors (1570 screen-detected and 1012 <b>interval</b> <b>cancers).</b> There were significant differences in the distribution of most clinicopathological variables between screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> Invasive TN <b>interval</b> tumors were more common than other phenotypes in breasts with low mammographic density; three-quarters of these tumors presented as masses without associated calcifications. HER 2 + tumors were more common in denser breasts and were associated with calcifications and multifocality. Architectural distortion was more common in Luminal A and Luminal B tumors. Certain radiologic findings are associated with pre-invasive lesions; these differ among invasive tumor phenotypes.

METHODS: <b>Interval</b> <b>cancer</b> case ascertainment is achieved by the regular exchange of data between Regional Breast Screening Quality Assurance Reference Centres and Cancer Registries. The present analysis includes interval cancers identified in women screened between 1 st April 1997 and 31 st March 2003, who were aged between 50 and 64 at the time of their last routine screen. RESULTS: In the periods 40 –o 12 months, 12 –o 24 months and 24 –o 36 months after a negative screen, we found overall <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates and regional ranges of 0. 55 (0. 43 – 0. 76), 1. 13 (0. 92 – 1. 47) and 1. 22 (0. 93 – 1. 57) per 1000 women screened, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To enable better {{monitoring}} of interim outcome {{measures in the}} NHS Breast Screening Programme by providing revised targets for cancer detection rates, and revised expected <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates. DESIGN AND SETTING: Expected detection rates of invasive cancers at prevalent screen are calculated, using estimates of the underlying England and Wales incidence rates and age specific prevalence incidence ratios from the Swedish Two County Study. Expected <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates are also derived from this study, and are used to calculate expected detection rates at rescreening. RESULTS: The expected invasive cancer detection rates at first screen for women aged 50 - 52 is 3. 6 per 1000. The expected rate at rescreening for women aged 53 - 64 is 4. 0 per 1000. Expected <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates for women screened from 1995 / 6 onwards are 0. 45 per 1000, 0. 65 per 1000, and 1. 2 - 1. 3 per 1000 for the periods within 0 -< 12, 12 -< 24, and 24 -< 36 months of screening.

This paper presents methods for the detection of architectural distortion in mammograms of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> cases taken prior to the detection of breast cancer using Gabor filters, phase portrait analysis, fractal analysis, and texture analysis. The methods were used to detect initial candidates for sites of architectural distortion in prior mammograms of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> and also normal control cases. A total of 4, 224 regions of interest (ROIs) were automatically obtained from 106 prior mammograms of 56 <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> cases, including 301 ROIs related to architectural distortion, and from 52 prior mammograms of 13 normal cases. For each ROI, the fractal dimension and Haralick’s texture features were computed. Feature selection was performed separately using stepwise logistic regression and stepwise regression. The best results achieved, in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, with the features selected by stepwise logistic regression are 0. 76 with the Bayesian classifier, 0. 73 with Fisher linear discriminant analysis, 0. 77 with an artificial neural network based on radial basis functions, and 0. 77 with a support vector machine.

40|$|Background: Colorectal cancers (CRCs) {{detected}} {{through the}} NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) {{have been shown}} to have a more favourable outcome compared to non-screen-detected cancers. The aim was to identify whether this was solely due to the earlier stage shift of these cancers, or whether other factors were involved. Methods: A combination of a regional CRC registry (Northern Colorectal Cancer Audit Group) and the BCSP database were used to identify screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> (diagnosed after a negative faecal occult blood test, before the next screening round), diagnosed between April 2007 and March 2010, within the North East of England. For each Dukes' stage, patient demographics, tumour characteristics, and survival rates were compared between these two groups. Results: Overall, 322 screen-detected cancers were compared against 192 <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> Screen-detected Dukes' C and D CRCs had a superior survival rate compared with <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> (P= 0. 014 and P= 0. 04, respectively). Cox proportional hazards regression showed that Dukes' stage, tumour location, and diagnostic group (HR 0. 45, 95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 69, P< 0. 001 for screen-detected CRCs) were all found to {{have a significant impact on}} the survival of patients. Conclusions: The improved survival of screen-detected over <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> for stages C and D suggest that there may be a biological difference in the cancers in each group. Although lead-time bias may have a role, this may be related to a tumour's propensity to bleed and therefore may reflect detection through current screening tests...|$|R
40|$|Background: Interval cancers are primary breast cancers {{diagnosed}} in women after a negative screening test {{and before the}} next screening invitation. Our aim was to evaluate risk factors for <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> and their subtypes and to compare the risk factors identified with those associated with incident screen-detected cancers. Methods: We analyzed data from 645, 764 women participating in the Spanish breast cancer screening program from 2000 - 2006 and followed-up until 2009. A total of 5, 309 screen-detected and 1, 653 interval cancers were diagnosed. Among the latter, 1, 012 could be classified {{on the basis of}} findings in screening and diagnostic mammograms, consisting of 489 true interval cancers (48. 2 %), 235 false-negatives (23. 2 %), 172 minimal-signs (17. 2 %) and 114 occult tumors (11. 3 %). Information on the screening protocol and women's characteristics were obtained from the screening program registry. Cause-specific Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of risks factors for <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> and incident screen-detected cancer. A multinomial regression model, using screen-detected tumors as a reference group, was used to assess the effect of breast density and other factors on the occurrence of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> subtypes. Results: A previous false-positive was the main risk factor for <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> (HR = 2. 71, 95 %CI: 2. 28 - 3. 23); this risk was higher for false-negatives (HR = 8. 79, 95 %CI: 6. 24 - 12. 40) than for true <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> (HR = 2. 26, 95 %CI: 1. 59 - 3. 21). A family history of breast cancer was associated with true intervals (HR = 2. 11, 95 %CI: 1. 60 - 2. 78), previous benign biopsy with a false-negatives (HR = 1. 83, 95 %CI: 1. 23 - 2. 71). High breast density was mainly associated with occult tumors (RRR = 4. 92, 95 %CI: 2. 58 - 9. 38), followed by true intervals (RRR = 1. 67, 95 %CI: 1. 18 - 2. 36) and false-negatives (RRR = 1. 58, 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 2. 49).

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} {{of prostate cancer}} has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) was initiated in 1993 to determine how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening affects prostate cancer mortality. Variations in the screening algorithm, such as the interval between screening rounds, likely influence the morbidity, mortality, {{and quality of life}} of the screened population. Methods: We compared the number and characteristics of interval cancers, defined as those diagnosed during the screening interval but not detected by screening, in men in the screening arm of the ERSPC who were aged 55 - 65 years {{at the time of the}} first screening and were participating through two centers of the ERSPC: Gothenburg (2 -year screening interval, n = 4202) and Rotterdam (4 -year screening interval, n = 13301). All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31, 2005, but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries. A potentially life-threatening (aggressive) <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> was defined as one with at least one of the following characteristics at diagnosis: stage M 1 or N 1, plasma PSA concentration greater than 20. 0 ng/mL, or Gleason score greater than 7. We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The 10 -year cumulative {{incidence of}} all prostate cancers in Rotterdam versus Gothenburg was 1118 (8. 41 %) versus 552 (13. 14 %) (P <. 001), the cumulative incidence of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> was 57 (0. 43 %) versus 31 (0. 74 %) (P =. 51), and the cumulative incidence of aggressive <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> was 15 (0. 11 %) versus 5 (0. 12 %) (P =. 72). Conclusion: The rate of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer,</b> especially aggressive <b>interval</b> <b>cancer,</b> was low in this study. The 2 -year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4 -year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify demographic, clinical and prognostic factors associated with median diagnostic wait times separately for each cohort (screen-detected, interval and symptomatic) by detection method.|$|R
40|$|The 4 th {{year of the}} Avon breast {{screening}} programme comprises {{two distinct}} groups: those called for screening {{for the first time}} (prevalent group) and those who were initially screened 3 years earlier (incident group). The cancer detection rate, stage of disease and rate of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> in these patients have been compared. For the prevalent groups of year 1 and year 4 there was no statistically significant difference in the cancer detection rate, proportion of small tumours or node positivity. For the prevalent and incident groups of year 4, there was no statistically significant difference in the cancer detection rate or proportion of small tumours. There were significantly fewer node-positive tumours in the incident group (5 / 45 vs 8 / 23; P < 0. 05). Fifty-six <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> presented in the 3 -year period between years 1 and 4 of screening; 28 (50 %) after 24 months. The screening programme may result in tumours being detected at an earlier stage, but this may be offset by the high rate of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> This suggests that the time between screens may need to be reduced to 2 years...|$|R
40|$|Mammographic {{density is}} one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer and has been {{thoroughly}} studied as such. Extensive mammographic density also decreases screening sensitivity, thereby increasing the risk of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> Whether density acts as fertile ground for all types of breast cancer, or whether it influences tumor growth in a specific direction, was not known when we embarked upon the studies of this thesis. We therefore aimed to investigate the association between density, tumor characteristics, molecular subtypes, recurrence, and survival, focusing on <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> in the last study. For studies I, III, and IV, we used the cases included in a population-based case-control study, in which cases were all Swedish women, aged 50 - 74, with incident breast cancer, diagnosed 1993 - 1995 (n= 3345). We only included postmenopausal women with no prior history of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical cancer in situ (n= 2720). Of these women, 1774 women had eligible mammograms. For study II, in which we investigated the relationship between density and molecular subtypes, the study population was based on all women with breast cancer operated at a large university hospital in Stockholm 1994 - 1996 (n= 524). Women with available gene expression profiling and mammograms were included in the study (n= 110). Pre-diagnostic/diagnostic density of the unaffected breast was assessed using a semi-automated, computer-assisted thresholding technique, Cumulus. Density was either measured as the dense area in cm 2 (absolute density=AD) or percentage density (PD) (the absolute dense area/the total breast area). We did not find an association between density and tumor characteristics (lymph node metastasis, hormone-receptor status, grade, and histopathological classification) except for tumor size. However, this association seemed at least in part to be due to masking delaying diagnosis. In accordance with the lack of association between PD and most tumor characteristics, we did not find an association between density and molecular subtypes, nor between density, distant recurrence, and survival. We did, however, see a relatively strong association between PD and both local and locoregional recurrence, independent of established risk factors. In the last study, we investigated the differences in survival between <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> and screening-detected cancers, taking mammographic density into account. We could show that <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> in both dense and non-dense breasts were associated with poorer prognosis compared to screening-detected cancers. However, the poorer prognosis seen in <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> in dense breasts seemed mainly attributable to delayed detection, whereas the group of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> in non-dense breasts primarily seemed composed of truly aggressive tumors which we believe need further study...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that factors such as current hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use andmammographic density may each lower the sensitivity of mammography and {{are associated with a}} greater risk of developing an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer.</b> This study explores this relationship further by examining the influence of patterns of HRT use and the percentage of mammographic density on the detection of breast cancer by classification of <b>interval</b> <b>cancer.</b> Methods: This study uses a case-case design nested within a cohort of women screened by the Ontario Breast Screening Program between 1994 and 2002. Interval cancers, both those missed at screening but seen on retrospective review (n = 87) or true intervals without visible tumor signs at screening (n = 288) were matched to 450 screen-detecte...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess how often women with undetected calcifications in prior {{screening}} mammograms are subsequently diagnosed with invasive cancer. From a screening cohort of 63, 895 women, exams were collected from 59, 690 women without any abnormalities, 744 women with a screen-detected cancer and a prior negative exam, 781 women with a false positive exam based on calcifications, and 413 women with an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer.</b> A radiologist identified cancer-related calcifications, selected by a computer-aided detection system, on mammograms taken prior to screen-detected or <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> diagnoses. Using this ground truth and the pathology reports, the sensitivity for calcification detection and the proportion of lesions with visible calcifications that developed into invasive cancer were determined. The screening sensitivity for calcifications was 45. 5 %, at a specificity of 99. 5 %. A total of 68. 4 % (n = 177) of cancer-related calcifications that could have been detected earlier were associated with invasive cancer when diagnosed. Screening sensitivity for detection of malignant calcifications is low. Improving the detection of these early signs of cancer is important, because the majority of lesions with detectable calcifications that are not recalled immediately but detected as <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> or in the next screening round are invasive at the time of diagnosi...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The study {{objectives}} were three-fold: {{to estimate the}} effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use on the sensitivity of mammographic screening; to examine the odds of having an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> {{as a function of}} duration of HRT use and to compare the size, grade, lymph node and hormone receptor status of tumours for HRT users and non-users. Setting: Perth, Western Australia, where a free, population-based mammographic screening service targets women aged 50 – 69 years. Methods: The cohort consisted of 113, 310 women who had 119, 296 screening episodes between January 1998 and December 1999. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the odds of having an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> {{as a function of the}} effect of the duration of HRT use (measured in years). Using subsequent screening rounds, χ 2 -tests were used to examine whether HRT users differed from HRT non-users in terms of tumour characteristics. Results: Ninety-seven screen-detected and 31 interval cancers were diagnosed among women who were on initial screening rounds, and 393 screen-detected and 153 interval cancers were diagnosed among women on subsequent screens, two years post screening. Two-year sensitivity outcomes were significantly lower for HRT users on initial screening rounds. For women on subsequent screening rounds, the odds of having an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> increased with the duration of HRT use (odds ratio 1. 09, 95...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE We {{sought to}} {{determine}} how breast cancers that occur within 1 year after a normal mammogram are discovered. METHODS Using population-based mammography registry data from 2000 - 2002, we identifi ed 143 women with <b>interval</b> breast <b>cancers</b> and 481 women with screen-detected breast cancers. We surveyed women’s primary care clini-cians to assess how the <b>interval</b> breast <b>cancers</b> were found and factors associated with their discovery. RESULTS Women with <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> were {{twice as likely to}} have a personal history of breast cancer (30. 1 %) as women with screen-detected cancers (13. 6 %). Among women with <b>interval</b> <b>cancers,</b> one half of the invasive tumors (49. 5 %) were discovered when women initiated a health care visit because of a breast concern, and 16. 8 % were discovered when a clinician found an area of concern while conducting a routine clinical breast examination. Having a lump and both a personal and a family history of breast cancer was the most common reason why women initiated a health care visit (44 %) (P <. 01). CONCLUSIONS Women with <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> are most likely to initiate a visit to a primary care clinician when they have 2 or more breast concerns. These concerns are most likely to include having a lump and a personal and/or family history of breast cancer. Women at highest risk for breast cancer may need closer surveil-lance by their primary care clinicians and may benefi t from a strong educational message to come for a visit as soon as they fi nd a lump.

40|$|Background: Full-field digital {{mammography}} (FFDM) {{has replaced}} screen-film mammography (SFM) in most breast cancer screening programs due to technological advantages such as possibilities to adjust contrast, better image quality and transfer capabilities. This study describes the performance indicators {{during the transition}} from SFM to FFDM and the characteristics of screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods: Data of the Dutch breast cancer screening program, region North from 2004 to 2010 were linked to The Netherlands Cancer Registry (N = 902 868). Performance indicators and tumour characteristics of screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> were compared between FFDM and SFM. Results: After initial screens, recall rates were 2. 1 % (SFM) and 3. 0 % (FFDM; P < 0. 001). The positive predictive values (PPV) were 25. 6 % (SFM) and 19. 9 % (FFDM; P = 0. 002). Detection rates were similar, as were all performance indicators after subsequent screens. Similar percentages of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were found for SFM and FFDM. Invasive cancers diagnosed after subsequent screens with FFDM were more often of high-grade (P = 0. 024) and ductal type (P = 0. 030). The incidence rates of <b>interval</b> <b>cancers</b> were similar for SFM and FFDM after initial (2. 69 / 1000 vs 2. 51 / 1000; P = 0. 787) and subsequent screens (2. 30 vs 2. 41; P = 0. 652), with similar tumour characteristics. Conclusions: FFDM resulted in similar rates of screen-detected and <b>interval</b> <b>cancers,</b> indicating that FFDM performs as well as SFM in a breast cancer screening program. No signs {{of an increase in}} low-grade DCIS (which might connote possible overdiagnosis) were seen. Nonetheless, after initial screening, which accounts for 12 % of all screens, FFDM resulted in higher recall rate and lower PPV that requires attention...|$|R
30|$|The {{proportion}} of interval cancers {{in the whole}} screening target population was 28 %, and among the screening attendees 33 %. In our previous study from the 1990 s and early 2000 s, the {{proportion of}} interval cancers among the screening attendees measured by the detection method was 35 %, {{and there was an}} increasing trend in the <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> proportion (Sarkeala et al. 2006). According to the current results, the reported increase in the early 2000 ’s seems to have turned to a decrease after the year 2007 when the expansion of invitational age in the Finnish mammography programme started. In women aged 60 – 69 years, the <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> occurrence has consistently been reported to be smaller than in the younger target population (Sarkeala et al. 2006; Törnberg et al. 2010). Nonetheless, also trends in the access to mammograms and/or other diagnostic activities outside screening may have affected the phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Background: There is accumulating {{evidence}} that digital breast tomosynthesis, {{referred to as}} 3 D-mammography in this protocol, improves screen-detection measures compared to standard 2 D-mammography {{in the context of}} population screening for breast cancer. However, the effect of 3 D-mammography at follow-up of screened women is not yet known: it is unknown whether additional cancer detection from 3 D-mammography leads to incremental screening benefit through a reduction of interval cancers, or whether it is mostly over-detecting indolent cancers. Methods: The aim {{of this study is to}} examine whether 3 D-mammography population screening improves breast cancer screening effectiveness by reducing <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates compared to standard digital (2 D) mammography screening, using individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. In this protocol, we outline the research plan which includes systematic identification of studies eligible to contribute data into the IPD meta-analysis, and sourcing and assembling IPD for participants screened with 3 D-mammography (3 D alone or integrated 2 D/ 3 D or integrated 2 Dsynthetic/ 3 D) and comparison participants screened with 2 D-mammography (standard of care in breast screening). The primary end-point of this work is the interval breast cancer rate per 10, 000 screens for 3 D-mammography versus 2 D-mammography screening. The IPD meta-analysis will also assess secondary outcomes including: screening sensitivity, cancer detection rates, cancer (prognostic) characteristics, and recall rates, for 3 D-mammography versus 2 D-mammography screening. The use of IPD meta-analysis will allow stratification of results by age and breast density, and will also facilitate analysis of cancer histological (prognostic) characteristics. Discussion: Finalization of data collection procedures and analysis plans will be complete by the end of 2017. Data collection will occur from late 2017 to late 2018 (screen-detection measures: cancer detection and recall data) and from mid- 2018 to mid- 2019 (<b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> data). Results of detection measures should be available by 2019, and <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> results in 2020. By addressing the critical evidence gap on whether 3 D-mammography screening reduces <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> rates (compared to 2 D-mammography), we expect that our findings will inform timely translation of 3 D-mammography technology into breast screening practice in population-based health programs...|$|E
40|$|Despite colonoscopic surveillance, Lynch {{syndrome}} patients develop {{colorectal cancer}} (CRC). Identification of modifiable factors {{has the potential}} to improve outcome of surveillance. The aims of this study were to determine (1) characteristics of patients with CRC, (2) endoscopic and histological features of these cancers, and (3) quality of the previous colonoscopy. Approximately 2, 200 medical reports from proven and obligate mutation carriers identified at the Dutch Lynch Syndrome Registry and two large hospitals were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of an <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> defined as CRC diagnosed within 24 months of previous colonoscopy. Thirty-one interval cancers were detected in 29 patients (median age of 52 [range 35 - 73]), after a median time of 17 months. All were MLH 1 or MSH 2 mutation carriers, and 39 % had a previous CRC. In patients without previous surgery for CRC, 84 % was proximally located. Of all interval cancers, 77 % were at local stage (T 1 - 3 N 0 Mx). In three patients (9 %) with an incomplete previous colonoscopy, CRC was located in the unexamined colon. In six of the nine patients with an adenoma during previous colonoscopy, the cancer was detected in the same colonic segment as the previously removed adenoma. Interval cancers were detected in MLH 1 and MSH 2 mutation carriers, especially in those with a history of previous CRC and between 40 and 60 years. <b>Interval</b> <b>cancer</b> could be related to incompleteness of previous endoscopy and possibly residual adenomatous tissue. Further reduction of the <b>interval</b> <b>cancer</b> risk may be achieved by optimizing endoscopy quality and individualization of surveillance guidelines. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} that the introduction of breast screening is closely monitored. The anticipated effect on breast cancer mortality will take 10 years or more fully to emerge, and will only occur if a succession of more short-term end points are met.
