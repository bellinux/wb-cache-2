500|$|At {{the time}} of the 50th anniversary of the flag, the government—held by the Conservative Party—was criticized for the lack of {{official}} ceremony dedicated to the date; accusations of partisanship were levelled. Minister of Canadian Heritage Shelly Glover denied the charges and others, including Liberal Members of Parliament, pointed to community events taking place around the country. Governor General David Johnston did, though, preside at an official ceremony at Confederation Park in Ottawa, integrated with Winterlude. He said [...] "he National Flag of Canada is so embedded <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> life and so emblematic of our national purpose that we simply cannot imagine our country without it." [...] Queen Elizabeth II stated: [...] "On this, the 50th anniversary of the National Flag of Canada, I am pleased to join with all Canadians in the celebration of this unique and cherished symbol of our country and identity." [...] A commemorative stamp and coin were issued by Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{popular with}} many, the {{character}} of Ruth has also gained much criticism over the years. In 2007, Karen Price from the Western Mail called Ruth a [...] "much-loved character" [...] and The Scotsman's Fordyce Maxwell called Ruth [...] "the archetype of common sense and forward planning". Victoria Summerley from The Independent noted the character was [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] {{because she is a}} Geordie and bemoaned the fact [...] "poor inoffensive Ruth" [...] was disliked by some of the more hardcore fans because of this. Nicholas Lezard from the same publication disliked Ruth, branding her [...] "highly irritating". He later thought the scriptwriters had created in David and Ruth [...] "the only couple in the Western Hemisphere who are delighted that their parents are coming for Christmas." [...] Ruth and David were described by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as [...] "the series' golden couple — the future Phil and Jill". While The Herald's Anne Simpson said the couple were [...] "the standing stones of Ambridge: rooted, solid, weathered by storms but unbeaten, a reassuring constant <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> life." ...|$|E
500|$|Spoilt Rotten {{was chosen}} by Jasper Fforde on the Penguin Books website {{as one of the}} books he would most like to get for Christmas. Fforde wrote that the book, [...] "makes uneasy reading for huggy liberals, and asks harsh {{questions}} over the bizarre sense of sentimentality that seems to have befuddled us Brits ever since millions of us queued up to sign a book of condolences for a princess we didn't know. Dalrymple looks at the downside of an overblown sense of sentiment, which resulted this year with a murderous thug who saw himself as a victim and found 32,000 people agreeing with him, and even opening a tribute Facebook page in his posthumous honor". Spoilt Rotten also made Thomas Sowell's list of Christmas books for 2010. A positive review in The Scotsman stated, [...] "Dalrymple tackles sentimentality on every front. He is frequently witty, always punchy and sometimes rapier-like, as he analyses the 'bunk' of his opponents to within an inch of its cant". In the Daily Express, Neil Hamilton reviewed the book positively, writing, [...] "Theodore Dalrymple's excellent Spoilt Rotten offers some thought-provoking insights and explains how emotional constipation <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> psyche has become emotional diarrhoea".|$|E

500|$|Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a {{photograph}} of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan [...] with the U.S. Presidential Seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal abortion procedures from 518 in 1967 {{to an average of}} around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor—more than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, [...] "If we accept the right to take life before birth are we so far from making the decision after birth?" [...] She went on to say, [...] "I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their position on abortion, and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, [...] "Today there is a wound <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
