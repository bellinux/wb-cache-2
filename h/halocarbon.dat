25|$|The U.S. Government's {{attitude}} {{began to}} change again in 1983, when William Ruckelshaus replaced Anne M. Burford as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to <b>halocarbon</b> regulations. In 1985 20 nations, including {{most of the major}} CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol. Meanwhile, the <b>halocarbon</b> industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. However, this shift was uneven with DuPont acting more quickly than their European counterparts. DuPont may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40 million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the U.S. in the next 88 years. The EU shifted its position as well after Germany gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Halocarbon</b> replacements, HCFC Blend B (Halotron I, American Pacific Corporation), HFC-227ea (FM-200, Great Lakes Chemicals Corporation), and HFC-236fa (FE-36, DuPont), {{have been}} {{approved}} by the FAA for use in aircraft cabins in 2010. Considerations for halon replacement include human toxicity when used in confined spaces, ozone depleting potential, and greenhouse warming potential. The three recommended agents meet minimum performance standards, but uptake has been slow because of disadvantages. Specifically, they require two to three times the concentration to extinguish a fire compared with Halon 1211. They are heavier than halon, require a larger bottle because they are less effective, and have greenhouse gas potential. Research continues to find better alternatives.|$|E
50|$|A few <b>halocarbons</b> are {{produced}} in massive amounts by microorganisms. For example, several {{million tons of}} methyl bromide {{are estimated to be}} produced by marine organisms annually. Most of the <b>halocarbons</b> encountered in everyday life - solvents, medicines, plastics - are man-made. The first synthesis of <b>halocarbons</b> was achieved in the early 1800s. Production began accelerating when their useful properties as solvents and anesthetics were discovered. Development of plastics and synthetic elastomers has led to greatly expanded scale of production. A substantial percentage of drugs are <b>halocarbons.</b>|$|R

25|$|After a 1976 {{report by}} the United States National Academy of Sciences {{concluded}} that credible scientific evidence supported the ozone depletion hypothesis a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, moved to eliminate the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans. At the time this was widely regarded {{as a first step}} towards a more comprehensive regulation policy, but progress in this direction slowed in subsequent years, due to a combination of political factors (continued resistance from the <b>halocarbon</b> industry and a general change in attitude towards environmental regulation during {{the first two years of}} the Reagan administration) and scientific developments (subsequent National Academy assessments that indicated that the first estimates of the magnitude of ozone depletion had been overly large).|$|E
2500|$|Dimethyl ether is {{the main}} {{constituent}} in some industrial [...] "freeze spray" [...] spot-coolants used in field testing of electronic components. In this role it has supplanted <b>halocarbon</b> compounds (Freon), which have been suspected of contributing to ozone depletion in the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main cause}} of ozone {{depletion}} and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, especially man-made <b>halocarbon</b> refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, freons, halons), [...] referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by winds after being emitted at the surface. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).|$|E
40|$|Sea ice is to date {{a rather}} poorly {{investigated}} {{part of the}} cycling of volatile halogenated organic compounds, <b>halocarbons.</b> These compounds are natural sources of reactive iodine and bromine to the atmosphere, and are produced in the marine environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the role of sea ice in terms of production and release of <b>halocarbons</b> to the atmosphere. Iodinated and brominated <b>halocarbons</b> were measured in polar sea ice as well as in snow, air, and seawater under the ice. Multiple samples were collected from the same location in order to cover variability. Studies were performed both in winter and summer, and seasonal variations were observed. Sea ice acted as a source of <b>halocarbons</b> both in winter and in summer. Biotic production was observed during summer, and depth distributions of <b>halocarbons</b> in the ice were related to ice algal biomass. Unexpectedly high concentrations of <b>halocarbons</b> were found at the surface of Antarctic winter sea ice. For bromoform (CHBr 3) the concentration range was 0. 2 - 20 nM in the top 10 cm of the ice. High concentrations were also found in the snow closest to the snow-ice interface. Our results suggest that an abiotic formation occurs in seasonal sea ice during polar night. This may lead to a winter accumulation of <b>halocarbons</b> in the marine boundary layer and enhance tropospheric ozone depletion in the polar spring...|$|R

2500|$|Halon was {{completely}} banned in Europe and Australia except for critical users like {{law enforcement and}} aviation, resulting in stockpiles either being destroyed via high heat incineration or {{being sent to the}} United States for reuse. Halon 1301 and 1211 are being replaced with new <b>halocarbon</b> agents which have no ozone depletion properties and low atmospheric lifetimes, but are less effective. Halon 2402 is a liquid agent (dibromotetrafluoroethane) which has had limited use in the West due to its higher toxicity than 1211 or 1301. It is widely used in Russia and parts of Asia, and it was used by Kidde's Italian branch, marketed under the name [...] "Fluobrene".|$|E
2500|$|The interim {{replacements}} for CFCs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which deplete stratospheric ozone, {{but to a}} much lesser extent than CFCs. Ultimately, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) will replace HCFCs. Unlike CFCs and HCFCs, HFCs have an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0. [...] DuPont began producing hydrofluorocarbons as alternatives to Freon in the 1980s. These included Suva refrigerants and Dymel propellants. Natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning. Hydrofluorocarbons {{are included in the}} Kyoto Protocol because of their very high Global Warming Potential and are facing calls to be regulated under the Montreal Protocol due to the recognition of <b>halocarbon</b> contributions to climate change.|$|E
2500|$|The Rowland–Molina {{hypothesis}} was strongly disputed {{by representatives of}} the aerosol and <b>halocarbon</b> industries. The Chair of the Board of DuPont {{was quoted as saying}} that ozone depletion theory is [...] "a science fiction tale … a load of rubbish … utter nonsense". Robert Abplanalp, the President of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements. Nevertheless, within three years most of the basic assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements and by direct observation in the stratosphere. The concentrations of the source gases (CFCs and related compounds) and the chlorine reservoir species (HCl and [...] ) were measured throughout the stratosphere, and demonstrated that CFCs were indeed the major source of stratospheric chlorine, and that nearly all of the CFCs emitted would eventually reach the stratosphere. Even more convincing was the measurement, by James G. Anderson and collaborators, of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the stratosphere. ClO is produced by the reaction of Cl with ozone—its observation thus demonstrated that Cl radicals not only were present in the stratosphere but also were actually involved in destroying ozone. McElroy and Wofsy extended the work of Rowland and Molina by showing that bromine atoms were even more effective catalysts for ozone loss than chlorine atoms and argued that the brominated organic compounds known as halons, widely used in fire extinguishers, were a potentially large source of stratospheric bromine. In 1976 the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report concluding that the ozone depletion {{hypothesis was}} strongly supported by the scientific evidence. [...] In response the United States, Canada and Norway banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 1978. Early estimates were that, if CFC production continued at 1977 levels, the total atmospheric ozone would after a century or so reach a steady state, 15 to 18 percent below normal levels. By 1984, when better evidence on the speed of critical reactions was available, this estimate was changed to 5 to 9 percent steady-state depletion.|$|E
40|$|The {{mission of}} the <b>Halocarbons</b> and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS) group is to study <b>halocarbons</b> and other trace gases that cause {{chemical}} and radiative change in the atmosphere. The goal of HATS is to measure and interpret the distributions and trends of these species in the troposphere, stratosphere, and ocean with the best analytical instrumentation available. The species studied include nitrous oxide (N 2 O); many halogenated species, such as <b>halocarbons,</b> fluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6); organic nitrates, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN); organic sulfur gases, such as carbonyl sulfide (COS); and hydrocarbons (HCs). The <b>halocarbons</b> include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); chlorocarbons (CCs), such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), methyl chloroform (CH 3 CCl 3), chloroform (CHCl 3), dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2), and tetrachloroethene (C 2 Cl 4); the replacement CFC...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} {{rates of}} eight volatile halogenated compounds by three tropical brown seaweed species collected from Cape Rachado, west coast Peninsular Malaysia, under different irradiances have been determined. A purge-and-trap sample preparation {{system with a}} gas chromatograph and mass-selective detector {{was used to measure}} a suite of <b>halocarbons</b> released by Sargassum binderi Sonder ex J. Agardh, Padina australis Hauck, and Turbinaria conoides (J. Agardh) Kützing. All species are widely distributed in Peninsular Malaysia, with S. binderi a dominant seaweed species at our survey site. Release of few <b>halocarbons</b> was found to be influenced by irradiance. Correlations were also observed between emission of certain <b>halocarbons</b> with photosynthetic activity, especially bromo-and iodinated compounds (0. 6 [*]<[*]r[*]< 0. 9; p[*]<[*] 0. 01) suggesting that environmental factors such as light can affect the release of these volatile halogenated compounds by the seaweeds into the atmosphere. Compared with temperate and polar brown seaweeds, tropical species, such as T. conoides, may emit higher levels of bromoform, CHBr 3, and other <b>halocarbons.</b> It is therefore important to investigate the contribution of tropical seaweeds towards the local atmospheric composition of <b>halocarbons...</b>|$|R
