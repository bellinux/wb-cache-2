2500|$|The {{printing}} press {{was invented in}} the Holy Roman Empire by the German Johannes Gutenberg [...] around 1440, based on existing screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system, by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. His newly devised <b>hand</b> <b>mould</b> made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. [...] In East Asia, where it was invented, the usefulness of movable type was limited by {{the complexity of the}} writing system and, without the <b>hand</b> <b>mould,</b> the production of [...] sorts (individual letters of type) was slow.

Use of fly ash in manufacturing brick is one such subject which is being studied by researchers. The aim of the present study is to investigate the strength and water absorption characteristic of fly ash bricks made of lime (L), local soil (S) and fly ash (FA). The experiments were conducted both on <b>Hand</b> <b>moulded</b> and Pressure moulded fly ash bricks. It was observed that none of the L-S-FA bricks satisfy all the requirements of standard codes.

5000|$|It was the {{invention}} of efficient metal type casting that was Gutenberg's most important invention. Woodblock printing had been known in China for centuries, and Laurens Janszoon Coster and other Dutch printers developed moveable type before Gutenberg. It was innovations in type casting that made for Gutenberg's breakthrough of commercially printing.

The matrix will be made by driving a punch of the type to be made into soft copper, or electrotyping a matrix from a piece of type.|$|E
40|$|Common clay bricks were {{prepared}} by mixing sand in different proportions (10, 20, 30, 40 wt. %) with clay. Local clay {{from two different}} sources, viz. Koel River and Naga Pond were used as the clay source. The clay – sand mixture was characterized for liquid limit, Plastic Limit and plasticity index. The brick samples were made by <b>hand</b> <b>moulding</b> and fired at 1000 °C, 1100 °C, 1200 °C and 1300 °C. Apparent porosity, Bulk density, Water absorption and Bending Strength of the samples were measured. The highest strength was 103. 80 kg/cm 2 for bricks prepared from Koel River Clay – Sand mixture(90 % Clay - 10 % Sand) and sintered at 1300 °C, apparent porosity was 22. 95 % and water absorption 11. 78 %. In Naga Pond Clay, the strength was 120. 02 Kg/cm 2, apparent porosity 22. 40 % and water absorption 11. 45 % for 90 % Clay – 10 % Sand composition. The porosity increased with increase in sand content. The results show that both the clay can be suitable for common roofing tile and water pitchers...|$|R

40|$|Comparison {{with the}} {{magnetic}} anisotropy of unbaked (only dried) and baked loam bricks, <b>hand</b> <b>moulded</b> in a rectangular frame, {{reveals that the}} same moulding technique had been applied to produce the bricks of a Medieval brick kiln that was archaeomag-netically dated at 1650 AD [Geoarchaeology (to be published) ]. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements show that the unbaked and baked bricks have a shape-related magnetic fabric, induced during the moulding process, with average Kmax occurring in the greatest faces along {{the direction of the}} longest edges and Kmin perpendicular to the greatest faces of the bricks. The anisotropy of thermoremanence (ATRM) is high, indicating that the remanence directions of bricks may accuse large deviations from the geomagnetic field direction responsible for it. However, anisotropy seems unlikely to be the cause for the apparent dis-crepancy between the archaeomagnetical and archaeological date of the brick kiln, the latter presumably about half a century older. Besides AMS, also the anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence was examined as a possible substitute for ATRM and to obtain in-formation on the magnetic state of the minerals contributing to the remanence anisotropy...|$|R

50|$|The exact date of Gutenberg's {{press is}} debated based on {{existing}} screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system by both adapting existing technologies and making inventions of his own. His newly devised <b>hand</b> <b>mould</b> {{made possible the}} rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities Johannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn—a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill. However, {{it was not until}} a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record exists; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.|$|E
5000|$|Casting: The matrix is {{inserted}} {{into the bottom of}} a device called a <b>hand</b> <b>mould.</b> The mould is clamped shut and molten type metal alloy consisting mostly of lead and tin, {{with a small amount of}} antimony for hardening, is poured into a cavity from the top. Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools, giving the casting sharp edges. When the type metal has sufficiently cooled, the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately 4 centimeters long, called a sort, is extracted. Excess casting on the end of the sort, called the tang, is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing, known as [...] "type height".|$|E
5000|$|At a {{later date}} a wall {{was added to the}} larger room to form the present central corridor. This wall was {{constructed}} of 100 millimetre wide v-jointed boards. The door and door hardware to this wall confirm its later construction. The v-jointed boards lining the ceiling to these rooms, the timber ceiling ventilators and the scotia cornices were probably added at this time as well. The ceilings may have been calico originally. The weatherboard walls to the eastern and western elevation may be original but if so were likely to have been unlined internally. The internal lining of 100 millimetre T and G boards are certainly a later addition. It is more probable that these walls were lined internally with studs exposed to the outside and that these have decayed and been replaced at {{a later date}}. This assertion is supported by inspection of the door and window sashes. The French doors {{at the front of the}} house have [...] "lambs tongue" [...] or ogee profile glazing bars which were <b>hand</b> <b>moulded</b> and which are more in keeping with earlier construction techniques. The windows have glazing bars which are machine moulded indicating that the sashes, if not the whole body of the windows, are later and likely to have been inserted when the east and west walls were reconstructed. Window hoods throughout are likely to date to this period also.|$|R

50|$|In {{injection}} moulding, hand moulds {{refer to}} simple moulds {{that have no}} provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a <b>hand</b> <b>mould</b> is cycled universal heating plates are required to warm the moulds and the moulds must be removed after each cycle to remove the mouldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mould. They are usually single cavity moulds, but may be multi-cavity if the moulding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of {{the simplicity of the}} parts. If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{product of}} manual typecasting were fonts for letterpress printing, {{and the process}} starts with the installation of a matrix with {{the impression of a}} particular glyph {{into the bottom of the}} <b>hand</b> <b>mould</b> which is adjusted for the width of the body and locked in preparation for casting. Molten type metal alloy would be carefully poured into a straight-sided vertical cavity at the top of the mould. The type caster would then give the mould a quick shake to aid the flow of type metal into every cavity of the matrix. In practice it was discovered that different glyphs would require different shakes to cast the characters properly. As the casting cooled down and solidified, the mould would be unlocked and the sort removed, ready for later finishing operations and locked again ready for the next character.|$|E
50|$|Gutenberg in 1439 was {{the first}} European to use the {{printing}} press and movable type in Europe. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink for printing books; adjustable molds; mechanical movable type; {{and the use of}} a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg's method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a <b>hand</b> <b>mould</b> for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.|$|E
