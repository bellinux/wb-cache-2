5|$|Glimcher {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} novel in 1988, before hiring Cynthia Cidre to write the screenplay. Various studios rejected the film, and after an unsuccessful pre-production development at Universal Pictures, the project moved to Warner Bros., with Regency Enterprises and Le Studio Canal+ agreeing to co-finance the film. When Warner Bros. wanted Jeremy Irons and Ray Liotta in the lead roles, Glimcher <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> executives to cast Assante and Banderas instead. Filming took place in Los Angeles, on sets recreating 1950s New York.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of her 1986 film Shanghai Surprise, Madonna decided to sign another comedy film titled Slammer, which was later renamed to Who's That Girl. However, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> both Warner Bros. and the {{producers}} of the film that she {{was ready for the}} project. Madonna enlisted her friend James Foley to direct the film. Shooting began in New York in October 1986, and continued until March 1987. Production was halted during December due to snowfall in New York. Madonna utilized the time to work on her next tour and the soundtrack of the film.|$|E
5|$|Development for The Rocketeer {{started as}} far back as 1983, when Stevens sold the film rights. Steve Miner and William Dear {{considered}} directing The Rocketeer before Johnston signed on. Screenwriters Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo had creative differences with Disney, which caused the film to languish in development hell. The studio also intended to change the trademark helmet design; Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted a straight NASA-type helmet, but Johnston convinced the studio otherwise. Johnston also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Disney to let him cast unknown actor Billy Campbell in the lead role. Filming for The Rocketeer lasted from September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. The visual effects sequences were created and designed by Industrial Light & Magic, and were supervised by animation director Wes Takahashi.|$|E

5|$|On November 10, 1948, Shadrick {{left for}} basic combat {{training}} at Fort Knox, Kentucky. As he was 17 years old, Shadrick <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> {{his parents to}} sign papers allowing him to enlist. Shadrick completed this training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, for post–World War II occupation duties. Shadrick spent a year on Kyushu island with the division. According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 he was growing tired of the country, and indicated in letters he was feeling depressed.|$|E
5|$|Tom Welling plays Clark Kent, a {{young man}} with superhuman {{abilities}} who tries to find his place in life after discovering that he is an alien and uses his powers to help those in danger. Clark's season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life. After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark. Although David Nutter <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> his manager that the role would not hurt the actor's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script, after reading the script Welling agreed to audition.|$|E
5|$|With air {{supremacy}} attained, Luftflotte 2 turned to support of ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw {{the full weight}} of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E

Toni <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Brad that her love for him is real.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the shoot, Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E
5|$|Saving Mr. Banks depicts several {{events that}} differ from {{recorded}} accounts. The premise of the script—that Walt Disney <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> P.L. Travers {{to hand over the}} film rights, including the scene when he finally persuades her—is fictionalized, as Disney had already secured the film rights (subject to Travers' approval of the script) when Travers arrived to consult with the Disney staff. Disney, in fact, left Burbank to vacation in Palm Springs a few days into Travers' visit and was not present at the studio when several of the film's scenes depicting him to be present actually took place. Therefore, many of the dialogue scenes between Travers and Disney are adapted from letters, telegrams, and telephone correspondence between the two. Although Travers was assigned a limousine driver, the character of Ralph is fictionalized and intended to be an amalgamation of the studio's drivers. In real life, Disney story editor Bill Dover was assigned as Travers' guide and companion during her time in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Boam's February 23, 1988 rewrite {{utilized}} many of Connery's comic suggestions. It {{included the}} prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Spielberg to show Indiana {{as a boy}} because of the mixed response to Empire of the Sun, which was about a young boy. Spielberg—who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award—had {{the idea of making}} Indiana a Boy Scout. Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision on March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end.|$|E

However, both team members <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wear incredibly heavy shoes while they danced. Each shoe weighed 2.5 kg. Teams would then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> a local family to let them stay for the night.|$|R

5|$|He {{expressed}} {{surprise that}} a task {{as important as}} the expedition's was entrusted to such young men. Von Hentig <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Emir that the mission did not consider themselves merchants, but instead brought word from the Kaiser, the Ottoman Sultan, and from India, wishing to recognise Afghanistan's complete independence and sovereignty. The Kaiser's typewritten letter, which he compared to the handsome greeting received from the Ottomans, failed to settle the Emir's suspicions; he doubted its authenticity. Von Hentig's explanation that the Kaiser had written the letter using the only instrument available at his field headquarters before the group's hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him. Passing along the Kaiser's invitation to join the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers, von Hentig described the war situation as favourable and invited the Emir to declare independence. This was followed by a presentation from Kasim Bey explaining the Ottoman Sultan's declaration of jihad and Turkey's desire to avoid a fratricidal war between Islamic peoples. He passed along a message to Afghanistan similar to the Kaiser's. Barkatullah invited Habibullah to declare war against the British Empire and to come to the aid of India's Muslims. He proposed that the Emir should allow Turco-German forces to cross Afghanistan for a campaign towards the Indian frontier, a campaign which he hoped the Emir would join. Barkatullah and Mahendra Pratap, both eloquent speakers, pointed out the rich territorial gains the Emir stood to acquire by joining the Central Powers.|$|E
25|$|The Taurus is {{credited}} with bringing many new design features into the mainstream marketplace. The Taurus used flush aerodynamic composite headlights, {{and was one of}} the first American sedans to do so. Originally, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) required that all cars sold in the United States use standardized round or rectangular sealed beam headlights, and Ford <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> them to change the rule to allow the headlights be any shape, as long as they met federal lighting standards.|$|E
25|$|Triveni picked Vishal Malhotra to {{play the}} {{character}} of the Pakistani supporter. The music composers approached Chandigarh-based singer Alamgir Khan to record the jingle for the advert. Khan, who had previously collaborated on the soundtracks of Bollywood films such as Bodyguard and Shaadi Ke Side Effects, revealed that he was reluctant to sing the jingle for the advert and that the producers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him hard. The song was composed and sung in a day, and the agency completed the shoot of the advert within five days, after which post-production was carried out.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{when the}} {{children}} {{were told that they}} could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of severe punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.|$|E
25|$|Emilio Estevez {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clarke, Estevez was recast. Nicolas Cage was considered {{for the role}} of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to John Cusack and Judd Nelson. Hughes eventually cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed at Nelson because he stayed in character by harassing Ringwald off-camera, and the other actors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Hughes not to fire him.|$|E
25|$|Thursday's Task: If Eric {{had won the}} HoH {{competition}} on Thursday night {{then he would have}} automatically completed the Nomination Task. In this case the top vote getting in CBS's AP poll would have been nominated along with a second player of Eric's choosing on Friday night, and Eric's task would have been complete. When Eric did not win the HoH competition, then he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the HoH to nominate the AP poll winner on Friday; however, if the HoH did not put up the player Eric/America was targeting on Friday, then Eric had a second chance to complete this task at the Veto Ceremony. Eric completed all but the last of his nomination tasks.|$|E

25|$|As the {{situation}} in Åland had now escalated to open violence, the Swedes intervened {{the situation}} with a counterfeit order by the White Army commander C. G. E. Mannerheim calling the Whites to retreat from Åland. In reality, general Mannerheim wanted the Whites {{to take control of}} all the islands and then launch an offensive against Turku, the Red capital of Southwest Finland. As the Whites did not know Mannerheim's real intentions, they followed the false order and left Åland on 20 February. As the White Finland found out about the Swedish conduct, they gave a strict objection. The Swedish government now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> that their purpose was not to join the islands to Sweden, but only to protect the Swedish-speaking people of Åland.|$|E
25|$|Gradually French Cardinals de Bernis and Luynes {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was impossible to find any better candidate with chances for the election than initially rejected by them Cardinal Braschi. This was the turning point of the conclave. The Braschi's candidature gained important and influential allies. But Spain and Portugal still opposed him as too much devoted to Jesuits. Braschi also had some opponents in the radical wing of his own party. To secure the required majority for Braschi, Cardinal de Bernis aligned himself with Cardinal Zelada, who recentely acted as mediator: de Bernis <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the political factions, while Zelada had to overcome the opposition among radical Zelanti. Also Cardinal Albani was engaged in the promotion of Braschi.|$|E
25|$|Princess Carolyne {{lived with}} Liszt {{during his years}} in Weimar. She {{eventually}} wished to marry Liszt, but since she had been previously married and her husband, Russian military officer Prince Nikolaus zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Ludwigsburg (1812–1864), was still alive, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Roman Catholic authorities that her marriage to him had been invalid. After huge efforts and a monstrously intricate process, she was temporarily successful (September 1860). It was planned that the couple would marry in Rome, on October 22, 1861, Liszt's 50th birthday. Although Liszt arrived in Rome on October 21, the Princess declined to marry him that evening. It appears that both her husband and the Tsar of Russia had managed to quash permission for the marriage at the Vatican. The Russian government also impounded her several estates in the Polish Ukraine, which made her later marriage to anybody unfeasible.|$|E
50|$|In 1931-32 season, their second, the Shamrocks won {{the league}} championship. Convinced {{they should be}} given a chance to play for the Stanley Cup, they petitioned the Cup {{trustees}} for that opportunity.

5000|$|In {{an article}} celebrating Schelling's Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics, Michael Kinsley, Washington Post op‑ed {{columnist}} {{and one of}} Schelling's former students, anecdotally summarizes Schelling's reorientation of game theory thus: [...] "You're {{standing at the edge}} of a cliff, chained by the ankle to someone else. You'll be released, and one of you will get a large prize, as soon as the other gives in. How do you persuade the other guy to give in, when the only method at your disposal - threatening to push him off the cliff - would doom you both? Answer: You start dancing, closer and closer to the edge. That way, you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him that you would do something totally irrational: plunge him and yourself off the cliff. You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him that you are prepared to take a higher risk than he is of accidentally falling off the cliff. If you can do that, you win." ...|$|R
