40|$|National laws {{governing}} {{collective investment undertakings}} were updated {{as a result of}} European secondary law modernization with a view to approximating the conditions of competition between those undertakings at Community level, {{while at the same time}} ensuring more effective and more uniform protection for unit-holders. Such coordination intended to facilitate the removal of the restrictions on the free movement of units of UCITS in the internal market. For the purposes of internal regulation UCITS means an undertaking: (a) with the sole object of collective investment in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets of capital raised from the public and which operate on the principle of risk-spreading; and (b) with units which are, at the request of holders, repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly, out of those undertakings’ assets. The UCITS may be constituted in accordance with contract law (as common funds managed by management companies), trust law (as unit trusts), or statute (as investment companies). <b>Key</b> <b>investor</b> <b>information</b> should be provided as a specific document to investors, before the subscription of the UCITS, in order to help them to reach informed investment decisions.

40|$|Cities {{compete with}} each other in order to attract more tourists, investors, {{businesses}} or residents today. Therefore, more and more attention is paid to the brand building and promotion of the city to the users of local services. However, the perception of the city (brand) can drastically vary among the users. The goal {{of this paper is to}} explore how the city of Trebinje is positioned in the minds of local services users. Determination of the status, image, and value of the city brand was carried out on the example of the city of Trebinje using Anholt-GfK Roper City Brands Index.

40|$|With the <b>Key</b> <b>Investor</b> <b>Information</b> Document (KID), the new UCITS IV {{framework}} {{brings a}} useful standardized and simplified scheme {{to explain the}} risk of mutual funds to non-professional investors. The Synthetic Risk and Reward Indicator (SRRI) methodology defines how to assess a volatility equivalent {{for each type of}} funds, and recognizes the specificities of various types of investment vehicles in the process. The SRRI rests upon two key principles: (i) risk-volatility mapping: the level of risk can be adequately translated by the volatility of returns; and (ii) reward to volatility: there must be a positive connection between the level of risk borne by the individual investor and the associated reward in terms of returns. We show that the SRRI methodology does not guarantee that these two principles are respected in practice. By forcing any type of risk to be translated into a volatility estimate, the approach overlooks investor’s heterogeneity in the definition of risk. The SRRI synthetic approach is powerless to adequately reflect the trade-off between normal and extreme risks the way it is perceived by individual investors. It also ignores that fund returns are not necessarily only related to volatility. We show that the KID does not replace a proper investment profiling system. The analysis of investor profiles is a necessary complement to the KID in order to provide adequate advice to investors. We provide an approach, based on the linear-exponential utility function, that enables the financial advisor to address the heterogeneity of investors when defining the risk of an investment portfolio.

Using annual management earnings forecasts from 1996 to 2010, I find that the association between forecast revisions and stock price changes over the revision periods is stronger when there is more informed trading. Further, the effect of <b>investor</b> <b>information</b> on the revision-return relation remains after controlling for various sources of managerial and public information, and is more pronounced when the information is more relevant to predicted earnings. In addition, more <b>investor</b> <b>information</b> contained in stock prices leads to a greater improvement in forecast accuracy but a weaker market reaction to the subsequent forecast announcement.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{new evidence that}} IPO underpricing is economic rents paid for investor to gather costly information. Subrahmanyam and Titman (1999) report that diverse <b>investor</b> <b>information,</b> once aggregated in the public market, could provide a more informative stock price and accurate feedback to firm’s investment decision. I investigate the hypothesis that IPO underpricing as economic rents could be higher, when <b>investor</b> <b>information</b> is diverse. In support of this hypothesis, I find a positive and significant correlation between the extent of underpricing and the information diversity measure proposed by Barron et al. (1998). There is a positive and significant correlation between this information diversity measure and an IPO firm’s subsequent (absolute) change in capital and R&D expenditures. In addition, firms with high information diversity measure and change in subsequent investment exhibit a better subsequent return performance than firms with low diversity and change in investment. This {{is consistent with the}} proposition that <b>investor</b> <b>information</b> serves as useful feedback for managers in the IPO market.
