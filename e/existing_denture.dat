40|$|This case {{presentation}} {{documents the}} treatment sequence of a 74 years old patient who complained about a sore spot of the palatal mucosa underneath the complete denture. The intraoral examination revealed a dark spot, redness and {{swelling of the}} mucosa around this spot and halitosis. The mucosa exhibited a perforation of 3 x 10 mm in diameter. A radiographic 3 -D picture showed an impacted canine tooth, which was partly covered by the palatal bone. Firstly the denture base was relieved and the swelling gradually disappeared. Then a biopsy was taken for histological analysis to exclude any malignant process. In local anesthesia the tooth was extracted, which exhibited a deep carious lesion of the entire crown. After surgery a visible collapse of the jaw crest was observed. During {{a period of two}} months the denture was relined with a soft material to improve its fit and to enhance the healing process.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether there is any relationship between the condition of complete dentures and TMDs. Methods: The sample consisted of 61 consecutive patients (35 females and 26 males) who were admitted to the Department of Prosthodontics of Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry for fabrication of new complete dentures.  The age range of the participants was between 32 and 80 years, with the mean age of 57. 05 ± 10. 26 years. The patients were examined by two prosthodontists. Using a questionnaire, the first prosthodontist asked the patients about their habits and history of trauma to the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). She then examined the participants for signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).   The second prosthodontist examined each participant's <b>existing</b> <b>denture</b> and checked its fit, stability, retention, occlusion, and centric relation, and recorded how long it had been in service. The examination was double blind. The data were recorded in examination sheets. Results: The relationship between TMDs and denture fit, stability, retention, centric relation and occlusion was analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Test. No significant relationship was found between denture characteristics and TMDs in complete denture wearers (P-value> 0. 05). Conclusion: Complete denture characteristics did not play a role in the development of TMDs in edentulous patients...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The maxillomandibular {{relationship}} (MMR) {{record is}} a critical step to establish the new occlusion in implant supported complete mouth rehabilitation. Using patients <b>existing</b> <b>denture</b> for recording the MMR requires implant definitive cast to be modified extensively to completely seat the denture (with unaltered flanges) on it. This may influence the correct seating of the denture on the implant definitive cast causing faulty recording of the MMR. Materials and Method: Elastomeric record bases, reinforced with the resin framework, are fabricated and relined with the light body elastomeric material when all the healing abutments are in place. The MMR is recorded with these elastomeric record bases using vacuum formed facial surface index of the occluded existing dentures as a guideline. Results: The elastomeric record bases with facial surface index of the existing dentures can allow clinicians to record MMR records without removing the healing abutments from the mouth with acceptable accuracy. This can save chair-side time of the procedure. The record of facial surfaces of existing complete denture {{in the form of}} vacuum formed sheet helps to set the occlusal vertical dimension. Conclusion: Use of facial surface index together with the elastomeric record bases can be the useful alternative technique to record the MMR in patients with implant supported full mouth rehabilitation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to increase the prevention efficiency of the secondary dentoalveolar deformations based {{on the characteristics of}} their pathogenesis and clinical course. Materials and methods. The results of clinical examination of 120 patients of different age groups (from 30 to 59 years) concerning the characteristics of the types of the secondary dentition deformities are presented in the article. Results. Objective study showed a high degree of deformation development, which arose in half of the cases in patients with <b>existing</b> <b>denture</b> defects. Some factors that influence the type of the secondary deformities and the direction of their development were established. They were the effect of the lost tooth on effective transmission of chewing pressure through the maxillary counterforts (the direction of tooth displacement in case of the secondary deformity was directly opposite to direction of counterforts) and trophic level of the teeth that were deformable or surrounded the area of displacement (displacement of devitalized teeth occurred 30 % more often than displacement of teeth that were innervated and supplied with blood). Radiological diagnosis made it possible to evaluate periodontal changes in case of the secondary deformities, which were characterized by changes in fibers tension of the tooth attachment apparatus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{the present}} {{prospective}} clinical study was to compare patient-reported outcomes for maxillary conventional dentures and maxillary implant-supported dentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-one patients (6 women and 15 men) being edentulous in the maxilla and encountering problems with their <b>existing</b> <b>dentures</b> were included. Twelve patients (4 women and 8 men) received {{a new set of}} conventional dentures, due to insufficient dentures. In nine patients (2 women and 7 men), the <b>existing</b> <b>dentures</b> were adjusted by means of relining or rebasing. All patients received implant-supported dentures on two retentive anchors. In total, 42 implants were inserted in the anterior maxilla. The participants rated their satisfaction on their <b>existing</b> conventional <b>dentures,</b> 2  months after insertion of new conventional dentures and 2  months after insertion of implant-supported dentures. Thereby, patients responded to questionnaires capturing the oral health impact profile (OHIP) using visual analog scales. Seven domains (functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical, psychological and social disability and handicap) were assessed. Higher scores implied poorer patient satisfaction. In addition, the questionnaire involved the evaluation of cleaning ability, general satisfaction, speech, comfort, esthetics, stability, and chewing ability. Higher scores implied higher patient satisfaction. RESULTS Patient satisfaction significantly increased for implant-supported dentures compared with old dentures in all seven OHIP subgroups, as well as for cleaning ability, general satisfaction, ability to speak, comfort, esthetics, and stability (P <  0. 05). The comparison of new conventional dentures and implant-supported dentures revealed a statistically significantly increased satisfaction for functional limitation (difference of 33. 2  mm), psychological discomfort (difference of 36. 7  mm), physical disability (difference of 36. 3  mm), and social disability (difference of 23. 5  mm), (P <  0. 05). Additionally, general satisfaction, chewing ability, speech, and stability significantly improved in implant-supported dentures (P <  0. 05).

40|$|Summary:. Establishing {{anatomic}} {{reduction of}} an edentulous mandible fracture is a frequently acknowledged challenge in craniomaxillofacial trauma surgery. In this study, we report a novel method for {{the reduction of}} the edentulous mandible fracture, via fabrication of modified Gunning splints using <b>existing</b> <b>dentures</b> and SMARTLock hybrid arch bars. This technique dramatically simplifies the application of an arch bar to dentures, obviates the need for the fabrication of impressions and custom splints, and eliminates the lag time associated with the creation of splints. Furthermore, this method may be used with or without adjunctive rigid internal fixation. The technique described herein of creating Gunning splints with SMARTLock hybrid arch bars provides surgeons with a simple, rapid, single-stage solution for reduction of mandibular fractures in the edentulous patient...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the last}} years, {{focus has been}} paid to implant {{treatment}} using immediate function protocols, and different approaches to provide patients with temporary constructions have been presented. Most of these techniques involve dental technicians producing the temporary construction, for example, rebuilding <b>existing</b> <b>dentures,</b> acrylic bridges, etc. PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of a chair-side technique of a cost-effective temporary prosthesis. Fixture survival rate and risk of temporary bridge failure were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven partially or totally edentate patients (18 female and 19 male; mean age: 66. 7 years) treated with chair-side manufactured temporary restorations (QuickBridge, BIOMET 3 i, Palm Beach, Fl, USA) for immediate loading have been evaluated. The prostheses extended from two unit bridges supported by two implants to full-arch construction supported by six implants. The temporary prostheses were monitored from the day of surgery and delivery to the time of replacement with a permanent prosthetic construction 3 to 6 months later. RESULTS: No implants were lost during the observation time. One (3 %) temporary prosthesis fractured and additional two (6 %) loosened during the follow-up time.

40|$|Clinical {{feasibility}} of mandibular implant overdenture retainers submitted to immediate load Introduction: Millions {{of people around}} the world do not have access to the benefits of osseointegration. Treatments involving oral rehabilitation with overdentures have been widely used by specialists in the oral medicine field. This is an alternative therapy for retention and stability achievement in total prosthesis with conventional treatment, and two implants are enough to establish a satisfactory overdenture. Objective: The objectives of the study were to evaluate 16 patients of both sexes, with an average age of 47. 4 +/- 4 years, using electromyographic analysis of masseter and temporal muscles and analyse the increase of incisive and molar maximal bite force with their <b>existing</b> complete <b>dentures</b> and following mandibular implant overdenture therapy to assess the benefits of this treatment. Materials and methods: For these tests, the Myosystem-BR 1 electromyograph and the IDDK Kratos dynamometer were used. Statistical analysis was performed using the repeated measures test (SPSS 17. 0). Results: A decrease in electromyographic activity during the rest, lateral and protrusion movements and increase of the maximal incisive and molar bite force after 15 months with a mandibular implant overdenture was observed. Conclusion: All the patients in this study reported a considerable improvement in the masticatory function and prostheses stability following treatment.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{instruments}} {{have been developed to}} measure the outcomes of oral disease. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) is the most sophisticated and comprehensive measure developed to date. At present, reports of the use of this measure are confined to descriptive population studies. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the validity of the OHIP with a generic health-related quality of life measure, the SF 36. Methods: Study subjects were in three groups, namely, edentulous patients seeking dental implants ("implant subjects", n= 32), edentulous patients seeking conventional dentures ("edentulous control", n= 35) and dentate patients ("dentate control", n= 21). All subjects completed an OHIP and SF 36 prior to receiving any treatment. The edentulous subjects also completed a subjective assessment of satisfaction with their <b>existing</b> conventional <b>dentures.</b> OHIP data were computed using the simple count and weighted scores methods. Results: The median number of negative impacts reported for each group was: 17 (implant subjects), six (conventional control) and one (dentate control). OHIP sub-scale scores were significantly higher (P< 0. 001) for implant subjects than control subjects. There were no significant differences between the SF 36 sub-scale scores. There was a significant correlation (P≤ 0. 01) between aspects of satisfaction with conventional dentures worn by the edentulous subjects and OHIP sub-scale scores. Correlations between denture satisfaction variables and SF 36 scores were not significant. Conclusions: It was concluded that the OHIP shows good discriminant and construct validity properties. As it is oral specific, it will be of greater use in measuring outcomes of oral disorders than generic measures such as SF 36.

Methods: Twenty-eight completely edentulous subjects (16 men and 21 women, age range from 49 to 87 years old.), who had been edentulous for at least 6 months, were wearing ill-fitting complete dentures, or unsatisfied with their <b>existing</b> complete <b>dentures</b> were recruited. Subjects were randomized to conventional and computer-aided design/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) treatment groups. Subjects in both groups were given the OHIP-EDENT (Oral Health Impact Profile for Edentulous Patients) and patient satisfaction questionnaires to record the data at baseline and at 1 month post-delivery of the new prostheses. Plaque samples were collected from intaglio surfaces of maxillary complete dentures at 1 month post-delivery to culture for any colonization of bacteria and/or yeasts. Results: There was a significant reduction in OHIP-EDENT scores within both treatment groups at the 1 month follow-up (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was also a significant reduction in almost all OHIP-EDENT domains scores at 1 month. Gender was significantly associated with OHIP-EDENT score at baseline (p = 0. 0419) and at 1 month (p = 0. 0152). Female subjects tend to have higher OHIP-EDENT scores than male subjects.

For this randomized clinical trial, 2 interforaminal short implants were placed in the intervention group (n = 16, 85. 0 ±  6. 19 yrs) to retain mandibular IODs; the control group (n = 18, 84. 1 ± 5. 55 yrs) received conventional relines. During the first year, no implant was lost; however, 2 patients died. IODs proved more stable, and participants in the intervention group demonstrated significantly higher denture satisfaction as well as an increased oral health-related quality of life compared to the control group. Maximum voluntary bite force improved significantly with IODs, yet the chewing efficiency was not different between groups. Masseter muscle thickness increased with IODs, mainly on the preferred chewing side. Body mass index decreased in both groups, but the decline tended to be smaller in the intervention group; blood markers and the Mini Nutritional Assessment did not confirm this tendency.

Purpose: To study: 1) if a 2 -visit CAD/CAM denture was satisfactory to patients who evaluated 12 specific clinical outcomes. 2) If there are any patient reported differences between various clinical outcomes, when evaluated at baseline (within 1 month of insertion) and at a 12 month follow-up since insertion. 3) If there are any adverse clinical and patient-satisfaction outcomes related to CAD-CAM complete denture prostheses. Materials and methods: A total of 20 subjects who presented with an existing set of maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were selected {{to take part in}} the study. Each set of complete dentures were duplicated in a clear acrylic resin. These duplicate dentures were then used as the custom tray, in which the patients went through border molding movements followed by a final impression. Jaw Relation Records was taken in centric relation at the appropriate occlusal vertical dimension and the correct incisal edge position. The mold and shade of the teeth were then selected. The duplicated dentures with occlusal rims and impression were then shipped to AvaDent. A digital preview was reviewed. If corrections were required, it was communicated with AvaDent through email or phone calls. Upon approval of the digital preview, the CAD-CAM monolithic dentures were milled. Standard denture protocols were followed for the insertion visit and subsequent post-insertion visits. The patients evaluated 12 clinical variables using the Visual Analogue Scale at 0 -months (baseline) and at 12 -months following insertion. The following variables were used: Retention (“Tightness”), Stability (“Absence of rockiness”), Support/Absence of food underneath the denture, Esthetics/Cosmetics, Finish/Appearance, Occlusion/Bite and chewing ability, Speech sounds/Ability to speak normally, Extensions/Bulkiness, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, Projection of the upper lip, Treatment time, and Overall evaluation/ “Overall prosthesis satisfaction” The collected data were then statistically analyzed. Results: Of the 20 subjects, 14 patients were evaluated at the 12 month follow up. Three subjects self-withdrew due to patient dissatisfaction. Another 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 14 patients rated the studied clinical outcomes as good to excellent at baseline and at 1 -year recall. Improvements in ratings were seen from baseline to 12 months in the following outcomes: extensions/bulkiness, occlusion/bite or chewing ability, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, finish/appearance, speech sounds, treatment time, and overall evaluation. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the patient-centered outcomes for CAD-CAM dentures fabricated using a 2 -visit protocol in patients with <b>existing</b> complete <b>dentures</b> was evaluated as good to excellent by patients, using a visual analog scale. The patient evaluations showed minimal differences from baseline and at 1 -year evaluation. However, speech, absence of sore spots, and total treatment time showed a statistically significant improvement in VAS ratings. Finally, patients classified as philosophical by House Classification provided the most favorable ratings in patient satisfaction for CAD-CAM dentures. Though the 2 -visit complete denture is a viable treatment option, clinicians should recognize the need for careful patient selection, learning curve in the clinical steps as well as the laboratory aspect of designing the CAD-CAM denture. Furthermore, the additional time and effort, spent off-chairside by clinicians to analyze and approve digital previews, should be weighed against chair-side time spent on the esthetic try-in procedure, which requires an additional visit...|$|R
