5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a <b>digital</b> <b>scanning,</b> ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to say {{with a high degree of}} confidence that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, will be treated by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright. It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – <b>digital</b> <b>scanning</b> counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.|$|E

40|$|As digital {{comic book}} {{consumption}} {{continues to rise}} in popularity, the comic book community appears conflicted over the effects that <b>digital</b> <b>scans</b> have {{on the meaning of}} collecting and reading comic books.

And does postpurchased <b>digital</b> <b>scan</b> dissemination primarily hurt copyright holders through lost sales, or does it help through social promotion?

2500|$|As England's {{contact with}} the Americas {{increased}} after the 1490s, explorers sometimes included verse with their descriptions of the [...] "New World" [...] up through 1650, the year of Anne Bradstreet's [...] "The Tenth Muse", which was written in America, most likely in Ipswich, Massachusetts or North Andover, Massachusetts) and printed/distributed in London, England by her brother-in-law, Rev. John Woodbridge. [...] There are 14 such writers whom we might on that basis call American poets (they had actually been to America and to different degrees, written poems or verses about the place). Early examples include a 1616 [...] "testimonial poem" [...] on the sterling warlike character of Captain John Smith (in Barbour, ed. [...] "Works") and Rev. William Morrell's 1625 [...] "Nova Anglia" [...] or [...] "New England," [...] which is a rhymed catalog of everything from American weather to glimpses of Native women, framed with a thin poetic [...] "conceit" [...] or [...] "fiction" [...] characterizing {{the country as a}} [...] "sad and forlorn" [...] female pining for English domination. Then in May 1627 Thomas Morton of Merrymount – an English West Country outdoorsman, attorney at law, man of letters and colonial adventurer – raised a Maypole to celebrate and foster more success at this fur-trading plantation and nailed up a [...] "Poem" [...] and [...] "Song" [...] (one a densely literary manifesto on how English and Native people came together there and must keep doing so for a successful America; the other a light [...] "drinking song" [...] also full of deeper American implications). These were published in book form along with other examples of Morton's American poetry in [...] "New English Canaan" [...] (1637); and based on the criteria of [...] "First," [...] "American" [...] and Poetry," [...] they make Morton (and not Anne Bradstreet) America's first poet in English.
