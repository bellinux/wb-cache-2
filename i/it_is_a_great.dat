25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E
25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It {{is probably one}} of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. <b>It</b> <b>ís</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E
25|$|The Metrical Dindshenchas, or Lore of Places, is {{probably}} the major surviving monument of Irish bardic verse. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> onomastic anthology of naming legends of significant places in the Irish landscape and comprises about 176 poems in total. The earliest of these date from the 11th century, and were probably originally compiled on a provincial basis. As a national compilation, the Metrical Dindshenchas has come down to us in two different recensions. Knowledge of the real or putative history of local places formed {{an important part of}} the education of the elite in ancient Ireland, so the Dindshenchas was probably a kind of textbook in origin.|$|E

Nowadays the honour is normally given to second lieutenants who excel at drill and ceremonial and who are physically fit.|$|E
25|$|Lazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' {{raising of}} Lazarus from the dead, {{just before he}} went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes {{anticipate}} the Resurrection of Jesus, showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, caviar), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday {{is considered one of the}} Great Feasts of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday services are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday service.|$|E

Its height is famous mostly for {{watching}} sunsets from. It is 16km from Chikmagalur town. Driving to Mullayanagiri is worth taking a risk. On the way is Sitalayanagiri where the water in the Shiva temple neither increases nor decreases. The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with a views from steep cliffs. Driving to the peak is not possible and includes a trek up the hill from the halfway point. There is a temple on top of the hill. From the topmost point of the hill the Arabian Sea is visible on clear days. The small hillock in the temple compound is the highest point in Karnataka. The narrow road to the temple makes two way traffic impossible. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> trekking spot in Karnataka.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Harold's sister, Hester, {{comes to}} Walford {{to visit and}} tells him that her son, David Samuels (Christopher Reich), is {{interested}} in joining him in Britain. As David is a doctor in Israel, Harold thinks <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> idea and in April that year, David joins him in Walford and is made {{a partner in the}} practice. Harold even moves back to Walford and he and David live in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernize the surgery and bring in computers but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), particularly when the two get drunk at a Christmas party, leave together and share the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been too drunk to do anything untoward anyway. Harold is not convinced however and berates David for the degradation he brought upon himself and the surgery. Later, David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients when he discovers that Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), is showing early symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. He decides not to tell Colin as worrying about his condition could bring on another attack although Colin may not have another attack for 20 years or so, choosing instead to tell Colin that he is overworked and anemic. This highly unethical move appalls David but despite this, Harold continues to refuse to tell Colin about his illness. However, in January 1989, he finally tells Colin the truth. Colin is furious that Harold had kept this information from him and refuses to listen when he tries to explain his reasons. He threatens to report Dr Legg to the authorities and is mortified at how unethical he has been. Although Dr Legg is sorry, he stands by his decision to lie, feeling that Colin benefited from not knowing - when in fact, the opposite is true.|$|E

Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an inclination roughly {{in line with the}} planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the planetoid as being an [...] "inner Oort cloud object", situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.|$|E
