500|$|Although the festival's historian, Frederic Spotts, {{suggests}} that Cosima was more creative than she affected to be, {{the primary purpose}} of all her productions was to follow the instructions and reflect the wishes of the Master: [...] "There is nothing left <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> to create, but only to perfect in detail". This policy incurred criticism, among others from Bernard Shaw, who in 1889 mocked Cosima as the [...] "chief remembrancer". Shaw scorned the idea that Wagner's wishes were best represented by the slavish copying in perpetuity of the performances he had witnessed. Ten years later Shaw highlighted as a feature of the [...] "Bayreuth style" [...] the [...] "intolerably old-fashioned tradition of half rhetorical, half historical-pictorial attitudes and gestures", and the characteristic singing, [...] "sometime tolerable, sometimes abominable". The subordination of the music to text, diction and character portrayal was a specific feature of the Bayreuth style; Cosima, according to Spotts, turned the principle of clear enunciation into [...] "a fetish ... The resulting harsh declamatory style came to be derided as ... the infamous Bayreuth bark".|$|E

And {{when he says that}} the books, and the games, and the comics and everything else, are not gospel, but are only additional Star Trek based on his Star Trek but not part of the actual Star Trek universe that he created... they're just, you know, kinda fun to keep you occupied between episodes and between movies, whatever... but he does not want that to be considered to be sources of information for writers, working on this show, he doesn't want it to be considered part of the canon by anybody working on any other projects.— Richard Arnold, 1991 ...|$|E
