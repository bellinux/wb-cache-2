40|$|This article {{presents}} four controversial {{issues that are}} raised by the articulation of <b>just</b> war <b>thinking</b> in my book, In Defence of War (2013, 2014) : the conception of just war as punitive, the penultimate nature of the authority of international law, the morality of national interest, and the elasticity of the requirement of proportionality.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a growing {{interest}} in questions about justice after war (jus post bellum), fuelled {{in large part by}} moral questions about coalition operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. As a result, it has become common to argue that jus post bellum is a third strand of <b>Just</b> War <b>thinking.</b> This article evaluates this position. It argues that that there are broadly two ways of understanding moral requirements after war: a minimalist position which holds that moral principles derived largely from jus ad bellum and jus in bello concerns should constrain what victors are entitled to do after war and a maximalist position which holds that victors acquire additional responsibilities that are grounded more in liberalism and international law than in <b>Just</b> War <b>thinking.</b> Finding problems with both approaches, the article argues that it is premature to include jus post bellum as a third element of <b>Just</b> War <b>thinking</b> and concludes by setting out six principles to guide future thinking in this area.

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large, instant reward for their years of schooling. Societal impacts and current media trends have {{had the effect of}} teaching people to expect instant gratification. The idea of waiting for a good job, earned through working from the bottom up, frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today's society. This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces, but also in interpersonal relationships. Current studies show that 45% of marriages will end in divorce. Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on them. Our society today makes it increasingly easy to receive instant gratification.

40|$|For {{more than}} 1700 years in Christian theology, {{there has been}} a chasm between <b>just</b> war <b>thinking</b> and pacifism. Advocates of these two ideological {{positions}} have attempted to bridge this divide {{in a number of ways}} through the centuries. Some, such as Glen Stassen, have brought together thinkers on both sides of the divide to propose a just peacemaking theory. Others, such as Michael Schuck, Mark Allman, and Tobias Winright, have added new stages to <b>just</b> war <b>thinking</b> in order to make that existing tradition more robust. Some groups may identify as contingent pacifists. These would generally accept the criteria of the just war theory, but would not ever acknowledge violent force to be justified under certain conditions. This dissertation argues that, while it may not be possible to overcome the impasse between pacifists and adherents to <b>just</b> war <b>thinking,</b> it is possible for the two factions to work together for peace. One of the main areas in which this goal may be advanced is through common care and respect for the natural environment. In this study, the author examines the development of the Catholic social tradition on the topics of peace and ecology, including a careful reading of Pope Francis’s social encyclical, Laudato si’. The dissertation introduces a new type of contingent pacifism: ecological pacifism. Ecological pacifism argues against any type of violent intervention that will harm the earth, on the basis of earth’s sacredness as God’s creation. The dissertation maintains that both pacifism and <b>just</b> war <b>thinking</b> in Catholic social thought will be enhanced by this addition...|$|R

The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it".
