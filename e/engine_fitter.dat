5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with Mk. II's in May 1941 and Finucane {{was assigned}} serial P8038, formerly of No. 303 Squadron RAF, on 21 May. It {{was the first}} of four Spitfires to carry the Shamrock emblem as his personal insignia. Jimmy Firth, his airframe rigger and 'Speedy' Moore, a Canadian <b>engine</b> <b>fitter,</b> were attempting to put an outline of the design on. Poorly done, it attracted the attention of Maurice Pownhall a professional in Lithography. Using green dope he completed the emblem on the forward left part of the cockpit fairing panel. Finucane approved and the Shamrock stayed.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the AFC {{raised its}} ground staff from {{volunteer}} soldiers and civilians who had previous experience or who were trade trained, {{and when the}} first AFC squadron was formed these personnel were provided with very limited training that was focused mainly upon basic military skills. As the war progressed, a comprehensive training program was established in which mechanics were trained in nine different trades: welders, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, engine fitters, general fitters, riggers, electricians, magneto-repairers, and machinists. Training was delivered by eight technical sections at Halton Camp. The length of training within each section varied, but was generally between eight to 12 weeks; the more complex trades such as <b>engine</b> <b>fitter</b> required trainees to undertake multiple training courses across a number of sections. General fitters had the longest training requirements, receiving 32 weeks of instruction.|$|E

500|$|William Simpson [...] "Bill" [...] McAloney, [...] (12 May 1910– 31 August 1995) was {{a senior}} {{engineering}} officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and an Australian exchange recipient of the George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the Commonwealth. Born in Adelaide, {{he worked as a}} mechanic before enlisting in the RAAF as an aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>fitter</b> in 1936. In August the following year, he attempted to rescue the pilot of a crashed Hawker Demon aircraft engulfed in flames at an airfield in Hamilton, Victoria. The first on scene, McAloney rushed into the wreckage in an effort to extract the unconscious pilot. The pilot's leg was trapped, however, and while struggling to free it one of the wing tanks burst, knocking McAloney unconscious. McAloney was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns and spent the next month in hospital. He was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal for his actions in the rescue attempt.|$|E
2500|$|After the RAF investigative board {{completed}} its {{report on the}} Halifax crash on 1 July 1942, it was distributed to a restricted list of approved recipients, but not publicly divulged. In the interests of wartime secrecy, the announcement of Blumlein's death was not made for another three years. The investigative board, headed by AIB Chief Inspector Vernon Brown – who later also investigated the post-war Star Tiger and Star Ariel disappearances – and assisted by Rolls-Royce, {{who had made the}} Halifax's Merlin engines, found that the crash was caused by engine fire, attributed to the unscrewing of a tappet nut on the starboard outer engine, which had been improperly tightened by an RAF <b>engine</b> <b>fitter</b> while inspecting the engine some three hours prior to the crash.|$|E
