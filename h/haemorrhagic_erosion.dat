40|$|It {{has been}} {{uncertain}} {{what types of}} erythematous gastric mucosa are produced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) -infection. We therefore design the present study to identify the type of erythematous mucosa associated with H. pylori-infection. A total of 590 consecutive Japanese patients (mean age 58. 7 years, 185 men and 405 women) referred to our hospital for diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were recruited in this study. We assessed endoscopically the type of gastric mucosal erythema, including spotty erythema, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>erosion,</b> reddish streaks, and raised erosion. H. pylori infection was diagnosed by a positive endoscopic 13 C-urea breath test (e-UBT). Of the 402 H. pylori-positive subjects, spotty erythemas in the corpus were found in 177 (44. 0 %), haemorrhagic erosions in 26 (6. 5 %), reddish streaks in the antrum in 21 (5. 2 %) and in the corpus in 10 (2. 5 %), and raised erosions in the antrum in 58 (14. 4 %) and in the corpus in 4 (1. 0 %). For spotty erythema in the upper body, sensitivity was 44. 0 %, specificity was 92. 6 % for H. pylori infection. Seventy-two (86. 7 %) of 83 patients with antral reddish streaks and 65 (52. 8 %) of 123 patients with antral raised erosions had H. pylori-negative e-UBT. Spotty erythema in the corpus was one of most frequent endoscopic findings reflecting H. pylori infection. In contrast, antral reddish streaks and raised erosions were likely to indicate the absence of H. pylori...|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{disturbances}} like anorexia, nausea, vomiting, {{abdominal discomfort}} and diarrhoea are known {{adverse effects of}} rifampicin. We report an upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to <b>haemorrhagic</b> gastric <b>erosions</b> after ingestion of rifampicin for pulmonary tuberculosis. The cause and effect relationship between development of <b>haemorrhagic</b> gastric <b>erosions</b> and rifampicin administration was confirmed by rechallenge with rifampicin. To our knowledge no such adverse effect of rifampicin has been reported previously...|$|R
40|$|URL] AuthorHenoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) {{is a type}} of {{systemic}} vasculitis of the small vessels, which frequently involves the skin, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. While the typical intestinal features of HSP include diffuse mucosal redness, small ring-like petechiae and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions,</b> tumour-like lesions are rarely observed. The current study presents a rare case of HSP with an intestinal tumour-like lesion in the caecum. The intestinal lesion caused fresh melaena, and was completely resolved with the administration of factor XIII as described in previously reported cases. It is important to immediately undergo proper treatment for improving tumour-like lesions which may cause severe complications, such as excessive haemorrhage and stricture...|$|R
40|$|Inflammation {{is known}} to be linked with {{development}} of colorectal cancer, and the aim was to assess the malignant potential and degree of inflammation in a dextran-sulphate-sodium-(DSS-) induced cyclic colonic tumour model (CTM) in rats and to compare it with the azoxymethane-(AOM-) induced CTM model. Tumours developed in both groups, although, in the DSS group, the colonic mucosa appeared edematous and the number of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions</b> and quantity of dysplastic lesions were higher as well as the mucosal concentration of myeloperoxidase and faecal viable count of Enterobacteriaceae. The livers were affected as evaluated by steatosis, parenchymal loss, haemorrhage, and inflammatory infiltrations, and higher proportions of acetate and lower proportions of butyrate in colonic content were found. The DSS model seems to mimic the clinical situation and may be valuable for investigation of inflammation-related dysplasia and colon cancer, as well as for altered liver function by endogenous inflammatory mediators...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the formation of}} severe gastric erosions produced in fasted rats by intragastric administration of droxicam and its active species piroxicam, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs of the oxicam group. The time course of gastric damage and the possible role of mucus secretion, changes of gastric vascular permeability, and neutrophil activation {{in the development of}} droxicam- and piroxicam-induced astric lesions, were also investigated. Both drugs dose-dependently (1 - 25 - 20 mg kg -) caused acute gastric <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions</b> in the rat. These lesions were significantly greater with piroxicam treatment 6 h after dosing. Only the lower doses of droxicam and piroxicam (1. 25 mg kg-') induced a significant increase of mucus gel production at different times (3 and 6 h). However, there was no increase in the concentration of its components. Oral pretreatment of the animals with either agent did not induce any changes on the values of mucosal vascular permeability. In contrast, myeloperoxidase activity as an index of neutrophil infiltration was significantly increased. A marked relationship was found between the lesion index and myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that neutrophil infiltration could {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal injury induced by these oxicam agent...|$|R
40|$|Calcium carbasalate is a therapeutically active {{salicylate}} {{which seems}} to cause less gastroduodenal mucosal damage than aspirin in laboratory animals. This endoscopist-blinded, randomised, cross over trial aimed to compare acute gastric mucosal damage in 20 healthy volunteers treated with acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) (650 mg three times daily) and effervescent calcium carbasalate (ECC) (826. 8 mg three times daily) bioequivalent to 650 mg ASA over a five day period. Endoscopy was performed immediately before treatment and on day 5 of each treatment. Serum salicylate, thromboxane B 2, and gastric mucosal prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) concentrations were measured after endoscopy. ECC caused fewer gastric mucosal erosions than ASA. The total number of gastric erosions was 23. 8 (16. 1) in the ASA treated subjects compared with 9. 1 (8. 7) in ECC treated subjects (p = 0. 004). Differences between ASA and ECC were significant for both the gastric antrum and body, and for both <b>haemorrhagic</b> and non-haemorrhagic <b>erosions.</b> The mean gastric body Lanza score for mucosal damage was lower after ECC than ASA (p = 0. 003). The visual analogue score for gastric body damage was lower for ECC (16. 9 mm (15. 9)) than for ASA (32. 7 mm (20. 8)), p = 0. 008. Serum salicylate concentrations were similar after both preparations (ASA: 66 (23) mg/l, versus ECC: 58 (17) mg/l, NS). Serum thromboxane B 2 was similarly reduced using both preparations- 97. 2 (3. 5) % inhibition with ASA, 95. 2 (5. 5) % inhibition with calcium carbasalate (NS). Suppression of gastric mucosal PGE 2 synthesis was similar with both preparations (ASA: 83. 4 (17. 1) %; ECC 84. 3 (12. 9) %; NS). It is concluded that ECC causes significantly less gastroduodenal mucosal damage than ASA administered at bioequivalent doses as judged by serum salicylate, serum thromboxane, and mucosal PGE 2 values. ECC may therefore be a less harmful alternative treatment to plain ASA...|$|R
