40|$|The {{evolution}} of hot-image formation {{in consideration of}} focusing lens effect is theoretically and numerically investigated. Through analysis of linear propagation theory with lens, it is shown that the location of <b>hot</b> <b>image</b> in focusing systems can be predicated through definite functional relation to <b>hot</b> <b>image</b> position in non-focusing systems, on condition that {{the distance between the}} <b>hot</b> <b>image</b> and the lens is relatively small. In addition through numerical calculation, specific variation characteristics of maximum intensity with the propagation distance representing hot-image formation process are presented, it is obtained that perturbing scatter size directly affects the location and corresponding peak intensity of the <b>hot</b> <b>image.</b> The lens influences the value of scatter size where minimum distance between hot-image plane and focus lens is generated. Finally, the effects of phase and amplitude modulation of scatter on <b>hot</b> <b>image</b> are also given. Results in this paper are of fair referenced value for controlling perturbing scatter and restraining the damage risk of optical components in focusing systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution of}} the axial intensity distribution during <b>hot</b> <b>image</b> formation perturbed by a small circular optical obscuration is investigated in detail under different conditions. An analytic expression is derived for the axial intensity distribution around the conjugate plane by assuming {{the thickness of the}} nonlinear medium to be infinitely small. In view of the analysis of the axial intensity oscillation, the expression can be extensively utilized to characterize the intensity maxima for a nonlinear medium with a finite thickness. The nonlinear medium thickness and obscuration size both have great influence on the magnitudes and distributed features of the intensity maxima, which initially vary from multiple ones with comparable intensities to ultimately a maximum of one obviously remaining. The reason for this phenomenon is that the nonlinear medium acts like a low-pass filter to the scattering field, and optical interference exists between the scattering and background field. Furthermore, a fixed expression of nonlinear medium thickness and obscuration size is obtained to determine the dividing point of the alterations of the <b>hot</b> <b>image</b> intensity distribution.

In this design, each element is constructed as a separate unit and when all are completed they are simply stacked up and fastened together with one screw, thereby minimizing the danger of breakage. The whole thermopile fits into a cubical evacuated case only 10 mm on an edge and, being so small, it can be used directly in front of an elliptical mirror which forms a small <b>hot</b> <b>image,</b> in some cases increasing the deflection due to a given radiation by a factor of 3.

40|$|Optical {{satellite}} imagery is often contaminated by the persistent presence of clouds and atmospheric haze. Without an effective method for removing this contamination, most optical remote sensing applications are less reliable. In this research, a methodology {{has been developed}} to fully automate and improve the Haze Optimized Transformation (HOT) -based haze removal. The method {{is referred to as}} AutoHOT and characterized with three notable features: a fully automated HOT process, a novel <b>HOT</b> <b>image</b> post-processing tool and a class-based HOT radiometric adjustment method. The performances of AutoHOT in haze detection and compensation were evaluated through three experiments with one Landsat- 5 TM, one Landsat- 7 ETM+ and eight Landsat- 8 OLI scenes that encompass diverse landscapes and atmospheric haze conditions. The first experiment confirms that AutoHOT is robust and effective for haze detection. The average overall, user’s and producer’s accuracies of AutoHOT in haze detection can reach 96. 4 %, 97. 6 % and 97. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the advantage of}} upright position imaging with a medium-energy collimator {{for the detection of}} sentinel lymph node (SLN). Methods: Thirty-four patients with operable breast cancer underwent sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy with 99 mTc-tin colloid. Images were obtained in 5 different positions and paired images from the same patient were compared using side-by-side interpretation. Images were compared in 3 groups: group 1 (anterior view); supine (SAV) vs. upright (UAV), group 2 (oblique view); supine (SOV) vs. upright (UOV), and group 3 (oblique view); modified supine (MOV) vs. UOV. Image quality was evaluated using a 3 -grade scale of clear, faint, and equivocal depiction, and correlated to 3 parameters: distance from injection site to lymph node (hot node), counts in <b>hot</b> node, and <b>image</b> contrast. Parameters in group 1 were compared by classifying the primary tumor site into 4 subregions. Results: Image quality in all 3 groups was more enhanced on the image obtained in the upright position than that in the supine position. Obtaining images in an upright position increased the mean distances by 1. 5 - 3. 2 cm, and mean contrasts were significantly increased by 0. 13 - 0. 31 (p < 0. 05). It was shown that image quality was more greatly affected by image contrast than by counts in the <b>hot</b> node. <b>Image</b> contrast of 0. 5 seemed an appropriate threshold level for detection of the hot node.

40|$|Images {{made with}} the VLBA have {{resolved}} the region in a nearby radio galaxy, Pictor A, where the relativistic jet that originates at the nucleus terminates in an interaction with the intergalactic medium, a so-called radio galaxy <b>hot</b> spot. This <b>image</b> provides the highest spatial resolution view of such an object to date (16 pc), {{more than three times}} better than previous VLBI observations of similar objects. The north-west Pictor A hot spot is resolved into a complex set of compact components, seen to coincide with the bright part of the <b>hot</b> spot <b>imaged</b> at arcsecond-scale resolution with the VLA. In addition to a comparison with VLA data, we compare our VLBA results with data from the HST and Chandra telescopes, as well as new Spitzer data. The presence of pc-scale components in the hot spot, identifying regions containing strong shocks in the fluid flow, leads us to explore the suggestion that they represent sites of synchrotron X-ray production, contributing to the integrated X-ray flux of the hot spot, along with X-rays from synchrotron self-Compton scattering. This scenario provides a natural explanation for the radio morphology of the hot spot and its integrated X-ray emission, leading to very different predictions for the higher energy X-ray spectrum compared to previous studies. From the sizes of the individual pc-scale components and their angular spread, we estimate that the jet width at the hot spot is in the range 70 - 700 pc, which is comparable to similar estimates in PKS 2153 - 69, 3 C 205, and 4 C 41. 17. The lower limit in this range arises from the suggestion that the jet may dither in its direction as it passes through hot spot backflow material close to the jet termination point, creating a "dentist drill" effect on the inside of a cavity 700 pc in diameter.

However, the diffuse X-ray emission shows signs of asymmetries {{in the core of}} the system. With a mean gas temperature of ~ 4. 0 keV and total gravitational mass of 3. 1 x 10 ^ 14 solar mass, within the virial radius, this is better described as a fossil galaxy cluster rather than a fossil group. The temperature profile shows no sign of a significant cooler core despite a cooling time dropping to 5 Gyr within the resolved core. We find a mass concentration parameter c_ 200 ~ 11 which is relatively high for a cluster of this mass, indicative of an early formation epoch. Using the spectroscopically identified cluster members we present the galaxy luminosity function for this fossil system.

The Ki- 67 -associated proliferation rate was evaluated on three digitalized <b>hot</b> spots using <b>image</b> analysis. The H&E‑based mitotic rate {{was found to}} correlate significantly better with Ki- 67 -assessed proliferation activity than with PHH 3 -assessed proliferation activity (r= 0. 780; P< 0. 01). A linear regression model (analysis of variance; P< 0. 001) allowed reliable predictions of the H&E-associated mitoses based on the Ki- 67 expression alone. Additionally, the Ki‑ 67 ‑associated proliferation revealed a higher and signifi-cant impact on the recurrence and metastasis rate of the GIST cases than by the classical H&E-based mitotic rate. The {{results of the present}} study indicated that the mitotic rate may be reliably and time‑efficiently estimated by immuno-histochemistry of Ki- 67 using only three hot spots...|$|R
