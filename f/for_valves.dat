2500|$|During 1991, a 1.8L 16-valve engine {{producing}} [...] (also {{first seen}} in the Renault 19) capable of propelling the car to [...] {{was introduced to the}} Clio engine range, known simply as the Clio 16S in France (S for [...] "soupapes", the French word <b>for</b> <b>valves),</b> and Clio 16V in export markets. It was the successor to the Renault 5 GT Turbo, which was discontinued that year as the R5 range was pruned back. As well as having a higher top speed than a regular Clio, the 16S sports wider plastic front wings, an offset bonnet vent, wider rear arches and uprated suspension and brakes, and colour-coded front mirrors and bumpers. The RSi side skirts were omitted, however. Inside, the 16V model has an extended instrument panel that houses dials for engine oil pressure, oil temperature, and oil level (which only indicates on engine start). The seats are also more supportive to match the sporting nature of the model. The non-catalyzed versions, still available in some markets, offer [...] and marginally higher performance with top speeds up to [...] and the 0–100km/h time dropping from 8 to 7.8seconds.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{the main}} {{application}} <b>for</b> <b>valves</b> is audio amplifiers for high-end hi-fi and musical performance use with electric guitars, electric basses, and Hammond organs, although these applications have different requirements regarding distortion which result in different design compromises, although {{the same basic}} design techniques are generic and widely applicable to all broadband amplification applications, not only audio.|$|E

50|$|Poly(p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS) is {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction}} of sodium sulfide with p-dichlorobenzene in a polar solvent such as 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). It is inherently flame-resistant and stable toward organic and aqueous conditions; however, it is somewhat susceptible to oxidants.

50|$|At a given engine speed, {{a longer}} stroke {{increases}} engine friction (since the piston travels a greater distance per stroke) and increases {{stress on the}} crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available <b>for</b> <b>valves</b> in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number. Because these factors favor lower engine speeds, undersquare engines are most often tuned to develop peak torque at relatively low speeds.|$|E
50|$|Henry Distin {{and his new}} fluegel horn {{were active}} in the {{development}} of brass bands in England. He created a new line of instruments under his own name, and in 1872 the Distin brand was bought by Boosey (a music publisher since 1792, and a manufacturer of instruments since 1851). D.J. Blaikely, the inventor in 1878 of an automatically compensation tuning system <b>for</b> <b>valves</b> collaborated with Distin, and together they developed a new range and improved existing models.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>valve</b> seen <b>for</b> <b>valve</b> {{attachments}} is the rotary valve. Some trombones have piston valves used instead of rotary <b>valves</b> <b>for</b> <b>valve</b> attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer valve or axial-flow Valve, the Hagmann valve, the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common <b>for</b> trombone <b>valve</b> attachments.|$|R

50|$|Another type of bonnet {{construction}} in a gate valve is pressure seal bonnet. This construction is adopted <b>for</b> <b>valves</b> for high pressure service, typically {{in excess of}} 2250 psi (15 MPa). The unique feature of the pressure seal bonnet is that the bonnet ends in a downward-facing cup which fits inside {{the body of the}} valve. As the internal pressure in the valve increases, the sides of the cup are forced outward. improving the body-bonnet seal. Other constructions where the seal is provided by external clamping pressure tend to create leaks in the body-bonnet joint.|$|E
