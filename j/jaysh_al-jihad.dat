25|$|Between 27 and 29 April 2015, {{fighting}} raged {{south of}} Quneitra city, near the Israeli-held Golan Heights, between an ISIL-linked rebel group <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> {{on one side}} and al-Nusra and FSA fighters on the other. The clashes started after a pair of <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> ambushes on rebel convoys preparing an offensive against government forces. The rebels besieged 200 <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> fighters in the village of al-Qahtania and took control of wide areas the group controlled. On 29 April, fighting also erupted in Daraa province between al-Nusra and the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, which was accused the previous month of also pledging allegiance to ISIL. The Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade captured an al-Nusra post in the town of Sahem al-Jolan. On 30 April, rebel forces captured the Quneitra border crossing from the <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> and on 5 May, al-Qahtania. Overall, the fighting left 59 rebels, 32 <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> fighters and two members of Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade dead.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016, {{remnants}} of <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> joined {{with two other}} Pro-ISIL factions in Southern Syria, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade and Islamic Muthanna Movement, to form the Khalid ibn al-Walid Army.|$|E
5000|$|Hasan Salama or Hassan Salameh (حسن سلامة, [...] ) (1913-1948) was a {{commander}} of the Palestinian Holy War Army (<b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> al-Muqaddas, Arabic: [...] ) in the 1948 Palestine War along with Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the failed offensive, the Islamic Muthanna Movement and the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade were {{severely}} weakened, leading to rumors they had merged. On 24 May 2016, they along with <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> officially united to form Khalid ibn al-Walid Army, or the Army of Khalid ibn al-Walid, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad.|$|E
50|$|On 29 March 2016, {{dozens of}} their members splintered-off to form an FSA-aligned group called al-Murabitin Brigade. In April 2016, {{there were reports that}} Muthanna Movement had merged with the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, {{although}} the group denied these reports at the time, in May 2016 Muthanna, <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> and the Martyrs Brigade announced they had united together as the Khalid ibn al-Walid Army.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> (Jihad Army) is an Islamic State {{group based}} in Quneitra Governorate. The group formed from the merger of 7 small {{independent}} groups and factions that defected from Nusra Front after it clashed with the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade in December 2014. These groups were: Jihad Brigades, Jamaat Jund al-Islam, Jamaat Abu Baseer, Mujahideen of al-Sham movement, Jamaat Shabab Ahl al-Sunnah, Nurayn Brigade, and Jamaat Bunyan al-Marsous.|$|E
50|$|Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni (عبد القادر الحسيني, also spelled Abd al-Qader al-Husseini) (1907 - 8 April 1948) was a Palestinian Arab {{nationalist}} and fighter who in late 1933 {{founded the}} secret militant {{group known as}} the Organization for Holy Struggle (Munathamat al-Jihad al-Muqaddas), which he and Hasan Salama commanded as the Army of the Holy War (<b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> al-Muqaddas) during the 1936-39 Arab revolt and during the 1948 war.|$|E
50|$|The {{group had}} been accused by other Syrian rebel groups of being {{affiliated}} with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In April 2015, violent clashes broke out between the group and the Free Syrian Army and al-Nusra Front, after Jaish al-Jihad militants ambushed and killed six FSA fighters at a checkpoint in Quneitra. By 6 May 2015, Nusra and other rebel groups announced that they had cleared al-Qahtaniyah and Quneitra city of <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> forces.|$|E
50|$|In late 2014, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade {{finally began}} to openly oppose other rebel groups and {{increasingly}} showcased its de facto allegiance to the ISIL. It became involved {{in a series of}} low intensity clashes with al-Nusra Front, and in December 2014 Nusra launched an offensive against the brigade until other rebel groups intervened and confined the Brigade to its base in the towns of Jamla and al-Shajarah. In April and May 2015, the brigade, as well as <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad,</b> launched attacks on al-Nusra. This fighting ended following arbitration from other local groups.|$|E
5000|$|The Army of the Holy War or Holy War Army (Arabic: جيش الجهاد المقدس; <b>Jaysh</b> <b>al-Jihad</b> al-Muqaddas) was a Palestinian Arab {{irregular}} {{force in}} the 1947-48 Palestinian civil war led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. [...] The force {{has been described as}} Husayni's [...] "personal" [...] army. The Arab League set up the Arab Salvation Army (Jaysh al-Inqadh al-Arabi) as a counter to the Army of the Holy War and as part of its plan to contain the Palestinian Arab leadership and to prevent it from exercising independent political or military options, although in practice the Arab governments prevented thousands of volunteers from joining either force.|$|E
