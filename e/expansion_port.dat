25|$|The keyboard, Famicom Modem, and Famicom Disk System {{would later}} be {{released}} as add-on peripherals, all utilizing the Famicom <b>expansion</b> <b>port.</b> Other peripheral devices connecting via the <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> would include the Famicom Light Gun, Family Trainer, and various specialized controllers. Many such devices would be produced for the console, though many of them, including the Famicom 3D System and Famicom Disk System, were never released outside Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Japanese Famicom was {{predominantly white}} plastic, with dark red trim. It featured a top-loading cartridge slot, grooves {{on both sides}} of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use, and a 15-pin <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> located on the unit's front panel for accessories.|$|E

25|$|Expansion ports {{are limited}} to a side <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> and a {{trapdoor}} expansion {{on the underside of}} the machine. The casing can also be opened up (voiding the warranty), all larger chips are socketed rather than being TH/SMD soldered directly to the motherboard, so they can be replaced by hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} NES, meanwhile, {{featured a}} front-loading cartridge {{covered by a}} small, hinged door that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times. It features a more subdued gray, black, and red color scheme. An <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> {{was found on the}} bottom of the unit and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote also {{features}} an <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> {{at the bottom}} which allows various functional attachments to be added. The connector, and any accessories that attach to it, use a 400kHz I²C protocol. This expandability {{is similar to that}} available with the port on the Nintendo 64 controller. A female connector is found on Wii remotes while expansions use a male connector.|$|E

5|$|The console has {{a number}} of {{internal}} features made available from its hardware and firmware components. The hardware allows for extendability (via <b>expansion</b> <b>ports),</b> while the firmware (and some software) can receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect24 service.|$|R
50|$|A DMA {{attack is}} a type of side channel attack in {{computer}} security, in which an attacker can penetrate a computer or other device, by exploiting the presence of high-speed <b>expansion</b> <b>ports</b> that permit direct memory access ("DMA").|$|R
25|$|Japan saw {{the release}} of the Satellaview, a modem which {{attaches}} to the Super Famicom's <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> and connected to the St.GIGA satellite radio station from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000. Satellaview users could download gaming news and specially designed games, which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, and released in installments. In the United States, the relatively short-lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a dial-up modem to compete against other players around the country.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} special {{controllers}} {{designed for use}} with specific games were released for the system, though very few such devices proved particularly popular. Such devices included, but were not limited to, the Zapper (a light gun), the R.O.B., and the Power Pad. The original Famicom featured a deepened DA-15 <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> {{on the front of}} the unit, which was used to connect most auxiliary devices. On the NES, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports {{on the front of the}} console.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} {{incorporate a}} top-loading slot for game cartridges, although {{the shape of}} the slot differs between regions to match the different shapes of the cartridges. The MULTI OUT connector (later used on the Nintendo 64 and GameCube) can output composite video, S-Video and RGB signals, as well as RF with an external RF modulator. Original versions additionally include a 28-pin <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> under a small cover {{on the bottom of the}} unit and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back; the redesigned models output composite video only, requiring an external modulator for RF.|$|E
50|$|The laptop has {{a notable}} lack of <b>expansion</b> <b>ports,</b> {{consisting}} of a RS-232 port, a printer port, and the docking connector. The computer used the docking connector to connect to a Toshiba DeskStation II, giving it extra capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The console has {{a number}} of {{internal}} features made available from its hardware and firmware components. The hardware allows for extendability (via <b>expansion</b> <b>ports),</b> while the firmware (and some software) can receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect24 service.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{requires}} a significant <b>expansion</b> of <b>port</b> facilities. Deutsche Bank and HSBC declined {{to fund the}} Abbott Point <b>port</b> <b>expansion</b> due to environmental concerns affecting their reputation.|$|R
25|$|The {{controllers}} were hard-wired to {{the console}} with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied {{directly from the}} Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even taking apart ones from American game consoles {{to see how they}} worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks left on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> {{on the front of the}} console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.|$|E
25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the Picture Processing Unit). To keep costs down, suggestions of including a keyboard, modem, and floppy disk drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> connection {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote uses two AA {{batteries}} {{as a power}} source, {{which can}} power a Wii Remote for 60 hours using only the accelerometer functionality and 25 hours using both accelerometer and pointer functionality. In May 2013, Nintendo announced a rechargeable battery and dock accessory, and various third-party manufacturers market charging solutions for the controller (see Wii Remote Chargers). According to an interview with Nintendo industrial designer Lance Barr, limitations of the Wii Remote's <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> make it unlikely {{that it will be}} used for internal battery charging. Although Nintendo discourages other rechargeable battery types such as lithium ion (Li-ion) and nickel-cadmium (NiCd), the company's support website indicates that nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries may be used. A 3300µF capacitor provides a temporary source of power during quick movements of the Wii Remote when connection to the batteries may be temporarily interrupted. If the Wii Remote is not used for more than 5 minutes, such as when the player is using a GameCube controller or watching Netflix, it will shut off, and can be re-activated by pressing any button.|$|E
50|$|The PC-FX's computer-like {{design was}} unusual for {{consoles}} at the time. It stands upright like a tower computer while other contemporary consoles lay flat. Another interesting feature is its three <b>expansion</b> <b>ports.</b> Also, {{similar to the}} 3DO, it featured a built in power supply.|$|R
5000|$|The Acorn BBC Micro was a {{very popular}} British {{computer}} in the 1980s with home and educational users, and enjoyed near universal usage in British schools into the mid-1990s. It was possible to use 100K 5¼" [...] disks and it had many <b>expansion</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
50|$|The console also {{features}} USB and IEEE 1394 (Firewire) <b>expansion</b> <b>ports.</b> A {{hard disk drive}} can be installed in an expansion bay {{on the back of}} the console, and is required to play certain games, notably the popular Final Fantasy XI. This is only available on certain models.|$|R
500|$|The Master System was {{produced}} in several variations. [...] Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components {{in order to reduce}} the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, reset button, power light, <b>expansion</b> <b>port,</b> and activation music and logo upon turning on the system. [...] Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil, created by Tectoy. [...] A variation known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic. [...] A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. [...] Another Master System, built as a handheld game console, was released under several brands including Coleco in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1984, Timex of Portugal {{developed}} and produced several Timex branded computers, including the Timex Computer 2048, highly {{compatible with the}} Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, which was very successful in both Portugal and Poland. An NTSC version was also made, initially intended for a United States release, but it was sold only in Chile and Argentina. Timex of Portugal also made a PAL version of the TS2068, called the Timex Computer 2068 (or TC2068 for short) which had different buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, which significantly increased the compatibility with ZX Spectrum software {{when compared to the}} North American model (the TS2068). The <b>expansion</b> <b>port</b> was also modified and made to be 100% compatible with the ZX Spectrum's, which bypassed the need for a [...] "Twister Board" [...] expansion that the TS2068 needed {{in order to make it}} compatibile with ZX Spectrum expansion hardware. It also had the AY sound output routed to the monitor/TV speakers instead of the internal twitter. The software developed for the TC2068 is completely compatible with the TS2068, since the ROMs weren't altered. Timex of Portugal also developed a ZX Spectrum [...] "emulator" [...] on cartridge form that mapped the first 16kB exactly like the earlier TC2048 computer did. Several other upgrades were made available, including a BASIC64 cartridge that enabled the TC2068 to use high resolution (512x192) modes. Despite having an AY-3-8912 sound chip, it's not connected in the same ports as in the ZX Spectrum 128K, rendering the TC2084 incompatible with the AY sound that the Spectrum 128K games produced. Due to all its advantages compared to the usual TS2068, a North American company, Zebra Systems, licensed the Timex TC2068 and sold it in the United States as the Zebra Silver Avenger. They also sold the FDD 3000 as the Zebra FDD 3000 in a silver case (as opposed to the European black cases) to match their colour scheme. Timex of Portugal was working on a successor to the TC2068 called the TC3256, using a Z80A CPU and featuring 256kB of RAM, which would feature a ZX Spectrum BASIC operating mode and a CP/M operating mode, but the company pulled the plug on its development since that by the end of 1989, the 8bit market was no longer profitable. Only one complete and fully working prototype of the TC3256 was made.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii MotionPlus is an {{expansion}} device {{that allows the}} Wii Remote to more accurately capture complex motion. Incorporated with a custom version of the Wii Remote Jacket, the Wii MotionPlus affixes directly to the Wii Remote <b>expansion</b> <b>port,</b> extending {{the length of the}} controller body by approximately [...] The Wii MotionPlus uses a Tuning fork gyroscope, which supplements the accelerometer and Sensor Bar capabilities of the Wii Remote, enabling controller motions to be rendered identically on the screen in real time, according to Nintendo. It is sold individually, as well as released in bundles with some MotionPlus compatible games such as Nintendo's Wii Sports Resort and [...] "Red Steel 2" [...] from Ubisoft. Black Wii Remotes bundled with the MotionPlus add-on were released in Europe in November 2009.|$|E
