40|$|AbstractAt present, it is {{difficult}} to accurately forecast the water inrush from coal seam floor. For safety, it is necessary to monitor and predict water inrush. Rock angular displacement can be observed easily and can show whether the coal seam floor has bent and destroyed or not. The elastic-plastic analysis and numerical simulation indicate that, 1) when angular displacement of rock is greater than the critical value, water inrush shall take place; 2) the critical value of angular displacement is 2 (1 + μ) /E × τ 0 by elastic-plastic analysis while the critical values of angular displacement in Buchun mine are 0. 0019 radian for shale stone and 0. 005 radian for fine sandstone, respectively, by numerical simulation. Based on these conclusions, we designed the early warning system of water inrush to obtain the laws of the damage <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>floor</b> rock and angular displacement. The practice shows that using the method of rock angular displacement is very effective for monitoring and forecasting water inrush caused by coal seam floor failure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing the {{software}} FLAC 3 D, we simulated {{the rule of}} deformation and failure of deep stope floor due to working face mining. The horizontal stress, vertical stress, shearing stress, horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, and plastic zone distribution of mined floor are all simulated in both the advanced direction and the tilted direction of working face. Along the advanced direction of working face, the region of floor strata come into being a compression region, an expansion region, and a recompression region; their displacement decrease {{with the increase of}} floor depth. While along the tilted direction, the rock mass under the upper and lower two-side coal mass is in a compressive state, resulting in a vertical compressive displacement and forming a plastic zone of 12. 3 m in depth. Considering the failure <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>floor,</b> the working face water-inrush coefficient of Taoyuan Coal Mines is 0. 082, which is 1. 4 times of the critical value. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to prevent water-inrush from floor aquifer and to ensure the safe mining of working face...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{covered in}} this thesis {{is concerned with the}} effects of the behaviour and load carrying capacities of classes of steel beam structures with various shapes of web openings. A comprehensive investigation on non-composite and partially concrete encased perforated steel Isections with large web openings positioned along the centre-line of the beams was undertaken. This thesis enhances the current knowledge on these classes of perforated beams, as previous research has shown that these beams are susceptible to various failure modes, due to the existence of large web openings. Currently, perforated steel beams with large web openings are utilised in most engineering applications such as infrastructure, ship building and aeronautical engineering. The most significant benefits of using such beams are the achievement of reductions in weight and accommodation of services within their structural <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>floor</b> systems. Specifically, in building applications, service integration eliminates the internal columns and supports, produces lighter structures which leading to reduced construction and installation time and results in cost effective structural forms and uses. However, many uncertainties are associated with perforated beams as well as non-standard methodology is used for their assessment. Perforated beams with standard circular, hexagonal and elongated web openings are most widely used nowadays, whilst various non-standard web opening shapes, such as `elliptical', are introduced through this thesis for first time. These new pioneering web opening shapes improve the structural performance of the perforated beams when examined under two critical failure modes (i. e. shear-'Vierendeel' mechanism and web-post buckling). Moreover, the manufacturing procedure of the `elliptical' web openings show great advantage in comparison with the manufacturing way of the more popular perforated beams with circular web openings (i. e. cellular beams). Also, other web opening shapes are reported and examined {{in this thesis}}. Furthermore, the novelty of the work seems to consist of the treatment of web openings of somewhat greater web opening depth than those usually considered and the introduction of a new class of composite concrete-steel beam. Despite the abundant experimental work on perforated steel beams that has been conducted by researchers throughout the years, the results are not comprehensive, due to the complexity of the beam configuration and the large number of variable parameters. Therefore, using commercially available finite element (FE) software, numerical analyses were verified by comparison to a new experimental programme designed to test each of the new structural forms. The numerical programme was then used to undertake extensive parametric studies to isolate some of the geometric and material properties that influence the failure modes associated with each of the new forms of structural systems. The main parameters under consideration are the web opening depth (noted usually as diameter), the critical opening length of the top and bottom tee-sections, the web opening spacing, the steel flange and web thicknesses, the concrete strength and contact properties between the steel and concrete of the newly formed composite beams. Detailed study of plastic hinges formation (i. e. high stress concentrations) was also employed {{in the vicinity of the}} web openings, by conducting both experimental and finite element (FE) investigation. This research study should now lead to better management of the use of perforated beams with large web openings as the profound difference between the novel and the conventional perforated beams is demonstrated. Useful practical applications of the so-called structural forms would be of particular interest in the general engineering, not just because of their superior structural performance, but also because of their low cost in manufacturing and usage. Another contribution is the investigation of the partial steel encasement with the concrete in-fill, on the percentage of enhancement of the steel perforated beams with web openings under high shear forces as well as on the distinction which is drawn between the conventional and the new composite beams. Finally, a further indirect outcome of this research thesis is the excellent agreement between the experimental and FE analyses as well as the data that can be used by future researchers to widen the above research to various engineering applications...|$|E

Recent research initiatives seek to develop slim floors by minimising the structural <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>floor</b> section. Ultra Shallow Floor Beams (USFBs) are used to reduce structural depth compared to traditional slabs (Fig 1). USFBs provide an overall reduction in floor-floor height. Concept is shown in Fig 2.

Resonance creates excessive floor vibrations when the floor’s natural frequency coincides with excitation frequencies e. g. walking, dancing, etc. The main aim was: To provide design guidelines of slabs with perforated USFBs.

40|$|Most of Earth’s volcanoes {{are under}} water. As {{a result of}} their {{relative}} inaccessibility, little is known of the structure and evolution of submarine volcanoes. Advances in navigation and sonar imaging techniques have made it possible to map submarine volcanoes in detail, and repeat surveys allow the identification of regions where the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the sea <b>floor</b> is actively changing. Here we report the results of a bathymetric survey of Monowai submarine volcano in the Tonga–Kermadec Arc, which we mapped twice within 14 days. We found marked differences in bathymetry between the two surveys, including an increase in seafloor depth up to 18. 8 [*]m and a decrease in depth up to 71. 9 [*]m. We attribute the depth increase to collapse of the volcano summit region and the decrease to growth of new lava cones and debris flows. Hydroacoustic T-wave data reveal a 5 -day-long swarm of seismic events with unusually high amplitude between the surveys, which directly link the depth changes to explosive activity at the volcano. The collapse and growth rates implied by our data are extremely high, compared with measured long-term growth rates of the volcano, demonstrating the pulsating nature of submarine volcanism and highlighting the dynamic nature <b>of</b> the sea <b>floor...</b>|$|R
