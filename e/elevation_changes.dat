5|$|For safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride {{rating system}} that classifies the attractions {{based on the}} {{intensity}} of the ride. The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid <b>elevation</b> <b>changes.</b> A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still rated on a scale from 1 to 5.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} streaky features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional <b>elevation</b> <b>changes</b> of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{accretion}} and <b>elevation</b> <b>change</b> in tidal forests, and {{the corresponding}} ability of these wetlands {{to keep pace with}} sea-level rise (SLR), represent data gaps in our understanding of wetland sustainability. Surface Elevation Tables and marker horizons were installed in three mature tidal forests and a restored tidal marsh, allowing us to measure <b>elevation</b> <b>change,</b> accretion, and subsidence. Additionally, we measured predictor variables to test for their significance in explaining accretion and <b>elevation</b> <b>change</b> rates. Mean accretion at our sites was 11. 67 +/- 3. 01 mm yr- 1 and mean <b>elevation</b> <b>change</b> was - 20. 22 +/- 8. 10 mm yr- 1, suggesting subsidence occurring beneath the sites. Processes contributing to accretion and <b>elevation</b> <b>change</b> at our sites may be driven by hydrologic patterns. Comparing our elevation trends with SLR trends suggests that our study sites may not keep pace with SLR. However, we may be observing short-term oscillations that do not indicate true long-term trends...|$|R

The nine-hole course was built using the natural terrain; however, some <b>elevation</b> <b>changes</b> were made to accommodate the large hills and valleys. For 50 cents an hour, workers had to climb and mark trees with ribbon, dig out roots, and blast out four-foot tree stumps. It was a five-year project that finished in 1965.

25|$|The {{finished}} canal ran 108 miles (174km), from Honesdale to Kingston (counting the tidewater {{portions of}} the Rondout where the canal joined the creek at Eddyville). Its 108 locks took it over <b>elevation</b> <b>changes</b> totaling 1,075 feet (328 m), more than the Erie Canal's 675 feet (206 m). The channel was four feet (122cm) deep (eventually increased to six feet (2 m)) by 32 feet (10 m) wide. It was crossed by 137 bridges and had 26 dams, basins and reservoirs. Originally it crossed the four rivers along its course — the Lackawaxen, Delaware, Neversink and Rondout Creek — via slackwater dams. Aqueducts were built over the rivers to replace them by John Roebling in the 1840s, cutting a few days from canal travel time and reducing accidents that were occurring at the Delaware crossing with loggers rafting their harvest downstream.|$|E
25|$|Past Sandy Creek, I-81 {{proceeds}} into Jefferson County, {{where it}} continues to travel across rural, undeveloped areas with only gentle <b>elevation</b> <b>changes.</b> US11 crosses I-81 {{for the last time}} just north of the county line, connecting to the freeway and switching from the highway's west side to its east side. As a result, I-81 now passes west of several villages and large hamlets, all located directly on US11. Connections to the communities are made by the primary east–west highways serving them, namely CR90 for Mannsville; NY193 for Pierrepont Manor; NY178 for Adams; and NY177 for Adams Center. At Adams Center, both I-81 and US11 take on a more northeasterly routing, bringing them farther inland toward the city of Watertown. The final exit before the city itself leads to NY232, a short connector between I-81 and Watertown Center, the southern extent of Watertown's suburbs.|$|E

25|$|The full Grand Prix Circuit {{begins on}} the Brabham Straight, an off-camber, {{slightly}} curved stretch, before plunging into the right-hander at Paddock Hill Bend. Despite {{the difficulty of}} the curve, due to the straight that precedes it, {{it is one of the}} track's few overtaking spots. The next corner, Druids, is a hairpin bend, negotiated after an uphill braking zone at Hailwood Hill. The track then curves around the south bank spectator area into the downhill, off-camber Graham Hill Bend, and another, slightly bent stretch at the Cooper Straight, which runs parallel to the pit lane. After the straight, the circuit climbs uphill though the decreasing-radius Surtees turn, before moving onto the back straight where the track's top speeds can be reached. The most significant <b>elevation</b> <b>changes</b> on the circuit occur here at Pilgrim's Drop and Hawthorn Hill, which leads into Hawthorn Bend. The track then loops around the woodland with a series of mid-speed corners, most notably the dip at Westfield and Dingle Dell and the blind Sheene curve. From there the track then emerges from the left hand and cambered Stirlings Bend onto the short straight to Clearways and rejoins the Indy Circuit for Clark Curve with its uphill off-camber approach to the pit straight and the start/finish line.|$|E

A series of direction and <b>elevation</b> <b>changes</b> lead into a second corkscrew, the inverted part of which is just above a portion of the queue line.

500|$|Depending on the source, Wacha shows a {{wide range}} of potential. [...] Scouting reports {{initially}} projected him for a potential of two plus-plus pitches (fastball and changeup) with command of both. [...] Baseball Prospectus noted that his polish due to pitch command helped fast-track him to the Major Leagues. [...] However, a dearth of vigorous fastball life escalates the importance of command. [...] Wacha offsets the shortage of sizable vertical movement with the pronounced descent through which his fastball, changeup and curve travel to create an additional obstacle as hitters to attempt square the bat on the pitch. [...] In addition, the drop in <b>elevation</b> <b>changes</b> the hitter's eye level. [...] Wacha was previously criticized for a heavy reliance on the fastball from lacking a solid breaking pitch. [...] Before refining his curveball, Baseball Prospect Nation commented that development of a slider [...] "to even only an occasional 'show-me' pitch would add another element to his game and allow him to become more refined in his pitch sequencing ability to work through a lineup." ...|$|E
500|$|Leary {{wrote that}} the canal began at Long Wharf in New Haven, Connecticut and exited the state of by the Congamnond Ponds, some [...] to the north.

Leary describes the canal was [...] "unquestionably Connecticut's foremost engineering feat before the advent of the railroads." [...] The first sections of the canal were operational in 1828, and the canal boats were pulled by mules up the canal, but it wasn't complete until the late 1830s. The operation of the canal was affected by the precipitation, with drought-like conditions resulting in closed sections, but it had a great impact on the local businesses and industries adjoining the canal.|$|E
