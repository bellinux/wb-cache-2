Here we examine sub-clinical infection by Trichomonas gallinae in a declining population of free-living <b>European</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Doves</b> and suggest caseous lesions cause mortality in adults and nestlings through subsequent starvation and/or suffocation. We found a 100 % infection rate by T. gallinae in adult and nestling <b>Turtle</b> <b>Doves</b> (n = 25) and observed clinical signs in three adults and four nestlings (28 %). Adults with clinical signs displayed no differences in any skeletal measures of size but had a mean 3 · 7 % reduction in wing length, with no overlap compared to those without clinical signs.

40|$|Background: Understanding how past climatic {{oscillations}} {{have affected}} organismic evolution will help predict {{the impact that}} current climate change has on living organisms. The <b>European</b> <b>turtle</b> <b>dove,</b> Streptopelia turtur, is a warm-temperature adapted species and a long distance migrant that uses multiple flyways to move between Europe and Africa. Despite being abundant, it is categorized as vulnerable because of a long-term demographic decline. We studied the demographic history and population genetic structure of the <b>European</b> <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> using genomic data and mitochondrial DNA sequences from individuals sampled across Europe, and performing paleoclimatic niche modelling simulations. Results: Overall our data suggest that this species is panmictic across Europe, and is not genetically structured across flyways. We found the genetic signatures of demographic fluctuations, inferring an effective population size (Ne) expansion that occurred between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, followed by {{a decrease in the}} Ne that started between the mid Holocene and the present. Our niche modelling analyses suggest that the variations in the Ne are coincident with recent changes in the availability of suitable habitat. Conclusions: We argue that the <b>European</b> <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> is prone to undergo demographic fluctuations, a trait that makes it sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, especially when its numbers are decreasing. Also, considering the lack of genetic structure, we suggest all populations across Europe are equally relevant for conservation. Trabajo financiado por: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

40|$|Agri-environment schemes {{such as the}} Environmental Stewardship in England {{provide a}} range of options, {{including}} some targeted at single species, which may benefit {{a wide range of}} other species or taxa. To ascertain whether trials of an agri-environment measure designed for a single species had wider biodiversity benefits, we describe monitoring of pollinators (bumblebees and butterflies) on plots of a novel seed mix aimed at providing a source of seed food throughout the breeding season for the rapidly declining <b>European</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> Streptopelia turtur. We compare pollinator abundance on these turtle dove plots to that on six control habitat types: fallow, grass margins, meadow, nectar flower mixture, wild bird cover and floristically enhanced margins. The abundance of foraging bumblebees and butterflies was higher on turtle dove plots than in fallow and wild bird cover habitats. Surprisingly, foraging bumblebee abundance was higher, and foraging butterfly abundance marginally higher on turtle dove plots than on nectar flower mixture. Whilst the specific mix described here is to be altered to increase access to foraging turtle doves, we suggest that the modified mix, to be rolled out through Higher Level Stewardship, is also likely to provide valuable resources for pollinators, adding to the growing body of literature demonstrating multi-taxa benefits of agri-environment options designed to benefit one species...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of migration routes, wintering grounds and stopover sites are crucial {{issues for the}} understanding of the Palearctic-African bird migration system {{as well as for the}} development of relevant conservation strategies for trans-Saharan migrants. Using miniaturized light-level geolocators we report a comprehensive and detailed year round track of a granivorous trans-Saharan migrant, the <b>European</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> (Streptopelia turtur). From five recovered loggers, our data provide new insights on migratory journeys and winter destinations of Turtle Doves originating from a breeding population in Western France. Data confirm that Turtle Doves wintered in West Africa. The main wintering area encompassed Western Mali, the Inner Delta Niger and the Malian/Mauritanian border. Some individuals also extended their wintering ranges over North Guinea, North-West of Burkina Faso and the Ivory-Coast. Our results reveal that all individuals did not spend the winter period at a single location; some of them experienced a clear eastward shift of several hundred kilometres. We also found evidence for a loop migration pattern, with a post-breeding migration flyway lying west of the spring route. Finally, we found that on their way back to breeding grounds Turtle Doves needed to refuel after crossing the Sahara desert. Contrary to previous suggestions, our data reveal that birds used stopover sites for several weeks, presumably in Morocco and North Algeria.

40|$|Post-fledging {{survival}} plays a {{vital role}} in the dynamics of bird populations and yet is the least studied avian life-stage. Habitat requirements post-fledging may have important implications for behaviour and survival, especially for declining populations in landscapes that have undergone wide-scale anthropogenic modification, resulting in an altered distribution and composition of habitats. The <b>European</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> is a widespread but rapidly declining species both within the UK and across Europe. Reduced seed food availability is thought to influence breeding success of this species, but it is not known whether post-fledging survival may also be influenced by seed availability. Here, we use leg-ring radio-tag attachments to monitor post-fledging survival and movements in 15 Turtle Dove nestlings from eight nests monitored during 2014 as part of a wider autecological study. Fledglings remained in close proximity to their nest for three weeks post-tagging, spending more than half their time in the immediate vicinity (within ∼ 20 m) of the nest. 95 % of foraging trips during this period were within 329 m of the nest and fledglings selected seed-rich habitat (semi-natural grassland, low-intensity grazing, fallow and quarries). Fledglings that were heavier and in better body condition at seven days old were more likely to survive for 30 days post-fledging, and the proportion of available seed-rich habitat was a strong predictor of nestling weight and condition at seven days old. Whilst our sample size is modest, this study highlights the crucial role of food availability in juvenile survival, both while adults are feeding nestlings, and to recently fledged young, and the potential for agri-environment schemes providing foraging and nesting habitats in close proximity to provide important benefits...|$|E

40|$|Disease {{is usually}} ignored as a {{potential}} driver of species decline. This is concerning since disease could have {{a greater impact on}} a species as it becomes vulnerable to other extinction risks. This thesis investigated Trichomonas gallinae infection in the UK’s fastest declining farmland bird, the <b>European</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> Streptopelia turtur. It employed molecular techniques to acquire data on parasite prevalence and identify strains, and trialled the application of Next Generation Sequencing technology to disease surveillance. Overall, 50 adult Turtle Dove samples from 2011 - 2015 were analysed and temporal variation in strain frequency was revealed. A degree of population structure in T. gallinae infecting different Turtle Dove populations (France 2014, n= 40; Senegal, n= 28) was apparent, along with some evidence of wide-ranging parasite dispersal, indirectly through their host. The potential risk of shared resources as a transmission route of T. gallinae was investigated with 226 food and 117 water samples screened for its presence. Evidence suggested T. gallinae was regularly present in both food and water resources. This has important implications for supplementary feeding being a conservation management tool. The reservoir of T. gallinae in the UK was reviewed by sampling potential hosts of Columbidae (n= 166), Galliformes (n= 13) and Passeriformes (n= 90). The detection of strains other than the finch epidemic strain in free-ranging Passerines revealed a greater level of genetic heterogeneity than previously shown in other studies. There were no significant associations between T. gallinae strain infection or coinfection with haemosporidians and measures of reproduction, body condition or post-fledging survival in Turtle Doves however, sample sizes were small. Overall, this study increases our understanding of the epidemiology of T. gallinae both in the wider bird population and a species of Vulnerable conservation status. It demonstrates how T. gallinae infecting wild birds is a useful model for investigating aspects of host- parasite ecology and encourages further research with this system...|$|E
40|$|Agri-environment schemes (AES) are {{increasingly}} being employed to mitigate biodiversity loss in agricultural environments. The <b>European</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> Streptopelia turtur is an obligate granivorous bird in rapid decline within both the UK (− 96 % since 1970) and across continental Europe (− 77 % since 1980), despite widespread uptake of AES. Here, we assess the efficacy of a potentially new, sown agri-environment option designed to provide abundant, accessible seed for S. turtur during the breeding season. During summer 2011 we compared vegetation structure and seed provision on trial plots to control habitat types (existing agri-environment options thought to potentially provide S. turtur foraging habitat) to assess whether trial plots performed better for foraging S. turtur than control habitats. In September 2011 all trial plots were topped (cut) and half of a subset of trial plots were then scarified (60 % of soil surface disturbed). Vegetation structure on topped, and topped and scarified trial plots was measured during summer 2012 to determine which management regime was most effective in maintaining suitable sward structure and seed provision into the second year. No control habitat type produced as much seed important in S. turtur diet as trial plots at any point during year one. Trial plots provided accessible vegetation structure {{early in the season}} with no difference in vegetation metrics between trial plots and previously published data on S. turtur foraging locations. However, to allow later access, management is required during mid-June to open up the sward through localized topping or scarification. Vegetation structure during year two was generally too dense to attract foraging S. turtur. However, scarifying trial plots during the September following sowing encouraged self-seeding of Fumaria officinalis (a plant species historically forming a significant proportion of S. turtur diet during the breeding season) into the second year, with this species present in 16 % of scarified trial plots compared to only 4 % of topped trial plots during year two. Thus, autumn scarification, possibly followed by topping or scarification of part of the trial plots in June, is necessary for trial plots to provide more seed and access for S. turtur than existing agri-environment options during year two. We recommend modifications to our original seed mix in order to reduce vegetation density and improve vegetation structure. The study provides an example of the need to strike the right balance between food abundance and accessibility, through vegetation structure, when designing agri-environment scheme management options that provide food for birds...|$|E
