The present study analyzed the effects of different grazing management methods on species diversity and richness in the steppe rangelands of Saveh, Iran. Data were collected from sixty 2 × 2 m plots within the areas of three, four-years protected range management projects. Margalef’s and Menhinick's indices, Simpson and Shannon-Weiner indices, and Pielou's index were used to evaluate plant species richness, diversity, and evenness, respectively. All data analyses were performed in PAST and SPSS. According to the mean values obtained for Shannon-Weiner index, Nemati rangeland (with rest-rotation grazing system and moderate grazing intensity) and Shirali Baglou rangeland (with continuous grazing throughout the year and high grazing intensity) had high species diversity with no significant differences among them. However, Chagneh rangeland (with continuous grazing {{for six months and}} fairly high grazing intensity) had the lowest diversity. Low values of diversity indices indicated low species diversity in steppe rangelands. Moreover, Shirali Baglou rangeland had the highest species richness compared to the other sites. In the other three rangelands, both species richness and diversity decreased with increasing the grazing intensity. Despite poor range conditions in Shirali Baglou rangeland, intensive livestock grazing and the consequent rise in invasive species increased species abundance and hence, resulting in species richness and diversity in the area. Although over-grazing throughout the year can promote plant species richness through increasing annual species, consequent soil degradation and instability of rangeland ecosystem can be expected...|$|R

The whole forest area not subjected to afforestation, reforestation or deforestation processes since 1990 will be considered as managed forest. In order to analyse different management strategies, the Carbon-Pro Project, involving 9 partners of the European CADSES area, considered a young beech high forest (ex-coppice, defined as "transitory silvicultural system") as a common case study for the Pre-alps region. Using data collected with forest plans during the period 1983 - 2005, aboveground and belowground forest carbon stock and sink of a specific forest compartment were estimated by the Carbon Stock Method proposed by the IPCC Guidelines. In order to apply this approach 41 trees were cut and a species-specific allometric equation was developed. Considering the aboveground tree biomass, the carbon sink amounts to 1. 99 and 1. 84 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 for the period 1983 - 1994 and 1994 - 2005 respectively. Adding the belowground tree biomass, the estimated sink amounts to 2. 59 and 2. 39 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 for each period. Taking the harvested wood products (firewood), the total carbon sequestration during the second period is 0. 16 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1. The case study highlights the possible rules for the different management strategies.

40|$|Human-induced fear in {{wildlife}} has {{the potential}} to impact animal behavior, survival, and species interactions through both direct and indirect effects. Risk-avoidance responses to fear can alter the way animals use space and resources, directly influencing their individual success and role in their ecological community. To understand ecological dynamics in systems increasingly modified and dominated by humans, a richer understanding is needed regarding the magnitude of human-induced fear in wildlife and the extent of its cascading effects. Large carnivores act as keystone predators in many ecosystems by limiting populations of large herbivores and mesocarnivores. The loss of large carnivores can trigger trophic cascades that restructure ecological communities. However, maintaining populations of large carnivores may not be enough if human disturbances restrict the ability for carnivores to continue their functional roles. Optimal coexistence scenarios between humans and carnivores should include minimizing behavioral impacts on carnivores and preserving species interactions. In this dissertation, I examine the nature and magnitude of human disturbances on carnivore behavior and the indirect effects of their human-induced fear. In particular, I investigate puma risk-foraging tradeoffs and their relationship to prey species on a gradient of human disturbance. I also explore the impacts of <b>human-induced</b> <b>activity</b> shifts in mesocarnivores on dietary niche partitioning. Finally, I apply my understanding of puma movement behavior and human risk-avoidance to prioritize developable lands for conservation. I conducting this work, I used or developed novel methods in citizen science, DNA metabarcoding, playback experiments, spatial analysis, and conservation planning. The results of my work indicate that humans can cause substantial risk-foraging tradeoffs in pumas, both at the immediate and landscape scale. This causes pumas to kill more deer per year when exposed to greater disturbance, but preferably consume smaller prey when actually adjacent to development. I also found that mesocarnivores increase diet overlap when they are disturbed by human activity and become more nocturnal. I developed a new approach to prioritizing conservation acquisitions based on puma movement potential and identified high quality land parcels that could be protected by local land trusts or county planners. My dissertation begins to explore the diversity of pathways that humans can alter animal communities by influencing the behavior of carnivores. Future work should evaluate the extent of human-induced behavioral cascades in ecosystems and determine the long-term outcomes of pervasive anthropogenic disturbance...|$|R

The internal stress that develops can be related to the water content of the soil. This method is validated using results for both silty clay loam and lay loam soils. Tensile stress at failure (estimated from the restrained ring method) was compared to tensile strength ranges of similar soils, and a good correlation was observed.

40|$|As a {{response}} to the identification of significant role of <b>human-induced</b> <b>activities</b> in the climate change, major industrialized countries have agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions on an average of 5. 2 % from 1990 levels by 2008 - 2012 with Kyoto Protocol in 1997. In this Protocol, the European Union as single identity has committed itself to reduce its emissions by 8 % by the year 2012 on 1990 levels, and unanimously ratified Kyoto Protocol in May 2002. While the Burden Sharing Agreement sets emission reduction targets for each member state, the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) that was launched in March 2000 outlines a list of priority actions for EU-wide common and coordinated policies and measures. This paper explores how climate change issue can be dealt in a transnational context, with a case study of the EU. It attempts to provide an outline of the European climate change policy, of the actors in play, its formulation and implementation processes, and a research agenda for a deeper understanding of these issues. The interviews made with the staff of the European Commission Directorate General of the Environment and of ministry of environments in selected member states in summer of 2002 highlight major experiences that could be gained from this European experience...|$|E
40|$|Estuaries are {{bodies of}} water along the coasts that are formed when fresh water from rivers flows into and mixes with salt water from the ocean. The {{estuaries}} serve as a habitat to some aquatic lives, including mangroves. <b>Human-induced</b> <b>activities</b> such as dredging of shipping lanes along the bottom estuarine, the disposal of industrial wastes into the water system and shoreline development influence estuarine dynamics which include mixing process. These activities might contribute to salinity changes and further adversely affect the estuarine ecosystem. In order to study at {{the characteristics of the}} mixing between salt water (estuary) and freshwater (river), a preliminary investigation had been done in the laboratory. Fresh water was released {{from one end of the}} flume and overflowing at weir at the other end. Meanwhile, salt water was represented by the red dye tracer released through a weir and intruded upstream as a gravity current. The isohalines are plotted to see the salinity patterns. Besides, to examine the spatial and temporal salinity profiles along the laboratory investigations, the plotted graphs have been made. The results show that the changes in salinity level along the flume due to mixing between fresh water and salt water. This showed typical salt-wedge estuary characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Estuaries, {{which are}} rich in nutrient, act as a habitat to some aquatic lives, {{including}} mangroves. <b>Human-induced</b> <b>activities</b> such as dredging and shoreline development influence estuarine dynamics which includes mixing process. This will further affect estuarine salinity and adversely affect the aquatic life. A laboratory investigation was conducted in a flume to observe the mixing in a salt-wedge estuary. Three conditions were studied, i. e. mixing in ordinary estuary, mixing in an estuary with a presence of smaller deep channel and mixing in an estuary with a presence of resisting structures along the channel banks. Freshwater was run {{from one end of}} the channel, overflowing a weir at the other end, while salt water was introduced at the base of the weir and intruded upstream as gravity current. Mixing in open channel occurs in longitudinal, vertical and transverse directions. The spatial and temporal salt-water intrusions were studied where the mixing patterns were visualized using red dye tracer. To have better understanding on the mixing process, salinity patterns are studied through the plotted isohalines. The spatial and temporal salinity profiles in the flume are also studied through plotted graphs. The results show that salinity differences occurred due to the interfacial mixing between saline and freshwate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBehavioral {{plasticity}} allows migrating {{animals to}} adjust their migration patterns inrelation to the environmental conditions they encounter during their movements. Sea turtles displaylong post-nesting migrations which vary considerably between species and populations. Todate, {{there has been no}} description of migratory patterns of the large population of olive ridley turtlesLepidochelys olivacea in the west Atlantic. Here, we investigated dispersal and dive patternsin relation to environmental conditions of 7 satellite-tracked olive ridley females from FrenchGuiana during their post-nesting migration. After they left the nesting beach, turtles followed aconsistent northwestward direction and then remained in the restricted yet productive neriticdomain of the continental shelf of French Guiana and Suriname. Despite this restricted dispersalrange, turtles demonstrated variability in the habitats they exploited, i. e. the coastline, the continentalshelf, and the continental slope, illustrating some plasticity. Moreover, turtles showed 2 differentforaging strategies, either directly reaching a specific foraging area off river mouths, ormeandering over the neritic area exploiting several foraging areas. In addition, turtles showed differentdive patterns related to their habitat, although mostly exploiting the seabed by routinelyperforming U-shaped benthic dives. Overall, turtles vertically exploited non-stratified watermasses characterized by warm surface temperatures consistent with their preferential thermalhabitat. The migration strategy used by olive ridleys from French Guiana raises conservation concerns,since turtles may be exposed to coastal <b>human-induced</b> <b>activities</b> that must be consideredin the implementation of accurate management measures for this still poorly studied populatio...|$|E
40|$|Hermatypic (reef building) corals produce massive skeletons that collectively {{form the}} {{limestone}} framework of tropical reefs. Coral reefs are diverse {{as well as}} productive biological communities which thrive in shallow marine environments. Community structure of the corals appears to be physically controlled by environmental parameters such as light, temperature, wave action, sedimentation, water quality, and nutrients. Coral reef organisms are usually stenotypic, exhibiting a relatively narrow range of tolerance within these environmental conditions. Reef building corals are adapted to live in oligotrophic (low nutrient) environments, and are particularly susceptible to nutrient loading. Excess nutrients supplied to coastal marine ecosystems may include nitrogen and phosphorous. The transport and transformation of these nutrients into coral reef communities are increasing {{as a result of}} anthropogenic (<b>human-induced)</b> <b>activities.</b> Some anthropogenic activities increase the nutrient supply to coastal waters via organic and inorganic pollution from sewage, groundwater seepage, and agricultural runoff; the effects of which may include eutrophication, changes in animal-algal symbiosis, shifts in competitive interaction, physiological alterations, and a decline in coral growth rate. Anthropogenic activities which produce excess nutrients near coastal waters are a major threat to coral communities throughout the world. In particular, the effects of added nutrient-enrichment are currently posing a serious threat to the vitality of coral reef ecosystems found adjacent to the Florida coast. This paper identifies sources, of water quality degradation, which include sewage, groundwater, and runoff, in South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s coastal waters, that my be adversely affecting hermatypic coral communities...|$|E
40|$|The Manahara River {{located in}} {{northeast}} {{part of the}} Kathmandu Valley has been disturbed for last one decade by several anthropogenic activities and natural causes thereby deteriorating its recreational functions and stream habitat. To obtain an existing environmental condition and disturbances of the river, the river was surveyed for its habitat, pollution level and surface water quality. Among the five representative segments of the river, the downstream segment (Sano Thimi) was scored into intermediate category showing more pollution and environmental deterioration compared to the upstream segments. Turbidity, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand and ammonia increase, whereas dissolved oxygen decreases from upstream to downstream with exponential functions. Aquatic lives like Garra sp. (Buduna), Schizothorax sp. (Asala), Channa sp. (Hiele) and Heteropneustes sp. (Singe) were observed except in downstream of the Jadibuti Bridge situated downstream from Sano Thimi stretch. Fish species were rare from the Jadibuti area most probably due to reduced dissoved oxygen (5 mg/l). Coliform bacteria ranged from 3000 to 4000 in the Manahara River showing high amount of bacterial contamination. Major disturbances, which affect river habitat and surface water quality of the Manahara River were destruction of riparian buffer zones, excavation excessive amount of sand from the river, encroachment of floodplains and bars, solid waste and sewer effluent, and tendency of landuse change. To retard environmental degradation of the Manahara River from the <b>human-induced</b> <b>activities,</b> local government needs to take immediate action. *Corresponding author...|$|E
