50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of this <b>guidance</b> <b>law</b> {{is that in}} most scenarios, it will bring the missile into a tail-chase {{towards the end of}} the missile's flight. This usually requires the missile to fly for longer, increasing the likelihood that the missile will run out of fuel or otherwise not reach the target.

The proposed new <b>guidance</b> <b>laws</b> improve the effectiveness of the proportional navigation (PN) law against manoeuvring targets. They augment the PN law which is a part of these laws. Analytical expressions of the new <b>guidance</b> <b>laws</b> for the generalized three-dimensional engagement model are presented.

40|$|<b>Guidance</b> <b>laws</b> {{based on}} a {{conventional}} sliding mode ensures only asymptotic convergence. However, convergence to the desired impact angle within a finite time is important in most practical guidance applications. These finite time convergent <b>guidance</b> <b>laws</b> suffer from singularity leading to control saturation. In this paper, <b>guidance</b> <b>laws</b> to intercept targets at a desired impact angle, from any initial heading angle, without exhibiting any singularity, are presented. The desired impact angle, which is {{defined in terms of}} a desired line-of-sight angle, is achieved in finite time by selecting the interceptor's lateral acceleration to enforce nonsingular terminal sliding mode on a switching surface designed using nonlinear engagement dynamics. Numerical simulation results are presented to validate the proposed <b>guidance</b> <b>laws</b> for different initial engagement geometries and impact angles.

50|$|Proportional {{navigation}} (also {{known as}} PN or Pro-Nav) is a <b>guidance</b> <b>law</b> (analogous to proportional control) {{used in some}} form or another by most homing air target missiles. It is {{based on the fact that}} two objects are on a collision course when the direction of their direct Line-of-Sight does not change. PN dictates that the missile velocity vector should rotate at a rate proportional to the rotation rate of the line of sight (Line-Of-Sight rate or LOS-rate), and in the same direction.|$|E
50|$|A rather simple {{hardware}} {{implementation of}} this <b>guidance</b> <b>law</b> {{can be found in}} early AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. These missiles use a rapidly rotating parabolic mirror as a seeker. Simple electronics detect the directional error the seeker has with its target (an IR source), and apply a moment to this gimballed mirror to keep it pointed at the target. Since the mirror is in fact a gyroscope it will keep pointing at the same direction if no external force or moment is applied, regardless of the movements of the missile. The voltage applied to the mirror while keeping it locked on the target is then also used (although amplified) to deflect the control surfaces that steer the missile, thereby making missile velocity vector rotation proportional to line of sight rotation. Although this does not result in a rotation rate that is always exactly proportional to the LOS-rate (which would require a constant airspeed), this implementation is equally effective.|$|E

The <b>guidance</b> <b>laws</b> are primarily based on nonlinear optimal control theory, and hence imbed effective trajectory optimization concepts into the <b>guidance</b> <b>laws.</b> Apart from being energy efficient by minimizing the control usage throughout the trajectory (minimum control usage leads to minimum turning, and hence leads to minimum induced drag), both of these laws enforce desired alignment constraints in both elevation and azimuth in a hard-constraint sense.

The engagement of underwater targets is suffered from uncertainties of the complicated underwater environment, short detecting range of the sonar seeker, the low speed ratio between vehicle and target, and longtime operations but no accurate positioning technique. Uncertainties of underwater environment includes temperature-dependent sound propagation path, sound shadow zone, current flowing direction, current flowing noise and self-noise of the vehicle. The first object {{is to find the}} target. The second object is to track the target and to re-track the target after the target lost.
