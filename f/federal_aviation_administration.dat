40|$|The {{impact of}} more timely and {{accurate}} weather data on airline flight planning {{with the emphasis}} on fuel savings is studied. This volume of the report discusses the results of Task 2 of the four major tasks included in the study. Task 2 compares various catagories of flight plans and flight tracking data produced by a simulation system developed for the <b>Federal</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Administrations</b> by SRI International. (Flight tracking data simulate actual flight tracks of all aircraft operating at a given time and provide for rerouting of flights as necessary to resolve traffic conflicts.) The comparisons of flight plans on the forecast to flight plans on the verifying analysis confirm Task 1 findings that wind speeds are generally underestimated. Comparisons involving flight tracking data indicate that actual fuel burn is always higher than planned, in either direction, and even when the same weather data set is used. Since the flight tracking model output results in more diversions than is known to be the case, it was concluded that there is an error in the flight tracking algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{residual}} stresses {{is important in}} understanding and predicting a concrete pavement???s performance. However, {{there is not a}} standard test for residual stresses in pavements. Prior pavement research was inspired by the hole-drilling straingage method used in metals. This method involves drilling a small hole into the specimen and measuring the resulting stress relaxation near the hole with strain gages. The strain change is then used to calculate the residual stresses in the metal. The pavement research at the <b>Federal</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Administration???s</b> National Airport Pavement Test Facility showed the promise of using core rings to create a similar stress relaxation in cantilevered concrete beams. The cantilevered beams were used to create a known and moderately-uniform stress state in the specimens. Testing at the University of Illinois continued the use of core rings and cantilevered beams and also introduced a method using notches. Strain gages on each beam measured the strain relaxation due to a core ring, one notch, or many notches. Strain relaxation was clearly seen in the core ring and notch beam tests, and this relaxation was most pronounced with the notch tests. Sawing a notch on both sides of a strain gage was able to relax all of the strain induced by the cantilever loading, making the residual stress calculation quite simple. A two-dimensional finite element analysis was used to parallel the testing and {{to learn more about the}} stress distributions through notched cantilevered beams...|$|R
40|$|The Phase 1 DAA Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) {{provided}} {{requirements for}} {{two classes of}} DAA equipment: equipment Class 1 contains the basic DAA equipment required to assist a pilot in remaining well clear, while equipment Class 2 integrates the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS) II system. Thus, the Class 1 system provides RWC functionality only, while the Class 2 system is intended to provide both RWC and Collision Avoidance (CA) functionality, {{in compliance with the}} Minimum Aviation System Performance (MASPS) for the Interoperability of Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems. The FAAs TCAS Program Office is currently developing Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X) to support the objectives of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Administrations</b> (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System Program (NextGen). ACAS X has a suite of variants with a common underlying design that are intended to be optimized for their intended airframes and operations. ACAS Xu being is designed for UAS and allows for new surveillance technologies and tailored logic for platforms with different performance characteristics. In addition to Collision Avoidance (CA) alerting and guidance, ACAS Xu is being tuned to provide RWC alerting and guidance in compliance with the SC 228 DAA MOPS. With a single logic performing both RWC and CA functions, ACAS Xu will provide industry with an integrated DAA solution that addresses many of the interoperability shortcomings of Phase I systems. While the MOPS for ACAS Xu will specify an integrated DAA system, it will need to show compliance with the RWC alerting thresholds and alerting requirements defined in the DAA Phase 2 MOPS. Further, some functional components of the ACAS Xu system such as the remote pilots displayed guidance might be mostly references to the corresponding requirements in the DAA MOPS. To provide a seamless, integrated, RWC-CA system to assist the pilot in remaining well clear and avoiding collisions, several issues need to be addressed within the Phase 2 SC- 228 DAA efforts. Interoperability of the RWC and CA alerting and guidance, and ensuring pilot comprehension, compliance and performance, will be a primary research area...|$|R
