The Hall of the Abencerrajes (c. 1333–91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333–54) are extraordinarily developed examples of muqarnas domes, taking {{the tradition of the}} squinch in Islamic architecture from a <b>functional</b> <b>element</b> in the zone of transition to a highly ornamental covering for the dome itself. The structural elements of these two domes are actually brick vaulting, but these are completely covered by the intricate mocárabe stalactites. The lacy and star-shaped crossing dome of Burgos Cathedral (1567) may have been inspired by these examples, in addition to that built over the cathedral's octagonal Chapel of the Condestable (148294) in the Gothic style.|$|E

40|$|Noncoding DNA, {{particularly}} intronic DNA, harbors important <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> {{that affect}} gene expression and RNA splicing. Yet, {{it is unclear}} which specific noncoding sites are essential for gene function and regulation. To identify <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> in noncoding DNA, we characterized genetic variation within introns using ethnically diverse human polymorphism data from three public databases—PMT, NIEHS, and SeattleSNPs. We demonstrate that positions within introns corresponding to known <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> involved in pre-mRNA splicing, including the branch site, splice sites, and polypyrimidine tract show reduced levels of genetic variation. Additionally, we observed regions of reduced genetic variation that are candidates for distance-dependent localization sites of <b>functional</b> <b>elements,</b> possibly intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs). Using several bioinformatics approaches, we provide additional evidence that supports our hypotheses that these regions correspond to ISEs. We conclude that studies of genetic variation can successfully discriminate and identify <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> in noncoding regions. As more noncoding sequence data become available, the methods employed here can be utilized to identify additional <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> in the human genome and provide possible explanations for phenotypic associations...|$|R

40|$|Three-prime untranslated regions (3 ′UTRs) {{are widely}} {{recognized}} as important post-transcriptional regulatory regions of mRNAs.

50|$|Built {{around a}} large central {{fireplace}} that opened on multiple sides to maximize warmth, Capen houses, like their medieval English counterparts, typically possessed three or four rooms on the ground floor: a parlor, a “hall,” a kitchen, and sometimes a foyer. The parlor traditionally functioned as a formal space and was not heated in the winter except on special occasions. The kitchen and hall acted as communal living spaces. The stairwell, not yet considered a focal point of design, remained a discreet and <b>functional</b> <b>element</b> of the house’s plan. While American colonists maintained the basic floor plan of the European houses, the ready and cheap supply of timber allowed them to use clapboard siding and shingled roofs rather than the mud and thatch common in Britain.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is demonstrating that the DP internal <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> in Amharic are the lexicalizations of the agreement between the functional projections in higher positions with the lexical elements in the c-command domains of these functional projections. The complex distribution of the <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> such as the gender, number, definiteness and case markers is argued to be derived via the same mechanism, Multiple/Reverse Agree. Describing the lexical and <b>functional</b> <b>elements,</b> the thesis starts from sketching the basic framework of the DP structure in the language. Emphasizing on the striking similarities the <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> exhibit, it then goes to propose that these <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> are the reflexes of the same syntactic operation, Multiple/Reverse Agree, established between the functional heads (K, D, C and Num) and the lexical heads in the c-command domains of these functional heads. By focusing {{on many of the}} issues that escaped attention in the literature such as the dependency of the adjectival agreement on the definiteness article, the thesis comes with a strong claim that the phi features (specifically the gender feature) merge on D, rather than on the head noun, contra to the standard assumption. Arguing that Multiple/Reverse Agree is an obligatory operation in definite noun phrases, the apparent optionality of the <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> on the modifiers is also analyzed to be an effect of a feature incorporation operation on the PF (interface) domain of the grammar. The placement of the traditionally dubbed `complementizer' element, yä, is also derived in the same way to other agreement elements. Assuming that all the yä-phrases, such as relative clauses, possessives and complement phrases are headed by null C [...] head, the thesis derives the complicated distribution of the particle, yä, in all the yä-phrases in a uniform fashion. Yä is taken to be, {{just like the rest of}} the <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> in the DP, the reflex of the Multiple/Reverse Agreement between the C and the lexical heads in the c-command domains of C...|$|R
50|$|Up {{to eight}} stories high, the {{building}} occupies {{an entire city}} block. The massively simplified facade of the bank clearly owes something to classicism.

The building's harmonious synthesis between form and functionality was highly acclaimed by critics. The metal rivets do not obstruct the facade but resemble decorative elements. The use of marble also makes the maintenance and cleaning of the facade very easy and inexpensive, another important <b>functional</b> <b>element</b> in Wagner's design.

The Legacy PSAP Gateway is expected to provide interworking and other functionality necessary for emergency calls routed via an i3 Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) to be delivered to and handled by legacy PSAPs without requiring changes to legacy PSAP Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). Calls routed via an i3 ESInet and delivered to a legacy PSAP must undergo signaling interworking (i.e., at the Legacy PSAP Gateway) to convert the incoming IP-based (i.e., Session Initiation Protocol SIP) signaling supported by the ESInet to the traditional Multi-Frequency (MF) or Enhanced Multi-Frequency (E-MF) signaling supported by the legacy PSAP.

50|$|For all {{of these}} reasons, the tribal economy of 7th-century Arabia {{constituted}} {{more than just a}} primitive patriarchal society, for the majority of transhumant cattle-breeders was supplemented by Arab traders and Arab agriculturalists (or “semi-agriculturalists”, as Asfendiarov had it, for they still had connections to the nomadic way of life). Taken together, these three social groups still made up one single economic formation, one that was characterized by a certain amount of economic specialization with all ensuing social contradictions, especially a marked distinction between rich and poor. What they all had in common was their tribal organization, which did not evolve into a community- or neighborhood-based social organization. The tribal organization, according to Asfendiarov, was not simply a “residue” (perezhitok) of the past that was doomed to vanish, but rather a very <b>functional</b> <b>element</b> necessary for survival in all three economic environments. He concluded that the Orient was characterized not by a historical sequence of primitive-patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist society, as in the West, but by one tribalformation that combined elements from all three formations. According to Asfendiarov, this tribal formation was retained at least until the 16th century.|$|E
