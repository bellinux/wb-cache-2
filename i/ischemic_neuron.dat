40|$|Aim: Thrombocyte {{activation}} {{is one of}} {{the mechanisms}} blamed for emerging of early brain injury(EBI) soon after subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH). It is wondered by researching to what extend neuron injury is prevented by making thrombocyte inhibition in SAH model. It shows that the role of trombocyte activation on EBI. Material and Method: 21 rabbits weighting 3 - 5 kg are divided in 3 groups 7 each. After ether anesthesia, 0. 2 cc arterial blood taking from group 1 and 2 was injected into cysterna magna and created SAH. After SAH, at regular intervals antithrombocyte drug (tirofiban) was given to group 2 intraperitoneally; no treatment was carried on group 1. 0. 2 cc SF was injected into cysterna magna in group 3. Decapitation was done in 72 nd hour and then ischemic brain map was done at hippocampus level. The amount of <b>ischemic</b> <b>neuron</b> was scored and statistically analyzed. Results: SAH was detected in all rabbits of group 1 and 2. There are meaningful difference between the group 1 and group 3 of scoring <b>ischemic</b> <b>neuron</b> of hippocampus's CA- 3 and CA- 4 areas. Whereas in group 2,which is a <b>ischemic</b> <b>neuron</b> treatment group, there is a decline in each area, this decline has reached to a statistical means only in CA- 4 area. Conclusion: There can be neuronal loss due to EBI even in the area which is free from blood in experimental SAH. Decreasing the injury of neuron with an antithrombocyte medicine shows that thrombocyte activation plays a great role in pathogenesis of EBI...|$|E

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the appearance of}} hallmarks of apoptosis following experimental stroke. The reviewed literature leaves no doubt that ischemic cell death in the brain is active, that is, requires energy; is gene directed, that is, requires new gene expression; and is capase-mediated, that is, uses apoptotic proteolytic machinery. However, sufficient differences to both classical necrosis and apoptosis exist which prevent easy mechanistic classification. It is concluded that ischemic cell death in the brain is neither necrosis nor apoptosis but is a chimera which appears on a continuum that has apoptosis and necrosis at the poles. The position on this continuum could be modulated by {{the intensity of the}} ischemic injury, the consequent availability of ATP and new protein synthesis, and both the age and context of the neuron in question. Thus the <b>ischemic</b> <b>neuron</b> may look necrotic but have actively died in an energy dependent manner with new gene expression and destruction via the apoptotic proteolytic machinery...|$|E

40|$|Na+ has {{a crucial}} role in {{neuronal}} osmoregulation and, therefore, its intracellular concentrations are strictly controlled by several homeostatic systems, the most important of which is the Na+/K+ ATPase. A marked increase in [Na+]i takes place after <b>ischemic</b> insults in <b>neurons</b> where it has {{a crucial role}} in triggering necrotic and, perhaps, also apoptotic cell death. While the impairment in Na+/K+ ATPase activity contributes to this process, it is not sufficient per se to cause the massive intracellular Na+ overload observed after ischemia which requires, instead, also a significant increase in Na+ influx into the cell or an impairment of Na+ efflux. Traditionally, the increase in Na+ permeability occurring in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> was ascribed to the activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and/or of glutamate receptors, and their pharmacological blockade was proposed as a therapeutic strategy in stroke but did not meet the expectations. More recently, the spotlight was turned on NCX, ASICs, NHE, and NKCC, a group of ion channels and transporters, which, because of their specific mechanisms of activation, could represent a preferential Na+ influx or efflux route in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Evidence suggesting their involvement in stroke and the possible benefits of their pharmacological modulation in this condition are reviewed in the present chapter...|$|R
50|$|The ischemic (ischaemic) cascade is {{a series}} of {{biochemical}} reactions that are initiated in the brain and other aerobic tissues after seconds to minutes of ischemia (inadequate blood supply). This is typically secondary to stroke, injury, or cardiac arrest due to heart attack.

The ischemic cascade usually goes on for two to three hours but can last for days, even after normal blood flow returns.|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} neuromodulator adenosine is neuroprotective against damage {{induced by}} cerebral ischemia. Its vasodilator effects add to its suitability {{as a possible}} anti-stroke agent, but also account for unwanted side effects following systemic administration of adenosine receptor agonists. ATP breakdown during ischemia produces adenosine which effluxes out of the neuron. This review will focus on endogenously produced adenosine and its subsequent protection against ischemia-induced neuronal damage in some stroke models, but will also highlight possible disadvantages to increasing adenosine concentrations. In the advantages column, therapeutic benefits have been obtained by enhancing synaptic concentrations of endogenous adenosine using the adenosine uptake inhibitor propentofylline, but not dipyridamole. There is an emerging role for endogenous adenosine in preventing delayed cell death, e. g. following hypoxic pre-conditioning. One of the cons associated with enhancing the synaptic concentration of adenosine is the appearance of adenosine receptor desensitization over time. Thus, there is a therapeutic window of opportunity during which activation of an adenosine A 1 receptor is beneficial to an <b>ischemic</b> <b>neuron.</b> LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 7806090; 0 (Neuroprotective Agents); 58 - 61 - 7 (Adenosine); RF: 132; ppublishSource type: Prin...|$|E
40|$|Neuregulin {{receptor}} degradation protein- 1 (Nrdp 1) is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for {{degradation and}} regulates cell growth, apoptosis and oxidative stress in various cell types. We have previously shown that Nrdp 1 is implicated in ischemic cardiomyocyte death. In this study, we investigated {{the change of}} Nrdp 1 expression in ischemic neurons {{and its role in}} ischemic neuronal injury. Primary rat cerebral cortical neurons and pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells were infected with adenoviral constructs expressing Nrdp 1 gene or its siRNA before exposing to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Our data showed that Nrdp 1 was upregulated in ischemic brain tissue 3 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in OGD-treated neurons. Of note, Nrdp 1 overexpression by Ad-Nrdp 1 enhanced OGD-induced neuron apoptosis, while knockdown of Nrdp 1 with siRNA attenuated this effect, implicating a role of Nrdp 1 in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neuron</b> injury. Moreover, Nrdp 1 upregulation is accompanied by increased protein ubiquitylation and decreased protein levels of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP 8) in OGD-treated neurons, which led to a suppressed interaction between USP 8 and HIF- 1 α and subsequently a reduction in HIF- 1 α protein accumulation in neurons under OGD conditions. In conclusion, our data support an important role of Nrdp 1 upregulation in ischemic neuronal death, and suppressing the interaction between USP 8 and HIF- 1 α and consequently the hypoxic adaptive response of neurons may account for this detrimental effect...|$|E

Co-administration of r-tPA and HBOT has already been proved to be effective, safe and feasible in myocardial infarction.

Ginkgo proanthocyanidins (20, 40, 80 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours before reperfusion. Results showed that ginkgo proanthocyanidins could effectively mitigate neurological disorders, shorten infarct volume, increase superoxide dismutase activity, and decrease malondialdehyde and nitric oxide contents. Simultaneously, the study on grape seed proanthocyanidins (40 mg/kg) confirmed that different sources of proanthocyanidins have a similar effect. The neurological outcomes of ginkgo proanthocyanidins were similar to that of nimodipine in the treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results suggest that ginkgo proanthocyanidins can effectively lessen cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and protect ischemic brain tissue and these effects are associated with antioxidant properties...|$|R
40|$|Disruption of {{the blood}} brain barrier (BBB) within the {{thrombolytic}} time window is an antecedent event to intracerebral hemorrhage in ischemic stroke. Our recent studies showed that 2 -h cerebral ischemia induced BBB damage in non-infarcted area and secreted matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) accounted for this disruption. However, the factors that affect MMP- 2 secretion and regulate BBB damage remains unknown. Since hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 α) was discovered as a mater regulator in hypoxia, we sought to investigate the roles of HIF- 1 α in BBB damage {{as well as the}} factors regulating HIF- 1 α expression in the ischemic brain. in vivo rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) models were used to mimic ischemia. Pretreatment with HIF- 1 α inhibitor YC- 1 significantly inhibited 2 -h MCAO-induced BBB damage, which was accompanied by suppressed occludin degradation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA upregulation. Interestingly, β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 -AR) antagonist ICI 118551 attenuated ischemia-induced BBB damage by regulating HIF- 1 α expression. Double immunostaining showed that HIF- 1 α was upregulated in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> but not in astrocytes andendothelial cells. Of note, HIF- 1 α inhibition with inhibitor YC- 1 or siRNA significantly prevented OGD-induced VEGF upregulation as well as the secretion of VEGF and MMP- 2 in neurons. More importantly, blocking β 2 -AR with ICI 118551 suppressedHIF- 1 α upregulation in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> and attenuated occludin degradation induced by the conditioned media of OGD-treatedneurons. Taken together, blockade of β 2 -AR-mediated HIF- 1 α upregulation mediates BBB damage during acute cerebral ischemia. These findings provide new mechanistic understanding of early BBB damage in ischemic stroke and may help reduce thrombolysis-related hemorrhagic complications...|$|R

In this study, we assessed whether hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) preconditioning of human BM-MSCs could increase their functional capacity and beneficial effect on <b>ischemic</b> rat cortical <b>neurons.</b> Human BM-MSCs were cultured under hypoxia (1 % O- 2) and with long-term reoxygenation for various times to identify the optimal conditions for increasing their viability and proliferation. The effects of H/R preconditioning on the BM-MSCs were assessed by analyzing the expression of prosurvival genes, trophic factors, and cell migration assays. The functionally improved BM-MSCs were cocultured with <b>ischemic</b> rat cortical <b>neurons</b> to compare with normoxic cultured BM-MSCs. Although the cell viability and proliferation of BM-MSCs were reduced after 1 day of hypoxic culture (1 % O- 2), when {{this was followed by}} 5 -day reoxygenation, the BM-MSCs recovered and multiplied extensively. The immunophenotype and trilineage differentiation of BM-MSCs were also maintained under this H/R preconditioning. In addition, the preconditioning enhanced the expression of prosurvival genes, the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of various trophic factors and migration capacity.

Here we examine the expression, activation, and cellular location of MMP- 3 and the cleavage of agrin, an MMP- 3 substrate, following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. MMP- 3 was activated by ischemia/reperfusion, which was revealed {{by the appearance of}} a cleaved form and increased degradation of a substrate. MMP- 3 was observed in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons,</b> oligodendrocytes, microvasculature, and reactive microglia/macrophages. In cell cultures, MMP- 3 expression was observed in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in mature oligodendrocytes, but not in oligodendrocyte progenitors, astrocytes, or microglia. Casein zymography revealed MMP- 3 in cultured neurons. Agrin was expressed in cultured neurons and cultured astrocytes. In brain tissue, agrin was detected in neurons, and following ischemia it was also detected in reactive astrocytes. Addition of MMP- 3 to protein extracts from control brain caused neuronal agrin degradation. Following ischemia/reperfusion, agrin disappeared from the tissue membrane fraction and a cleaved agrin fragment was found in tissue protein extracts. The present results show MMP- 3 activation and neuronal transmembrane agrin cleavage after ischemia/reperfusion.

However, the mechanism of HIF- 1 regulation is still not fully understood in ischemic brains. We tested a hypothesis that both the 26 S and the 20 S proteasomal pathways were involved in HIF- 1 α degradation under ischemic conditions. Using in vitro ischemic model (oxygen and glucose deprivation) and a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, we tested effects of inhibitors of proteasomes and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) on HIF- 1 α stability and brain injury in cerebral ischemia. We observed that 30 and 60 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation significantly increased the 20 S proteasomal activity. We demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors increased HIF- 1 α stabilization and cell viability and were more effective than PHD inhibitors in primary cultured cortical neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation. Furthermore, {{the administration of the}} proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin, to mice resulted in smaller infarct size and brain edema than a PHD inhibitor.

40|$|The {{failure of}} blood vessels to revascularize ischemic neural tissue {{represents}} a significant challenge for vascular biology. Examples include proliferative retinopathies (PRs) such as retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which are the leading causes of blindness in children and working-age adults. PRs are characterized by initial microvascular degeneration, followed by a compensatory albeit pathologic hypervascularization mounted by the hypoxic retina attempting to reinstate metabolic equilibrium. Paradoxically, this secondary revascularization fails to grow into the most ischemic regions of the retina. Instead, the new vessels are misdirected toward the vitreous, suggesting that vasorepulsive forces operate in the avascular hypoxic retina. In the present study, we demonstrate that the neuronal guidance cue semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) is secreted by hypoxic neurons in the avascular retina {{in response to the}} proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1 β. Sema 3 A contributes to vascular decay and later forms a chemical barrier that repels neo-vessels toward the vitreous.

Increased activity of MMPs including MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and MMP- 13 was demonstrated in neuronal nuclei of brains {{at an early stage}} of ischemic stroke and reperfusion injury [4],[10]. The nucleus has a matrix that resembles the ECM and provides structural and organizational support for various nuclear processes as well as apoptosis, which involves proteolytic processing of nuclear proteins. The intranuclear gelatinase activity in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> suggests a possible role for gelatinases in nuclear matrix proteolysis. Intranuclear MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activity was shown to facilitate oxidative injury in <b>neurons</b> during early <b>ischemic</b> insult by cleaving nuclear proteins poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP- 1) and X-ray cross-complementary factor 1 (XRCC 1). Both PARP- 1 and XRCC 1 are DNA repair enzymes which become activated following the induction of DNA damage. DNA base excision repair machinery in neuronal nuclei repairs oxidative DNA damage. DNA strand breaks induce PARP- 1 activity, which triggers DNA repair by binding to damaged DNA.

We have previously demonstrated that supernatants derived from ischemic microglia can protect ischemic brain cells by releasing GDNF and TGF-beta 1. In the present study, we investigate whether products of ischemic astrocytes can also protect ischemic microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in a similar manner. Supernatants from ischemic astrocytes were collected after various periods of ischemia and incubated with microglia, astrocytes, or neurons individually, under in vitro ischemic conditions. The components responsible for the protective effects of astrocyte-derived supernatants were then identified by Western blot, ELISA, trypan blue dye exclusion, and immunoblocking assays. Results showed that under conditions of in vitro ischemia the number of surviving microglia, astrocytes, and neurons was significantly increased by the incorporation of the astrocyte-derived supernatants. Astrocyte supernatant-mediated protection of ischemic microglia was dependent on TGF-beta 1 and NT- 3, ischemic astrocytes were protected by GDNF, and <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> were protected by NT- 3. In addition, protein expression of TGF-beta 1 and NT- 3 receptors in microglia, GDNF receptors in astrocytes, and NT- 3 receptors in neurons was increased by in vitro ischemia.

After the entire aorta was exposed, segmental arteries from T 6 through L 1 were sequentially ligated while regional oxygen saturation was monitored. Decreases in regional oxygen saturation were calculated as percentage changes from baseline. The degrees of ischemia in the upper and lower spinal cord were compared histopathologically. ResultsBaseline regional oxygen saturations were similar in the upper (68. 8 % ± 9. 0 %) and lower (68. 0 % ± 11. 5 %, P =. 82) cord. After ligation, however, regional oxygen saturation levels were significantly lower in the lower cord (41. 3 % ± 10. 1 %) than in the upper cord (64. 8 % ± 9. 3 %, P =. 037). The regional oxygen saturation had decreased by 39. 0 % ± 11. 5 % in the lower cord but only by 6. 3 % ± 7. 6 % in the upper cord (P =. 026).

The advent of animal and tissue culture models of ischemia has led to many new insights into the mechanisms by which <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> die. If ischemia is complete and pro-longed, neuronal death is inevitable. However, it has be-come increasingly clear that many secondary biochemical changes that exacerbate injury occur in response to the ini-tial insult. In models of cerebral ischemia in rodents, as much as 50 % or more of ischemic brain may be spared from infarction by preventing these secondary biochemical events. Understanding of the mechanisms by which neu-ronal cell death takes place has resulted in a number of therapeutic strategies that aim to prevent secondary bio-chemical changes and thus decrease the damage that results from cerebral ischemia. These basic mechanisms may also have relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases associ-ated with excessive neuronal death. This chapter summarizes many of the mechanisms that have been demonstrated to exacerbate the neuronal death caused by hypoxia and hypoglycemia. Ischemic neuronal death may involve the activation of enzymes and receptor...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{patients}} with acute ischemic stroke, early treatment with thrombolytic agents {{is thought to}} permit reperfusion of <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> and to promote recovery of function. The Multicenter Acute Stroke-Trial - Europe (MAST-E) was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of streptokinase in {{patients with}} acute ischemic stroke. Methods Patients with moderate-to-severe ischemia in {{the territory of the}} middle cerebral artery were randomly assigned to receive streptokinase (1. 5 million units over a period of one hour) or placebo within six hours after the onset of stroke. The primary efficacy outcome was a binary criterion combining mortality and severe disability at six months, with severe disability defined as a score of 3 or higher on the Rankin scale. The primary safety outcomes were mortality at 10 days and cerebral hemorrhage. Results All randomized patients (156 in the streptokinase group and 154 in the placebo group) were evaluated at six months. The incidence of the primary efficacy outcome was similar in the two groups (124 patients in the streptokinase group and 126 in the placebo group died or had a Rankin score {{greater than or equal to}} 3). However, the mortality rate at 10 days was significantly higher in the streptokinase group than in the placebo group (34. 0 percent vs. 18. 2 percent, P= 0. 002). The higher rate in the streptokinase group was mainly due to the hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic cerebral infarcts. At six months, more deaths had occurred in the streptokinase group than in the placebo group (73 vs. 59, P= 0. 06). Conclusions In patients with acute ischemic stroke, treatment with streptokinase resulted in an increase in mortality. The routine use of streptokinase cannot be recommended in acute ischemic stroke.

40|$|In {{our studies}} we {{characterized}} neuroprotective mechanisms, using in vivo and in vitro models of neuronal cell death. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, so called statins, exert rapid cholesterol-independent effects. In our studies we tested whether postevent treatment with intravenously (i. v.) administered rosuvastatin improves stroke outcome in mice. In addition we characterized the therapeutic time window, dose-response {{as well as}} the impact on levels of phosphorylated endothlelial nitric oxide (eNOS) and Akt kinase. Furthermore we investigated signaling cascades of microglial inflammation. As a dominant cellular ectonucleotidase, CD 39 degrades ATP to ADP. In vitro studies have shown, that microglia is activated by ATP. Here we tested the impact of CD 39 for microglial activation, using cd 39 knockout mice (cd 39 -/-). In the third part of our studies, we investigated neuroprotective effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). PACAP confers protection in models of cerebral ischemia. However the mechanisms are poorly understood. In our studies rosuvastatin, administerd i. v., significantly reduced lesion size and improved functional outcome, when given up to 4 hours after induction of focal cerebral ischemia. Neuroprotection was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated eNOS and Akt kinase. Regarding CD 39, ATP failed to stimulate puringergic receptor 2 mediated migration in cd 39 -/- microglia. However, the effects of ATP on migration in cd 39 -/- microglia was restored by addition of a soluble ectonucleotidase or co-stimulation with ADP. In different in vivo models of neuronal cell death, cd 39 -/- mice showed reduced accumulation of microglia at the pathological sites. Following focal cerebral ischemia the infarct size was increased in cd 39 -/- mice. PACAP expression was up regulated in cortical pyramidal cells, following focal cerebral ischemia.

40|$|SUMMARY We prospectively studied 14 {{patients}} with acute cerebral infarctions using serial I 33 Xenon inhalation cerebral determination (133 Xe-rCBF), scored neurological examinations, and neuropsycholog-icai testing. All patients underwent the same {{battery of tests}} at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after cerebral infarction to determine the prognostic value of early rCBF studies and the chronological relation-ship of changes in rCBF to clinical status. Baseline rCBF within 3 days of symptoms of acute stroke did not correlate with clinical neurological outcome (r = — 0. 17, p < 0. 30; r = — 0. 18, p < 0. 28, for the two indices of rCBF used). Among the 11 patients demonstrating neurological recovery, 7 improved at 1 week, significantly before increases in rCBF (p < 0. 05). We conclude that early baseline rCBF does not predict dinical outcome in {{patients with}} acute cerebral infarctions and that return of neurological function precedes rather than follows increases in rCBF. Stroke Vol 17, No 2, 1986 AS VASCULAR OCCLUSION is the underlying cause of acute cerebral infarction, decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) {{would appear to be}} a pre-dictable occurrence following acute stroke. Several reports indicate early rCBF determinations do corre-late with magnitude of infarction and predict clinical outcome. These studies find that luxury perfusion indi-cates a good prognosis, and low initial rCBF bodes ill for the patient with acute stroke. '~ 9 As lysis of a throm-bus and/or opening of collaterals could be crucial in salvaging <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons,</b> it seems reasonable that an increase in rCBF would accompany improvement in stroke patients. However, no study has examined the chronological relation between changes in rCBF and clinical changes in patients with acute stroke.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:The {{striatum}} {{is one of}} {{the regions}} most sensitive to transient forebrain ischemia. After 30 -minute ischemia, areas of massive neuronal degeneration are clearly detectable a few hours after the insult and attain their maximal extension 24 hours after the insult. However, for most cellular and neurochemical parameters it is not known whether some recovery occurs at later times. We examined certain cell populations in the caudate putamen at different times after transient ischemia. METHODS:Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 30 -minute forebrain ischemia (four-vessel occlusion model). Six experimental groups were considered: control animals and ischemic animals killed 4 hours, 1 day, 7 days, 40 days, and 8 months after reperfusion. Three striatal cell populations were examined by means of immunocytochemistry coupled to computer-assisted image analysis: vulnerable medium spiny neurons, resistant aspiny neurons, and reactive astrocytes, labeled for their content of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein mr 32 (DARPP- 32), somatostatin and neuropeptide Y, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, respectively. RESULTS:(1) The area containing DARPP- 32 immunoreactive neurons was markedly decreased (15 % to 20 % of control caudate putamen area) at 1 day after reperfusion and partially recovered at the following times (40 % to 50 % at 7 days and 50 % to 60 % at 40 days and 8 months after reperfusion). (2) The appearance of reactive astrocytes was precocious (4 hours to 1 day after ischemia) in the medial caudate putamen, the region in which DARPP- 32 recovered within 40 days after ischemia, and late (7 to 40 days after ischemia) in the lateral caudate putamen, where no DARPP- 32 recovery was detected. (3) Neuropeptide Y/somatostatin-containing <b>neurons</b> resisted the <b>ischemic</b> insult and could be detected in areas devoid of DARPP- 32 immunoreactive neurons as long as 8 months after reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS:The present results show a marked recovery of DARPP- 32 -positive neurons within 40 days after 30 -minute forebrain ischemia in the medial, but not the lateral, caudate putamen. Medial caudate putamen also contains a high density of reactive astrocytes on the first day after ischemia, suggesting that astrocytic support has {{an important role in the}} spontaneous recovery of <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose Oligodendrocyte (OL) {{death is}} {{important}} in focal cerebral ischemia. TIMP- 3 promotes apoptosis in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons</b> by inhibiting proteolysis of TNF-&# 945; superfamily of death receptors. Since OLs undergo apoptosis during ischemia, we hypothesized that TIMP- 3 contributes to OL death. Methods Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in Timp- 3 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice with 24 or 72 h of reperfusion. Cell death in white matter was investigated by stereology and TUNEL. Mature or immature OLs were identified using antibodies against glutathione S-transferase-&# 960; (GST-&# 960;) and galactocerebroside (GalC), respectively. Expression and level of proteins were examined using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Protein activities were determined using a FRET peptide. Results Loss of OL-like cells was detected at 72 h only in WT ischemic white matter where TUNEL showed greater cell death. TIMP- 3 expression was increased in WT reactive astrocytes. GST-&# 960; was reduced in ischemic white matter of WT mice compared with WT shams with no difference between KO and WT at 72 h. GalC level was significantly increased in both KO and WT ischemic white matter at 72 h. However, the increase in GalC in KO mice {{was significantly higher than}} WT; most TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic white matter expressed GalC, suggesting TIMP- 3 deficiency protects the immature OLs from apoptosis. There were significantly higher levels of cleaved caspase- 3 at 72 h in WT white matter than in KO. Greater expression of MMP- 3 and - 9 was seen in reactive astrocytes and/or microglia/macrophages in WT at 72 h. We found more microglia/macrophages in WT than in KO, which were the predominant source of increased TNF-&# 945; detected in the ischemic white matter. TACE activity was significantly increased in ischemic WT white matter, which was expressed in active microglia/macrophages and OLs. Conclusions Our results suggested that focal ischemia leads to proliferation of immature OLs in white matter and that TIMP- 3 contributes to a caspase- 3 -dependent immature OL death via TNF-&# 945;-mediated neuroinflammation. Future studies will be needed to delineate the role of MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 that were increased in the Timp- 3 wild type...|$|R
40|$|Ischemic stroke {{occurs as}} a result of a lack or severe {{reduction}} of blood supply to the brain. Presently therapeutic interventions are limited and there is a need to develop new and efficacious stroke treatments. To this end, a great deal of research effort has been devoted to studying the potential molecular mechanisms involved in ischemic neuronal death. Correlative evidence demonstrated a paradoxical activation of the cell cycle machinery in <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons.</b> The levels and activity of key cell cycle regulators including cyclin D 1, Cdk 2 and Cdk 4 are upregulated following ischemic insults. However, the functional relevance of these various signals following ischemic injury was unclear. Accordingly, the research described in this thesis address the functional relevance of the activation of the cell cycle machinery in ischemic neuronal death. 	 The data indicate that the inhibition of Cdk 4 protects neurons from ischemia-induced delayed death, whereas abrogation of Cdk 5 activity prevents excitotoxicity-induced damage in vitro and in vivo. Examination of upstream activators of mitotic-Cdks showed that Cdc 25 A is a critical mediator of delayed ischemic neuronal death. Investigation of the potential molecular mechanism by which cell cycle regulators induced neuronal death revealed perturbations in the levels and activity of key downstream targets of Cdk 4. The retinoblastoma protein family members, pRb and p 130 are increasingly phosphorylated following ischemic stresses. Importantly, p 130 and E 2 F 4 proteins are drastically reduced following ischemic insults. Additionally, E 2 F 1 association with promoters of pro-apoptotic genes are induced while that of E 2 F 4 is reduced. These changes appear to be important determinants in ischemic neuronal death. Cumulatively, the data supports the activation of the cell cycle machinery as a pathogenic signal contributing to ischemic neuronal death. The development of neuroprotectant strategies for stroke has been hampered in part by its complex pathophysiology. Previous research indicated that flavopiridol, a general CDK-inhibitor, is unable to provide sustained neuroprotection beyond one week following cerebral ischemia. The potential benefit of combining flavopiridol with another neuroprotectant, minocycline, was explored. The data indicate that while this approach provided histological protection 10 weeks after insult, the protected neurons are not functional due to progressive dendritic degeneration. This evidence indicates that targeting cell cycle pathways in stroke while important must be combined with other therapeutic modalities to fully treat stroke-induced damage...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Using {{the method}} of lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) assay, to observe the activities of rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) intervened by Tongluo Jiunao Injection (TLJNI), a traditional Chinese compound drug removing toxin to dredge brain collaterals, and then further {{study the effects of}} different kinds of conditioned mediums (CMECs-CM) of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells on ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion cerebral cortex cells, and to probe into the drug pharmacological mechanisms of CMECs in modulating the neurons. Methods: Three kinds of CMECs (normal, ischemic and ischemic/reperfusional) were all treated by TLJNI previously, and then the three pairs of CMECs-CM without serum were collected respectively for LDH assay. Rat cerebral cortex neurons were also primarily cultured and then divided into similar three groups (normal, ischemic and ischemic/reperfusional). The neuron responses caused by CMECs-CM at different concentrations were observed by using LDH transudation rate assay. Results: The LDH release values of ischemic and ischemic/reperfusional CMECs with TLJNI treatment were obviously reduced (P＜ 0. 01) compared with the same kinds of CMECs untreated. For <b>ischemic</b> <b>neurons,</b> both conditioned medium of ischemic CMECs (Is-CM) and conditioned medium of ischemic CMECs with drug treatment (IsT-CM) in high concentration of 100 % increased the LDH transudation rate (P＜ 0. 01), while in low concentration of 10 %, IsT-CM reduced the transudation rate (P＜ 0. 05). For ischemia/reperfusion neurons, all kinds of CMECs-CM reduced the transudation rate respectively (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). As far as each group concentration was concerned, 10 % or 50 % showed relatively stronger effects, and both conditioned medium of normal CMECs (N-CM) group and conditioned medium of ischemic/reperfusional CMECs (Rp-CM) group had statistical significance (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). For normal neurons, all kinds of CMECs-CM increased the transudation rate respectively (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). As far as each group concentration was concerned, only conditioned medium of normal CMECs (N-CM) had statistical significance (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). Conclusion: The study shows that TLJNI is capable of preventing the damage of CMECs from both ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion states. Chinese drug can restrain the brain ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion damage by the media that CMECs modulate the neurons, demonstrating the pharmacological mechanisms of TLJNI. This work also indicates that there exist some active substances against ischemia/reperfusion injury secreted from CMECs-CM with TLJNI treatmen...|$|R
