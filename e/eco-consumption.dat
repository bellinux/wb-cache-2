40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{discussion}} is to examine the new trends observed in consumer behaviour of today’s households around the world. This article contains a purely theoretical analysis of the new trends. Its structure is as follows: after explaining the concept of a consumption trend and its main characteristics, the further part of this text analyses the key “new” or “alternative” consumer trends, such as: deconsumption, <b>eco-consumption,</b> conscious consumption, collaborative consumption, freeganism, prosumption, smart shopping and cocooning, followed by a conclusion.

40|$|Consumption {{has again}} become {{the object of}} {{critical}} political attention in France {{over the last few}} years. Despite obvious links with the global project to promote “sustainable consumption,” this renewal of interest has had little connection with Agenda 21. Among the factors responsible for this situation, the poor integration of environmental issues in French political culture seems to be of primary importance. While the country has made some recent progress, historical analyses highlight the fragmented style of environmental management in France. These circumstances, in turn, have contributed to the slow uptake of “sustainable development” and have been a major impediment in the implementation of successful <b>eco-consumption</b> policies. However, if the ultimate goal of “sustainable consumption” is to transcend contemporary ways of acquiring goods and to move toward a reassessment of the values underlying them, then several developments in France become directly relevant. Indeed, if the country does not qualify as a leader in conventional <b>eco-consumption</b> policies, it has begun to evince self-reflexivity regarding some basic consumption practices. This article considers three especially notable developments: (1) the implementation of innovative employment policies such as the 35 -hour work week; (2) the revival of the country’s anti-consumerism movement; and (3) the adoption of confrontational positions on culture and agriculture during international trade negotiations. Taken in the round, these trends suggest the emergence of a nationwide exercise in “discriminating consumerism” and a move away from an unquestioned materialism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of porous materials based on geopolymers allows {{the benefits of}} <b>eco-consumption,</b> good insulating properties and good mechanical properties to be combined. For geopolymers to be useful, the {{development of}} an understanding of their properties under various conditions is important. Attention was given to the structural evolution of porous materials with heating. The structural evolutions were investigated using thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy. The formation of a crystalline phase was observed and identified as a zeolite. To elucidate the roles played by the raw materials, silicon concentration and potassium concentration on the formation of the crystalline phase, three parameters in the foam synthesis process were modified. The influence of silica fume and metakaolin on the appearance of the crystalline phase was examined through the reactivity of the raw materials in contact with a potassium solution. Different behaviors directly linked to the network composition were observed. Silica-fume-based samples showed phase crystallization and dehydroxylation due to the large concentration of silicon, which likely {{led to the formation of}} hydrated silica species. The formation of the zeolite-phase network upon the application of heat depended only on the silica dissolution and was linked to the composition of silica in terms of the silicon species and grain size. Studying the crystalline phase formation by variation of the amount of potassium allowed the determination of a maximum silicon concentration and a minimum potassium concentration. The formation of the zeolite phase occurred at a potassium concentration greater than 3. 5 mol*L - 1 and a silicon concentration lower than 16. 5 mol*L - 1, which confirmed the presence of F-zeolite...|$|E

However, in planning for sustainable urban development, implications of this increased diversity and possibly conflicting perspectives are seldom considered. The aim of this thesis is to explore dimensions of justice and politics in sustainable urban development by studying inclusionary/exclusionary effects of discursive power of official strategies for eco-friendly living {{on the one hand}} and everyday lifestyles on the other, in ethnically and socially diverse areas. Two case studies have been conducted, one in a city district of Stockholm, Sweden, and one in an area of Sheffield, England. The empirical material consists of interviews with residents, interviews with planners and officials and an analysis of strategic planning documents. The case study in Stockholm illustrated the prevalence of a dominant discourse among residents in which Swedishness is connected with environmental responsibility in the form of tidiness, recycling and familiarity with nature. In Sheffield there are more competing and parallel environmental discourses. The mainstream British environmental discourse and sustainability strategies are being criticised from Muslim as well as green radical perspectives. The mainstream discourse is criticised for being tokenistic in its focus on gardening, tidiness, recycling and <b>eco-consumption,</b> and hence ignoring deeper unsustainable societal structures. This can be interpreted as a postpolitical condition, in which there is a consensus around “what needs to be done,” such as more recycling, but in which difficult societal problems and conflicting perspectives on these are not highlighted. In the thesis it is argued that the strategies for urban sustainability are underpinned by Swedish/British middle-class norms, entailing processes of (self-) disciplining and normalisation of the Other into well-behaving citizens. It is argued that an appreciation of the multiple and others’ ways of saving natural resources would make the sustainability strategies more attuned to social and cultural diversity as well as more environmentally progressive. Finally, the importance of asserting the political in sustainability strategies is stressed, highlighting the organisation of society and possible alternative socioenvironmental futures.  QC 2010042...|$|E
