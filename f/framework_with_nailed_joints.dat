30|$|With {{the recent}} concern toward wood {{utilization}} in large-scale structures, increasing the strength performance of structural elements is important. Developing structural elements using board materials {{is one of}} the measures to increase the strength performance. A high-performance <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> to resist shear loading is necessary to increase the strength performance of wooden structural elements using board materials. This study was conducted {{in order to understand the}} shear properties of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> intended for large-scale structures. Shear tests were conducted <b>with</b> <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> using structural plywood, medium density fiberboard, or particleboard. The yield resistance was determined from experimental load-slip displacement curves, and was also calculated using European yield theory (EYT). Consequently, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens using MDF showed an experimental yield resistance higher than those using structural sugi plywood. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens using PB also showed a high value similar to that of the joints using structural karamatsu plywood. The yield resistance of most of the joint specimen series calculated using European yield theory showed slightly higher values than the experimental yield resistance. This study observed the deformation behavior around nail the head under shear loading. No deformation was observed from the appearance at the initial region of the test. The nail head started a rotational deformation when the joint started yielding. Moreover, the side panel became partially embedded. The nail head was completely embedded at the maximum load of the specimen. Nail pull-out from the base material was not remarkably evident. This deformation behavior was observed in all the board materials used in this study.|$|R
30|$|Plywood-sheathed {{structural}} diaphragms <b>with</b> <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> {{are commonly}} used {{in the construction of}} light wooden frames or other types of structures. Past {{studies have shown that the}} in-plane shear resistance performance of the diaphragms is mainly dominated by the shear performance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> [1 – 4]. The embedment behavior of wood by a nail is an important characteristic that strongly influences the shear performance of the joints. This characteristic has been used to analyze or predict shear performances on the basis of European Yield Theory [5, 6], elastic foundation model [7 – 12], and finite element method [13 – 15]. Therefore, the embedment behavior of wood and wood-based materials by a nail must be clarified. The embedment behaviors of various types of wooden materials by dowel-type fasteners have been investigated under different loading conditions. For example, Chui and Ni [16] conducted embedment tests on spruce, maple, and plywood specimens under reversed cyclic load. Jeon and Kong [17] evaluated the embedment behavior of glulam specimens made of Japanese cedar by ash pegs. Bal [18] investigated the characteristics of plywood reinforced with glass fiber fabric. Sawata and Sasaki [19] evaluated the embedment properties of decay-treated solid wood specimen.|$|R
30|$|Plywood is a wood-based panel {{material}} {{produced by}} alternately laminating veneers with parallel and perpendicular grain directions. The grain direction of each veneer may affect embedment behavior in plywood–solid wood <b>nail</b> <b>joints.</b> On the shear performance of plywood–solid wood <b>nailed</b> <b>joints,</b> {{the effect of}} the grain direction of plywood has been investigated under single-shear loading. Stewart [22] conducted a single-shear test <b>with</b> <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens. He prepared two types of plywood joint specimens. In the joint specimes, the plywood was attached to become that the grain direction of surface veneer were parallel or perpendicular to the load direction. The load–deformation curves of the two types of specimens were not considerably different. Harada et al. [23] conducted the tests with similar types of specimen and reported no large difference in maximum load. However, the deformation at maximum load in the case of plywood with perpendicular grain of the surface veneer was higher than that of parallel grain. Meanwhile, Demirkir and Colakoglu [24] reported that stiffness was higher when the surface direction of plywood was parallel to the loading direction than when the surface direction of plywood was perpendicular to the loading direction. Hagiwara [25] reported no difference in shear performance between the parallel and perpendicular grain directions of plywood. However, when the angle between the grain and load directions was 30 °, 45 ° or 60 °, resistance performance decreased under a small load range.|$|R
30|$|Shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> in wood that were loaded perpendicular to the grain; these joints had 21 specifications depending on different combinations of wood species, nail dimensions, number of nails, and edge distances of the main members, and their effects on the shear resistance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were also investigated. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> CN 75 <b>nails</b> had higher initial stiffness than the <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> CN 50 <b>nails,</b> provided the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected <b>with</b> 3 or 5 nails was not always a simple product {{of the number of}} nails and the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected <b>with</b> a <b>nail,</b> and instead depended on the combination of wood species of the main member and nail dimensions. When the edge distance decreased, the maximum load and energy capacity decreased, thereby affecting the energy capacity. The maximum load of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> CN 75 <b>nails</b> may be smaller than those <b>with</b> CN 50 <b>nails</b> depending on the combination of wood species and nail dimensions. When the edge distance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> was less than 26  mm, the energy capacity of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> CN 75 <b>nails</b> was less than or similar to those <b>with</b> CN 50 <b>nails.</b>|$|R

40|$|Single shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>nailed</b> timber <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> varying main member thickness, side member thickness and nail length projecting from the main member, and their effects on various shear performances of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were investigated. Initial stiffness and yield load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were almost constant when the ratio of main member thickness to nail diameter (lm/d) was 7 - 14 and 10 - 14, respectively.

Maximum load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> lm/d of 9 was 36 % lower than that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> lm/d of 13 - 17. Energy capacity of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> lm/d of 9 was 58 % lower than that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> lm/d of 13 - 15. Regardless of nail length projecting from the main member (lnp), initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> lnp was close to that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without lnp.

The maximum load of nail-head pull-through and the maximum load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were little affected by the density profile. However, the ultimate strength of lateral nail resistance, the stiffness, and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were affected by the density profile of MDF and showed high values when the surface layer of the MDF had high density.

30|$|<b>Nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used joints in wooden houses, and they show shear resistance to lateral force. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> under lateral force are designed to avoid the brittle failure of wood while designing timber joints. It is known that split failures in <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded perpendicular to the grain are affected by less thick wood, less spacing between nails, less edge and end distances, and wood species. The standard for structural design of timber structures—edited by Architectural Institute of Japan [1]—specifies that edge and end distances and spacing of nails must be equal to or greater than the minimum required for the design of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints.</b> In this standard, the allowable shear strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without split failure of members is exhibited, and the same values regardless of loading direction to the grain are shown. Although <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> sufficient edge and end distances are preferable, it is difficult to always ensure this during the actual constructions of wooden houses. Because the width of the common frame members used in wooden houses are substantially fixed, less edge distance is often observed in the actual panel–frame joints. Therefore, it is important to accumulate the data regarding the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> failed by split of members under lateral force if consideration is given to the nailing conditions in the actual construction of wooden houses.|$|R
30|$|In wooden light frame constructions, floors {{consist of}} joists and floor sheathings of plywood or other sheet {{materials}} {{fastened to the}} joists generally <b>with</b> CN 50 <b>nails</b> according to JIS A 5508. Shear walls are fastened to these floors generally <b>with</b> CN 90 <b>nails</b> according to JIS A 5508 at their bottom plates [1, 2], where the bottom plates of the shear walls are fastened to the joists <b>with</b> CN 90 <b>nails</b> through the floor sheathings fastened to the joists <b>with</b> CN 50 <b>nails</b> themselves. In this structural system, the lateral forces applied to the shear walls are partially transmitted from the bottom plates to the joists directly via CN 90 nails, and the remained lateral forces are transmitted through the <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> CN 50 <b>nails</b> between the floor sheathings and the joists. The current design standard of timber structures [3] does not provide the allowable lateral resistance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> in this combined system. Structural designers, therefore, cannot determine the working resistance for arbitrary combinations of materials and nails. Some studies [4 – 6] showed the models to calculate the lateral resistance of joints with interlayer, which were connected <b>with</b> <b>nails</b> or a dowel. However, those models assumed no connection or rigid connection between the interlayer and timber. It is then {{need to understand the}} actual behavior of the joints with interlayer slips for practical design of the joints considered in this study. The evaluation of allowable working resistance of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> of various combinations has also become demanded for developing various construction systems including prefabrication of structural or non-structural components. An example of demand may be the installation of external thermal-insulation components that are expected to have structural resistance too [7], which is practical for one-stroke repair of thermal-insulation and earthquake-proof reinforcement.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 <b>Nailed</b> <b>joints</b> between {{sheathing}} and framing in light-frame wood buildings play a {{vital role}} in assuring structural safety by providing the stiffness needed to transfer the forces among the building components and the medium of energy dissipation during severe earthquakes and wind storms. However, the exact nature of load transfer and energy dissipation in <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> has not been characterized. This investigation was aimed at theoretically and experimentally characterizing the dynamic behavior of typical <b>nailed</b> <b>joints.</b> The theoretical evaluation combined the linear step-by-step analysis and the concept of beam-on-elastic-foundation to model the nonlinear behavior of joints with interlayer gaps. The effect of damping was included by postulating a model with springs and dashpots and then using, experimental data to demonstrate its accuracy. Pseudo-dynamic tests were conducted on four twenty-specimen samples that were matched with respect to their material properties. The samples were tested to determine the nail bearing for wood and plywood, and the behavior of complete joints and <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> gaps. The <b>nail</b> bearing properties were used to formulate a mechanism for stiffness and slip due to wood and plywood crushing which was then verified by comparing its predictions to the results from testing joints with gap. A sensitivity study based on the complete-joint model shows that the slip modulus has the greatest effect on the joint damping. Both, the dissipated and slip work were found to decrease with increasing slip modulus. The rate of decrease is significant at law loads for the submodel of interlayer friction, but not as substantial at high loads. The variation of the slip modulus in wood and plywood affects the rate of decrease the most at high loads. The experimental results show that the traditionally defined equivalent viscous damping significantly underestimates the damping of tight <b>nailed</b> <b>joints,</b> because the assumption of linearity overestimates the slip work. However, for specimens with gap under small loads, the assumption of linear damping results in an accurate damping ratio...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{dynamic tests}} of <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are {{conducted}} under a band-limited white-noise wave using a uniaxial hydraulic shaking table. The principal results are as follows: dynamic responses of <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> under a band-limited white-noise wave are reasonably {{related to the}} static load-slip relationships and the dynamic responses under harmonic waves of them. When <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are shaken under a composite wave of wide frequency range, they resonate transitionally {{with one of the}} frequency components one after another decreasing their equivalent resonant frequencies along their static load-slip curves. <b>Nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are in danger of ultimate failures even though the input maximum accelerations do not exceed their damage limits, if they are shaken for long times with or without intermittences. In this case, <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are prone to fail in low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of <b>nails.</b> <b>Nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints,</b> on the other hand, are prone to fail in typical static failure modes when they are shaken under strong input maximum accelerations equivalent to their ultimate limits.|$|R
30|$|The {{general view}} of the test results {{indicates}} that <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are likely damaged by the frequency components of seismic waves close to their higher resonant frequencies below the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance. However, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are ultimately broken by the lower frequency components of seismic waves, to which damaged joints with degraded stiffness resonate. The transition of the responsive behavior of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> affects the seismic resistance of entire structures. If the principal frequency components of seismic waves {{are close to the}} resonant frequencies after cyclic stiffness degradation of the nailed structural elements, structures are prone to collapse readily under strong earthquakes. If the principal frequency components of seismic waves are close to their resonant frequencies below the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance, on the other hand, the structures are initially prone to be damaged, but the resultant stiffness degradation may enable the structures to survive strong earthquakes. This discussion leads to an important conclusion that structural engineers should distinguish between principal frequency components dominant to the ultimate or safety-limit resistance and those dominant to the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance [12].|$|R

The dynamic response of <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> is clearly dependent upon both the input frequency and the acceleration. These responsive characteristics {{arise from the}} nonlinear load–slip relationships and the characteristic cyclic stiffness degradation of nailed joints; that is, the cyclic degradation of the equivalent linear stiffness decreases the resonant frequencies of the same joints, which results in a transition of dynamic responses. It indicates that frequency components of seismic waves resonant to the frequencies corresponding to safety-limit stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> may lead them to critical failures, even if the accelerations do not exceed the accelerations equivalent to the static damage-limit resistance.|$|R
