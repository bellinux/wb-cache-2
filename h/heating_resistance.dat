Recently, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and gene expression profiling approaches have been used for detecting candidate genes for <b>heat</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, the resolution of QTL mapping is not high enough to examine the individual effects of various genes in each QTL. Heat stress-responsive genes, characterized by gene expression profiling studies, are not necessarily responsible for <b>heat</b> <b>resistance.</b> Some of these genes may be regulated in association with the heat stress response of other genes. Results To evaluate which heat-responsive genes are potential candidates for <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> with higher resolution than previous QTL mapping studies, we performed genome-wide deficiency screen for QTL for <b>heat</b> <b>resistance.</b> We screened 439 isogenic deficiency strains from the DrosDel project, covering 65. 6 % of the Drosophila melanogaster genome in order to map QTL for thermal resistance.

Another group of genes up-regulated in selected flies is characterized by also responding to heat shock treatment several hours after peak induction of known Hsps revert to nonstress levels. These findings suggest phototransduction genes to be critically involved in <b>heat</b> <b>resistance,</b> and support a role for components of the phototransduction process in stress-sensing mechanisms.

For clothing vapour resistance, few data were available so far. Indices for vapour permeability (im) and reduction factors for vapour transfer (Fpcl) of clothing were used instead, using a relation between <b>heat</b> and vapour <b>resistance</b> to derive the clothing vapour resistance from the value for clothing <b>heat</b> <b>resistance.</b> This paper reviews the two commonly used approaches (im and Fpcl), as well as five alternative approaches to the problem. The dierent approaches were evaluated for their accuracy and their usability. The present paper shows that the currently used relations are not adequate when the wearer of the clothing starts moving, or is exposed to wind. Alternative approaches are shown to improve the determination of dynamic clothing vapour resistance, though some are thought to be too complex. An empirical description of the relation between the clothing permeability index (im) and the changes in clothing <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> due to wind and movement was selected as the most promising method for deriving clothing vapour resistance.

Different solutions exist to manage this organic waste, for instance local and centralized composting, anaerobic digestion, or co-incineration with municipal waste. Except for local composting, theses methods need to collect and transport food waste to be processed, which mean transporting a lot of water. The Life Cycle in Practice (LCiP) (LIFE 12 ENV/FR/ 001113) project helps SMEs to reduce the environmental impacts of their products and services across the entire life cycle. Within the frame of this project, the environmental impact of the Eco-Cleaner system is evaluated with the standardized life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Eco-Cleaner (EC) is a stand alone accelerated system that can transform food waste in valuable compost in only 24 hours. It is designed by Biowaste Recycling ([URL] It can be declined in different capacities, from family size (about 1 - 2 kg/days of food waste) to large communities of 1300 place settings (up to 700 kg/days). EC technology is based on a permanent control of the ratio of humidity and temperature to optimize fermentation rate of food waste by a special consortium of more than thirty thermophilic bacteria. Waste reduction is about 90 % and compost is sanitized to ensure the destruction of active parasites, insect eggs and germs. EC compost is dry (80 - 90 % siccity level), and it has a quite high nitrogen content (about 3 - 4 % on dry matter) and is rich in organic matter. Thanks to an activated carbon filter (replaced every two years), it is odourless and has no noxious gas emission. Since it's dry, this compost can be stored without further degradation, and its transport has a reduced environmental cost. The functional unit is the composting of one ton of food waste. The inventory includes the machine itself, its use, its refitting every twelve years, and its end of life. Refurbishing includes mainly the replacement of the motor, the <b>heating</b> <b>resistance,</b> the plastic parts, the seals, and only 5 % of metals. Avoided chemical fertilizers consecutive to compost application are considered as system expansion, and it induces negative impact values in all categories.

Abiotic depletion is highly impacted due to the metals the EC is made of (92 % of total weight, principally steel), but a large improvement is achieved by the quadruplicating of the life span because of refurbishing, and the recycling of metals at the end of life.

40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> and ultrastructural {{features}} of spore suspensions prepared from Clostridium thermocellum LQRI, Clostridium thermosulfurogenes 4 B, and Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum 39 E were compared {{as a function}} of decimal reduction time. The decimal reduction times at 121 degrees C for strains LQRI, 4 B, and 39 E were 0. 5, 2. 5, and 11 min. The higher degree of spore <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> was associated with a spore architecture displaying a thicker cortex layer. <b>Heat</b> <b>resistance</b> of these spores was proportional to the ratio of spore cortex volume to cytoplasmic volume. These ratios for spores of strains LQRI, 4 B, and 39 E were 1. 4, 1. 6, and 6. 6, respectively. The extreme <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> and autoclavable nature of C. thermohydrosulfuricum spores under routine sterilization procedures is suggested as a common cause of laboratory contamination with pure cultures of thermophilic, saccharide-fermenting anaerobes...|$|R

40|$|Cold {{shock and}} ethanol and {{puromycin}} stress responses in sporulating Bacillus subtilis cells have been investigated. We {{show that a}} total of 13 proteins are strongly induced after a short cold shock treatment of sporulating cells. The cold shock pretreatment affected the <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> of the spores formed subsequently, with spores heat killed at 85 or 90 °C being more heat resistant than the control spores while they were more heat sensitive than controls that were heat treated at 95 or 100 °C. However, B. subtilis spores with mutations in the main cold shock proteins, CspB, -C, and -D, did not display decreased <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to controls, indicating that these proteins are not directly responsible for the increased <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> of the spores. The disappearance of the stress proteins later in sporulation suggests that they cannot be involved in repairing heat damage during spore germination and outgrowth but must alter spore structure {{in a way which}} increases or decreases <b>heat</b> <b>resistance.</b> Since <b>heat,</b> ethanol, and puromycin stress produce similar proteins and similar changes in spore <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> while cold shock is different in both respects, these alterations appear to be very specific...|$|R
