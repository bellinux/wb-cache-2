40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and oestradiol (E) as biological markers in response to illegal administration of testosterone, 19 -nortestosterone (N) and oestradiol, either alone or in combination. Twenty male Friesian calves (age 13 - 14 months) were allotted to a control group (n = 5), and five experimental groups (n = 3) each. Each experimental animal was repeatedly injected with one of the following hormonal treatments: E, T, N, T+E and N+E. Circulating DHEA, T, DHT and E were determined by radioimmunoassay. The administration of T alone did not induce any variation in plasma DHEA, T, DHT and E, which were similar to those in the control group. In contrast, DHEA, T and DHT were on average significantly lower in the T+E and N-treated groups (p < 0. 01), whereas the administration of N+E resulted in the reduction of plasma T and DHT without any modification of plasma DHEA. The administration of E alone or in combination increased circulating levels of E but did not affect androgen plasma profiles. The results indicate that plasma levels of T do not permit detection of <b>illegal</b> <b>treatments</b> because plasma androgens always remained within the physiological range. <b>Illegal</b> E <b>treatment</b> could be detected in blood samples when they were collected at least every 20 days...|$|R

Moreover, anonymous QC samples were sent to be analysed to some Italian laboratories. All kits showed a fair degree of parallelism (P 10 %. Moreover, the laboratories participating in the EQC produced statistically different (P < 0. 05) results, particularly for high and medium concentrations.

The microscopic analysis of thymus showed lymphoid depletion and cortical atrophy: the lesions were severe and diffuse in group D and attenuated in group E. Lymphnodes was not specifically affected by treatments. The study has increased the data as reference for the control of <b>illegal</b> <b>treatments</b> in beef bovine: it has permitted to confirm the correlation between lesions and administration of corticosteroids, but especially to notice the modulating action on thymus lesions due to interaction with oestrogens.

40|$|The {{olive oil}} market is {{suffering}} from sophisticated <b>illegal</b> <b>treatments.</b> One common adulteration process consists of the addition to virgin olive oil of lower quality oils, such as “lampante” oil, an inexpensive oil and with some organoleptic defects, which is then submitted to thermal deodorization under vacuum processes for removal of the undesired flavor components. Such a blending {{may not have a}} huge influence on the chemical composition and may not significantly affect the parameters usually checked as quality indicators, although the organoleptic properties may change. As a consequence, a major effort is being devoted to find reliable markers able to unmask such adulterations.

5000|$|A {{few days}} after I'll Have Another won the 2012 Derby, New York Times writers Joe Drape and Walt Bogdanich ran a story {{discussing}} O'Neill's extensive history of medication violations. It ran {{on the front page}} of the paper. Additional criticism came from other quarters, including Frank Deford of NPR, who expressed his view that both O'Neill and the owner of I'll Have Another did not deserve to win the Belmont, describing O'Neill as [...] "a charming enough character, but a drug cheat nonetheless." [...] Due to the reports of multiple medication violations, O'Neill had been nicknamed [...] "'Drug' O'Neill." [...] However, some industry experts, such as Andrew Beyer of the Washington Post, felt that O'Neill was a skilled trainer who had made some mistakes but had been [...] "maligned." [...] Taking a middle ground, Bill Dwyre of the Los Angeles Times viewed O'Neill's violations as a [...] "misdemeanor." [...] Bogdanich found that O'Neill had 15 medication drug violations during his career and had [...] "milkshaked" [...] horses—an <b>illegal</b> <b>treatment</b> for fatigue that involves inserting a tube down a horse's esophagus to administer a mixture of substances. In a 2012 interview with NPR, Bogdanich criticized a lack of enforcement of drug rules in American horse racing, noting that although O'Neill faced a 180-day suspension for milkshaking, any punishment imposed upon him have would little impact on his livelihood: [...] "He could turn it over to his assistants, his stable, and never miss a beat. The horses keep running. If they win, they keep getting their purses. You know, that's what America lacks that the rest of the world has. They have law and order." [...] In October 2012, the Los Angeles Times ran a story on O'Neill's gregariousness and kindness to others, suggesting that jealousy motivated his detractors.|$|E
5000|$|On December 4, 1901, Pilipo Mikila and Kalani, {{left the}} Kalaupapa Hansen's Disease Settlement in {{violation}} of the regulations of the Board of Health. The local police captain, believing that they had been stealing sheep, arrested them on their return to Kalaupapa and put them in jail. Kalani made a confession and was put in a light airy cell. Mikila denied guilt and as a punishment, was put in a cell with no outside window, comparatively dark and poorly ventilated. Until March 12, 1902, he was not arraigned on any charge and no written accusation was made against him. He was in an advanced state of Hansen's disease when arrested and grew even worse during his detainment. On the aforementioned date, he was taken home by the members of a society to which he belonged. He died six days later. He had no proper care before leaving the jail, and no medical attention. Complaints were made about this heartless and <b>illegal</b> <b>treatment</b> to the Attorney-General and after an investigation, C. W. Reynolds, the superintendent of the settlement, and Dr. Oliver, the local physician were discharged for official neglect. It was a surprise to the public that at the same meeting of the Board of Health where these actions were taken, it was similarly resolved that [...] "the harmony and interests of the leper settlement would be promoted by the removal of Father Wendelin Moeller (the priest in charge of Kalaupapa since Father Damien's death) and that the Right Reverend Gulstan, Bishop of Panopolis, be requested to remove him forthwith and appoint some other priest to fill the vacancy made thereby." [...] Msgr. Ropert subsequently informed the Board he would comply with their resolution when formal written charges against Father Wendelin had been served and proven. The Board refused to file charges, but informed the Msgr. Ropert that Father Wendelin's permit to remain at the settlement would be revoked as of June 10, 1902. It was later disclosed that Superintendent Reynolds had filed complaints with the Board accusing Father Wendelin of interfering with his management; Father Wendelin admitted having preached, not against the Board of Health, but against the shameful immorality of concubinage and adultery at the settlement, and the performance of public work to be done on Sunday without any urgent necessity. After considerable public outrage at the actions of the Board of Health by the Home Rule Party, the various Catholic societies, the Portuguese societies, the Protestant Ministerial Union, the Board of Health resolved [...] "out of respect for the Bishop and in appreciation of the charitable objects of the Catholic mission at the settlement, this request (by Msgr. Ropert to retain Father Wendelin in view of his long and faithful services at the Kalaupapa Settlement) be granted on the distinct understanding that Father Wendelin attend strictly to his clerical duties in the future..." [...] Father Wendelin, appreciative of Msgr. Ropert's efforts opined that he could not [...] "strictly adhere to his clerical duties" [...] without preaching against immorality and the breaking of the Sabbath, and requested that Msgr. Ropert relieve him of his charge. On September 23, 1902, Msgr. Ropert granted Father Wendelin's request and replaced him with Father Maximin André, head of the Hilo mission.|$|E
40|$|Background: In view of {{the current}} {{economic}} crisis and the resulting austerity measures being implemented by governments across Europe, public expenditure for substance abuse treatment has increasingly become a subject of discussion. An EU cross-country comparison would allow an estimation of {{the total amount of}} public resources spent on substance abuse treatment, compare various substance abuse treatment funding options, and evaluate the division of expenditures between alcohol and illegal drugs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate the public spending of EU countries for alcohol and <b>illegal</b> drug abuse <b>treatment</b> in hospitals. Methods: Our study uses a uniform methodology in order to enable valid cross-national comparisons. Our data are drawn from the Eurostat database, which provides anno 2010 data on government spending for the <b>treatment</b> of <b>illegal</b> drug and alcohol abuse in 21 EU member states. The cross-country comparison is restricted to hospitals, since data were unavailable for other types of treatment providers. The systematic registration of in- and outpatient data is essential to monitoring public expenditures on substance abuse treatment using international databases. Results: Total public spending for hospital-based <b>treatment</b> of <b>illegal</b> drug and alcohol abuse in the 21 EU member states studied is estimated to be 7. 6 billion euros. Per capita expenditures for <b>treatment</b> of <b>illegal</b> drug abuse vary, ranging from 0. 1 euros in Romania to 13 euros in Sweden. For alcohol abuse, that figure varied from 0. 9 euros in Bulgaria to 24 euros in Austria. These results confirm other studies indicating that public expenditures for alcohol treatment exceed that for <b>illegal</b> drug <b>treatment.</b> Conclusions: Multiple factors may influence the number of hospital days for alcohol or <b>illegal</b> substance abuse <b>treatment,</b> and expenditures fluctuate accordingly. In this respect, we found a strong correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and public expenditures per hospital day. The prevalence of problematic (illegal or legal) drug use in a country did not correlate significantly with the number of hospital days. Other factors must be included in the analysis of public expenditures for the treatment of substance abuse, such as the drug policy in a given country and the social norms regarding alcohol consumption...|$|R
5000|$|The {{disparate}} {{impact theory}} of liability is controversial for several reasons. First, it labels certain unintended effects as [...] "discriminatory," [...] although discrimination {{is not an}} intentional act. Second, the theory is in tension with disparate treatment provisions under civil rights laws {{as well as the}} U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. For example, if the hypothetical fire department discussed above used the 100-pound requirement, that policy might disproportionately exclude female job applicants from employment. Under the 80% rule mentioned above, unsuccessful female job applicants would have a prima facie case of disparate impact [...] "discrimination" [...] against the department if they passed the 100-pound test at a rate less than 80% of the rate at which men passed the test. In order to avoid a lawsuit by the female job applicants, the department might refuse to hire anyone from its applicant pool—in other words, the department may refuse to hire anyone because too many of the successful job applicants were male. Thus, the employer would have intentionally discriminated against the successful male job applicants because of their gender, and that likely amounts to <b>illegal</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> and a violation of the Constitution's right to equal protection. In the 2009 case Ricci v. DeStefano, the U.S. Supreme Court did rule that a fire department committed <b>illegal</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> by refusing to promote white firefighters, in an effort to avoid disparate impact liability in a potential lawsuit by black and Hispanic firefighters who disproportionately failed the required tests for promotion. Although the Court in that case did not reach the constitutional issue, Justice Scalia's concurring opinion suggested the fire department also violated the constitutional right to equal protection. Even before Ricci, lower federal courts have ruled that actions taken to avoid potential disparate impact liability violate the constitutional right to equal protection. One such case is Biondo v. City of Chicago, Illinois, from the Seventh Circuit.|$|R

40|$|Targeted protein {{biomarker}} profiling {{is suggested}} as a fast screening approach for detection of <b>illegal</b> hormone <b>treatment</b> in meat production. The advantage of using biomarkers {{is that they}} mark the biological response and, thus, are responsive to a panel of substances with similar effects. In a preliminary feasibility study, a 4 -plex protein biomarker flow cytometric immunoassay (FCIA) previously developed {{for the detection of}} recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) was applied to cattle treated with steroids, such as estradiol, dexamethasone, and prednisolone. Each treatment resulted in a specific plasma biomarker profile for insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), IGF binding protein 2, osteocalcin, and anti-rbST antibodies, which could be distinguished from the profile of untreated animals. In summary, the 4 -plex biomarker FCIA is, apart from rbST, also capable of detecting treatment with other growth-promoting agents and therefore clearly shows the potential of biomarker profiling as a screening method in veterinary control. It is proposed to perform additional validation studies covering high numbers of treated and untreated animals to support inclusion or adaptation of protein biomarker approaches in future monitoring regulations...|$|R
