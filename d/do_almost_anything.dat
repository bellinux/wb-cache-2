You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber?

25|$|The third tale, Guardian of the Solar System, {{finds the}} house and Sara finally separating. She trades places with a man named Robert, to whom she had told stories and granted wishes for many years. The trade, Robert's final wish, gives him the ability to <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything,</b> {{although}} it necessitates sacrificing his body. Sara is suddenly reborn in {{a new version of}} her original body, albeit slightly older and with a thousand years of memories. However, she has no idea what happened to the real Sara after she left the house. This new Sara feels lost in this new world, so Robert grants her final wish. The TARDIS materializes in front of her; inside it, the Doctor (implied to be an incarnation other than the first) wonders what force dragged it down to Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Political analyst David Taras of Mount Royal University {{argued that}} {{although}} Klein was popular, he failed at public policy. His focus on paying down Alberta's fiscal debt during an oil boom - {{a time when}} interest rates on debt were low - was done [...] "at the expense of hospitals, roads, light rail transit lines, and investing in better health-care services or education." [...] Rich Vivone, {{who was involved in}} Alberta politics from 1980-2005, claimed Klein [...] "had the trust and popularity to <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything</b> he wanted and survive" [...] and his [...] "fiscal achievements early in his career were significant, but he [...] "utterly failed at health reform and economic diversification" [...] and he did [...] "little for culture, recreation or the arts." ...|$|E
2500|$|A highly skilful winger, {{considered}} by several pundits {{to be one}} of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport, Best received plaudits for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders. Recalling Best's career and style of play, Patrick Barclay said: [...] "In terms of ability he was the world’s best footballer of all time. He could <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything</b> – technically, speed, complete mastery of not only the ball but his own body. You could saw his legs away and he still wouldn’t fall because his balance was uncanny, almost supernatural. Heading ability, passing ability, I mean it goes without saying the dribbling – he could beat anybody in any way he chose. For fun he’d play a one-two off the opponent’s shins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gorgonzola (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green rat {{apprentice}} candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder {{having a}} better job than him. He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since blue cheese {{was one of the few}} foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name [...] "gorgonzola" [...] for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green opossum or a green rat. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything</b> to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode Sniffleball. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.|$|E

A short while before, Gerald, toying with the idea of ending his sorrows by violence, had left Sally unmoved: but now her mind leapt back to what he had said, and apprehension succeeded indifference. There was no disputing the fact that Gerald was in an irresponsible mood, under the influence of which he was capable of <b>doing</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything.</b> Sally, listening in the doorway, felt a momentary panic.|$|R
2500|$|Comic Book Resources ranks Victor von Doom {{as their}} fourth {{favorite}} Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him {{being able to}} [...] "stand up against entities like Mephisto, the Beyonder, and Galactus and often comes out on top", {{as well as the}} tragedy of any [...] "other number of circumstances could have led to Doctor Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain.", a fact that later led to the character's redemption. Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his [...] "master of sorcery and technology an unusual combination", and also felt [...] "his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to Magneto." [...] Von Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying that Doom [...] "could come to the United States and he could <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything,</b> and we could not arrest him because he has diplomatic immunity. Also, he wants to rule the world and if you think about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.", that Doom technically isn't a villain. Mark Waid echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom [...] " [...] got a great look, a great visual design [...] a dynamite origin." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 July, in St. Petersburg, the German Ambassador von Pourtalès told Sazonov {{to reject}} Grey's {{offer of a}} summit in London, stating that the {{proposed}} conference was [...] "too unwieldy", and if Russia were serious about saving the peace, they would negotiate directly with the Austrians. Sazonov replied {{that he was willing}} to see Serbia accept almost all of the Austrian demands, and following von Pourtalès’s advice, rejected Grey's conference proposal in favour of direct talks with the Austrians. Von Pourtalès reported to Germany that Sazonov was being [...] "more conciliatory", seeking [...] "to find a bridge... to satisfy... Austrian demands" [...] and willing to <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything</b> to save the peace. At the same time, von Pourtalès warned that changes in the Balkan balance of power would be regarded as a highly unfriendly act by Russia. The following Austro-Russian talks were sabotaged by Austria's refusal to abandon any of the demands on Serbia As a preparatory move in case a war did break out, and Britain were to become involved, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the British Admiralty, ordered the British fleet not to disperse as planned, arguing that news of the British move might serve as a deterrent to war, and thus help persuade Germany to put pressure on Austria to abandon some of the more outrageous demands in their ultimatum. Grey stated that a compromise solution could be worked out if Germany and Britain were to work together. His approach generated opposition from British officials, who felt the Germans were dealing with the crisis in bad faith. Nicolson warned Grey that in his opinion [...] "Berlin is playing with us". Grey for his part, rejected Nicolson's assessment, and believed that Germany was interested in stopping a general war.|$|E

She had just begun to feel the need of an additional teacher, and should gladly receive Genevieve, provided she fulfilled certain requisites, of which, luckily, French pronunciation stood the foremost.

5000|$|Pauline Kael {{dismissed}} the film, citing its [...] "insinuating, hotted-up dialogue {{that it would}} be fun to hoot at if only the hushed, sleepwalking manner of the film didn't make you cringe or yawn". Ebert responded to Kael's negative review: Yes, Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat (1981) is aware of the films that inspired it—especially Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944). But it has a power that transcends its sources. It exploits the personal style of its stars to insinuate itself; Kael is unfair to Turner, who in her debut role played a woman so sexually confident that we can believe her lover (William Hurt) could be dazed into <b>doing</b> <b>almost</b> <b>anything</b> for her. The moment we believe that, the movie stops being an exercise and starts working.|$|R
