500|$|Soon after {{reaching}} , the fighter's DME (radio) showed MCAS El Toro was [...] away. The pilot of '458' then performed an aileron roll, a flight maneuver that rolled the aircraft 360° {{in order to}} allow the pilot to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lt. Schiess, the Radar Intercept Officer, was operating the fighter's radar, which was unable to detect any aircraft due to its deteriorated condition. Because of the stowed position of the scope, he had been leaning forward and looking downward at the instrument. Between three and ten seconds prior to the collision, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and observed the DC-9 in his peripheral vision and shouted a warning to the pilot. The pilot attempted an evasive roll but was unable to clear the oncoming airliner.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> hastily, and she {{answered}} the question in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{from his}} work to behold--none other than Colonel Comyn Carvel.|$|E
6000|$|BARBARA [looking at Bill, whose {{attitude}} has never changed, and whose expression of brooding wrath has deepened] Oh, we shall cure him in no time. Just watch. [She {{goes over to}} Bill and waits. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> at her and casts his eyes down again, uneasy, but grimmer than ever]. It {{would be nice to}} just stamp on Mog Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill? ...|$|R
50|$|A frail {{old woman}} is coming down. The camera {{gives us a}} brief close-up. “She carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.” O backs up and hurries down {{the steps to the}} right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> briefly to see where she is, then hides his head from view.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> kept <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at {{the height}} of the ceilings, the size of the rooms, taking in the size and {{proportion}} of the house, and the quality of the fittings.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> to Jacob Welse, {{as though}} for consent, and {{received}} it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at her abrupt pause, and she {{was looking}} at the house.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> meditatively and Fortune {{shook his}} head, {{inwardly}} chafing at the delay.|$|E
60|$|Daniel Hawkins {{had just}} come out to care for his horse. By sheer {{accident}} <b>he</b> had <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{at the window and}} beheld Leo in the act of dropping out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course, the astounding {{spectacle}} {{took the}} poor lad's breath away. He could only stare in stupid astonishment, and wonder how {{a single individual}} could possess such incredible riches. Then presently <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> brilliantly <b>up</b> and exclaimed: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} the video was this : Scatman walking through a car park at night, when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> the spirit of Armstrong appears. The pair agree to duet and the action {{switches}} to a New Orleans Mardi Gras street party. Armstrong and Scatman ride along the road in an open top limo whilst a marching band precedes them and various children dressed as Scatman dance around. There's also shots of John by various New Orleans Landmarks. The video ends {{back in the car}} park as Armstrong disappears.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at her, {{and their}} eyes met, nor could he turn his head away again.|$|E
60|$|Nikasti looked {{downwards}} at {{the dress}} coat {{which he was}} carrying. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at Von Schwerin.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and saw {{the second}} {{apprentice}} disappear with amazing swiftness from behind the goods in the window.|$|E
60|$|The bowman ceased rowing, and {{the crew}} {{followed}} his example, while <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> inquiringly <b>up</b> {{at the sky and}} round his limited horizon, as guides and seamen are wont to do when asked for an opinion as to professional movements.|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} Folkestone bus rumbled up, and he ascended. His aunt {{stood in the}} doorway to see him off. His uncle {{assisted}} with the box and portmanteau. Only furtively could <b>he</b> <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> at the Pornick windows, and still it seemed Ann hardened her heart against him. [...] "Get up!" [...] said the driver, and the hoofs began to clatter. No--she would not come out even to see him off. The bus was in motion, and old Kipps was going back into his shop. Kipps stared in front of him, assuring himself that he did not care.|$|R
60|$|As {{the word}} 'brotherly' passed {{through his mind}} {{in one of his}} reveries, <b>he</b> smiled, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at the picture of Mozart that was before him...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> reproachfully, {{caught the}} comic lift of her eyebrow just like their father's, laughed, and felt better.|$|E
60|$|Michael bristled, but {{permitted}} the first timid step. At the second <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at Daughtry to make certain.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence was}} prolonged. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{to find her}} {{watching}} him with a slight smile curving her lips.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{few minutes}} past that time when Miss Brown returned. Peter Ruff was sitting at his desk, looking {{as though he had}} never moved. He was absorbed by a book of {{patterns}} sent in by his new tailor, and <b>he</b> only <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> when she entered the room.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden {{had ridden}} over from home, {{and left his}} horse in the hotel stables. As he passed the hall a {{familiar}} figure standing in the open doorway hailed him. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> quickly <b>up,</b> and stopped short. It was Harcutt who was standing there, in a Norfolk tweed suit and thick boots.|$|R
60|$|As {{he stepped}} on the {{sidewalk}} in front of Trinity Church, which stands at the beginning of Wall Street, <b>he</b> happened to <b>glance</b> <b>up,</b> and not far away saw Hardwick.|$|R
60|$|He threw {{something}} on the counter, and the Jew started, despite himself, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up.</b> It was the sailor’s belt.|$|E
60|$|He {{listened intently}} {{for a second}} or so; no sound came from the inner room. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> towards the gallery.|$|E
60|$|And {{about half}} an hour {{afterwards}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> from his book to find his visitor fast asleep in his garden chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are wise to run up to town this morning," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at the grey skies. [...] "By-the-bye, if you dine at Curzon Street to-night, do ask Hedges to serve {{you some of the}} '99 Cliquot. A marvellous wine, as you doubtless know, Ledsam, but it should be drunk. Au revoir!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{passed out}} of the house and down the street. A wan delight came into his face at the sight of the lone tree. [...] "Jes' ain't goin' to do nothin'," [...] he said to himself, half aloud, in a crooning tone. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> wistfully <b>up</b> at the sky, but the bright sun dazzled and blinded him.|$|R
6000|$|... "What d'ye think now, Captain Meadows?" [...] <b>he</b> asked presently, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at his {{superior}} officer. [...] "Didn't I warn you {{what would be}} the upshot of having those niggers on board the Belinda?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at {{her from}} the ground, almost as darkly as he had looked at Tom Pinch; but held his peace.|$|E
60|$|He {{spread his}} hands, deprecating, not understanding. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{the stairs and}} along the {{corridor}} again, and downstairs into the hall.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{again at}} Lady Harman. (She was {{standing}} behind Mr. Brumley {{so that he could}} not see her but--did their eyes meet?) ...|$|E
60|$|Sheldon obeyed her instructions, rushed hot-water bottles {{along to}} her, {{and then sat}} on the veranda vainly trying to {{interest}} himself in a two- months-old file of Sydney newspapers. <b>He</b> kept <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> and across the compound to the grass house. Yes, he decided, the contention of every white man in the islands was right; the Solomons {{was no place for}} a woman.|$|R
6000|$|Peter Sherikov {{studied the}} {{variable}} {{man for a}} moment before he answered. [...] "Where? I'm taking you to my labs. Under the Urals." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> suddenly <b>up</b> at the sky. [...] "We better hurry. The Security police will be starting their demolition attack in a few hours. We want to be a long way from here when that begins." ...|$|R
50|$|Fitzgerald is understandably {{nervous about}} {{watching}} his own ancestor be murdered, {{especially since he}} never {{got to know the}} man himself; he has met Kennedy only once. Wang reassures Fitzgerald that every field historian has moments of doubt such as this. When she departs for their home time, she says something that Fitzgerald does not quite catch. He decides {{to get it over with}} and journeys to Dealey Plaza in Dallas. However, when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> to the Texas School Book Depository and sees Lee Harvey Oswald raise a gun to kill Kennedy, Fitzgerald is unable to stand by and watch the killing. He intervenes and saves the president's life, shouting for the president and his entourage to take cover. Oswald fires anyway, but misses, and is later arrested by Dallas police.|$|R
