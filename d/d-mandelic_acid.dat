40|$|The {{soluble protein}} {{fraction}} prepared from mandelate grown cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens {{as described in}} a previous paper (Gunsalus et al., 1953) contains four enzymes which {{are involved in the}} conversion of DL-mandelic acid to benzoic acid. These are: mandelic acid racemase, benzoyl-formic carboxylase, and two benzaldehyde dehydrogenases, linked respectively to diphos-phopyridine nucleotide (DPN) and triphospho-pyridine nucleotide (TPN). This paper describes the separation of these four enzyme activities and some of their properties. METHODS Assays. Benzoylformic carboxylase was assayed manometrically by measuring the rate of carbon dioxide evolution from benzoylformic acid at pH 6. 0 and 30 C. The test system contained 100 ug of cocarboxylase, 50 iM of sodium benzoyl-formate, and phosphate buffer (0. 1 M, pH 6. 0) sufficient to give a total volume of 2. 5 ml. Measurements were usually made in air, but crude extracts still containing the particle frac-tion were assayed in nitrogen to preclude oxida-tion of the benzaldehyde formed. The rate of decarboxylation is a linear function of enzyme concentration over the measurable range. The unit of activity is defined as the amount of en-zyme which decarboxylates one micromole of benzoylformic acid per hour under the specified conditions. Mandelic acid racemase was assayed by an indirect mrnometric method, that is, by deter-mining the rate of oxygen uptake by washed particles (L(+) -mandelate dehydrogenase) with <b>D-mandelic</b> <b>acid</b> as substrate in the presence o...|$|E
