2500|$|Roosevelt {{commented on}} {{his role in}} the battles: [...] "On the day of the big fight <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> my men to do a deed that European {{military}} writers consider utterly impossible of performance, that is, to attack over open ground an unshaken infantry armed with the best modern repeating rifles behind a formidable system of entrenchments. The only way to get them {{to do it in the}} way it had to be done was to lead them myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{the show}} was listed as #11 in a {{featured}} TV Guide article, [...] "25 Top Cult Shows Ever!", and included a sidebar which read, [...] "Mike Nelson, writer and star (replacing creator Joel Hodgson), recently addressed a college audience: 'There was nobody {{over the age of}} 25. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> [...] "Where are you seeing this show?" [...] I guess we have some sort of timeless quality.'" [...] Three years later, TV Guide rewrote the article, and bumped MST3K to #13. In 2007, {{the show was}} listed as one of Time magazine's [...] "100 Best TV Shows of All-Time". In 2012, the show was listed as #3 in Entertainment Weeklys [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years", with the comment that [...] "MST3K taught us that snarky commentary can be way more entertaining than the actual media." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{her for a}} drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. I always said it and my granddad said it. Even now {{people come up to me}} and ask if I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] {{continued}} Sharpeye, with a smile, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your {{forgiveness for}} <b>having</b> ventured really <b>to</b> practise deception on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} {{mentioned}} that, sir, because I purpose staying at Silverdale now," [...] he said. [...] "It leads up <b>to</b> what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, that is arranged. Now for {{the first}} thing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you. If Mr. Rosario comes, I do not wish that message from my husband to be delivered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to do so. I cannot but feel, however, how little right <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her, seeing that I am likely to be so poor a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} keep you waiting such a long time," [...] she murmured, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you first--for your friendship, and you weren't very kind to die. But I can't." ...|$|E
60|$|DICK. But I {{shall be}} {{of age in}} a year; my money's my own, it's not as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any one's leave; and I mean, I do know my own mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Dorcas, {{that is all}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you." [...] He {{rose and}} strolled to the window. [...] "I have been admiring these flower beds. How many gardeners are {{employed}} here, by the way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sam's {{account of}} the matter,' replied Perker, 'is, I will venture to say, a {{perfectly}} correct one. Well now, my dear Sir, the first question <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> is, whether this woman is to remain here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} sign it, and we'll get Hastings to witness it in a minute or two. In the {{meanwhile}} there's a thing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you. How do you stand in regard to Miss Ismay?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{unloaded}} {{the canoe}} and ate. Bastin's appetite was splendid. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him {{to remember that}} when this supply was done I {{did not know where}} we should find any more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} no {{progress}} with my work," [...] she said slowly, [...] "and the money was gone. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mr. Courtlaw for his true verdict, and he gave it me. I have given up painting." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was a poser to me. I {{could not}} at the moment recall Enoch's appositeness, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was {{lowering}} myself {{in the eyes of}} the lunatic. [...] "And why with Enoch?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you will not}} {{consider}} my errand here a particularly pleasant one, Herr Captain. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a warrant here for the arrest of one of your passengers, whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> hand over to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Interviewer: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{you this}} because it's been killing {{me for the}} past five years. On the song A Sorta Fairytale ... you sing about pulling back the hood. Are you talking about the hood I think you're talking about? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{a friend}} of Duncombe's, Mr. Pelham," [...] he said, [...] "and that is enough. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> not only you, but all three of you, to {{consider}} what I am {{going to tell you}} as absolutely confidential." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was in {{too much}} of a hurry to get one, and I gave all my money to the man who drove the car. That's why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to pay my fare. You see, I'm not too proud to use your money after all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{just look}} {{the thing in}} the face yourself, Le Breton. I can't very well give you a {{recommendation}} to any other head master without mentioning to him why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you for your resignation. And I'm afraid if I told them, nobody else would ever take you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't {{care for}} that, if he don't bite. He used to gnash them at me; and when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him for money I didn't like it; but now I don't mind him a bit. He threw the peerage at me one day, but it didn't go within a yard of my head." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CICELY (relieved). Oh, that's all right. It {{would have}} been so awkward if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> one of your men to turn out. You won't mind, I know. (All the men stare at her. Even Drinkwater forgets his sorrows in his stupefaction.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Bounderby,' {{she went}} on in a steady, {{straight}} way, without regarding this, 'asks me to marry him. The question <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> myself is, shall I marry him? That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because your {{presence}} {{may be required}} here. You and Mr Mason will remain where you are to guard the girls, until I return. All that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is, that you be in readiness to follow me at a moment's notice when the time comes." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{worked at}} it in the evenings in the granary loft, {{and the rest of us}} forebore to {{question}} him concerning it, because he evidently disliked talking about his literary efforts. But this evening <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him if he would soon have it ready, as I wanted to make up the paper.|$|E
60|$|It {{was clear}} to me that the most vital {{activities}} in which I could engage would be those which most directly affected the Church, public habits of thought, education, organised research, literature, and the channels of general discussion. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> myself how my position as Liberal member for Kinghamstead squared with and conduced to this essential work.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it, father," [...] she {{answered}} coolly. [...] "He was with Mrs. Quest when I asked her, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him too. Besides, I rather like Mr. Cossey, he is always so polite, and I don't see why you should take such a violent prejudice against him. Anyhow, he is coming, {{and there is an}} end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing whatever, ma'am,' replied Mr. Jackson. 'How de do, ladies? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> pardon, ladies, for intruding--but the law, ladies--the law.' With this apology Mr. Jackson smiled, made a {{comprehensive}} bow, {{and gave his}} hair another wind. Mrs. Rogers whispered Mrs. Raddle {{that he was really}} an elegant young man.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] I answered. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> some anxieties just now {{which will make}} me a very poor {{companion}} for Mrs. Playmore at the opera. My letter to you mentions, I think, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your advice on matters which are of very serious importance to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are baiting {{the horses}} at the inn," [...] she said. [...] "I want your arm, Mr. Troy, {{as far as}} the village--and, in return, I will take you back to London with me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your advice about one or two little matters, and this is a good opportunity." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{one thing}} more that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you, {{relating}} to a poor lost creature {{who is in the}} room with us at this moment. But, oh, I am so weary! Mr. Fennick will tell you what it is. Say to yourself sometimes--perhaps when you have married some lady who is worthy of you--There was good as well as bad in poor Emma. Farewell.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{begin to}} {{interest}} you,’ she cried. ‘But, frankly, you are condemned to help me. If the service <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{of you were}} serious, were suspicious, were even unusual, I should say no more. But what is it? To take a pleasure trip (for which, if you will suffer me, I propose to pay) and to carry from one lady to another a sum of money! What can be more simple?’ ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the close}} of the third day Ajor and I were able to {{converse}} with considerable fluency, {{and it was a great}} relief to both of us, especially to Ajor. She now did nothing but ask questions whenever I would let her, which could not be all the time, as our preservation depended largely upon the rapidity with which I could gain knowledge of the geography and customs of Caspak, and accordingly <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> numerous questions myself.|$|E
5000|$|The Week cites Parker-Pope in its {{discussion}} {{of the issue of}} teenage drinking: [...] "After watching the latest Harry Potter movie, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> “Does Hogwarts <b>have</b> a drinking problem?” said Tara Parker-Pope in The New York Times. Unlike in previous Harry Potter movies, alcohol has a “starring role” in “The Half-Blood Prince.”" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that I am in a tiff, Sir Francis. I hope I am not, because what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say is too serious for ill-humour." [...] Then she paused. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> say is of some importance;--of very great importance. Sir Francis Geraldine, I feel that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> forgive me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2015 Liberal Democrats {{leader and}} Rovers fan Tim Farron {{publicly}} criticised Walker's daughter Lynda Matthewman. Farron stated “Part {{of me is}} cross with Lynda. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> did they really do due diligence on the Venky's before they sold? This meant everything to her dad and they’ve sold it {{to a bunch of}} clowns.” ...|$|R
