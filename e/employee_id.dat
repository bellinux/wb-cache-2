MTA employees can also ride free of charge if they carry their MTA <b>employee</b> <b>ID</b> card.|$|E
500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his <b>employee</b> <b>ID</b> card. Jack tells her you can do anything if you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E
50|$|User default {{accounts}} - Personal accounts {{should be}} established for each employee. These accounts will receive invalid transactions (i.e. incorrect or missing data elements) that are not corrected and loaded within a company-defined grace period. In addition, <b>employee</b> <b>IDs</b> are sometimes mapped to a general ledger account number.|$|R
50|$|Validation Table Creation - Rules may be {{established}} for creating validation tables that match {{each of the}} requirements of your respective third-party vendors (i.e. photocopies, fax, shipping charges, etc.). These rules control the data elements extracted, and the criteria for extraction, including all clients, customer locations, <b>employee</b> <b>IDs,</b> phone extensions, corporate offices, etc. The validation tables may be produced at any time on demand, or they be created using scheduled tasks or task lists.|$|R
5000|$|Notice {{that the}} syntax for {{providing}} the callback to the [...] function is identical, but an object is passed {{instead of a}} function pointer. When invoked, the callback function is executed just as any other member function, and therefore has full access to the other members (data or functions) of the object. Of course, {{this is just a}} trivial example. To understand what power a functor provides more than a regular function, consider the common use case of sorting objects by a particular field. In the following example, a functor is used to sort a simple employee database by each <b>employee's</b> <b>ID</b> number.|$|R
2500|$|Later Abagnale {{decided to}} {{impersonate}} pilots {{because he wanted}} to fly throughout the world for free. He acquired a uniform by calling Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), telling the company that he was a pilot working for them who had lost his uniform while getting it cleaned at his hotel, and obtaining a new one with a fake <b>employee</b> <b>ID.</b> He then forged a Federal Aviation Administration pilot's license. Pan Am estimated that between the ages of 16 and 18, Abagnale flew more than [...] on more than 250 flights and flew to 26 countries by deadheading. As a company pilot, he was also able to stay at hotels for free during this time. Everything from food to lodging was billed to the airline company.|$|E

50|$|An ECRS {{can provide}} the ability to {{schedule}} tasks on both the accounting system server and the LAN. Individual tasks may be run at timed intervals separately, or grouped into task lists and run together. Scheduled tasks may include processes on the accounting server to extract validation information, transferring validation information to the LAN, updating a vendor’s validation tables on the cost recovery system (such as <b>employee</b> <b>IDs,</b> accounting codes and cost-types), transferring cost transactions from the LAN to the accounting server and processing cost transactions into the billing system. Transaction processes can then be automated to minimize administrative overhead and reduce delays updating transactions into the billing system.|$|R

5000|$|A {{key that}} has an external, {{real-world}} meaning (such as a person's name, a book's ISBN, or a car's serial number) is sometimes called a [...] "natural" [...] key. If no natural key is suitable (think of the many people named Brown), an arbitrary or surrogate key can be assigned (such as by giving <b>employees</b> <b>ID</b> numbers). In practice, most databases have both generated and natural keys, because generated keys can be used internally to create links between rows that cannot break, while natural keys can be used, less reliably, for searches and for integration with other databases. (For example, records in two independently developed databases could be matched up by social security number, except when the social security numbers are incorrect, missing, or have changed.) ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{database}} columns contain string or {{numerical data}} that conforms to a pattern, such as phone numbers, dates, addresses, product identifiers, and <b>employee</b> <b>ids.</b> These patterns {{are useful in}} a number of data processing applications, including understanding what a specific field represents when field names are ambiguous, identifying outlier values, and finding similar fields across data sets. One way to express such patterns would be to learn regular expressions for each field in the database. Unfortunately, exist- ing techniques on regular expression learning are slow, taking hundreds of seconds for columns of just a few thousand values. In contrast, we develop XSystem, an efficient method to learn patterns over database columns in significantly less time. We show that these patterns can not only be built quickly, but are expressive enough to capture a number of key applications, including detecting outliers, measuring column similarity, and assigning semantic labels to columns (based on a library of regular expressions). We evaluate these applications with datasets that range from chemical databases (based on a collaboration with a pharmaceutical company), our university data warehouse, and open data from MassData. gov...|$|R

50|$|Students with ID {{have some}} of the worst {{employment}} outcomes of all disability populations (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013). In 2009, only 35% of young adults between the ages of 21 and 25 were employed. By contrast, during the same time period, the average employment rate was at 90.2% (Moore & Schelling, 2014). That same year, 40.3% of <b>employees</b> with <b>ID</b> earned less the federal minimum wage (Moore and Schelling, 2014). The combination of an increasing number of jobs requiring some type of education after high school and their history of exclusion from the higher education system have led to this conclusion. In the past, employment options for people with ID have been limited to supported employment and sheltered workshops (Foley et. al., 2012).|$|R

40|$|Aim: This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} supported employment agencies in promoting health of people with ID in real jobs. The research approach is novel, focusing on agency support strategies used to prevent high risk behaviours and promote access to company health promotion activities. Method: A web questionnaire was sent to 300 UK supported employment agencies. The activities of assessing, training and ongoing support were evaluated {{in the light of}} health and well-being promotion initiatives. The survey evaluates the agency’s awareness of the problems of people with ID (eating habits, smoking, alcohol misuse, abuse of drugs, social difficulties). Coping strategies used by agencies to address health problems were investigated. Results: The paper describes levels of awareness of health among supported employment agencies, the health issues workers face, the kinds of health promotion assistance agencies delivered directly, and with employers {{and the extent to which}} supported employment agencies play a mediating role in health promotion at work. Conclusion: The paper identifies implications for agencies in improving their role as mediators in promoting healthy lifestyles for <b>employees</b> with <b>ID,</b> as required by recent UK government policy...|$|R
