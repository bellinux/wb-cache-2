5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E
500|$|The {{account of}} Theophanes Continuatus on Thomas's revolt states {{that in this}} time, [...] "the servant raised <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> his master, the soldier against his officer, the captain against his general". This has led some scholars, chiefly Alexander Vasiliev and George Ostrogorsky, to regard Thomas's revolt as an {{expression}} of widespread discontent among the rural population, which suffered under heavy taxation. Other Byzantinists, notably Lemerle, dismiss rural discontent as a primary factor during the revolt.|$|E

500|$|Between 4:00pm and 5:00am the {{following}} day, the Polish 10th Armored Division, Polish 19th Armored Division, Polish 4th Infantry Division and Polish 5th Infantry Division, totaling about 10,300troops and the Internal Security Corps {{under the command}} of Poplavsky entered Poznań. A two-hour long procession of tanks, armored cars, field guns, and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it. At 9:00pm a wave of detentions began. The detainees were taken to Ławica airport, where they were subjected to brutal interrogation; 746persons were detained until August8. The protests continued until June30, when the troops finally pacified the city, after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators. At 7:30am on June29 the Prime Minister arrived and infamously declared on the local radio station that [...] "any provocateur or lunatic who raises <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the people's government may be sure that this hand will be chopped off." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning on 28 June 1956, {{workers in}} the {{industrial}} city of Poznań, who had repeatedly, but in vain petitioned the authorities to intervene and improve their deteriorating situation, went on strike and rioted {{in response to a}} cut in wages and changed working conditions. Demonstrations by factory workers turned into a huge citywide protest. 16 tanks, 2 armoured personnel carriers and 30 vehicles were brought to bear by a local military commander. Some of them were seized by the protesters, who also broke into the local government buildings. 57 people were killed and several hundred injured in two days of fighting. Several major military formations entered the scene, but the army's role was mainly that of support of the police and the security forces action. At the Poznań radio station, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz in his widely publicized speech warned and threatened the rioters: he [...] "…who will dare raise <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the people's rule may be sure that… the authorities will chop off his hand". Of the 746 people officially detained during and {{in the aftermath of the}} disturbances, almost 80% were workers. The authorities launched an investigation, attempting to uncover a claimed premeditated instigation and involvement by Western or anticommunist underground centers. Such efforts were unsuccessful and the events were found to have been spontaneous and locally supported. The Poznań revolt's lasting impact was that it caused a deeper and more liberal realignment within the Polish communist party and its relationship to Moscow.|$|E

At Sanhedrin 101b it says [...] "Why did Jeroboam merit sovereignty? Because he reproved Solomon. And why was he punished? Because he reproved him publicly. As it is written, And this was the cause that he lifted up <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. He said thus to him: Thy father David made breaches in the wall, that Israel might come up [...] on the Festivals; whilst thou hast closed them, in order to exact toll for the benefit of Pharaoh's daughter.

"And Jeroboam {{the son of}} Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, {{a servant}} of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the king. And this was the cause that he lifted up <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the king: Solomon built Millo, and {{repaired}} the breach {{of the city of}} David his father.

And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee—but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel—because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his father." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the reading}} {{continues}} in chapter [...] having borne no children after 10 years in Canaan, Sarai bade Abram to consort with her Egyptian maidservant Hagar, so that Sarai {{might have a}} son through her, and Abram did as Sarai requested. When Hagar saw that she had conceived, Sarai was lowered in her esteem, and Sarai complained to Abram. Abram told Sarai that her maid was in her hands, and Sarai treated her harshly, so Hagar ran away. An angel of God found Hagar by a spring {{of water in the}} wilderness, and asked her where she came from and where she was going, and she replied that she was running away from her mistress. The angel told her to go back to her mistress and submit to her harsh treatment, for God would make Hagar's offspring too numerous to count; she would bear a son whom she should name Ishmael, for God had paid heed to her suffering. Ishmael would be a wild donkey of a man, with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> everyone, and everyone's hand against him, but he would dwell alongside his kinsmen. Hagar called God [...] "El-roi," [...] meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her, and the well was called Beer-lahai-roi.

2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), which coincides with chapter [...] {{sometime}} later, God tested Abraham, directing {{him to take}} Isaac {{to the land of}} Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering. Early the next morning, Abraham saddled his donkey and split wood for the burnt offering, and then he, two of his servants, and Isaac set out for the place that God had named. On the third day, Abraham saw the place from afar, and directed his servants to wait with the donkey, while Isaac and he went up to worship and then return. Abraham took the firestone and the knife, put the wood on Isaac, and the two walked off together. When Isaac asked Abraham where the sheep was for the burnt offering, Abraham replied that God would see to the sheep for the burnt offering. They arrived at the place that God had named, and Abraham built an altar, laid out the wood, bound Isaac, laid him on the altar, and picked up the knife to slay him. Then an angel called to Abraham, telling him not to raise <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the boy, for now God knew that Abraham feared God, since he had not withheld his son. Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in a thicket by its horns, so he offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. Abraham named the site Adonai-yireh. The angel called to Abraham a second time, saying that because Abraham had not withheld his son, God would bless him and make his descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands on the seashore, and victorious over their foes. All the nations of the earth would bless themselves by Abraham's descendants, because he obeyed God's command. Abraham returned to his servants, and they departed for Beersheba; where Abraham stayed.
