40|$|The {{construction}} industry develops {{at a high}} pace today. Because of this the construction companies has to rethink and try to develop at the same pace. One {{of the biggest challenges}} in the {{construction industry}} today is to improve the logistics since improved logistics leads to lower costs. This is something that the construction companies have started to realize and they are beginning to invest more money in order to improve the logistics. It is especially important to have good logistics when the conjuncture turns for the worse. There {{are a lot of things}} that can be done in order to achieve a good logistic. The aim of this paper is to describe how the logistics for <b>kitchen</b> <b>interior,</b> in the construction industry, looks today and how it can be improved. This paper is executed in cooperation with the Nordic construction company NCC. Our paper is a result of two field studies and a couple of interviews performed at the construction site of NCC and during a visit at MyresjöKök in Älmhult. During the field studies we have focused on the following six areas; (1) Ordering, (2) Receiving the orders and packing and delivering, (3) Receiving <b>kitchen</b> <b>interior</b> and unloading, (4) Check of received interior, (5) Internal logistics and (6) Mounting. The reason to why we executed the field studies was to achieve a deeper understanding for the logistic chain of <b>kitchen</b> <b>interior</b> and how it can be improved. The result of our paper shows that there are a whole lot that can be improved to gain a better logistic. Hiring an external logistic company is an alternative to improve the logistic, which takes care of receiving, unloading and transportation on the construction site. This makes it possible for the construction company to focus on the production. Planning and communication is very important and needs to be proved as well. This is the ABC for achieving a good logistic. Our research shows that a new checking system that MyresjöKök will introduce during this fall is most likely to contribute to higher profitability due to an increased delivering guarantee...|$|R
