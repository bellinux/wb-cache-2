50|$|Leblouh (lebluh) is the {{practice}} of force-feeding girls from as young as five to teenagers, in Mauritania, Western Sahara, and southern Morocco, where obesity was traditionally regarded as desirable. Especially prevalent in rural areas and having its roots in Tuareg tradition, leblouh is practiced to increase chances of marriage {{in a society where}} high body volume used to be a sign of wealth. The synonym gavage comes from the French term for the <b>force-feeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> to produce foie gras.|$|E

5000|$|Force-feeding is {{also known}} as gavage, from a French word meaning [...] "to gorge". This term {{specifically}} refers to <b>force-feeding</b> <b>of</b> ducks or <b>geese</b> in order to fatten their livers in the production of foie gras.In modern Egypt, the practice <b>of</b> fattening <b>geese</b> and male Muscovy ducks by force-feeding them various grains is present, mostly by individuals, unrelated to foie gras production, but for general consumption of those birds later. It is not widespread on commercial farms however. The term used for such a practice is called [...] "Tazgheet" [...] تزغيط from the verb [...] "Zaghghat" [...] زغَط.|$|R
5000|$|COK joined {{organizations}} Animal Legal Defense Fund, Farm Sanctuary and Animal Protection & Rescue League, and individuals, in {{filing a}} lawsuit against the USDA for allowing the sale of foie gras, a diseased poultry product. The agency is required through the Poultry Products Inspection Act to condemn diseased poultry as adulterated. The <b>force-feeding</b> <b>of</b> ducks and <b>geese</b> to produce foie gras results in a condition known as hepatic lipidosis or [...] "fatty liver disease," [...] in which the birds' livers swell up to ten times their normal size.|$|R
40|$|A {{follow-up}} study {{was performed to}} describe characteristic physiological alterations by means of computer tomography, direct chemical analysis and histology of the liver, and blood biochemical parameters during conventional force-feeding of Landes geese. 30 birds were exposed to an 18 -day long force-feeding. Sampling was performed at the start and during force-feeding (7 th, 11 th, 14 th, 18 th days). Computer tomographic data were plotted in 3 D histograms, effectively indicating the volumetric development and the fat deposition of the liver. Applying the so-called fat index, a saturation process was found for the hepatic fat content. Histological sections indicated the appearance of microvesicular fat forms in the hepatocyte cytoplasm, which first turned to a total fatty infiltration, later changing to a macrovesicular form with progressing inflammation; membrane damage was not visualized. In blood metabolites triglyceride, total and HDL cholesterol and uric acid increased measurably, while creatinine concentration decreased. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase activities increased strongly, while that of lactate dehydrogenase only slightly. Based {{on the results of}} macroscopic and microscopic imaging techniques and blood biochemical parameters, a comprehensive {{follow-up study}} was performed, elucidating still unknown processes during <b>force-feeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>geese...</b>|$|E

It also explores the fraught role of prison doctors called upon to perform the procedure. Since the Home Office first authorised force-feeding in 1909, {{a number of questions}} have been raised about the procedure. Is force-feeding safe? Can it kill? Are doctors who feed prisoners against their will abandoning the medical ethical norms of their profession? And do state bodies use prison doctors to help tackle political dissidence at times of political crisis...|$|R
