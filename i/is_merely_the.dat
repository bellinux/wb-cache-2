5|$|Little {{is known}} of Somairle's {{descendants}} in the decades following his demise. Dubgall does not appear on record until 1175, when he is attested far from the Isles in Durham, by the Durham Cathedral's Liber Vitae. Nothing is certain of Dubgall's later activities, {{and it is possible}} that, by the 1180s, Ragnall had begun to encroach upon Dubgall's territories and his position as head of the meic Somairle. The fact that Dubgall is not accorded any title by the Liber Vitae could be evidence that Ragnall had displaced him upon Somairle's demise, or that the chronicle's account of Dubgall's connection with the kingship <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> work of thirteenth-century bias favouring the powerful meic Dubgaill, Dubgaill's descendants.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at The Forge, Captain Archer, Commander T'Pol, and T'Pau, {{having found}} the sacred Kir'Shara (which the Syrrannites believe will usher a Vulcan enlightenment), {{endeavor}} {{to take it}} to the capital. En route, T'Pol and T'Pau discuss the taboo of mind-melds, and T'Pau offers to mind-meld with T'Pol. She states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art, and that Pa'nar Syndrome <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> by-product of an improperly conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T'Pol is captured while the others escape. She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination.|$|E
5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E

25|$|Swami Sivananda {{also notes}} that God is free from charges of {{partiality}} and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal suffering in the world.

Justice Hall furthermore {{argues that the}} concept articulated by Justice Tysoe in R. v.

This doctrine, Hall notes, has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education.|$|E
25|$|As a {{demonstration}} of the principles involved in raytracing, let us consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere. This <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> math behind the line–sphere intersection and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of raytracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.|$|E
25|$|Dante meets and converses {{with several}} great saints of the Church, {{including}} Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Saint Peter, and St. John. The Paradiso is consequently more theological in nature than the Inferno and the Purgatorio. However, Dante {{admits that the}} vision of heaven he receives <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> one his human eyes permit him to see, and thus the vision of heaven found in the Cantos is Dante's personal vision.|$|E

25|$|This {{suggests}} that the usual split of a quaternion into scalar and vector parts would be better represented as a split into scalar and bivector parts; if this is done the quaternion product <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> geometric product. It also relates quaternions in three dimensions to complex numbers in two, as each is isomorphic to the even subalgebra for the dimension, a relationship that generalises to higher dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Some philosophers, such as Sartre, {{believe in}} an epistemic {{loneliness}} in which loneliness {{is a fundamental}} {{part of the human}} condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring meaning in life and the isolation and nothingness of the universe. Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> feeling of being cut off from this process.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer {{discusses}} suicide at length, {{noting that}} it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged. By asceticism, the ultimate denial of the will, one can slowly weaken the individual will {{in a way that is}} far more significant than violent suicide, which is, in fact, in some sense an affirmation of the will.|$|E

25|$|While {{economic}} compensation <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> {{result of}} scarcity, educational attainment {{may be related}} to that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a graduate degree represents the acquisition of expertise (a factor of production) that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner. As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on educational attainment (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being. The following chart further explains the strong correlation between educational attainment and personal as well as household income.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} {{of a house}} for military purposes is often undertaken {{in very different ways}} to conventional civilian demolitions. In peacetime situations, demolition <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> first stage in a process that is usually intended to clear the ground for subsequent re-use (for instance, replacing an old building with a newer one or decommissioning an old industrial building). It is undertaken with extensive preparations, such as stripping the property of items of value, removing hazardous materials such as glass and asbestos insulation, and preparing the structure by removing features that might impede the demolition (such as internal partitions).|$|E
25|$|Josiah Crackenthorpe, {{purveyor}} of tea biscuits, built Rutherford Hall in 1884. His son, Luther, now a semi-invalid widower, had displayed spendthrift qualities in his youth. To preserve the family fortune, Josiah has left his considerable fortune in trust, the income from {{which is to}} be paid to Luther for life. After Luther's death, the capital is to be divided equally among Luther's children. Luther Crackenthorpe <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> trustee of Rutherford Hall and hence, according to the will, cannot sell the house. The house itself will be inherited by Luther Crackenthorpe's eldest surviving son or his issue.|$|E

25|$|In Book 2, {{electricity}} and gravity {{are described as}} fundamental forces of the will. Knowledge is something that was invented to serve the will and is present in both human and non-human animals. It is subordinate {{to the demands of}} the will for all animals and most humans. The fundamental nature of the universe and everything in it is seen as this will. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will {{do more harm than}} good. According to them, child labour <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E
