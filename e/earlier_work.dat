After Ricketts' death in 1948, Steinbeck dropped the species catalogue from the <b>earlier</b> <b>work</b> and republished it with a eulogy to his friend added as a foreword.|$|E
5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to <b>earlier</b> <b>work.</b> Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his <b>earlier</b> <b>work.</b> He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by {{saying that it was}} a soundtrack not to be missed by buyers of video game music.|$|E

40|$|Recently, state {{agencies}} have been successfully implementing construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) delivery on highway projects. While <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging is frequently cited in the literature as a primary benefit of CM/GC, there is limited to substantiate or refute these benefits. Additionally, agencies need {{a better understanding of}} the current state-of-practice of <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packing in CM/GC to help with effective implementation. In an ongoing Federal Highway Agency research project, 12 of 34 completed CM/GC projects reported the use <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging, and will be the focus of this study. Research methods used within this paper include: literature review, content review of agency manuals/instructions, project surveys, agency interviews, and case studies. Triangulated findings suggest that <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging can contribute to expediting project completion, mitigating project risks, reducing project cost, and minimizing public impacts. To achieve these outcomes, agencies must perform detailed planning to generate severable/independent packages that take into account all potential impacts to the project. Trends in data indicate that <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packages can lead to cost savings, yet the sample size does not provide statistical significance. Future research should explore the performance of a larger data set of CM/GC projects with and without <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging along with a cost/benefit analysis of <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packages...|$|R

Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
