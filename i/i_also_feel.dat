[...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed.

2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I had to be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>feel</b> more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E

60|$|The {{existing}} {{capitalist system}} is doomed. Its injustice is so glaring that only ignorance and tradition could lead wage-earners to tolerate it. As ignorance diminishes, tradition becomes weakened, {{and the war}} destroyed the hold upon men's minds of everything merely traditional. It may be that, through the influence of America, the capitalist system will linger for another fifty years; but it will grow continually weaker, and can never recover the position of easy dominance which it held in the nineteenth century. To attempt to bolster it up is a useless diversion of energies which might be expended upon building something new. Whether the new thing will be Bolshevism or something else, I do not know; {{whether it will be}} better or worse than capitalism, I do not know. But that a radically new order of society will emerge, I feel no doubt. And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>feel</b> no doubt that the new order will be either some form of Socialism or a reversion to barbarism and petty war such as occurred during the barbarian invasion. If Bolshevism remains the only vigorous and effective competitor of capitalism, I believe that no form of Socialism will be realized, but only chaos and destruction. This belief, for which I shall give reasons later, is one of the grounds upon which I oppose Bolshevism. But to oppose it {{from the point of view}} of a supporter of capitalism would be, to my mind, utterly futile and against the movement of history in the present age.|$|E
6000|$|What {{is called}} the {{international}} novel is popularly dated from the publication of [...] "Daisy Miller," [...] though [...] "Roderick Hudson" [...] and [...] "The American" [...] had gone before; but it really began in the beautiful story which I have just named. Mr. James, who invented this species in fiction, first contrasted in the [...] "Passionate Pilgrim" [...] the New World and Old World moods, ideals, and prejudices, {{and he did it}} there with a richness of poetic effect which he has since never equalled. I own that I regret the loss of the poetry, but you cannot ask a man to keep on being a poet for you; it is hardly for him to choose; yet I compare rather discontentedly in my own mind such impassioned creations as Searle and the painter in [...] "The Madonna of the Future" [...] with [...] "Daisy Miller," [...] of whose slight, thin personality <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>feel</b> the indefinable charm, and of the tragedy of whose innocence I recognize the delicate pathos. Looking back to those early stories, where Mr. James stood at the dividing ways of the novel and the romance, I am sometimes sorry that he declared even superficially for the former. His best efforts seem to me those of romance; his best types have an ideal development, like Isabel and Claire Belgarde and Bessy Alden and poor Daisy and even Newman. But, doubtless, he has chosen wisely; perhaps the romance is an outworn form, and would not lend itself to the reproduction of even the ideality of modern life. I myself waver somewhat in my preference--if it is a preference--when I think of such people as Lord Warburton and the Touchetts, whom I take to be all decidedly of this world. The first of these especially interested me as a probable type of the English nobleman, who amiably accepts the existing situation with all its possibilities of political and social change, and insists not at all upon the surviving feudalities, but means to be a manly and simple gentleman in any event. An American is not able to pronounce as to the verity of the type; I only know that it seems probable and that it is charming. It makes one wish that it were in Mr. James's way to paint in some story the present phase of change in England. A titled personage is still mainly an inconceivable being to us; he is like a goblin or a fairy in a storybook. How does he comport himself {{in the face of all}} the changes and modifications that have taken place and that still impend? We can hardly imagine a lord taking his nobility seriously; it is some hint of the conditional frame of Lord Warburton's mind that makes him imaginable and delightful to us.|$|E
6000|$|The reader {{must have}} noticed that I never speak of German art, or German philosophy, but in depreciation. This, however, is not because I cannot feel, or would not acknowledge, the value and power, within certain limits, of both; but because <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>feel</b> that the {{immediate}} tendency of the English mind is to rate them too highly; and, therefore, it becomes a necessary task, at present, to mark what evil and weakness there are in them, rather than what good. I also am brought continually into collision with certain extravagances of the German mind, by my own steady pursuit of Naturalism as opposed to Idealism; and, therefore, I become unfortunately cognizant of the evil, rather than of the good; which evil, so far as I feel it, I am bound to declare. And {{it is not to}} the point to protest, as the Chevalier Bunsen and other German writers have done, against the expression of opinions respecting their philosophy by persons who have not profoundly or carefully studied it; for the very resolution to study any system of metaphysics profoundly, must be based, in any prudent man's mind, on some preconceived opinion of its worthiness to be studied; which opinion of German metaphysics the naturalistic English cannot be led to form. This is not to be murmured against,--it is in the simple necessity of things. Men who have other business on their hands must be content to choose what philosophy they have occasion for, by the sample; and when, glancing into the second volume of [...] "Hippolytus," [...] we find the Chevalier Bunsen himself talking of a [...] "finite realization of the infinite" [...] (a phrase considerably less rational than [...] "a black realization of white"), and of a triad composed of God, Man, and Humanity[105] (which is a parallel thing to talking of a triad composed of man, dog, and canineness), knowing those expressions to be pure, definite, and highly finished nonsense, we do not in general trouble ourselves to look any farther. Some one will perhaps answer that if one always judged thus by the sample,--as, for instance, if one judged of Turner's pictures by the head of a figure cut out of one of them,--very precious things might often be despised. Not, I think, often. If any one went to Turner, expecting to learn figure-drawing from him, the sample of his figure-drawing would accurately and justly inform him that he had come to the wrong master. But if he came to be taught landscape, the smallest fragment of Turner's work would justly exemplify his power. It may sometimes unluckily happen that, in such short trial, we strike upon an accidentally failing part of the thing to be tried, and then we may be unjust; but there is, nevertheless, in multitudes of cases, no other way of judging or acting; and the necessity of occasionally being unjust is a law of life,--like that of sometimes stumbling, or being sick. It will not do to walk at snail's pace all our lives for fear of stumbling, nor to spend years in the investigation of everything which, by specimen, we must condemn. He who seizes all that he plainly discerns to be valuable, and never is unjust but when he honestly cannot help it, will soon be enviable in his possessions, and venerable in his equity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contrast}} between Macduff and Macbeth is accentuated by their approaches to death. Macduff, hearing of his family’s death, reacts with a tortured grief. His words, [...] "But <b>I</b> must <b>also</b> <b>feel</b> it as a man" [...] (4.3.223), indicate {{a capacity for}} emotional sensitivity. While Macbeth and Lady Macbeth insist that manhood implies a denial of feeling (1.7.45-57), Macduff insists that emotional depth and sensitivity are part {{of what it means}} to be a man. This interpretation is supported by Macduff’s reaction upon his discovery of Duncan’s corpse and the echo of Macduff’s words when Macbeth responds to the news of Lady Macbeth’s death. Macduff struggles to find the words to express his rage and anguish, crying, [...] "O horror, horror, horror" [...] (2.3.59). In some stage interpretations, Macduff’s character transitions from a state of shock to one of frenzied alarm. This contrasts starkly with Macbeth’s famous response to the announcement of his wife’s death: [...] "She should have died hereafter / There would have been a time for such a word / Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" [...] (5.5.17-19). Macbeth’s words seem to express a brutal indifference-she would have died anyway-and perhaps even suggest that he has lost the capacity to feel.|$|R
