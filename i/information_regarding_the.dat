5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game.

5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained <b>information</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E
