5|$|The season 6 {{finale of}} CBS's reality show The Amazing Race ended in Ping Tom Memorial Park. Contestants were {{instructed}} {{to make their way}} to the finish line in the park from a Gino's East pizzeria; however, after contestants hailed taxis, most of the drivers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the park was located.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2014, Ben Arfa {{signed for}} Hull City on a season-long loan. He made his debut on 15 September, {{replacing}} fellow debutant Abel Hernández {{for the final}} 11 minutes of a 22 home draw against West Ham United. In December 2014, however, Ben Arfa unexpectedly left England, with Hull manager Steve Bruce later admitting he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the player was and that his career with Hull appeared to be over.|$|E
5|$|The Kafka {{family had}} a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, {{although}} Ellie and Valli had married and {{moved out of the}} first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.|$|E

5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, {{which most of the}} Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E
5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
5|$|For the XI Corps, {{it was a}} sad {{reminder}} of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they clogged the streets of the town; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the Garlach family {{for the rest of the}} three-day battle. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the cemetery was.|$|E

5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to cut the beam {{because they were not}} sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) {{arrive at}} the scene of Ed Russell (David Shumbris), a stay at home father, who is found by his wife Jen (Molly Price) stabbed to death at their house, whilst their baby {{daughter}} Sophie is at home. When Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) goes to tell Ed's son Mike (Jake O'Connor) about his father’s death, Megan stops him, telling Bud to let his mother tell him. Megan has a flashback to when she was younger, focussing on when a young Megan (Madeline Milne) receives the news of her father’s death from a policeman, as the police <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> her mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy), was at the time. Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; she thought they were Mike's. The attack on Ed was personal and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on Ed was personal after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails. Mike protests his innocence, and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) finds evidence which makes Mike innocent. Throughout the day, Megan tries to rebuild her relationship with Lacey (Mary Mouser), carpooling Lacey and her friends, Sarah (Teresa Celentano) and Betsy (Anna Friedman).|$|E

5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{fired at}} James Balasko, a U.S. citizen, hitting a nearby car. Balasko had been {{attempting}} to film the shooter. Many people, unable {{to use their}} parked cars, were hiding or running along Jetty Road and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> Bryant was because the gunfire was extremely loud and difficult to pinpoint. It was not clear that Bryant was mobile, nor was it even clear from which direction the shots were coming.|$|E
25|$|Alan Bonsell testified.

On hearing that the money had been raised in William Buckingham's church, and directed through Bonsell's father so {{that it might be}} donated anonymously, Jones elected to take over the examination of Bonsell himself, questioning him for about ten minutes.|$|E

25|$|Laxman was {{particularly}} prolific against Australia, in both Tests and One Day Internationals. Six {{out of his}} 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds came against Australia.

25|$|The Red Cross, {{not content}} merely with helping prisoners, also lent {{assistance}} to families who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> {{their loved ones}} were being held, by ensuring that the latter received mail or money intended for them. Its International Prisoners-of-War Agency in Geneva was the largest non-governmental institution to {{have come to the}} prisoners’ aid. With a daily average of 16,500 letters asking for information on prisoners {{over the course of the}} war, this organisation became a sine qua non.|$|E

25|$|The last contact Tobares {{had with}} someone was at 12:32p.m. on June 5, 2013, {{the day he}} disappeared. He was {{speaking}} to Verónica Román, a friend from Argentina. While on the phone, Tobares {{explained that he was}} doing Gerardo a favor by driving a vehicle from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara and exchanging it for another of his boss' preference. He told Verónica that they were guiding him along the way, but said he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he was, that he was scared, and that the whole situation seemed strange to him. That was the last thing Tobares said to Verónica.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, Herbert Youngblood, {{a fellow}} escapee from Crown Point, {{was shot dead}} by three police {{officers}} in Port Huron, Michigan. Deputy Sheriff Charles Cavanaugh was mortally wounded in the battle and died a few hours later.

An Indiana newspaper reported that Youngblood later retracted the story and said he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> Dillinger was at that time, as he had parted with him soon after their escape.|$|E
25|$|Before broadcast, {{the plot}} of series two was closely guarded. Cast members were sworn to secrecy about the details, and {{required}} to sign non-disclosure agreements. Actor Andrew Buchan said cast members were told little about the plot, except on a need-to-know basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. Actor Joe Sims said that actors only receive two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the plot was headed. Several different endings for series two were filmed, and Chibnall said that even cast members would remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode aired.|$|E
