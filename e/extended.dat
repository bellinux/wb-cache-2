The {{extension}} caused the road to Sheridan to become a spur route of Route 46. The spur route was then <b>extended</b> west into Nodaway County around 1948–1949, and was numbered supplemental route D. Four years later, the route was <b>extended</b> to Route 27 (now Route 148). In 1954, Route 246 was designated, starting from Sheridan, and ending at Route 46. The next year, Route 246 was <b>extended</b> to replace supplemental route D as the main connector from Hopkins to Route 46. The whole route was surfaced in concrete by 1959.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical <b>extending</b> {{limit in}} {{horizontal}} drilling means the maximum horizontal <b>extending</b> {{length of a}} horizontal well under certain ground and down-hole mechanical constraint conditions. Around this concept, the constrained optimization model of mechanical <b>extending</b> limits is built and simplified analytical results for pick-up and slack-off operations are deduced. The horizontal <b>extending</b> limits for kinds of tubular strings under different drilling parameters are calculated and drawn. To improve <b>extending</b> limits, an optimal design model of drill strings is built and applied to a case study. The results indicate that horizontal <b>extending</b> limits are underestimated a lot when the effects of friction force on critical helical buckling loads are neglected. Horizontal <b>extending</b> limits firstly increase and tend to stable values with vertical depths. Horizontal <b>extending</b> limits increase faster but finally become smaller {{with the increase of}} horizontal pushing forces for tubular strings of smaller modulus-weight ratio. Sliding slack-off is the main limit operation and high axial friction is the main constraint factor constraining horizontal <b>extending</b> limits. A sophisticated installation of multiple tubular strings can greatly inhibit helical buckling and increase horizontal <b>extending</b> limits. The optimal design model is called only once to obtain design results, which greatly increases the calculation efficiency...|$|R
