This study used qualitative and descriptive statistics to examine verbal sexual coercion experiences among a community sample of 114 women and explored the role of sexual precedence in these experiences.

Verbal persuasion and persistence were the most commonly reported tactics. The valence of this verbal persuasion differed qualitatively according to precedence status, with those having a history of sexual precedence using negative persuasion (e. g., threats to relationship) and those with no precedence relying on positive messages (e. g., sweet talk). Most women used direct verbal resistance to indicate their unwillingness to have sex, regardless of precedence status. Women’s reasons for compliance and consequences differed qualitatively according to sexual precedence status.

Education is also important for attaining jobs and a stable career, which is critical for breaking the cycle of poverty and securing a sound economic future, both individually and as a nation. Students with lower achievement are more likely to drop out of high school, entering the workforce with minimal training and skills, and subsequently earning substantially less than those with more education. Therefore, eliminating the racial {{achievement gap}} and improving the achievement of minority students will help eliminate economic disparities and ensure that America's future workforce is well prepared to be productive and competitive citizens.|$|R

Therefore, two recent, area-based programs - New Deal for Communities in the United Kingdom, and Neighbourhood Renewal in Victoria, Australia - were used as test cases to identify. a gap in the current state-of-the-art of area-based program evaluation. This omission was the failure to account properly for population mobility through intervention sites. Findings from the two Programs and from the literature on population mobility in disadvantaged areas indicated that: a) population turnover of 50 % or more within five years was not unusual for disadvantaged neighbourhoods; b) the characteristics of people who stayed in disadvantaged areas, those who moved in, and of those who moved out, tended to be consistent between Programs and countries. `Stayers' were more likely to be older, less educated, retired and in poorer health than `inmovers' and `outmovers'. Inmovers' tended to have lower incomes and be less active economically than `outmovers', who on the whole were upwardly mobile. The failure to account properly for selective residential mobility was found to <b>have</b> strong <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> impact on the assessment of outcomes for residents, because `outmovers' took measurable Program benefits away from the neighbourhoods, while `inmovers' lowered the socio-economic profiles of the communities.

Due to the lack of phytases in the non-ruminant digestive tract, monogastric animals cannot utilize dietary phytic acid and it is excreted into manure. High phytic acid content in manure results in elevated phosphorus levels in soil and water and accompanying environmental concerns.

While confounding is often assumed {{to occur in the}} same direction as the toxicant exposure, the relationship between the benefits and risks associated with fish and seafood consumption is a classic example of negative confounding: the exposure to methylmercury occurs with fish and seafood, which are also associated with beneficial nutrients, and the signs of mercury toxicity [corrected] Mercury and nutrients may affect the same epidemiological outcomes, but most studies addressing one of them <b>have</b> ignored the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> confounding by the other.

40|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the environment}} is largely a public good. Contributing to a public good is costly to an individual, while the benefits are enjoyed by all. Despite this, many people voluntarily contribute to public goods, both in laboratory economic experiments and through day-to-day environmental decisions. These voluntary contributions are largely motivated intrinsically, that is satisfaction comes from the act itself rather than external rewards. Policy interventions are often required to increase the provision of public goods to the socially optimal level, which usually {{take the form of}} extrinsic incentives such as payments or regulations. Theoretical and empirical evidence from psychology and economics suggests that such extrinsic incentives can crowd out the intrinsic motivations which underlie voluntary contributions. As a result, a policy may have less than the anticipated impact. It is even possible for a costly policy intervention to lead to a decrease in overall public good provision, as individuals cease to contribute voluntarily. This paper argues that environmental policy design should proceed with caution in the presence of intrinsic motivations. Weak regulations and small, competitive financial incentives <b>have</b> the greatest <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> effects.

Marine macroalgae are recognized as effective and efficient bioaccumulators of heavy metals and are sometimes used as bioindicators. Macroalgae support abundant and diverse communities of mobile invertebrates that play key roles in temperate marine environments. However, the potential ecological consequences of the contamination of algae on associated epifauna are yet to be considered. In this study, the brown alga Sargassum linearifolium was experimentally spiked with copper to assess the effects of contamination on epifaunal invertebrates in both field and laboratory assays. Copper contamination greatly reduced the colonization {{of a variety of}} epifaunal taxa in the field. Laboratory assays further examined the effects of contaminated macroalgae on habitat preferences, feeding rates, survivorship, and growth in the herbivorous amphipod Peramphithoe parmerong. Adult P. parmerong were less likely to select spiked macroalgae in short-term habitat preference assays and consumed spiked algae at lower rates in feeding assays. In a longer-term (30 -d) experiment, survivorship of juvenile amphipods was reduced by up to 75 % by contaminated macroalgae, but no effects on the growth of survivors was observed. Heavy metal contamination of macroalgae is a widespread phenomenon that <b>has</b> the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> substantial <b>negative</b> consequences <b>for</b> associated invertebrate fauna.

Analysis {{of a wide range}} of variables associated with wind development need to be included in policy development to ensure simultaneous conservation and support of renewable energy development. The objective of this project is to analyze wind energy development to inform US Forest Service management practices through applicable federal, agency, forest and state regulations as well as mitigation of potential impacts. Geospatial analysis is used to evaluate project suitability and associated impacts through a case study of the Nantahala and Pisgah National Forests in North Carolina. This case study is the basis for a spatial decision support system (sDSS) which offers a methodology to consolidate the assessment and authorization process for wind projects on public lands. Based on 16 variables of representing environmental sensitivities, construction requirements, land designations and state policy, this analysis finds that the majority of the study is are highly sensitive or exclusionary to wind energy development. To both promote renewable energy and continued conservation of environmental resources, the Forest Service must take steps to address concerns raised over management practices limiting development potential. Recommendations from this analysis include the need for agency wide clarification of intent and scope of current and proposed Forest Service wind energy management, as well as the prioritization of variable importance in future wind project siting...|$|R

First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging {{in and of itself}} as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media. Comment: ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 201...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} human needs and motivations, such as those for adult {{attachment}} and acceptance, is met {{in the context of}} intimate partner relationships. However, by virtue of that intimacy, such relationships also <b>have</b> the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> more <b>negative</b> interactions, such as transgressions by one partner that are experienced as rejection or as a betrayal of trust by the other. Part of the ongoing task of relationship maintenance and repair is the offering of an apology and its acceptance. Relationship restoration is enhanced by apologies that are accepted as genuine and as indications that the transgressor is truly sorry. The present study took a phenomenological perspective to investigate experiences of apology and identified apology aspects that led to the belief that the transgressor was truly sorry for the offence. Participants were ten male and thirteen female adults (aged 2. 6 - 58 years) in intimate relationships whose partners had committed a serious transgression in the previous two years. Audio-taped, in depth, semi-structured interviews produced extensive transcripts that were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Findings, in association with quantitative measures that were not the main focus of this report, indicated that an apology, alone, was not significantly associated with forgiveness. However, the transgressors 2 ̆ 7 perceived sorriness was significantly associated with apology and forgiveness. The grounded theory methodology generated a preliminary framework for understanding what constitutes an authentic apology in the specific context of relationship transgressions. Important elements of apology were expressions of affirmation, affect and action with a self-other focus, rather than a self-focused apology that emphasized the wrongdoer 2 ̆ 7 s own perspective. Conclusions regarding the utility of the framework for couples counseling and suggestions for extending it through testing in various alternative contexts are offered...|$|R
