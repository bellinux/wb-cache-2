5|$|Although {{part of the}} Los Angeles {{metropolitan}} area, {{the university}} is {{in close proximity to}} two other large metropolitan and culturally-defined regions, the Inland Empire and Orange County. The university has a tier 1 area, defined as a geographical admissions region surrounding the campus, roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, the city of Chino Hills to the south, Interstate 605 to the west, and Interstate 15 to the east. Cal Poly Pomona's campus buildings vary in age and style from the Mission Revival Kellogg Horse Stables and the Kellogg House (suggesting the Spanish colonial architectural heritage of Southern California) built in the 1920s; the modernist box-like portion of the library completed in 1969; to contemporary dormitories, <b>engineering,</b> <b>science</b> and library-expansion facilities completed in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|All {{students}} {{enroll in}} one of five magnet programs. The High School University (HSU) magnet offers a traditional college preparatory curriculum with electives. The Math/Science/Technology (MST) magnet specifically prepares students for college programs in <b>engineering,</b> <b>science</b> and math. Minimal requirements for MST students include courses in algebra, trigonometry, calculus (including mandatory AP Calculus), biology, chemistry and computer programming. The Journalism & Communication (J) magnet focuses on journalism, publishing, and media production. To earn class credit, J students can participate in production of the school's national award-winning yearbook (The Crimson), student newspaper (The Crimson Record), award-winning literary magazine (One Blue Wall), multimedia website (RedEye) or a weekly morning television show called Manual AM, which is broadcast to all classrooms. The J program was formerly known as CMA (Communications and Media Arts), but the name was changed so that the Manual program would stand out from others in the district with similar names.|$|E
