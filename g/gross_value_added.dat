The exact value of this contribution is questionable and has been subject to substantial debate in recent literature. Existing offsite {{construction sector}} valuation methodologies have been based upon market research questionnaires and estimates of turnover and manufacturing output. Considerable {{attention has been given}} to the definition of the terms used to describe the various constituent technologies and manufacturing processes. However there has been limited reference to its size, sector classification, employment statistics and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to the UK gross domestic output.

A breakdown of the sector, examining the common standard industrial activity classification codes (SIC), the <b>gross</b> output and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> for each sub‐sector is provided. The results show that there has been significant underestimation of the <b>gross</b> output and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> when compared to previous studies. An understanding of the broad and diverse nature of the offsite construction sector is provided with data that demonstrate an overview of the sector’s historical performance.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the decision rules yields relatively strong support for the model using data for nondurable and durable goods industries.

40|$|Globalisation is intensifying {{international}} trade and imported goods are increasingly being used in production.

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{differentiation}} of <b>gross</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of farms {{with a focus on}} mixed production from twelve selected European Union countries in view of the manner of farming. The objective is to define the effect of an ecological and conventional manner of farming on the differentiation of <b>gross</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and to quantify the level of impact of subsidy policy on the elimination of the said inequality. The fulfillment of the said objective was based upon the quantification of the Gini coefficient, which was quantified for selected indicators on the basis of data from the FADN database for the year 2009. In order to assess the effect of the manner of farming on the differentiation of the analyzed indicators, a horizontal decomposition of the Gini coefficient was performed. On the other hand, a vertical decomposition of the Gini coefficient served to assess the effect of EU subsidy policy on the level of inequality of the indicator of <b>gross</b> <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> The obtained results indicate a lesser inequality of the economic productivity of European agricultural businesses, which is not significantly determined by an ecological or conventional manner of farming, but rather by the local specifics of individual countries and their agricultural-food markets, as well as the applied subsidy policy, which primarily in organic farming decreases the inequality of <b>gross</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to a significant extent and strengthens the competitiveness as well as viability of agricultural businesses...|$|R

We engage with common critical perceptions of water markets by presenting first-hand evidence of their effects in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Water markets in the MDB, as developed within an appropriate institutional framework and coupled with comprehensive water planning, have: (1) helped deliver improved environmental outcomes; (2) assisted irrigators’ adaptation responses to climate risks, such as drought; (3) increased the <b>gross</b> <b>valued</b> <b>added</b> of farming; and (4) been regulated in ways to meet social goals.

40|$|This paper builds and {{estimates}} {{a new model}} of firm behavior that includes decisions to order, use, and stock input materials in a stage-of-fabrication environment with either <b>gross</b> production or <b>value</b> <b>added</b> technology. The model extends the traditional linear-quadratic model of output (finished goods) inventories by incorporating delivery and usage of input materials plus input inventory investment - features which largely have been ignored in the literature. Stylized facts indicate that input inventories are empirically more important than output inventories, especially in business cycle fluctuations. Firms simultaneously choose input and output inventories; thus, the model exhibits feedback between stocks induced by dynamic stage-of-fabrication linkages. Estimation of inventory decision rules shows the model is reasonably consistent with data in nondurable and durable goods industries. The results reveal inventory stock interaction, convex costs, and viability of <b>gross</b> production and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> specifications, industrial differences, and input inventory-saving technology.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{methodology}} for the decomposition of economic growth by industry which allows interindustry comparisons. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the growth decomposition methodology developed by Ivanov and Ivanov and Webster for tourism and generalizes it for all industries in the national economy. Findings – The methodology is exemplified with analysis of the contribution of specific industries to economic growth in Bulgaria for the period 2000 - 2005. However, the model presents an approach that is general and can be applied to other countries and industries. Research limitations/implications – The methodology identifies the direct impacts of specific industries on the per capita growth of real <b>gross</b> domestic product/gross <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Future research might integrate indirect and induced effects in the analysis. The methodology could be further refined by decomposing the <b>gross</b> domestic product/gross <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to their constituent elements. Practical implications – The paper identifies the industries in the Bulgarian economy that generate economic growth. Originality/value – The paper introduces a new methodology for measuring the contribution of specific industries to economic growth. It might be of value to both academics and macroeconomic policy makers. Bulgaria, Economic growth, Gross domestic product, <b>Gross</b> <b>value,</b> National accounts programmes, Welfare...|$|R
40|$|With the {{availability}} of international <b>value</b> <b>added</b> trade data it has become evident that gross export data and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> data do not provide the same information. Although gross exports crosses national borders and is the target of trade policy, <b>value</b> <b>added</b> data tell us what fragment in the production chain is internationally competitive in a particular country. With respect to comparative advantage {{the differences between the}} two types of data are often illustrated by means of examples using a single sector. In the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, however, the position of a commodity versus all other commodities in a country determines whether or not a sector has a comparative (dis) -advantage.

In this paper we determine the distributions of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) in terms of <b>gross</b> exports and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> for 40 countries.

The inter-temporal factor decomposition of trade shows that deepening input-output linkages between the four regions played an important role in promoting trade in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in the West Pacific. This process was partly interrupted by the economic turmoil during the 1995 - 2000 period, but intensified toward 2005.
