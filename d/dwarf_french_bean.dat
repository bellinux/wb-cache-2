Irrigation influenced most of the yield attributes except pod size and number of seeds per pod. The maximum number of pods and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) (5. 03) was obtained from fortnightly flood irrigation (6 mm) with mulch while maximum pod yield (19. 77 t ha - 1) was obtained from half-weekly sprinkler irrigation (3 mm).

40|$|Changes in {{the rates}} of {{synthesis}} of three enzymes of phenyl-propanoid biosynthesis in Phaseolus vulgaris L. (<b>dwarf</b> <b>French</b> <b>bean)</b> have been investigated by immunoprecipitation of [35 S]methionine-labeled enzyme subunits with mono-specific antisera. Elicitor causes marked, rapid but transient co-ordinated increases {{in the rate of}} synthesis of phenyl-alanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase concomitant with the phase of rapid increase in enzyme activity at the onset of accumulation of phenyl-propanoid-derived phytoalexin antibiotics in suspension cultures of P. vulgaris. Co-ordinate induction of enzyme synthesis is also observed in hypocotyl tissue during race:cultivar-specific interactions with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, causal agent of anthracnose. In an incompatible interaction (host resistant) there are early increases apparently localized to the initial site of infection prior to the onset of phytoalexin accumulation and expression of hypersensitive resistance. In contrast, in a compatible interaction (host susceptible) there is no induction of synthesis {{in the early stages of}} infection, but a delayed widespread response at the onset of lesion formation associated with attempted lesion limitation. It is concluded that expression of the phytoalexin defense response in biologically stressed cells of P. vulgaris characteristically involves co-ordinate induction of synthesis of phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{hypocotyl}} sections or {{cell suspension}} cultures of <b>dwarf</b> <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with an abiotic elicitor (denatured ribonuclease A) resulted in increased extractable {{activity of the}} enzyme l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. This induction could be transmitted from treated cells through a dialysis membrane to cells which were not {{in direct contact with}} the elicitor. In hypocotyl sections, induction of isoflavonoid phytoalexin accumulation was also transmitted across a dialysis membrane, although levels of insoluble, lignin-like phenolic material remained unchanged in elicitor-treated and control sections. In bean cell suspension cultures, the induction of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in cells separated from ribonuclease-treated cells by a dialysis membrane was also accompanied by increases in the activities of chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase, two enzymes previously implicated in the phytoalexin defense response. Such intercellular transmission of elicitation did not occur in experiments with cells treated with a biotic elicitor preparation heat-released from the cell walls of the bean pathogen Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. The results confirm and extend previous suggestions that a low molecular weight, diffusible factor of host plant origin is involved (in French bean) in the intercellular transmission of the elicitation response to abiotic elicitors...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} at Lincoln University during the 1999 - 2000 growing season to investigate the effect of crop species and sowing density on weed dynamics, productivity and species composition. Crops with a spreading (narrow-leafed lupin, Lupimus augustifolius and <b>dwarf</b> <b>French</b> <b>bean,</b> Phaseolus vulgaris), rosette (turnip, Brassica campestris and forage rape, Brassica napus) and upright (maize, Zea mays and ryecorn, Secale cereale) growth habits were sown at 0. 0. 0. 5. 1. 0.. 2. 0 and 4. 0 times their optimum population. No other weed control measures were applied. The six crops were sown on 8 September 1999 (early spring) : narrow-leafed lupin, ryecorn and forage rape on and 4 November 1999 (early summer) : <b>dwarf</b> <b>French</b> <b>bean,</b> maize and turnip. The weed seed bank prior to sowing was predominated by Coronopus didymus. There were {{significant differences in the}} suppressive ability of the different crop species and different crop populations (p < 0. 001). Weed dry matter (DM) was lowest in turnip (0. 58 g/m²) and highest in <b>dwarf</b> <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (123. 50 g/m²) at final harvest. By final harvest crop density had a marked effect on weed DM production. There was decreased weed DM at higher plant populations in all crop species, except turnip, at all plant populations. However, there were differences between 0. 5 and 4. 0 x optimum populations in bean (397 and 12 g/m²), rape (189 and 26 g/m²), lupin (125 and 7 g/m²), maize (106 and 0 g/m²) and ryecorn (51 and 18 g/m²). Weed suppression as affected by the different crop treatments was directly related to leaf area index (LAI), radiation interception and radiation use efficiency (RUE). The highest LAI’s were recorded in turnip (4. 1) at 60 DAS. While other crops such as bean and maize attained LAI's of only 0. 66 and 1. 1 respectively by the same time. Leaf area index increased with increased plant population in all crops. Leaf area index in turnip at 60 DAS ranged from 3. 5 at 0. 5 x optimum population to 5. 1 at 4. 0 x optimum population. In maize LAI ranged from 0. 4 to 2. 0 at the same plant populations at the same time. Canopy closure occurred at 50 DAS in turnip at 4. 0 x optimum population, at 60 DAS for lupin, ryecorn and rape and at 83 DAS for maize and bean. Canopy closure was never attained at 0. 5 x optimum population in lupin, rape, ryecorn, bean and maize. Turnip intercepted the most solar radiation (SR) at 1068 MJ/m² which was 354 MJ/m² more than bean, which intercepted the least photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Total intercepted PAR also increased with increased plant population. There was a strong linear relationship between cumulative intercepted PAR and cumulative DM yield in all crops. Maize produced more DM per MJ of intercepted PAR than all the other crops at 3. 4 g DM MJ PAR⁻¹ whereas lupin, ryecorn, rape, bean and turnip produced 1. 7. 1. 2. 0. 98 and 0. 37 g DM PAR⁻¹ respectively. Crops with large leaf size and rapid growth were effective in reducing the weed seed bank, weed species and numbers in the following growing season. The most effective reduction occurred with turnip followed by maize (55 and 66 x 103 seed/m² respectively) compared with lupin and rape which contained the highest (158 and 130 x 103 seeds/m² respectively). Weed seed production was markedly affected by plant population (p < 0. 05). Higher plant populations (2. 0 and 4. 0 x optimum population) of lupin, rape, ryecorn and maize effectively suppressed weed seed production. Lower plant populations (0. 5 and 1. 0 x optimum population) contained higher weed seed numbers/m² in lupin, rape, ryecorn, bean and maize plots. Coronopus didymus was the most abundant species in the weed seed bank in the 2000 -growing season. Weed seedling emergence in the 2000 -growing season also reflected previous crop treatments. Bean contained the highest weed seedling density (1. 163 weed seedlings/m²) and turnip the least (109 weed seedling/m²). As plant population increased from 0. 0 to 4. 0 x optimum population weed density decreased. The decrease was most pronounced in lupin (1. 128 to 466 weed seedlings/m²), rape (1. 082 to 319 weed seedlings/m²) and ryecorn (1. 308 to 362 weed seedlings/m²). Chenopodium album was the most abundant weed species to emerge during the 2000 growing season. A mechanistic model of crop and weed growth was tested for its ability to simulate DM accumulation of weed and crop in lupin, rape and ryecorn and used SR and LAI data. The model accurately predicted crop and weed DM for lupin, rape and ryecorn grown at the 4 crop densities. The model could be of practical value in predicting the potential weed DM yield under different crop species at different plant densities. The results suggested that inclusion of large leaf size and rapid growth in selection of crop as competitors to suppress weeds by using crops such as turnip, maize and ryecorn should be feasible in a weed management program...|$|E

RNA blot hybridization with 32 P-labeled cDNA sequences was used to demonstrate marked accumulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase mRNAs in excision-wounded hypocotyls of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (<b>dwarf</b> <b>French</b> <b>bean)</b> and during race-cultivar-specific interactions between hypocotyls of P. vulgaris and the partially biotrophic fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causal agent of anthracnose. In an incompatible interaction (host resistant), early concomitant accumulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase mRNAs, localized mainly but not entirely in tissue adjacent {{to the site of}} infection, was observed prior to the onset of phytoalexin accumulation and expression of localized, hypersensitive resistance.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of [35 S]methionine-labeled polypeptides synthesized in vitro by translation of isolated polysomal RNA demonstrated stimulation of the synthesis of characteristic sets of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase isopolypeptides in directly infected tissue and distant, hitherto uninfected tissue in both compatible and incompatible interactions.

40|$|Amylase {{activities}} and patterns were compared in extracts from mature seeds and from {{different parts of}} seedlings at various stages of seed germination of various varieties of different legume species. Apart from soyabean, all varieties had low levels of amylase activities in extracts from mature seeds, while the former had a remarkably high level. Amylase {{activities and}} the number of bands increased during seed germination and showed time and tissue specifity. The extracts from cotyledons had the highest activities and the largest number of bands as compared to that of the various parts of embryonic axes. Amylase activities and patterns had time specific changes during the various stages of seed development of the 7 varieties of different legume species studied. All the different varieties showed changes in zymogram patterns and decreased amylase activity during seed development, except soyabean where amylase activity remained high at all stages. The different components of amylase were characterised in pea (var. Feltham First). One band of a -amylase activity, restricted to the cotyledons, was present in the middle stages of seed development only, then reappeared at the third day of seed germination. The embryonic axes β -amylase activity decreased as the seed developed, to reach zero level in mature seeds, and reappearred during seed germination. The reverse sequence occurred for the cotyledonary β -amylase. The pea a -amylase was partially purified using ethanol precipitation, glycogen complex and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The purified protein had three major bands with few faint bands on the SDS polyacrylamide gel. The embryonic axes β -amylase of pea was partially purified using the conventional method, ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purified protein contained two thick bands and many faint bands on the SDS polyacrylamide gel. The zymogram patterns of phosphorylase, EST, GDH, GOT, LDH, ADH and MDH were investigated during seed development of various varieties of different legume species.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glyoxylate {{released as}} a result of ureide catabolism in the developing fruits of legumes was examined through an investigation of alanine-, glutamate- and serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in these tissues. A study of the distribution of these activities among the tissues of the developing fruits of two ureide-transporting legumes, <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and an amide-transporter, snow pea (Pisum sativum), was conducted. Serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in each species was very low relative to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In all three species most of the aminotransferase activity was in the pods. In cowpea, alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity was high in the embryos relative to the seed coats, whereas in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea the seed coats had higher activity than the embryos. Three glyoxylate aminotransferases were isolated and partially purified from extracts of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea developing fruits. These were a serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), which primarily catalyzes the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction; a glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT), which catalyzes both the glutamate- and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions; and an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction. Sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that the SGAT and GGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> fruits are located in the peroxisomes, and that the AGAT is located outside the peroxisomes, probably in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. These results confirm the existence of an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT) as an enzyme distinct from the GGAT. The results of initial velocity kinetic studies of the enzymes isolated from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea, conducted at pH 7. 1, were consistent with a Ping Pong reaction mechanism involving pyridoxal phosphate as a co-enzyme. The Km values obtained for the substrates of the enzymes were in all cases higher for the amino acid than for glyoxylate. For the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes the Km for the amino acids was about ten-fold higher than that for glyxoylate. The affinity of the snow pea enzymes for glyoxylate was less than that of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes. Alanine--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was associated with the GGAT and this activity was reversible, in contrast to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity of this enzyme. The reversible aspartate--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> developing fruits was not catalyzed by the glyoxylate aminotransferases. The pH optimum of the GGAT and the SGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> was approximately 8. 3.

Search engines, online libraries, company websites and other sources provide information in an increasingly plentiful, easy to find, and easy to digest way. Small-scale farmers continue to sell their <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> to middlemen at throw away prices yet there are exporting companies that can buy their beans at high prices for profitability. This has been brought about by the possible missing information about the <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> marketing trends and the profitability of the crop, limited access to the necessary capital to make the switch possible, poor infrastructure necessary to bring the crops to export outlets, high risk of the export markets (for instance, from hold-up problems selling to exporters), limited human capital necessary to adopt successfully a new agricultural technology, for instance the Global Good Agricultural Practices (GlobalGAP) and Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) requirements, and misperception by researchers and policy makers about the true profit opportunities and risk of crops grown for export markets. This study was conducted to assess the impact of market intelligence systems on sales revenue of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> farmers in Ol-Donyo Sabuk of Machakos County, Kenya. To achieve this overall objective, three specific objectives were addressed, namely; (1) to establish the existing <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> marketing channels in Ol-Donyo Sabuk, (2) to compare the sales revenues of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> farmers with and without market intelligence systems, and (3) to compare return on capital for different actors within the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> value chain. Systemic random sampling was used to select 120 farmers for this study. Data were collected through administering questionnaire for personal interviews. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics such as percentages, and means to answer the stated objectives. In addition, statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse data. The study revealed that 30 percent of the 120 sampled <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers had access to <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> market intelligence systems, which is a small proportions of farmers compared to those who did not have access. The results revealed that 30 percent of the 120 sampled <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers were selling their produce as a group and had access to market intelligence systems 70 percent of the 120 sampled <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers not having access to market intelligence systems thus selling their produce to brokers. The results showed that group farmers selling their product to exporters had a higher return on capital as compared to individual farmers selling their produce to middlemen. xiii Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the government and other key players in the horticulture industry enhance extension services to <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers by training them on market intelligence systems and stringent EU market requirements in order to improve on sales revenues from the crop and subsequent return on capital. Further the government establishes a <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> value addition plant that will cater for all farmers in <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> production and a high return on capital will go to Kenya economy but not to foreigners who own most of the value addition plants. This will too provide employment to many. The brokers should be removed from the production chain because they misuse farmers making profits where they did not invest and exporters would be advised to improve on their mode of produce payment and produce rejection handling. There is need to do away with hawkers and brokers within the value chain by having binding contracts and steady markets.

40|$|Yields of commercially {{important}} {{crops in}} Kenya are often far below their potential. Amongst the possible reasons for such low yields {{may be the}} ecosystem degradation that {{can be expected to}} have negative impacts on pollinator presence in cropland, and the consequent food security issue for smallholder farmers who depend on these crops for their livelihood. Our study was carried out to assess the potential pollination deficit of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), a major export vegetable crop in Kenya grown by small-scale farmers. Sufficient pollination of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> likely results in high seed set and uniform heavier green pods. Such pods get the highest grade while malformed pods are unmarketable, reducing family income. We hypothesized that pollination success was linked to the abundance and diversity of large pollinators, itself associated with the proximity to natural habitats. Flower visitors to <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> were sampled in 2011 and 2012 in ten farmer-managed plots, five within 200 m from the edge of Mt. Kenya forest and five farther away, more than 1000 m.

Flowers were observed for 2 h in each plot once weekly for three weeks at peak flowering from 0900 - 1100 h in the morning and 1200 – 1400 h in the afternoon on alternate days. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) were the most abundant visitors of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> flowers followed by carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.) and leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.).

The maximum grain yield of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (42.12  q/ha) was recorded in T 7 treatment that received combined application of 25  % N through vermicompost plus 75  % N through urea followed by T 9 treatment that received combined application of 50  % N through urea plus 50  % N through vermicompost. These {{results suggest that the}} quantity of chemical fertilizers for <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> could be reduced by 25 – 50  % due to combined application of vermicompost with chemical fertilizer. These results are comparable with those reported by Kale (1998) who suggested that the quantity of chemical fertilizers could be reduced to 25 – 50  % due to application of vermicompost for plants like brinjal, tomato, radish and carrot.|$|R

Ten samples each of three plant parts leaf and stem, flower and growing tip samples were collected at weekly intervals, in eleven field plantings in the Lockyer Valley (south-east Queensland, Australia) {{over a three-year period}} from December 2011 to June 2014. There were significantly more F. schultzei than F. occidentalis in lettuce and tomato, and significantly more F. occidentalis than F. schultzei in <b>French</b> <b>beans.</b> Zucchini supported the highest abundance of both species, with no significant difference in mean abundance. Both species displayed similar preferences for different plant parts, with significantly more in flowers compared to leaf and stem and growing tip samples. There were significantly more thrips in female zucchini flowers compared to male flowers. Thrips were present in small numbers one week after planting in all crops, with peak abundance at flowering. F. occidentalis were temporally segregated by crop age (weeks since planting), with significantly higher levels present in zucchini compared to <b>French</b> <b>bean,</b> lettuce and tomato between weeks three and six, followed by significantly higher levels in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> between weeks eight and ten. F. schultzei were temporally separated by crop age between zucchini and lettuce, with significantly higher levels present in zucchini between weeks four and six, and in lettuce between weeks eight and ten. Implications for crop monitoring are that sampling should be concentrated at pre-flowering for F. occidentalis in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and zucchini and for F. schultzei in tomato and zucchini. For lettuce, the seedling stage is most vulnerable to infestation by both species. Growers {{should be aware of the}} potential for both Frankliniella species to disperse from senescing zucchini flowers from week seven and aim to implement control strategies around this period...|$|R
40|$|The {{short-range}} diurnal dispersal {{pattern of}} adult {{western flower thrips}} Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), in relation to spatial distribution of <b>French</b> <b>beans,</b> was determined in the field. A total of 1200 adult female F. occidentalis were released on 60 <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> plants with 20 adult thrips per plant at the central release point of 3. 14 m 2. Dispersal was determined {{in terms of the}} number of thrips recorded on <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> planted on concentric circles at 0. 9, 1. 8, 3. 6, 7. 2 and 14. 4 m radii from a circular central release point for five days. Results indicated that there was a steady increase in the proportion of dispersing adult F. occidentalis from the first to the fourth day in the first planting season, and from the first to the third day in the second planting season. The peak hour for dispersal was 10. 15 h in the first season while it was 13. 15 h in the second season. Temperature and wind speed were positively associated with the dispersal activity of adult F. occidentalis. Minimal flight activity was at temperatures below 15 °C and peak flight activity was at 19 °C. The prevailing wind direction did not influence the dispersal pattern of adult F. occidentalis in both seasons. Adult F. occidentalis moved up to 7. 2 m on <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> on the first day. In both seasons, the mean direction of thrips dispersal was mostly uniformly distributed (not oriented to a particular compass direction) around the central release point. The results provide an insight into developing integrated management strategies against the pest based on isolation of farm fields, management of alterative hosts around <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> fields and insecticide application.

In NE India wilt and damping-off in beans are serious diseases which are mainly caused by Fusarium spp and Rhizoctonia solani. Out of 625 bacterial isolates obtained from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> growing fields of Manipur, 15 potential isolates were selected, whose inhibition zone width were more than 15 mm. Strain IBSD-LKBI exhibited strong antagonistic activity and can inhibit both the pathogens. Besides, this strain also produced extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (protease, chitinase, β- 1, 3 -glucanase), secondary metabolites (Siderophore, HCN). It also produces plant growth promoting hormone (IAA) and can solubilize organic phosphate. Burkholderia cepacia IBSD-LKBI exhibited the highest plant growth promotion and BCA. After 60 days of treatment, plant height, root length, fresh weight and % of disease suppression were significantly (P Burkholderia cepacia (98 %). Multiple sequence alignment & phylogram with closely related sequence accessions using MEGA Software revealed this naturally occurring biocontrol bacteria belongs to Burkholderia cepacia complex genomovar I based on the Biolog identification system with 16 S rDNA gene sequence analysis.

40|$|Western {{flower thrips}} (WFT) (Frankliniella occidentalis) is an {{introduced}} pest that harms <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> production in Kenya and other countries. Since new WFT management approaches are being developed, {{a closer look}} at the genetic makeup of WFT populations can give new insights into source habitats, crop colonization patterns or host plant preferences, which are prerequisites for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. For this purpose, we used six microsatellite loci to analyse the genetic structure, diversity and gene flow of WFT sampled on <b>French</b> <b>beans,</b> intercrops and weeds in Kenyan <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> production areas. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the available microsatellites are sufficiently polymorphic for more detailed analyses on local dispersal patterns of WFT in Kenya. Even with the limited data set, the results reveal that F. occidentalis populations show considerable genetic differentiation between host plant species but not between regions, which suggests reduced gene flow and a possible development of biotypes. Possible consequences of the results on IPM are discussed. Copyright © icipe 201...|$|R
40|$|Gentleman's agreements" {{involving}} handshakes or promissory {{market access}} possibilities through brokers and middlemen have enabled most small farmers in Kenya to export an extensive array {{of fruits and}} vegetables. However, despite rapid expansion into these forms of market linkages, {{there has been a}} dearth of empirical information regarding the factors that such marketers consider when linking small farmers to the market. This paper uses data from a 2001 <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> farmers survey conducted in Mwea Tebere Central Kenya to evaluate household and infrastructural factors determining informal linkages for <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> marketing. Logit estimates show that irrigation equipment is a prerequisite for linkage, farm localities further from central crop collection centres and close proximity of farms to source of irrigation waters, and poor accessibility of large farms preferred by brokers in linking small farmers. The results lend credence to the importance of brokers and middlemen as an emerging institution in linking small farmers to export markets in rural regions that have poor infrastructures e. g. roads. verbal agreement, logit, <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> exports, small farmers, linkage, brokers and middlemen, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
