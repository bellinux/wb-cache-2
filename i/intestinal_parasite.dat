25|$|Hookworm {{infection}} is an infection by {{a type of}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasite</b> in the roundworm group. Initially there may be itching and a rash {{at the site of}} infection. There may be no symptoms in those only affected by a few worms. In those infected by many worms there may be abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and feeling tired. The mental and physical development of children may be affected. Anemia may result.|$|E
25|$|Auto{{infection}} is {{the infection}} {{of a primary}} host with a parasite, particularly a helminth, {{in such a way}} that the complete life cycle of the parasite happens in a single organism, without the involvement of another host. This can occur with the <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasite</b> Strongyloides stercoralis. Strongyloidiasis involves premature transformation of noninfective larvae into infective larvae, which can penetrate the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perineal area (external autoinfection).|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasite,</b> Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{studying}} 553 feral cats in Northern Florida in the United States tested {{them for}} a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be Bartonella henselae, the cause of cat-scratch disease in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. Feline coronavirus was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested {{did not appear to be}} a greater risk for shedding the virus than pet cats. Researchers studying 96 feral cats on Prince Edward Island in Canada found that feline roundworm was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by Toxoplasma gondii, which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding T. gondii oocysts. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasite,</b> with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. Hopkin, asthma {{involves}} atopic allergy, {{which in}} turn involves the release of mediators that induce inflammation. [...] In 2007, Dr. Melendez and his associates studied filarial nematodes and ES-62, a protein that nematodes secrete in their host. [...] They discovered that pure ES-62 prevents the release of allergenic inflammatory mediators in mice, resulting in weaker allergic and asthmatic symptoms. [...] In the Journal of Immunology, Dr. Bashir et al. describe their experimental findings that an allergic response against peanuts is inhibited in mice infected with an <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasite.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ötzi {{apparently}} had whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), an <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasite.</b> During CT scans, {{it was observed}} that three or four of his right ribs had been cracked when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body. One of his fingernails (of the two found) shows three Beau's lines indicating he was sick three times in the six months before he died. The last incident, two months before he died, lasted about two weeks. Also, it was found that his epidermis, the outer skin layer, was missing, a natural process from his mummification in ice. [...] Ötzi's teeth showed considerable internal deterioration from cavities. These oral pathologies may have been brought about by his grain-heavy, high carbohydrate diet. DNA analysis in February 2012 revealed that Ötzi was lactose intolerant, supporting the theory that lactose intolerance was still common at that time, despite the increasing spread of agriculture and dairying.|$|E

40|$|In Brazil, malaria is {{prevalent}} in the Amazon region and these regions coincide with high prevalence of <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> but few studies explore the interaction between malaria and other parasites. Therefore, the present study evaluates changes in cytokine, chemokine, C-reactive protein, and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in 264 individuals, comparing plasma from infected individuals with concurrent malaria and <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> to individuals with either malaria infection alone and uninfected. In the studied population 24 % of the individuals were infected with Plasmodium and 18 % coinfected with <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites.</b> Protozoan parasites comprised {{the bulk of the}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> infections and subjects infected with <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> {{were more likely to have}} malaria. The use of principal component analysis and cluster analysis associated increased levels of IL- 6, TNF-α, IL- 10, and CRP and low levels of IL- 17 A predominantly with individuals with malaria alone and coinfected individuals. In contrast, low levels of almost all inflammatory mediators were associated predominantly with individuals uninfected while increased levels of IL- 17 A were associated predominantly with individuals with <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> only. In conclusion, our data suggest that, in our population, the infection with <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> (mainly protozoan) does not modify the pattern of cytokine production in individuals infected with P. falciparum and P. vivax...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} infection with <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> in 101 dogs in an animal shelter in Veracruz, Mexico, and investigate whether any general characteristics of the dogs were associated with infections. Methods: Parasitological examination of fecal samples from the dogs was performed by means of centrifuge-flotation using Sheather's sucrose and zinc sulfate flotation media. In addition, hematocrit was determined in each canine blood sample. Results: <b>Intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> were found in 99 (98. 0 %) of the 101 dogs studied. About five different <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> were identified: Ancylostoma caninum in 89 dogs (88. 1 %), Giardia canis in 46 (45. 5 %), Uncinaria stenocephala in 43 (42. 6 %), Trichuris vulpis in 19 (18. 8 %) and Strongyloides canis in 16 (15. 8 %). Multivariate analysis showed: 1) Giardia infection was associated with young age and mixed breed; 2) Ancylostoma was associated with young age and no rabies vaccination; and 3) Strongyloides was associated with no rabies vaccination. Uncinaria and Trichuris infections were not associated with the variables assessed. Conclusions: A high prevalence of <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> {{was found in the}} dogs studied.

40|$|<b>Intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> such as Toxocara canis, Giardia spp and {{hookworm}} {{represent a}} risk for dogs {{in most countries}} worldwide including South Africa, they can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea and anemia due to blood loss. But the hygiene hypothesis discusses {{the possibility that a}} decrease in parasite infections at early ages increases the incidence of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed countries. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the prevalence of infection of the different <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> with focus on Toxocara canis, Hookworm and Giarda spp in dogs using microscopic and molecular techniques. In addition, the association between Toxocara canis, hookworm and Giardia spp infections and animal health including allergic manifestations in the dog will be part of the study. This will be done by looking if an association can be found between dogs with <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> and there body condition score. In this study the following hypothesis is tested namely: if there is an association between <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites</b> and the body condition of dogs. Feces collected from the dogs were microscopically examined for <b>intestinal</b> <b>parasites.</b> These results from the microscopical examination together with the body condition score of the examined dogs were statistically analyzed using spss which resulted in an odss ratio.
