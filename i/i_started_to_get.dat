500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} for the studio sessions, the band focused on their vocal interplay by practicing barbershop quartet-style songs, which helped both Cuomo and Sharp feel more comfortable collaborating during rehearsals. Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his falsetto backing vocal: [...] "I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. After a lot of practice, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it down." [...] Fifteen songs were rehearsed for the album pre-production sessions in New York {{in preparation for the}} Electric Lady Studios recording sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: [...] "Lullaby for Wayne", [...] "I Swear It's True", [...] "Getting Up and Leaving", and a reprise version of [...] "In The Garage". The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called [...] "Mykel & Carli", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording would later be released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 Death to False Metal album). A later re-recording of [...] "Mykel & Carli" [...] would be featured as a B-side on the [...] "Undone - The Sweater Song" [...] single.|$|E

When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> approval for my acting.

In his second event, 50 metre rifle three positions, Emmons {{finished}} the qualification round in second place, 1 point behind the leader. In the ten-shot final, Emmons overtook the leader after just the first shot. Over the next eight shots, Emmons extended his lead to 3.3 points. Then his 3.3 point lead vanished when he posted a 4.4 on his final shot. He finished off the podium in 4th place. Emmons called the last shot a [...] "freak of nature". [...] "The way I come into a target is <b>I</b> <b>start</b> above the target and come down from 12 o'clock {{and get into the}} bullseye", he told reporters. [...] "And as I get down into the bullseye is when <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on the trigger (with my finger) and as <b>I</b> was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on the trigger, the gun just went off. I guess I just set it off. I got on the trigger a little too hard. I didn't feel my trigger finger shaking but I guess it was.

2500|$|Vana's {{criticism}} of the living conditions that candidates live {{in which they have}} zero contact with outsiders was also brought up a year later by contestant Aleksandra King who left the process in the fourth task, following her departure she said: [...] "I can't tell you in exact detail how much contact I was allowed with my family but, for me, the restricted contact was not good enough. I {{would have liked to have}} picked up the phone and just said, [...] "How are you guys? OK, Great." [...] I was not able to do that. I've got a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old and a five-year-old but it's the work-life balance thing because there are other mums in there who have younger kids and it was OK for them. But for me, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> slightly irritated because I felt like why is this even a business tip, what has lack of contact with my family got to do with it? It was winding me up and going on in my head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a [...] "blame culture" [...] and the atmosphere [...] "wasn't necessarily great for business".|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E
