40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} a new and relatively simple algorithm which is capable to tune the parameters of the loop filter in a phase lock loop, like the one that can be found in a global navigation satellite system receiver. The parameters are chosen while the system is running, in order to make the bandwidth of the filter adaptive with respect to the signal dynamic and strength. A wider bandwidth is obtained to make the filter more reactive when searching the carrier, while the bandwidth gets narrower when the system is in the tracking state, in order to cut off as much noise as possible. The algorithm is based on the observation of the estimated variance of the phase lock loop <b>discriminator</b> <b>output.</b> This variance is computed by means of a circular buffer and it is compared with a threshold when the buffer is full, in order to keep the bandwidth constant or to reduce it. Nonetheless, the algorithm avoids carrier unlock events due to an excessive reduction of the bandwidth, because the frequency controls are compared with the current noise equivalent bandwidth of the system, and it provides to widen the bandwidth when the signal dynamics requires it.

In this sampling scheme, one can extract both the energy and timing information for an event. In this paper, we report our prototype implementation of this sampling method and the performance results obtained with this prototype. The prototype consists of two multi-threshold discriminator boards and a time-to-digital converter (TDC) board. Each of the multi-threshold discriminator boards takes one input and provides up to 8 threshold levels, which can be defined by users, for sampling the input signal. The TDC board employs the CERN HPTDC chip that determines the digitized times of the leading and falling edges of the <b>discriminator</b> <b>output</b> pulses. We connect our prototype electronics to the outputs of two Hamamatsu R 9800 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) that are individually coupled to a 6. 25 x 6. 25 x 25 mm{sup 3 } LSO crystal.

A method for computing the autocorrelation (ACF) of the DCPM signal has been developed and the power spectral and bandwidth occupancy of DCPM signals have been obtained. It is shown that the digital SSB angle modulated signal always occupies a smaller bandwidth than the equivalent double sideband (DSB) signal. The error probability of coherent, differential phase and frequency detectors is evaluated in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the satellite mobile radio channel with narrowband receiver filters. It is shown that SSB signals perform better than DSB signals at small system bandwidths. However for the much wider bandwidths, the DSB signals perform much better as {{the effect of the}} amplitude fluctuation in the SSB signal becomes more significant in the comparison. Frequency detection of the SSB signal with the triangular pulse shape yields the worst error probability performance. A new detector named differential frequency detector is proposed {{to take advantage of the}} two possible sampling points available at the <b>discriminator</b> <b>output</b> for the DCPM signal with the triangular phase pulse shape and is demonstrated to perform better than the discriminator detector.

40|$|International audiencePARISROC is a {{front-end}} electronics ASIC {{designed for}} the next generation of neutrino experiments. These detectors will take place in megaton size water tanks and will require very large surface of photo-detection [3]. PMm 2 project proposes to segment the very large surface of photo-detection in macro pixels made of 16 photomultiplier tubes connected to an autonomous front-end electronics. The ASIC must only send out the relevant data by network to the central data storage. This data management reduces considerably the cost of these detectors. The PARISROC chip integrates 16 channels totally independents. Each analogue channel is made of a low noise preamplifier with variable and adjustable gain. The variable gain is common for all channels. The gain is also tuneable channel by channel to adjust the input detector's gain (on 8 bit). The preamplifier is followed by a slow channel for the charge measurement in parallel with a fast channel for the trigger output. The slow channel is made by a variable (50 - 200 ns) slow shaper followed by an analogue memory with depth of 2 to provide a linear charge measurement up to 50 pC; this charge is converted by a 12 bit Wilkinson ADC. The fast channel is composed of a fast shaper (15 ns) followed by 2 low offset discriminators to auto-trig down to 10 fC. The thresholds are loaded by 2 internal 10 -bit DACs common for the 16 channels. The 2 <b>discriminator</b> <b>outputs</b> are multiplexed to provide only 16 trigger outputs. Each output trigger is latched to hold the state of the response until the end of clock cycle. It is also delayed to open the hold switch on the maximum of the slow shaper.

This time is then converted by a 12 bit Wilkinson ADC. The two ADCs discriminators have a common ramp, of 8, 10 or 12 bits, as threshold to convert the charge and the fine time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a search for}} standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson using events recorded by the CDF experiment in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5. 6 fb(- 1). The search is performed using a matrix element technique in which the signal and background hypotheses are {{used to create a}} powerful <b>discriminator.</b> The discriminant <b>output</b> distributions for signal and background are fit to the observed events using a binned likelihood approach to search for the Higgs boson signal. We find no evidence for a Higgs boson, and 95 % confidence level (C. L.) upper limits are set on sigma(p (p) over bar -> WH) X B(H -> b (b) over bar). The observed limits range from 3. 5 to 37. 6 relative to the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses between m(H) = 100 GeV/c(2) and m(H) 150 GeV/c(2). The 95 % C. L. expected limit is estimated from the median of an ensemble of simulated experiments and varies between 2. 9 and 32. 7 relative to the production rate predicted by the standard model over the Higgs boson mass range studied...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn urban environments, {{standalone}} GNSS receiver architectures can {{be strongly}} affected {{to the point}} {{of not being able to}} provide a position accuracy suitable for use in vehicular applications. Specifically, the reception of GNSS signals is affected by the surrounding objects, such as high buildings, trees, lampposts and so on, which can block, shadow, reflect and diffract the received signal. As a result, two significant signal distortions are generated. On one hand, the reception of reflected or diffracted GNSS LOS echoes in addition to the direct LOS signal generates the phenomenon known as multipath. Multipath echoes represent one of the most detrimental positioning error sources in urban canyons. In fact, the reception of echoes distorts the ideal correlation function and leads to a degradation of the signal code and carrier estimations accuracy up to a loss of lock of the code and carrier tracking loops. Consequently, the pseudo-range and Doppler measurements are degraded. On the other hand, the total or partial obstruction of the GNSS LOS by the urban environment obstacles causes GNSS LOS blockage or GNSS LOS shadowing phenomena. The reception of Non-LOS (NLOS) signals introduces a bias on the pseudo-range measurements if only NLOS satellites are tracked. This bias can be very important as it is representative of the extra-path travelled by the NLOS signal compared to the theoretical LOS signal. The LOS shadowing can also decrease the LOS signal C/N 0 and thus makes the signal more vulnerable to the multipath effect. Finally, the resulting degraded measurements cause the navigation processor to compute an inaccurate position solution or even to be unable to compute one in the case of few available measurements. Therefore, advanced GNSS signal processing techniques must be implemented in order to improve the navigation solution performance in urban environments. A promising approach for reducing the effect of multipath interference and NLOS reception is vector tracking (VT), first introduced in [1] where the signal tracking and navigation solution tasks are accomplished by the central navigation filter. In comparison to conventional or scalar tracking (ST), where each visible satellite channel is being tracked individually and independently, VT exploits the knowledge of the receiver’s position and velocity that can be further used to aid the receiver’s tracking performance. In [1], the navigation filter replaces the delay lock loops (DLLs) with an Extended Kalman filter (EKF), responsible for computing the navigation solution that drives the Numerical Control Oscillator (NCOs) of each tracking channel. Vector DLL (VDLL) tracking performance of the GPS L 1 signal in weak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment and robustness against signal interference and attenuation has been demonstrated in [2], [3] and [4]. The objective of this paper is to assess the performance of the Vector Delay Frequency Lock Loop (VDFLL) architecture in multipath and NLOS reception in a dense urban environment. The most evident advantages introduced by this method are robustness to momentary and individual satellite signal blockages, channel coupling and accumulative signal power facilitating the tracking of low C/N 0 channels and an increased tracking performance in weak-signal or interference/jamming-affected environments. In this paper, a dual constellation GPS + Galileo single frequency L 1 /E 1 VDFLL architecture is presented since this type of receiver can signi?cantly improve the availability of a navigation solution in urban canyons and heavily shadowed areas: an increased satellite in-view availability is directly translated in a higher measurement redundancy and improved position reliability. In the implementation proposed in this paper, the DLL and FLL <b>discriminator</b> <b>outputs</b> for both the L 1 and E 1 tracking channels will be accommodated in the measurement vector of the EKF navigation filter. The chosen EKF navigation filter system model is a (8 x 1) position and velocity state vector, containing the six position/velocity terms in ECEF coordinates and the receiver clock bias and drift terms. The code delay and Doppler frequency estimations, computed from the EKF navigation solution, will drive in the feedback loop of the code and carrier NCO updates for each GPS BPSK and Galileo BOC tracking channels. The innovation of this work consists in the design of a dual constellation US GPS + European Galileo single frequency band L 1 /E 1 GNSS receiver, with an emphasis on the detailed mathematical formulation of EKF filter state and measurement model. In specific, great effort will be given to the description of the filter measurement innovation vector and the passage from the error to the absolute state configuration. The main objective of this paper is to perform a detailed comparison of the performance assessment between the conventional tracking, GPS-only- and dual GPS/Galileo VDFLL architectures in two different levels:- System level: expressed in terms of user’s position and velocity estimation accuracies, position and velocity errors bounding and resistance to degraded signal reception conditions;- Channel level: indicated by the code delay and carrier Doppler frequency accuracies. A realistic car trajectory in dynamic condition in urban scenario will be used. Moreover, several signal outages and significant power drops are simulated in different satellite channels in order to observe the tracking sensitivity of the proposed VDFLL architecture. 3 D positioning root mean square error (RMSE) have been computed for the conventional tracking, GPS L 1 VDFLL, and GPS/Galileo VDFLL architectures. Contrary to the conventional tracking, the L 1 /E 1 VDFLL loop is able to recover the frequency and code-delay estimation at the end of the simulated outages...|$|R
