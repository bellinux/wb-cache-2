40|$|Non-communicable diseases, {{including}} cardiovascular diseases, {{are responsible}} for over 70 % of deaths in Brazil. Currently, over 25 % of Brazilian adults are diagnosed as hypertensive; overall, current dietary sodium intake in Brazil (4700 mg/person) is over twice the international recommendations, and 70 – 90 % of adolescents and adults consume excessive sodium. National sodium reduction strategies consider the main dietary sources of sodium to be added salt to foods, foods consumed outside of the household, and sodium in processed foods. The national voluntary strategy for sodium reduction in priority <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> has been continuously monitored over a 6 -year period (2011 – 2017) {{and there was a}} significant 8 – 34 % reduction in the average sodium content of over half <b>food</b> <b>categories.</b> Different <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> have undergone differing reductions in sodium over time, aiding gradual biannual targets to allow industries to develop new technologies and consumers to adapt to foods with less salt. By 2017, most products of all <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> had met the regional targets proposed by the Pan American Health Organization, showing that voluntary sodium reduction strategies can potentially contribute to food reformulation. Nevertheless, regulatory approaches may still be necessary in the future in order to reach all food producers and to allow stronger enforcement to meet more stringent regional targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of eight phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) {{was investigated in}} 53 composite food samples from 12 <b>food</b> <b>categories,</b> collected in 2015 for a Swedish food market basket study. 2 -ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPHP), detected in most <b>food</b> <b>categories,</b> had the highest median concentrations (9 ng/g ww, pastries). It was followed by triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) (2. 6 ng/g ww, fats/oils), tris(1, 3 - (TCIPP) (0. 80 ng/g ww, pastries). Tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), and tris(2 -butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) were not detected in the analyzed food samples. The major contributor to the total dietary intake was EHDPHP (57 %), and the <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> which contributed the most to the total intake of PFRs were processed food, such as cereals (26 %), pastries (10 %), sugar/sweets (11 %), and beverages (17 %). The daily per capita intake of PFRs (TCEP, TPHP, EHDPHP, TDCIPP, TCIPP) from food ranged from 406 to 3266 ng/day (or 6 e 49 ng/kg bw/day), lower than the health-based reference doses.

40|$|Abstract: Food {{and feeding}} habits of T. zillii were studied from 572 fish samples {{collected}} from April to May 2011 (dry season) and July to August 2011 (wet season) from Lake Ziway. Stomach content {{analysis was conducted}} using frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods of analyses. Macrophytes, detritus and phytoplankton were the dominant <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> occurring in 94. 9 %, 94. 2 % and 82. 5 % of the total stomachs examined and constituting 45. 2 %, 29. 4 % and 16. 8 % of the total volume, respectively. The contributions of insets, nematodes, zooplankton and ostracods were relatively low. Macrophytes (50. 4 %), phytoplankton (21. 8 %) and detritus (18. 5 %) constituted {{the bulk of the}} food volume during the dry season. In the wet season detritus (40. 8 %), macrophytes (37. 8 %), phytoplankton (12. 5 %) and insects (6. 5 %) contributed the bulk of the <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> consumed. Phytoplankton, detritus and insects were important <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> of juveniles (5. 0 - 9. 9 cm TL) whereas macrophytes, detritus and phytoplankton were important <b>food</b> <b>categories</b> of adults.
