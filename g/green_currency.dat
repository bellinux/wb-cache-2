40|$|THE TRADITIONAL TOOL of {{monetary}} policy {{is an open}} market operation, in which the Federal Reserve purchases short-term Treasury securities from the public. The Fed pays for these purchases by crediting the deposits that the selling bank holds in an account with the Fed. These deposits {{can be thought of}} as electronic credits for cash, which banks could withdraw in the form of <b>green</b> <b>currency</b> whenever banks wished. The primary goal of open market operations was understood to be to control the available supply of reserve deposits and the money supply in order to achieve policy targets for the short-term interest rate and inflation. If the Fed wanted to increase the supply of reserve deposits on a strictly temporary basis, it would traditionally do so with a repurchase agreement (repo), acquiring an asset from the counterparty and crediting the counterparty’s Fed balance with newly created deposits, with an explicit agreement to return the asset and receive the deposits plus interest back at a 68 THE FED’S ENTRY AND EXIT STRATEGIES specified future date. Essentially repos represent a collateralized short-term loan from the Fed to private banks, which had traditionally been the Fed’s favored method for effecting a temporary increase in reserve deposits. Figure 1 displays the assets held by the Federal Reserve each week between January 2003 and June 2007. Treasury securities represented by far the most important asset over this period. The volume of repurchase agreements was much smaller than Treasuries held outright, and the high week-to-week volatility of repos resulted from the way in which this tool was used t...|$|E
