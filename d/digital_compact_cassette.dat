25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, several {{manufacturers}} {{were prepared to}} introduce read/write digital audio formats to the United States. These new formats were a significant improvement over the newly introduced read-only digital format of the compact disc, allowing consumers to make perfect, multi-generation copies of digital audio recordings. Most prominent among these formats was Digital Audio Tape (DAT), followed in the early 1990s by Philips' <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (DCC) and Sony's Minidisc.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{development}} of the cassette effectively ceased when digital recordable media, such as DAT and MiniDisc, were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Anticipating the switch from analog to digital format, major companies, such as Sony, shifted their focus to new media. In 1992, Philips introduced the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (DCC), a DAT-like tape in almost the same shell as a Compact Cassette. It was aimed primarily at the consumer market. A DCC deck could play back both types of cassettes. Unlike DAT, which was accepted in professional usage because it could record without lossy compression effects, DCC failed in both home and mobile environments, and was discontinued in 1996.|$|E

5000|$|After {{a certain}} level of {{hesitation}} over the first single, [...] "I'm in the Mood" [...] (originally produced by Soulshock and Karlin) was picked to be the final leader—though as support for [...] "Searchin'", which would be separately delivered on vinyl only to DJs. [...] "I'm in the Mood" [...] did well by itself, and with a video accompanied by a hip-hop remix from M-Doc & Jere M.C. (better known as In Da Soul) the title was on singles reproduced by David Morales for the dance floor. The song spawned Peniston's fourth No. 1 (dethroning {{from the top of the}} US Dance chart Aretha Franklin's [...] "A Deeper Love") and peaked at No. 16 in UK (#32 in the Hot 100). I guess the title tells you where I'm coming from with the new album.

5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (DCC), US Patent 4,620,311, October 1986 by Kees Schouhamer Immink.|$|E
5000|$|While at Sony, {{he worked}} on Japan's first {{magnetic}} tape recorders, portable tape recorders, music stereo systems, Betamax video, <b>digital</b> cameras, a <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> magazine-type recorder and Japan's first transistor radio. In 1964, {{a team led by}} Kihara developed the CV-2000, the world's first VTR intended for home usage. He also was instrumental in creating cassette versions of the VTR (Video Tape Recorder),established the basis for the U-matic system. In 1981, was involved {{in the development of the}} Mavica digital still camera, which used floppy disks to record images and developed the Mavigraph color video printer in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Philips' {{development}} of the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> in 1963 and Sony's {{development of}} the Walkman in 1979 led to widespread consumer use of magnetic audio tape. In 1990, the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was the dominant format in mass-market recorded music. The development of Dolby noise reduction technology in the 1960s brought audiophile quality recording to the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> also contributing to its popularity.|$|R
50|$|Philips {{named the}} {{videotape}} standard Video <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (VCC) to complement its landmark audio <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> format introduced in 1963, but the format itself was marketed under the trademark Video 2000.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> - European {{explicit}} {{version with}} 14 tracks including the track [...] "Did You Do It?" [...] This version comes with Parental Advisory label.|$|E
50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was {{intended}} as a digital replacement for the mass-market analog cassette tape, but received very little attention or adaptation. Its failure is generally attributed to higher production costs than audio CDs, and lukewarm reception by consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Recording from an {{analogue}} source {{resulted in}} a disc marked [...] "protected" [...] and [...] "original" [...] allowing one further copy to be made (this contrasts with the SCMS on the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> where analogue recording was marked as [...] "unprotected").|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} {{technically}} sound, but a nearly complete {{failure in the}} marketplace, with a very low take-up by a few audiophiles only. Apart from {{the problem of the}} bulky cassettes, the performance of <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> had improved dramatically with the use of new materials such as chromium dioxide, Dolby B noise reduction, and better manufacturing quality. For most people, the quality of <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> was adequate, and the benefits of the expensive Elcaset system limited. Audiophiles turned away from Elcaset and towards high-end <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> decks from companies like Nakamichi, which began making very high-quality tape decks using the <b>compact</b> audio <b>cassette</b> in late 1973, even three years before the Elcaset was released. The tapes they made could be played on any <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> machine. Also, the Elcaset machines were expensive. Elcaset began a fast fade-out in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The {{cassette}} itself looks {{similar to}} a <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> only larger—about twice the size. Like the earlier RCA tape cartridge, it contained 6 mm (0.25 in) tape running at 9.5 cm/s (3.75 in/s), twice the width and twice {{the speed of a}} <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> providing greater frequency response and dynamic range with lower high-frequency noise than the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> Another notable difference from <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> is that the tape is withdrawn from the cassette when run through the transport mechanism so that the manufacturing tolerances of the cassette shell will not affect sound quality. The top-of-the-line Elcaset decks also have all the features of deluxe open-reel decks, such as separate heads for erasing, recording, and playback; remote control, and heavy-duty transports for low wow & flutter.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to being issued on the popular formats of vinyl, cassette and compact disc, The Kenny Rogers Story was also issued on the short lived <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette.</b> The album was eventually deleted in the mid-1990s following {{the release of the}} similar themed collection Daytime Friends - The Very Best of Kenny Rogers.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Immink joined Philips’ {{magnetic}} recording group, where he {{contributed to the}} design of coding technologies of the digital video tape recorder, DV and the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (DCC). The DCC was short-lived: introduced in 1992 and discontinued in 1996. The DV, launched in 1994, has become a popular tape standard for home and semi-professional video production.|$|E

With the demise of these formats, SCMS is not in widespread use. However, the concept of SCMS was resurrected in the broadcast flag, a measure (and now defunct) mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to limit the copying of digital TV signals.|$|E

50|$|In 1979 the Walkman brand was introduced, in {{the form}} of the world's first {{portable}} music player using the compact cassette format. Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1992 as an alternative to Philips DCC or <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and as a successor to the compact cassette. Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the ATRAC brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.|$|E

50|$|Singles {{have been}} issued in various formats, {{including}} 7 in, 10 in, and 12-inch (30 cm) vinyl discs (usually playing at 45 rpm); 10-inch (25-cm) shellac discs (playing at 78 rpm); cassette, 8 and 12 cm (3- and 5-inch) CD singles and 7-inch (18 cm) plastic flexi discs. Other, less common, formats include singles on <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> DVD, and LD, {{as well as many}} non-standard sizes of vinyl disc (5-inch/12 cm, 8-inch/20 cm, etc.). Some artist release singles on records, a trend more common in musical subcultures.|$|E
50|$|Analog {{cassette}} deck {{sales were}} expected to decline rapidly {{with the advent of}} the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape (DAT), MiniDisc, and the CD-R recorder drives. Philips responded with the <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> a system which was backward-compatible with existing analog cassette recordings for playback, but it failed to garner a significant market share and was withdrawn. One reason proposed for the lack of acceptance of digital recording formats such as DAT was a fear by content providers that the ability to make very high quality copies would hurt sales of copyrighted recordings.|$|E
5000|$|Those who favour {{the digital}} format {{point to the}} results of blind tests, which {{demonstrate}} the high performance possible with digital recorders. The assertion is that the 'analog sound' is more a product of analog format inaccuracies than anything else. One of the first and largest supporters of digital audio was the classical conductor Herbert von Karajan, who said that digital recording was [...] "definitely superior to any other form of recording we know". He also pioneered the unsuccessful <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and conducted the first recording ever to be commercially released on CD: Richard Strauss's Eine Alpensinfonie.|$|E
