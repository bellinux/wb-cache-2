50|$|On some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the return}} and enter key {{are two different}} keys, an artifact of the differing handling of newlines by different operating systems. As an example, on the Macintosh, the return key is the usual key, while the enter key is positioned at the lower right of the numeric <b>key</b> <b>pad.</b> While using the type tool in Adobe Photoshop, the return key produces a new line while the enter key ends editing mode.|$|E
50|$|MDC-systems have {{an option}} for {{selective}} calling. By pressing a series of keys on the encoder-decoder, the base station operator can send a data packet that activates a lighted indicator or makes the radio beep. On some radio models with alphanumeric displays, the display may flash CALL until a reset button is pressed. On radio models with ten <b>key</b> <b>pads,</b> mobile radios may be programmed to selectively call one another in this manner. In order to call a radio, the calling party must know the four-digit MDC identity of the radio to be called.|$|R

5000|$|The NX {{system was}} {{developed}} by acoustician and clarinetist Arthur Benade from the 1970s {{until his death in}} 1987. [...] The NX clarinet has a distinct bore shape. In addition, differences from the standard Boehm system include: separate holes for the register key and for throat B flat, operated by a single left thumb key via an automatic mechanism; elimination of some redundant tone holes, with some resulting changes in fingering; and modifications of tone hole spacings, tone hole depths, and <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> heights to minimize turbulence in the bore.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Secure device pairing is {{especially}} difficult for spontaneous interaction in ubiquitous computing environments because of wireless communication, lack of powerful user interfaces, and scalability issues. We demonstrate {{a method to}} address this problem for small, mobile devices that does not require explicit user interfaces like displays or <b>key</b> <b>pads.</b> By shaking devices together in one hand for a few seconds, they are securely paired. Device authentication happens implicitly as part of the pairing process without the need for explicit user interaction “just for security”. Our method has been implemented in two variants: first, for high-quality data collection using wired accelerometers; second, using built-in accelerometers in standard Nokia 5500 mobile phones. ...|$|R
50|$|New {{opportunities}} arose as banks began {{rolling out}} debit {{cards in the}} mid-1990s. Verifone was quick to launch itself into this new market, producing terminals designed with <b>key</b> <b>pads</b> for customers to punch in their PIN numbers. But as the domestic credit and debit card markets neared saturation, Verifone made ready to launch itself in new directions. While continuing its international expansion, topping four million installed systems in 1994, and maintaining its manufacturing capacity, doubling production capacity with a new plant near Shanghai in China in 1994, Verifone had already evolved its primary focus to producing software applications, offering vertically integrated systems solutions, including applications for standard computer operating systems.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet {{systems in}} general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers, to which {{additive}} <b>keys</b> (from one-time <b>pads)</b> were added, encrypting the content. When used correctly {{so that the}} plain text is of equal or lesser length to a random <b>key,</b> one-time <b>pad</b> encryption is unbreakable. However, cryptanalysis by American and British code-breakers revealed {{that some of the}} one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of {{a small part of the}} traffic.|$|R
50|$|The AnyKey {{keyboard}} {{is easily}} distinguished from other generic keyboards by an extra double column of F keys {{on the left}} side, a unique eight directional arrow <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> {{as opposed to the}} traditional inverted T, and a quartet of extra keys directly above the numeric pad that control the programmable aspects of the keyboard. They are labeled “Program Macro”, “Suspend Macro”, “Repeat Rate”, and “Remap”, reading left to right. All versions of the AnyKey are white or very light gray with some keys (notably the programming keys, extra function keys, and arrows) in a darker gray.|$|E

Its <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> contains nearly 5 carats of ruby bearings. Other models include Ascent (2004), Constellation Classic (2006), Constellation Ayxta (2009), among others. Ascent phones {{are designed to be}} lightweight and durable, made of aluminium or titanium with vulcanised rubber and leather. The Classics are simple and small handsets. Ayxtas are flip phones that come in numerous variants and colors. In 2006, Vertu produced and released the Aerius Bluetooh Headset designed by Timothy Jacob Jensen.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{types of}} encryption, by their {{mathematical}} properties, cannot be defeated by brute force. An {{example of this}} is one-time pad cryptography, where every cleartext bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer - but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the Venona project, generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation: the <b>key</b> <b>pads</b> not being truly random, intercepted keypads, operators making mistakes - or other errors.|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{original}} 1981 IBM PC 83-key keyboard was criticized by typists for its non-standard {{placement of the}} [...] and left [...] keys, and {{because it did not}} have separate cursor and numeric pads that were popular on the pre-PC DEC VT100 series video terminals. In 1982, Key Tronic introduced the now standard 101-key PC keyboard. In 1984, IBM corrected the [...] and left [...] keys on its AT keyboard, but shortened the [...] key, making it harder to reach. In 1986, IBM changed to the 101 key enhanced keyboard, which added the separate cursor and numeric <b>key</b> <b>pads,</b> relocated all the function keys and the [...] keys, and the [...] key was also relocated to {{the opposite side of the}} keyboard.|$|R
50|$|Fraud {{prevention}} is a specialized type of agent-assisted automation focused on reducing ID theft {{and credit card}} fraud. ID theft and credit card fraud are huge threats for call centers and their customers and few good solutions exist, but new agent-assisted automation solutions are producing promising results. The technology allows the agents {{to remain on the}} phone while the customers use their phone <b>key</b> <b>pads</b> to enter the information. The tones are masked and the information passes directly into the customer relationship management system or payment gateway in the case of credit card transactions. The automation essentially makes it impossible for call center agents and also call center personnel that might be monitoring the calls to steal the credit card number, social security number, or other personally identifiable information.|$|R
5000|$|The TI-89 {{has been}} criticized for making some {{fundamental}} operations difficult for users to find. This design flaw, known as [...] "cryptic input", can be a drawback for students (particularly those who are used to the user-friendly interface of the previous TI-83 and TI-84 models). An example of this cryptic input is the base 10 logarithm function. Rather than having a key for the log function, users must navigate through a series of menus to find this operation. Alternatively, users can press the [...] "diamond" [...] shift key, followed by the number 7 on the <b>key</b> <b>pad.</b> However, there is no indication on the actual calculator to suggest this short-cut.|$|E

50|$|The touch tone <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> has sixteen keys {{laid out}} in a four-by-four matrix. Each key {{produces}} a combination of two audible tone frequencies, determined by their position on the pad. Each column and row has a distinct frequency assigned, thus generating a total of sixteen dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals. Early keypads only used the keys with the digits 1 through 9 and 0. The extra keys were intended for computer data entry, business functions, and military applications. By 1967, the keys with the asterisk (*) and hash (#) were added on all subscriber telephone sets. The keys A, B, C, D were used as priority signals (FO, F, I, and P) in the Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) of the US military.|$|E
