(:ru:Центральный институт труда) in Moscow, which he {{referred}} to as his [...] "last work of art". The organization of the Institute was encouraged by Lenin, who promised to allocate the initial funding of the project. The institution developed scientific approaches to work management, which in practical terms amounted to methods of training workers to perform mechanical operations in the most efficient way. Some simple repetitive operations, like the cutting of materials with a chisel, were studied in great detail. Recommendations on setting up the work processes efficiently were published.According to Figes (1996), Gastev [...] "As {{the head of the}} Central Institute of Labor, established in 1920, he carried out experiments to train the workers so that they would end up acting like machines. Hundreds of identically dressed trainees would be marched in columns to their benches, and orders would be given out by buzzes from machines. The workers were trained to hammer correctly by holding a hammer attached to and moved by a <b>hammering</b> <b>machine</b> so that after half an hour they had internalized its mechanical rhythm. The same process was repeated for chiseling, filing, and other basic skills. Gastev's aim, by his own admission, was to turn the worker into a sort of 'human robot' (a word, not coincidently, derived from the Russian verb to work, rabotat). Since Gastev saw machines as superior to human beings, he thought this would represent an improvement in humanity." ...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{stressed}} {{turbine blades}} made of Inconel 718 (DIN NiCr 19 NbMo (2. 4668); ASTM B 637; UNS N 07718) have to satisfy stringent requirements regarding durability and reliability. The impact of surface integrity on the fatigue {{strength of the}} workpiece material {{has proven to be}} of significant importance. An optimization of the surface integrity after wire EDM of Inconel 718 can be achieved using the surface finishing process <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening. <b>Machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening is an incremental forming process which has the potential to induce residual compressive stresses and strain hardening while smoothing surface asperities. As the effect of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening on surface integrity has not yet been completely investigated, this paper deals with its description and modeling of the unknown impact of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening on the fatigue strength of Inconel 718. Wire EDM and <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening parameters maximizing the fatigue strength are presented. Experimental measurements are performed to quantify the surface integrity, especially surface roughness, compressive residual stresses and strain hardening, after wire EDM and subsequent <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening. The evaluation of the effect of surface integrity on the fatigue strength is carried out using a bending fatigue strength testing machine. Additionally, a finite element model is developed to analyze the surface integrity under load and to reveal the effects of difficult-to-measure properties on the fatigue strength. Based on the new knowledge gained during this work, a model to predict the fatigue strength using similitude theory is presented. Along with the previously analyzed correlations between surface integrity and fatigue strength, this allows a constructive setting of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening parameters. Thereby, a significant new contribution to knowledge about the influence of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening on surface integrity and fatigue strength of Inconel 718 is made. The presented approach can be easily transferred to other materials and workpiece geometries...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Silica is an {{inorganic}} material {{that found in}} the nature in various forms. The hazards of crystal of silica or α-quartz (free silica) is greater than other forms. Exposure to dust that contains free silica result to pulmonary injury and result to silicosis and death finally. The present research was conducted in order to evaluate the level of workers exposure to free silica in air of Khaf Iron stone quarries. "nMaterials and methods: The exposure level to total and respiratory dust measured based on personal and environmental sampling methods and concentration of dust determined based on gravimetric method. For determination of amounts of free silica, dust samples analyses based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, and results compared with standard levels. "nResults: The maximum amount of total dust and free silica measured in stone breaking station (800 ± 155 mg/m 3 and 26. 11 ± 6. 7 mg/m 3) and minimum of them measured in official and safeguarding station (8. 28 ± 2. 2 mg/m 3 and 0. 012 ± 0. 0019 mg/m 3). The maximum amount of respiratory dust and free silica measured in red mound digging number 1 (66. 14 ± 13. 45 mg/m 3 and 1. 48 ± 0. 39 mg/m 3) and minimum of them measured in air <b>hammer</b> <b>machine</b> station (5. 26 ± 2. 62 mg/m 3 and 0. 01 ± 0. 005 mg/m 3).

40|$|The {{first known}} {{drawings}} of machines {{can be found}} in warfare-themed manuscripts. The oldest of them dates back to the 14 th century, but their proliferation took place in the 15 th century. During the century an almost standardized drawing style, vocabulary was developed, which also survived throughout the Renaissance. Compared to the relatively high number of the survived warfare-related manuscripts that included drawings (their number is above 50), the representation of machines for civil usage is very rare throughout the century, even though the architectural drawings also proliferated during this century, and they also introduced a distinct representation style. The survived portfolio of the Strasbourg master builder Hans Hammer lies at the intersection of this two disciplines: it includes both machine and architectural drawings in a large number. Given the occupation of the master, it can safely assumed that in contrast to those found in the majority of the contemporary machine drawings, his machines served civil purposes. In this article the following questions are discussed: how do Hans <b>Hammer’s</b> <b>machine</b> drawings fit in the corpus of the contemporary machine drawings both by drawing style and function; and with which manuscripts can a direct connection be made...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} strength of rock {{is one of}} the most important factors of concern to engineers involved in mining operations. Information about rock strength is used in rock excavation planning and design operations in civil and mining engineering. Drilling is widely carried out in hard rocks for blasting the rock mass so that the blasted material can be easily loaded by the excavators. The drillability of rock depends on many factors including rock properties whereas properties such as compressive strength, porosity, density etc. are uncontrollable parameters during drilling process. A number of studies have been reported recently on the application of sound level which have been concentrated on using either CNC or jack <b>hammer</b> <b>machine</b> for drilling purpose. It is worth mentioning that neither CNC <b>machine</b> nor jack <b>hammer</b> drill set-up is the normal way of drilling in rock, nor in mining, civil or any other operations, not even in working with rock in installation of countertops. Therefore, it is difficult to exactly say whether the noise generated during drilling is only from the rock drilling or from the drilling unit itself. In view of the above, it is important to fabricate a new drilling set-up which is a silent unit in itself. Such unit when used for drilling purpose will clearly indicate the change in sound level produced with different rock properties...|$|R
40|$|Composite materials, {{including}} Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars, {{have been}} gaining momentum as alternatives to traditional steel reinforcements in civil and structural engineering sectors. FRP materials are non-corrosive, non-conductive, and lightweight and possess high longitudinal tensile strength, which are advantageous {{for their use}} in civil infrastructure. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental investigation into the effects of the use of glass FRP (GFRP) bars as internal reinforcement on the behaviour of concrete beams. Both static and dynamic (impact) behaviours of the beam have been investigated. Twelve GFRP reinforced concrete (RC) beams were designed, cast and tested. Six GFRP RC beams were tested under static loading to examine the failure modes and associated energy absorption capacities. The remaining six GFRP RC beams were tested under impact loading using a drop <b>hammer</b> <b>machine</b> at the University of Wollongong. GFRP RC beams with higher reinforcement ratio showed higher post cracking bending stiffness and experienced flexural-critical failure under static loading. However, GFRP RC beams under impact loading, regardless of their shear capacity, experienced a 2 ̆ 2 shear plug 2 ̆ 2 type of failure around the impact zone. Energy absorption capacities of beams were determined. The average dynamic amplification factor was calculated as 1. 15, indicating higher dynamic moment capacities compared to static moment capacities (15 - 20...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} causes of injury and loss of life in {{structures}} subjected to blast loading is the glass windows. Common window glass is annealed glass. When annealed glass is subjected to impulsive loads {{such as the one}} generated by a blast, it breaks into relatively large shards with sharp cutting edges. This is responsible for for most of the injuries incurred in explosions. In the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, more than 75 % of the injuries were due to flying shards of glass. The current approach to testing blast-resistant glazing materials such as polycarbonates and laminated glass is to carry out tests in either a shock tube or an open-air arena. Limited access to such facilities is the main obstacle hampering the development of standardised tests for glazing under blast loading conditions. This paper will present a simple and economical physical simulation technique for testing glass panels under impact and blast loading conditions. A technique that can generate pressure shocks simulating blasts of different magnitude and duration is based on a high-capacity drop <b>hammer</b> <b>machine</b> to produce impulsive loads which are distributed over the glass panel using the airtight chamber with a fluid medium. Experimental and numerical simulation results for the annealed glass panels with and without fragment retention films will demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to deliver a blast impulse with a given characteristic...|$|R

25|$|With his description, it is {{seen that}} the {{out-of-date}} Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer (Chinese: 水碓 Pinyin: shui dui; Wade–Giles: shui tui). The Han Dynasty scholar and poet Ma Rong (79–166 AD) mentioned {{in one of his}} poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'. As described in the Hou Han Shu, in 129 AD the official Yu Xu gave a report to Emperor Shun of Han that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western Qiang people by way of canals through the Qilian Mountains. In his Rou Xing Lun, the government official Kong Rong (153–208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old). During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer Du Yu established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to work off one large waterwheel. In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip <b>hammer</b> <b>machines,</b> such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China. There are numerous references to trip hammers during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there are Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) references that report the use of trip hammers in papermills of Fujian Province.|$|R
