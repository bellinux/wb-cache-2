25|$|Yet another {{variation}} on the minifigure is the magnet figure, from such themes as Star Wars, Batman, Indiana Jones and City. The magnet figures {{are not included in}} regular sets but are instead sold in packs of three or more. Some of these include accessories and <b>display</b> <b>base</b> bricks. These figures include magnets in their legs, which allow them to stick to metal surfaces. Magnet figures are nearly indistinguishable from stand figures in appearance. Unlike the LUL figures, only the torso and the hips of magnet minifigures are inseparable.|$|E

To date only a single series of figures have been produced: Batman, the Riddler, the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman and exclusive to a boxset Robin. Two Batman variants were also produced a limited SDCC exclusive figure with an action feature that replicates the famous Batusi dance and a Surf's Up Batman figure complete with surfboard and trunks. Each figure has the likeness of their respective actor (with Catwoman resembling Newmar and the Riddler resembling Gorshin) and came packaged with a <b>display</b> <b>base</b> and collector card. A Batmobile was also sold to retail making {{this the first time}} the classic model has been produced for action figures in the 6-inch scale.|$|E

However, the transient response of passive matrix <b>displays</b> <b>based</b> on polymer and organic light-emitting diodes limits display resolution, image uniformity, and image contrast.
