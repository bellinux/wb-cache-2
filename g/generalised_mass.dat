40|$|This paper {{presents}} a trajectory-tracking control strategy {{for a class}} of mechanical systems in Hamiltonian form. The class is characterised by a simplectic interconnection arising {{from the use of}} generalised coordinates and full actuation. The tracking error dynamic is modelled as a port-Hamiltonian Systems (PHS). The control action is designed to take the error dynamics into a desired closed-loop PHS characterised by a constant mass matrix and a potential energy with a minimum at the origin. A transformation of the momentum and a feedback control is exploited to obtain a constant <b>generalised</b> <b>mass</b> matrix in closed loop. The stability of the close-loop system is shown using the close-loop Hamiltonian as a Lyapunov function. The paper also considers the addition of integral action to design a robust controller that ensures tracking in spite of disturbances.

40|$|An {{essential}} part of mathematical modelling is the accurate and reliable estimation of model parameters. In biology, the required parameters are particularly difficult to measure due to either shortcomings of the measurement technology {{or a lack of}} direct measurements. In both cases, parameters must be estimated from indirect measurements, usually in the form of time-series data. Here, we present a novel approach for parameter estimation that is particularly tailored to biological models consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. By assuming specific types of nonlinearities common in biology, resulting from <b>generalised</b> <b>mass</b> action, Hill kinetics and products thereof, we can take a three step approach: (1) transform the identification into an observer problem using a suitable model extension that decouples the estimation of non-measured states from the parameters; (2) reconstruct all extended states using suitable nonlinear observers; (3) estimate the parameters using the reconstructed states. The actual estimation of the parameters is based on the intrinsic dependencies of the extended states arising from the definitions of the extended variables. An important advantage of the proposed method is that it allows to identify suitable measurements and/or model structures for which the parameters can be estimated. Furthermore, the proposed identification approach is generally applicable to models of metabolic networks, signal transduction and gene regulation...|$|E
40|$|Modification of neutron and proton driplines by {{the capture}} of strange hyperon(s) by normal nuclei has been investigated. A <b>generalised</b> <b>mass</b> formula (BWMH) based on the strangeness {{dependent}} extended liquid drop model {{is used to calculate}} the binding energy of normal nuclei as well as strange hypernuclei. The neutron (Sn) and proton (Sp) separation energies of all hypernuclei with neutral hyperons Lambda, double Lambda or charged hyperons Cascade(-), Theta(+) inside are calculated using BWMH mass formula. The normal neutron and proton driplines get modified due to the addition of the hyperon(s) (Lambda, double Lambda, Cascade(-), Theta(+) etc.) to the core of normal nuclei. The hypernuclei containing the charged hyperon(s) like those with neutral hyperon(s) have similar nucleon separation energies like core nuclei if proton number instead of net charge is used in the symmetry term. Due to the effect of opposite charges present in Theta(+) and Cascade(-), hyperons their corresponding driplines get separated from each other. All the hyperons modify mean field potential due to strong hyperon-nucleon coupling. Addition of a single charged hyperon in normal nuclei affects the entire proton drip line more prominently than that by neutral hyperon. The neutral hyperonic effect on proton dripline is significant for lighter nuclei than for heavier ones whereas both the charged as well as neutral hyperons affect almost the entire neutron dripline.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{boundary}} {{conditions on the}} mode count and modal density of one- and two-dimensional structural systems, beams and plates, respectively, are investigated by using the wavenumber integration method. Bending vibrations are examined first for a single beam. In this case it is demonstrated that the average mode count is reduced by between 0 and 1 for each boundary constraint, {{depending on the type}} of boundary conditions. For more <b>generalised</b> <b>mass</b> and stiffness constraints a frequency-dependent coefficient, which need not lie between 0 and 1, is obtained. The effects of line constraints on the mode count of two-dimensional systems are similar to the equivalent one-dimensional constraints but they are always frequency dependent. Then the mode count of systems of multiple collinear beams and coplanar plates is studied. It is found that an intermediate constraint has the same effect on the average mode count as the same type of constraint applied at an end of the system. The modal density is largely independent of boundary conditions for one-dimensional systems although there are exceptions, while it is dependent on boundary conditions for two-dimensional systems. The results are compared with those from previously published formulae for natural frequencies and with results from finite element method (FEM) analysis. Inclusion of the effect of the boundary conditions in statistical energy analysis (SEA) estimations will result in improved agreements with both analytical and numerical results...|$|E

We present the sufficient conditions on the <b>generalised</b> Vaidya <b>mass</b> function, that will generate a locally naked singular end state. Our analysis here generalises all the earlier works on collapsing higher dimensional generalised Vaidya spacetimes.

Hence for these classes of mass function Cosmic Censorship gets restored in higher dimensions and the transition to higher dimensions restricts the set of initial data that results in a naked singularity.

40|$|The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (hereafter {{referred}} to as the 1951 Convention) was passed on 28 July 1951. Twenty-six states were represented in the negotiations and the Convention was adopted by 24 votes to 0. 1 The Convention was drafted to deal with the situation in post-Second World War Europe, where the developing Cold War had caused approximately 200, 000 people to flee the Communist bloc each year since 1945, on top of the 400, 000 people still needing resettlement following the Second World War. 2 The Convention defined a refugee as a person who had fled their homeland because of ‘a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion’ (Article 1). The adoption of political persecution as the only legitimate cause of flight, and the temporal and geographical limitations imposed on those wishing to seek protection (protection was availed only to those seeking asylum due to events prior to 1 January 1951 within Europe), meant that the Convention was not universal in providing protection for refugees.

40|$|An {{important}} bottleneck in the modelling {{of biological}} systems is {{the scarcity of}} experimental data on kinetic parameters. Recent advances in measurement technologies increase the feasibility of infer ring these parameters from time series data (Anguelova et al., 2007; Voit and Almeida, 2004). We present a methodology for estimating kinetic parameters from time series data, {{in a way that}} is particularly tailored to biological models consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, in particular for systems in which the nonlinearities are polynomial, such as in mass action or <b>generalised</b> <b>mass</b> action kinetics, or rational functions of the states, as in Michaelis-Menten or Hill kinetics. The proposed approach consists of three steps. First, the system is transformed into an ex-tended system in observer normal form. The extended system does only depend on structural information, not on the value of the parameters (Xia and Zeitz, 1997; Fey et al., 2008). This allows to design a high-gain observer estimating the states of the extended system (Vargas and Moreno, 2005). As the extended system is not observable everywhere, but only trajectory ob-servable, the observer can only be an approximate observer. However, the observer error can be chosen to be arbitrarily small. In a final step, the parameters are determined based on the observer states, as the unique solutions of simple nonlinear functions of these states. Thus, the proposed parameter scheme estimates is a global estimation algorithm. The parameter estimation methodology is illustrated on a simple model of the circadian rhythm in neurospora (Leloup et al., 1999). The model contains three species, six reactions and exhibits autonomous oscillations corresponding to the day-night cycle The proposed observer-based pa-rameter estimation method is able to recover all parameters, even if the trajectory comes close to singularities of the observability...|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of mode shapes and dynamic response of bending-torsion coupled beams is assessed {{by using the}} concept of <b>generalised</b> <b>mass.</b> In {{the first part of}} this investigation, the free vibratory motion of bending-torsion coupled beams is studied in detail. The conventional method of interpreting the normal modes of vibration consisting of bending displacements and torsional rotations is shown to be inadequate and replaced by an alternative method which is focussed on the constituent parts of the generalized mass arising from bending and torsional displacements. Basically, the generalized mass in a particular mode is identified and examined in terms of bending, torsion and bending-torsion coupling effects. It is demonstrated that the contribution of individual components in the expression of the generalized mass of a normal mode is a much better indicator in characterizing a coupled mode. It is also shown that the usually adopted criteria of plotting bending displacement and torsional rotations to describe a coupled mode can be deceptive and misleading. In the second part of the investigation, attention is focussed on the dynamic response characteristics of bending-torsion coupled beams when subjected to random bending or torsional loads. A normal mode approach is used to establish the total response. The input random excitation is assumeed to be stationary and ergodic so that with the linearity assumption, the output spectrum of the response is obtained by using the frequency response function. The contribution of each normal mode to the overall response is isolated. Particular emphasis is placed on bending-induced torsional response and torsion-induced bending response. A number of case studies involving different types of bending-torsion coupled beams with cantilever end conditions are presented. The limitations of existing methods of modal interpretation are highlighted, and an insight into the mode selection for response analysis is provided...|$|E

40|$|When {{cellular}} materials are {{immersed in a}} solution of high concentration, the mass transfer is considered a multi-component transport process in which simultaneous and countercurrent flows occur in the biological tissue. The mass transfer process of each component in the solid–liquid system is affected not only by operational parameters, {{but also by the}} presence of other components. The main driving force for the mass transfer phenomena is attributed to the concentration gradient between external and internal solid material, and the interaction among fluxes and tissue matrix. Matrix deformation and tissue shrinkage are important characteristics influencing mass transfer.

40|$|Black hole mass {{determination}} {{in active}} galaxies {{is a key}} issue in understanding various luminosity states. In the present paper we try to <b>generalise</b> the <b>mass</b> determination method based on the X-ray excess variance, successfully used for typical broad line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS 1) to Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS 1) galaxies. NLS 1 galaxies differ from BLS 1 with respect to several properties. They are generally more variable in 2 - 10 keV energy band so the natural expectation {{is the need to}} use a different scaling coefficient between the mass and the variance in these two types of sources. However, we find that such a simple approach is not enough. Although for majority of the 21 NLS 1 galaxies in our sample a single scaling coefficient (larger by a factor 20) provided us with a satisfactory method of mass determination, in a small subset of NLS 1 galaxies this approach failed. Variability of those objects appeared to be at the intermediate level between NLS 1 and BLS 1 galaxies. These exceptional NLS 1 galaxies have much harder soft X-ray spectra than majority of NLS 1 galaxies. We thus postulate that the division of Seyfert 1 galaxies into BLS 1 and NLS 1 according to the widths of the Hbeta line is less generic than according to the soft X-ray slope.

40|$|This {{study is}} laid out in 8 self-explanatory sections. The Introduction sets the scene for the thesis by {{describing}} the reasoning behind the study, defines terms and introduces the reader to the markets for amphibious aircraft which drive the design requirements. An overall floatplane design methodology is developed. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the 2 practical float configurations are identified, which result in a basic configuration choice methodology. A method of initially estimating float dimensions and mass for a required displacement is developed from existing references and the aircraft and float databases. Initial float support structure design solutions are proposed based, again, on the information from the databases. A method of positioning the resultant float and structure configuration relative to the existing land-based aircraft centre of gravity is then developed using existing guidance on lateral and longitudinal water-borne static stability and the aircraft database. Guidance on the initial purchase price of floats is gained from a study of commercially available items. The changes in performance due to fitting floats to a conventional aircraft are studied along with a drag comparison study of the main configurations. The work on flyingboats develops an overall flyingboat design methodology which identifies key areas where design methods are required. These methods are developed leading to initial configuration choice methodologies based on a series of <b>generalised</b> <b>mass,</b> configuration and role classifications. Having decided on the overall configuration, tools are developed to choose the method of providing on-water lateral stability and to complete the initial sizing of that choice. A method of estimating initial planing bottom dimensions is developed along with step position and configuration. Tools to estimate the mass of flyingboat-specific items are developed including planing bottom structure and the choice of lateral stability method. Knowing the mass and configuration of the flyingboat allows spray estimation and detailed on-water static stability calculations to be completed to check the acceptability of the initial configuration and dimensions. Performance estimation methods including take-off and landing, aerodynamic drag and on-water dynamic stability are proposed. Logistic support infrastructure, safety and water loading are common to both floatplanes and flyingboats and these are discussed in a separate section, along with a method of allocating values to amphibious aircraft design attributes to measure the success of the design. The methodologies are then used to design 5 floatplanes and 5 flyingboats based on a crosssection of relevant aircraft specification types. This use of the methodologies illustrates that the concept of a linked series of tools to complete the rapid conceptual design of an amphibious aircraft has been successfully achieved. A discussion chapter summarises the key discoveries in each of then former chapters and a conclusion details how the study's aim to develop integrated conceptual design methodologies for waterborne and amphibious aircraft has been successfully achieved. The study's contribution to knowledge, which includes mass, sizing, performance and cost equations for both floatplanes and flyingboats, are also detailed. A list of further work is included which concentrates on the need for further empirical information to increase confidence in the methodologies.

40|$|AbstractIn part I of {{this paper}} we have deduced <b>generalised</b> Einstein <b>mass</b> {{variation}} formulae assuming relative frame velocities v c. We again use {{the notion of the}} residual mass m 0 (v) which for v>c is defined by the equation m(v) =m 0 (v) [(v/c) 2 - 1]- 1 / 2 for the actual mass m(v). The residual mass is essentially the actual mass with the Einstein factor removed, and we emphasise that we make no restrictions on m 0 (v). Using this formal device we deduce corresponding new mass variation formulae applicable to superluminal relative frame velocities, assuming only the extended Lorentz transformations and their consequences, and two invariants that are known to apply in special relativity. The present authors have previously speculated a dual framework such that both the rest mass m 0 ∗ and the residual mass at infinite velocity m∞∗ (by which we mean p∞∗/c, assuming finite momentum at infinity) are equally important parameters in the specification of mass as a function of its velocity, and the two arbitrary constants can be so determined. The new formulae involving two arbitrary constants may also be exploited so that the mass remains finite at the speed of light, and two distinct mass profiles are determined as functions of their velocity with the rest mass assumed to be alternatively prescribed at the origin of either frame. The two profiles so obtained (M(U),m(u)) and (M∗(U),m∗(u)) although distinct have a common ratio M(U) /M∗(U) =m(u) /m∗(u) that is a function of v>c, indicating that observable mass depends upon the frame in which the rest mass is prescribed...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{modelling}} of {{the potential}} failure modes in the rock mass is an essential task towards a robust design of roof support systems in coal mines. The use of <b>generalised</b> rock <b>mass</b> properties based on averaged properties (e. g. Hoek-Brown model) {{has been found to}} limit the capability to reproduce the actual rock mass behaviour which may include a wide range of interacting and complex failure mechanisms such as shear and tension fracturing of the intact rock and shear and separation of pre-existing discontinuities, including re-activation. Recent studies have also shown that traditional models, such as the Mohr-Coulomb, may not accurately describe the behaviour of the intact rock, particularly for stress induced failures where spalling and slabbing are observed. This is mainly due to the cohesion and friction components of the shear strength of the intact rock not being mobilised at the same rate with strain-softening of the former component playing an essential role in the post peak behaviour. In addition, coal measure rocks are often transversely isotropic, both by way of the preferred orientation of clay particles within the finer grained lithology and by bedding textures and bedding partings, and this is often ignored in computer simulations. A newly developed transversely isotropic brittle rock mass model is applied in the simulation of a hypothetical and simple roadway development. A Cohesion Weakening - Friction Strengthening (CWFS) approach is adopted to describe the intact rock where the mobilisation and strain-softening of the two shear strength components are linked to plastic deformation. Failure and plastic deformations are also allowed to develop along any number of ubiquitous joint sets using a conventional Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and applying the stress-strain correction accordingly. The impacts of anisotropy and brittle rock {{on the development of the}} excavation disturbed zone or height of softening, as often referred to, are investigated and their implication in the roof support design discussed...|$|R
