5000|$|Champagne is {{primarily}} a product of vast blending - of different grape varieties, different vintages and different vineyards - with a typical non-vintage blend being composed of grapes from up to 80 different vineyards. However, for their prestige cuvee (such as Moët et Chandon's Dom Pérignon or Louis Roederer's Cristal) Champagne producers will often limit the grape sources to only Grand cru (and sometimes Premier crus) vineyards. While single vineyard Champagnes are rare, they do exist, such as Krug's Clos du Mesnil coming from the Grand cru vineyard located near Le Mesnil-sur-Oger. <b>Grower</b> <b>Champagnes,</b> {{the product of a}} single producer and vineyard owner, located in Grand cru villages will often label their wines [...] "100% Grand cru" [...] if their wines qualify for the designation.|$|R
5000|$|In the Champagne region, the {{production}} of Champagne is largely {{in the hands of}} producers who purchase grapes from independent growers. While some growers today produce wines under their own labels (known collectively as [...] "grower Champagne"), in the early 20th century the immense amount of capital needed to produce Champagne was beyond the reach of most <b>growers.</b> <b>Champagne</b> houses were able to bear the large risk of losing a considerable amount of product from exploding bottles as well as the cost of maintaining storage facilities for the long, labor-intensive process of making Champagne. This dynamic created a system that favored the Champagne houses as the only source of revenue for the vineyard owners. If the Champagne houses did not buy their grapes, a grower had little recourse or opportunity for another stream of income.|$|R

5000|$|A common {{criticism}} of Grower Champagnes {{is the potential}} for variable quality, especially from vintage to vintage. While the larger Champagne houses and negociants have the flexibility to buy grapes from all over the Champagne region, <b>Grower</b> <b>Champagne</b> makers are limited to only their vineyard holdings. Conversely, advocates of Grower Champagnes say that the blending of many terroirs by the larger houses makes those wines [...] "underflavored" [...] and non-distinctive.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Selosse is a <b>grower</b> <b>Champagne,</b> {{which means}} the grapes used to produce the wines are grown in {{vineyards}} owned by the winery rather than being purchased from other growers, {{as is the case}} in most Champagne production. The entire production is grown according to biodynamic principles and Anselme is considered a pioneer of biodynamics in Champagne. Selosse wines are fermented using oak barrels, in contrast to the majority of Champagne producers who use stainless steel tanks.|$|E
50|$|His {{particular}} type of wine is known as <b>Grower</b> <b>Champagne,</b> where grapes used to produce the wines are grown in vineyards owned by the Selosse family, rather than being purchased from other growers. He {{was one of the}} first winemakers to show that small producers can make their own wine. Anselme is considered a pioneer of biodynamics in Champagne and grows his grapes in an organic way. Selosse wines are fermented in oak barrels, in contrast to the majority of Champagne producers who often use stainless steel tanks. Consequently, the wines are often described as artisnal.|$|E

5000|$|With {{vineyard}} owners vastly outnumbering the producers, the Champagne houses {{used this}} dynamic of excess supply vs limited demand to their advantage. They hired agents, known as commissionaires, to negotiate prices with vine growers. These commissionaires were paid {{according to how}} low a price they could negotiate and many employed unsavory tactics to achieve their means-including violence and intimidation. Some commissionaires openly sought bribes from vine growers, often {{in the form of}} extra grapes which they would sell themselves for extra profit. The prices they were able to negotiate barely covered the cost of farming and harvesting which left many Champenois vine growers in poverty. With the constant threat of Champagne houses ignoring the law and using more [...] "foreign" [...] grapes, tensions were already high between vine <b>growers</b> and <b>Champagne</b> houses when the late 19th century and early 20th century brought with it the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic and a string of poor weather and poor vintages. The tensions culminated in the Champagne riots of 1910 and 1911. To avoid the type of situation which led to the riots, producers and <b>growers</b> of the <b>Champagne</b> region formed an agreement that developed the Échelle des Crus system where prices would be set by a joint committee of producers and growers, fairly applied and based on the presumed quality of a village's vineyards. In recent times there has been discussion of modifying the classification and going to a [...] "Burgundy-like" [...] system whereby vineyards, rather than villages, would be the basis of ratings. Critics charge that a system based on rating an entire village ignores terroir differences within the large area of a village.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>growers</b> and <b>Champagne</b> producers {{was not the only}} source of tension. Within the Champagne region itself there was civil discontent among neighbors as to what truly represented [...] "Champagne". The French Government tried to answer the vine growers concerns by passing legislation defining where Champagne wine was to come from. This early legislation dictated that the Marne department and a few villages from the Aisne department were the only areas approved to grow grapes for Champagne production. The glaring exclusion of the Aube region, where Troyes, the historic capital of Champagne, is located, promoted further discontent as the Aubois protested the decision. The Aube, located south of the Marne, was closer to the Burgundy region in terms of soil and location. The growers of the Marne viewed the region as [...] "foreign" [...] and not capable of producing true Champagne but the Aubois viewed themselves as Champenois and clung to their historical roots.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, Lyons {{worked as}} a wine {{merchant}} for Justerini & Brooks in Edinburgh before moving to London with the company in 2000. It was while working for Justerini & Brooks in St James's street that Lyons received the opportunity to sell and taste a great many fine and rare wines particularly Bordeaux and Burgundy. Lyons {{has said that it}} was during this period that he developed a deep love of the classic wines of France. In 2001 Lyons moved to Lea & Sandeman where he was introduced to the quality of individual <b>grower</b> <b>Champagne</b> and Italian wine.|$|E
50|$|Grower Champagnes are {{sparkling}} wines {{made in the}} Champagne {{region of}} France that are produced by the same estate that owns the vineyards from which the grapes come. While large Champagne houses, such as Mumm, may use grapes sourced from as many as 80 different vineyards, Grower Champagnes {{tend to be more}} terroir-focused, being sourced from a single vineyard or closely located vineyards around a village. Today there are over 19,000 independent growers in the Champagne region, accounting for nearly 88% of all vineyard land in the region. Around 5000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes. A <b>Grower</b> <b>Champagne</b> can be identified by the initials RM (Récoltant-Manipulant) on the wine label.|$|E
5000|$|Grower Champagnes {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "artisanal winemaking" [...] with terroir being at the forefront for each wine, rather than an emphasis on a consistent [...] "house style" [...] that can be made year after year. While large Champagne houses, such as Moët et Chandon may source grapes from the entire Champagne region, the vineyards owned by a <b>Grower</b> <b>Champagne</b> maker are generally clustered around a single village. Some growers will craft their wine to reflect the terroir of that village, especially if they own vineyards in one of Champagne's Grand crus. Grower Champagnes are often released younger than their large house counterparts due, in part, to the greater financial resources that would be needed for long term aging and storage. Many also show a lower dosage, and occasionally no dosage at all, than most negociant manipulant bottlings.|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} 19,000 {{independent}} <b>growers</b> in the <b>Champagne</b> region, accounting for nearly 88% of all vineyard {{land in the}} region. Around 5000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes. The larger Champagne houses have holdings in only 12% of the region's vineyards, making it a necessity for them to buy grapes from independent growers. Under current Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations, there are strict limitations on planting. Some growers are seeing an economic advantage in making wine from their own grapes, especially if they have land in one of Champagne's Grand cru villages, rather than selling them to the larger houses where they {{become part of a}} generic blend.|$|R
40|$|In <b>Champagne,</b> France grape <b>growers</b> and and winemakers work {{together}} {{to make the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most iconic sparkling wine. Part of what makes Champagne so celebrated is its reputation for constant quality: only the best grapes are used to make wine. In poor vintage years, grape growers sell less grapes to winemakers; poor vintages are the result of bad weather. This presents the opportunity for grape growers to hedge the risk of poor weather and resulting lower harvest values with weather derivatives. This study explores the potential for grape growers to trade them to effectively hedge against low harvest values by hedging against cooler weather in the month of June, when grape vines are flowering and sensitive to cold, through an empirical study of historical grape harvest and temperature data from 1952 through 2011. Weather derivatives would have provided an effective hedge against low harvest values up through 1991. After 1991, harvest sizes and therefore harvest revenues are no longer significantly correlated with weather and weather derivatives no longer provide an effective hedge against low harvest values for grape <b>growers</b> in <b>Champagne...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Champagne Riots of 1910 and 1911 {{resulted}} {{from a series of}} problems faced by grape <b>growers</b> in the <b>Champagne</b> area of France. These included four years of disastrous crop losses, the infestation of the phylloxera louse (which destroyed 15000 acre of vineyards that year alone), low income and the belief that wine merchants were using grapes from outside the Champagne region. The precipitating event may have been the announcement in 1908 by the French government that it would delimit by decree the exact geographic area that would be granted economic advantage and protection by being awarded the Champagne appellation. This early development of Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée regulation benefitted the Marne and Aisne districts to the significant exclusion of the Aube district which included the town of Troyes—the historic capital of the Champagne region.|$|R
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>Grower</b> <b>Champagne</b> {{is a relatively}} recent phenomenon. Since the 18th century, Champagne houses have dominated the business dynamic in the region. These private houses or negociants would buy grapes from the owners of several vineyards to blend and make Champagne. As of 2003, there were over 3,700 brands of Grower Champagnes available for purchase within France but only around 130 brands in the United States. [...] As of 2008, these wines accounted for less than 3% of Champagne market, with that market growing as the wines continue to increase in popularity. Distributors and wine retailers tend to tout the comparative value and lower cost of Grower Champagnes versus the wines of larger Champagne houses, due to the larger Champagne houses' costs of mass market advertising. The smaller Growers {{leave it up to}} the importer and wine retailer to market their wines.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II, {{the sales}} and {{popularity}} of Champagne surged once more. Since 1950, sales have grown steadily, quadrupling in total to over 200 million bottles. The increase in worldwide demand has prompted the French authorities {{to look into}} expanding the region's AOC zone to facilitate more production. There still exist the business dynamic between vine <b>growers</b> and <b>Champagne</b> houses with majority of the region's 19,000 growers selling their grapes to the nearly 300 Champagne houses in production. Over time Champagne has become not only {{a reflection of the}} terroir of the Champagne region but also a brand in itself, with the Champenois vigorously defending that brand and the uses of the term [...] "Champagne". The popularity and success of Champagne has inspired many imitators around the world (such as Cava in Spain, Sekt in Germany and several American sparklers) but also within France itself with sparkling Cremants. The name [...] "Champagne" [...] is a protected designation of origin in the European Union and all wines produced and sold in the EU must conform to those standards and not label a wine as [...] "Champagne" [...] unless it comes from the Champagne AOC (in the United States there is a legal loophole for semi-generic terms). In 1985, use of the term méthode champenoise was also outlawed with producers of [...] "champagne style" [...] sparkling wine opting to uses phrases like méthode traditionnelle to signify that their wine is made using the same production methods as Champagne.|$|R
5000|$|The Cognac Appellation d'origine contrôlée {{is divided}} into six crus {{corresponding}} to the growing areas called Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois, Bons Bois and Bois Ordinaires. The crus’ delimitation, according to geological and sampling criteria of the eau-de-vies, was carried out during the 19th century, registered in 1909 and integrated in the designation decree in 1938.Fine Champagne is produced from eau-de-vies from two crus (Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne) which have very chalky soil. This terroir produces very aromatic eau-de-vies, slow ripening, with a great ageing potential. Petite Champagne {{is known for its}} cognacs’ potency, while Grande Champagne is known for its cognacs’ finesse.The two main crus’ soil, soft and chalky from the Cretaceous period, has a great capacity to retain water which ensures a regular supply to the vine. The level of organic material is significant and the top soil reflects the light encouraging the vine to thrive. The Fine Champagne cognac’s plant material is mostly the Ugni Blanc vine; the cognac designation decree also includes the Folle Blanche and Colombard vines. The Ugni Blanc vine, also called Trebbanio, originates from Italy, it is known for its finesse, vivacity and acidity which is ideal for distillation. A late budding variety, the Ugni Blanc is less susceptible to late frosts. It is also found in Armagnac, the Languedoc, Corsica, Italy and Bulgaria. Out of the 75,000 hectares in the Cognac appellation area, Grande Champagne has 13,800 hectares and Petite Champagne has 16,200 hectares. During the 1960s, l’Alliance Fine Champagne (The Fine Champagne Alliance) was started by André Hériard Dubreuil of Rémy Martin. This cooperative brings together a thousand wine <b>growers</b> from Petite <b>Champagne</b> and Grande Champagne.|$|R
