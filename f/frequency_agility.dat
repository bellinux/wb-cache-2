These requirements motivate {{the design of}} multiband (MB) ultra-wideband (UWB) radios for their simplicity in handling pronounced <b>frequency</b> selectivity, <b>agility</b> in coping with interference, scalability in providing multirate operation, and their potentially low cost. Relative to baseband UWB radios, MB-UWB systems have gained popularity in the IEEE standards for short-range wireless links. However, multiple-access (MA) schemes must be designed carefully to harness the diversity benefits provided by the MB-UWB propagation, in a spectrally efficient manner. To this end, we introduce a crossband flexible UWB MA scheme for multipiconet WPANs. The resultant design that we term FLEX-UWB offers resilience to multiuser interference, can conveniently accommodate various spreading alternatives, enables full multipath diversity, and can effect scalable spectral efficiency (from low to medium and high data rates).

40|$|Obesity and {{physical}} inactivity {{are on the}} rise amongst Canadians. Dog sports, agility in particular, may represent a form of physical activity that can help address the health issues that some of our population face. However, some individuals elect to participate in the sport less frequently while others engage in very high amounts of agility. Because increased participation in physical activity is good for health, an understanding of why some individuals engage in agility in high amounts needs to be developed. The study utilized the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to investigate social/ environmental factors that influence the motivational sequence amongst adult agility participants to understand why some individuals engage in high amounts of the sport. Meeting the recommended amounts of physical activity is linked to improved health, so an exploration into how much physical activity is achieved through agility participation was also completed. Finally, the tenets of the SDT were utilized to assess how motivation influences physical activity behaviours. Method: The study utilized a cross sectional mixed methods design that involved two components., competitive adult agility participants were assessed (n= 233) in component one. Participants filled out the SMS II, the BNSSS, a physical activity inventory, and a demographic questionnaire. T and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to identify differences in motivation and hierarchal regression analysis was used to predict physical activity behaviours from the tenets of the SDT. Seven individuals who participated in component one and engaged in higher amounts of agility participation were then interviewed for component two regarding the social/environmental factors that influenced their agility involvement. Results: Those who engage in higher amounts of agility had significantly higher levels of intrinsic motivation (U(231) = 3321. 5, Z=- 3. 178, p<. 001). On average, the sample expended 700 kcal/week through their agility participation, effectively accruing 70 % of the recommended amount of physical activity. Self-determined motivation was able to positively predict the amount of agility related energy expenditure, and the overall <b>frequency</b> of <b>agility</b> participation. Interviews in component two revealed ten social/environmental factors that influenced motivation, including: task/ego orientation, dog influence, family, friends, mentors, initial success, interspecies bond, challenge, and the venue. Conclusion: The findings revealed that, in this context, agility competitors experience high levels of self-determined motivation and need satisfaction, and those with higher intrinsic motivation tend to participate more. Social/environmental factors in the sport of agility may influence the motivational sequence and how much individuals participate. The present study provides a backbone for more experimental exploration to determine the relationships between the motivational sequence constructs and how they directly impact physical activity behaviours...|$|R

A reconfigurable antenna with <b>frequency</b> and polarization <b>agility</b> [...] 7. Applications of reconfigurable antennas in MIMO systems [...] 8. Conclusions and future work. Reconfigurable antennas (RAs) are at the frontier of current antenna research and are excellent antenna candidates for advanced wireless communication applications. The basic structure of a RA {{is similar to that}} of a conventional one; however, by using electrical, mechanical or other means to change the fundamental operating mechanism of an individual radiator, the frequency and radiation characteristics of the RA can be varied significantly. This makes a single RA equal to multiple antennas with fixed functionalities. Thanks to the agility and diversity of RAs, they find wide application in Software Defined Radios, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, diversity communication systems, satellite communications, and military communication systems. One of the greatest design challenges for antenna reconfigurability is changing one characteristic of an antenna, such as the frequency response, without affecting others (polarization or radiation pattern), since the frequency response and the radiation characteristics of an antenna are always highly related. Furthermore, for RAs using electronic components to achieve reconfigurability, the design of an effective dc bias network that has a limited influence on the antenna performance is another important design issue for antenna engineers. In this dissertation, motivated by the increasing significance of RAs as well as the demand for new design methods for compact RAs with simple dc bias networks, a thorough investigation is presented on RAs in terms of frequency, polarization, pattern, as well as compound frequency and polarization RAs. A few novel RAs with dc bias networks are designed, fabricated and measured. And they have demonstrated many advantages over other corresponding reported designs. In addition, a literature review reveals that, although a considerable number of papers on RAs have been published, much fewer are reported on the study of the applications of RAs in wireless communication systems. In order to examine the practical application of RAs, the proposed polarization and pattern RAs are incorporated separately in 2 x 2 MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Real-time channel measurements are conducted in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. Compared to the systems with non-reconfigurable antennas, a significant enhancement of the system capacity is accomplished.
