40|$|In this study, the {{usefulness}} of multi-polarization X-band SAR data for oil slick monitoring is investigated. The effect of <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> and noise contamination, and the combination of HH and VV polarization channels for oil slick monitoring is discussed. Dual-polarization data collected by TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed during two large-scale oil spill exercises in the North Sea is analysed. Oil slicks are detected in low wind speeds (1. 6 - 5 m/s) over a range of <b>incidence</b> <b>angles.</b> While the noise contamination of the signal is seen to increase with increasing <b>incidence</b> <b>angles,</b> the multi-polarization features provide less information at the lowest <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> here available (~ 20 °- 21 ° for TerraSAR-X and ~ 24 °- 26 ° for COSMO-SkyMed). When slick characterization utilizing multi-polarization features is desired, intermediate <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> seem preferable. For TerraSAR-X data at <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> ~ 27 °- 29 ° and ~ 41 °- 42 °, consistency in feature values between scenes is seen to some extent. No clear variations with slick age are observed. TerraSAR-X data, being coherent in phase, is found more useful for multi-polarization analysis than COSMO-SkyMed in this data set. ...|$|R

Whereas the classical geometrical optics approximation predicts an abrupt transition from complete transmission at small <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> to no transmission at large angles, the full model predicts a more gradual transition with partial reflection/transmission that is sensitive to the canyon geometry and controlled by evanescent modes for small <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> and relatively short waves.

30|$|In our {{simulations}} of tilted nanowires, the performance is symmetric {{with respect to}} positive and negative <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> for TE waves with electric field along the x-axis and TM waves with magnetic field along the y-axis. However, this symmetry is broken for TE incidence with electric field along the y-axis and TM incidence with magnetic field along the x-axis. The results shown for the tilted nanowire arrays are {{the average of the}} two orthogonal polarizations. The performance of the tilted nanowires is slightly better under positive <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> versus negative <b>incidence</b> <b>angles,</b> where the Poynting vector is closer to along the axis of the nanowire. In addition, the performance of the tilted nanowires is consistently higher than that of the vertical nanowire arrays for <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> under about 60 °.

Since the clusters, like all triples, are repeated at integer multiples, the value 2n also corresponds to a cluster. The corresponding parabola intersects the b-axis at right angles at b = 2n, and hence its reflection upon interchange of a and b intersects the a-axis at right angles at a = 2n, precisely where the parabola for n is reflected at the a-axis. (The same is of course true for a and b interchanged.) ...|$|E
