Mesoscale holes (100 − 300 nm) in a chromium film are used as an etch mask to fabricate pyramidal pits and then as a <b>deposition</b> <b>mask</b> to form the metallic pyramids. We have fabricated two- and three-layered pyramids with control over their materials and chemical functionality.

40|$|A {{general and}} {{scalable}} method {{has been developed}} for patterning nanometer scale lines hierarchically over large areas using nanowires as masks for etching and deposition. Core−shell nanowires with controlled diameter and shell dimensions were aligned with nanometer to micrometer scale pitches using a Langmuir−Blodgett approach and then transferred en mass to planar substrates. Transferred nanowires were used as <b>deposition</b> <b>masks</b> to define metal lines with pitches from the nanometer to micrometer scale over centimeter square areas.

This nanolithography method represents a highly scalable and flexible pathway for defining nanometer scale lines on multiple length scales and thus has substantial potential for enabling the fabrication of integrated nanosystems. The development of novel methods for patterning structures on nanometer length scales can make possible fundamental investigations of new devices and could help to enable applications in nanoelectronics, photonics, and nanobiotech-nology.

For the first time, various unique nanostructures with long-range order, including network structures with tunable neck length and width, hexagonal-shaped, and rectangular-shaped arrays as well as size tunable nanohole arrays, were fabricated by this route.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, we have {{fabricated}} an ordered arrangement of macropores with diameters above 1 [*]μm in silicon using a circular noble-metal thin film as the catalyst [10, 11]. However, the polystyrene honeycomb mask used for metal deposition, which was prepared using binary colloidal crystals composed of large silica spheres and small polystyrene spheres [10], had a relatively coarse framework, resulting in imperfect templating into the silicon substrate. Therefore, to fabricate more precise macroporous silicon using a noble-metal thin film as the catalyst, {{it is essential}} to prepare the metal <b>deposition</b> <b>mask</b> with a dense framework and periodic openings. In this work, we used metal-assisted chemical etching through a dense photoresist mask with a 2 D hexagonal array of openings, which was prepared by sphere photolithography, to fabricate high-quality macroporous silicon.

The well-known top-down techniques providing accurate size and geometric control in periodic semiconductor nanostructure patterning include laser interference lithography [6], nanoimprint lithography [7], ion beam lithography [8], and electron beam lithography [9]. However, the cost and complexity of these techniques increase dramatically with the demand for reduced feature sizes over large areas. Nanosphere lithography (NSL) has emerged as an alternative nanofabrication technique, where a monodisperse or multidisperse nanosphere template acts as an etching or <b>deposition</b> <b>mask</b> to transfer its pattern to the underlying substrate [10 – 12]. The sizes of nanospheres can be tuned from 20 to 1, 000 nm [13, 14], offering a simple and inexpensive solution to scale nanostructure feature sizes. More importantly, the location, density, and coverage of nanostructures can be well controlled. With improvements in the domain sizes of the self-assembled nanosphere arrays [15], NSL has great potential in fabricating nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and biosensors. Over the past decade, NSL {{has been used to}} nanopattern Si [16], GaAs [17], and glass [18] substrates.

Ordered monolayers of polystyrene nanospheres were used as a <b>deposition</b> <b>mask</b> through which silver was deposited by thermal evaporation, subsequent removal of the nanospheres thus leaving an array of metallic nanoparticles. By reactive-ion etching of the nanospheres in an oxygen plasma prior to silver deposition, arrays consisting of particles of increasing size were fabricated. The extremities of the particles eventually merge to create a continuous metallic network perforated by subwavelength holes, thus allowing a study of the particle-hole transition. Combining optical measurements of transmittance and reflectance with information gained using scanning electron microscopy, three separate regimes were observed. For low etch times the samples comprise mainly individual nanoparticles and the optical response is dominated by localized surface plasmon resonances that show no dispersion. As the etch time is increased almost all of the nanoparticles merge with adjacent particles, although many defects are present—notably where some particles fail to merge, a small gap being left between them. The presence of these defects prevents an abrupt structural transition from metallic nanoparticles to a continuous metallic film perforated by an array of nanoholes. The presence of such gaps also results in dispersion data that lack clearly defined features. A further increase in etch time leads to samples with no gaps: instead, a continuous metal film perforated by a nanohole array is produced.

30|$|Due to {{the great}} {{research}} prospect of silver nanoparticles in nanosensors, many researchers have devoted to study it [110, 111]. So, we pick three representative examples to write in detail. Among them Zhu et al. [110] fabricated rhombic silver nanoparticles for biosensing. The rhombic silver nanoparticles were prepared by follow method. The mixed solution (polystyrene nanospheres and glass nanospheres with fluorocarbon surfactant) was coated onto the glass substrate to form a <b>deposition</b> <b>mask,</b> and then followed by hydrofluoric acid etching to remove the glass nanospheres. After that, the Ag metal thin film was deposited through the nanosphere masks using thermal evaporation or electron beam evaporation. After removal of the polystyrene nanospheres by sonication in absolute ethanol for 3  min, well-ordered rhombic AgNPs array was finally obtained on the substrates. The rhombic AgNPs array was single particle dimension of 140  nm in-plane width and 47  nm out-of-plane height. To prepare the biosensing, the Ag nanorhombuses are firstly functionalized using the self-assembly monolayer technique. Then assisting with 1 -ethyl- 3 -[3 -dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride, we covalently attached biotin to the carboxylate groups. The advantage of this biosensor is that the rhombic AgNPs array-based sensor with more hot spots has higher sensitivity {{than that of the}} traditional Ag triangular nanoparticles-based sensor. A detection of high sensitivity of the bio-molecule in lower concentration has been realized by means of the LSPR-based nanobiosensor. This type of biosensor will have potential applications in many fields such as medical science and biological technology. Meanwhile, M. Ghiaci et al. [111] utilized silver nanoparticles compounds as new electrochemical sensors for glucose detection. These electrochemical sensors were prepared based on synthesizing of two amine compounds bounded to silica support. The size of used AgNPs is 10  nm. The electrochemical sensor prepared by this method has a lower limit of glucose detection than other electrochemical sensors. This type of nanosensors will be more conducive to diabetes detection and treatment. Silver nanoscale sensors can also be used for environmental detection such as Li et al. [112] synthesized aza-crown ether (ACE)-modified silver nanoparticles as colorimetric sensors for Ba 2 +. What is more, colorimetric sensors merely need minimal instrumentation, achieve high sensitivity, and thus can make on-site detection even easier. The colorimetric sensors were synthesized by silver nanoparticles efficiently conjugated with CS 2 –ACE. ACE-modified AgNPs have good recognition of Ba 2 +, with the detection limit of 10 −[*] 8  mol/L.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of point}} {{contacts}} {{has made the}} Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell design {{one of the most}} efficient monocrystalline-silicon photovoltaic cell designs in production. The main feature of such solar cell is that the rear surface is partially contacted by periodic openings in a dielectric film that provides surface passivation. However, a trade-off between ohmic losses and surface recombination is found. Due to the technology used to locally open the contacts in the passivation layer, the distance between neighboring contacts is on the order of hundreds of microns, introducing a significant series resistance. In this work, I explore the possibility and potential advantages of using nanoscale contact openings with a pitch between 300 nm to 10 µm. Analytic and numerical simulations done {{during the course of this}} thesis have shown that such nanoscale contacts would result in negligible ohmic losses while still keeping the surface recombination velocity Seff,rear at an acceptable level, as long as the recombination velocity at the contact (Scont) is in the range from 103 - 105 cm/s. To achieve such contacts in a potentially cost-reducing way, my experimental work has focused on the use of polystyrene nanospheres as a sacrificial mask. The thesis is therefore divided into three sections. The first section develops and explores processes to enable the formation of such contacts using various nanosphere dispersion, thin-film deposition, and layer etching processes. The second section describes a test device using a thin-film amorphous silicon NIP diode to explore the electrical properties of the point contacts. Finally, the third section considers the application of such point contacts on crystalline silicon by exploring localized doping through the nanoholes formed. In the first section, I have explored using polystyrene nanoparticles (NPs) as a patterning mask. The first two tested NPs deposition techniques (spray-coating, spin-coating) give poorly controlled distributions of nanospheres on the surface, but with very low values of coverage. The third tested NPs deposition technique (floating transfer technique) provided a closely-packed monolayer of NPs on the surface; this process was more repeatable but necessitated an additional O 2 plasma step to reduce the coverage area of the sphere. This was performed using matrix distributed electron cyclotron resonance (MD-ECR) in order to etch the NPs by performing a detailed study. The NPs have been used in two ways; by using them as a direct <b>deposition</b> <b>mask</b> or by depositing a secondary etching mask layer on top of them. In the second section of this thesis, I have tested the nanoholes as electrical point-contacts in thin-film a-Si:H devices. For low-diffusion length technologies such as thin-film silicon, the distance between contacts must be in the order of few hundred nanometers. Using spin coated 100 nm NPs of polystyrene as a sacrificial <b>deposition</b> <b>mask,</b> I could form randomly spaced contacts with an average spacing of a few hundred nanometers. A set of NIP a-Si:H solar cells, using RF-PECVD, have been deposited on the back reflector substrates formed with metallic layers covered with dielectrics having nanoholes. Their electrical characteristics were compared to the same cells done with and without a complete dielectric layer. These structures allowed me to verify that good electrical contact through the nanoholes was possible, but no enhanced performance was observed. In the third section of this thesis, I investigate the use of such nanoholes in crystalline silicon technology by the formation of passivated contacts through the nanoholes. Boron doping by both thermal diffusion and ion implantation techniques were investigated. A thermally grown oxide layer with holes was used as the doping barrier. These samples were characterized, after removing the oxide layer, by secondary electron microscopy (SEM) and conductive probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM). Au cours de cette thèse, j’ai étudié la possibilité et les avantages d’utiliser des contacts nanométriques au-dessous de 1 µm. Des simulations analytiques et numériques ont montré que ces contacts nanométriques sont avantageux pour les cellules en silicium cristallin comme ils peuvent entrainer une résistance ohmique négligeable. Mon travail expérimental était focalisé sur le développement de ces contacts en utilisant des nanoparticules de polystyrène comme un masque. En utilisant la technique de floating transfert pour déposer les nanosphères, une monocouche dense de nanoparticules s’est formée. Cela nécessite une gravure par plasma de O 2 afin de réduire la zone de couverture des NPs. Cette gravure était faite et étudiée en utilisant la technique de plasmas matriciels distribués à résonance cyclotronique électronique (MD-ECR). Une variété de techniques de créations de trous nanométriques était développée et testée dans des structures de couches minces et silicium cristallin. Des trous nanométriques étaient formés dans la couche de passivation, de SiO 2 thermique, du silicium cristallin pour former des contacts nanométriques dopés. Un dopage local de bore était fait, à travers ces trous nanométriques par diffusion thermique et implantation ionique. En faisant la diffusion, le dopage local était observé par CP-AFM en mesurant des courbes de courant-tension à l’intérieur et à l’extérieur des zones dopées et en détectant des cellules solaires nanométriques. Par contre le processus de dopage local par implantation ionique a besoin d’être améliorer afin d’obtenir un résultat similaire à celui de diffusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} {{technology has}} been attracting widespread attention because of its effective energy harvest by directly converting solar energy into electricity. Thin-film silicon solar cells {{are believed to be}} a promising candidate for further scaled-up production and cost reduction while maintaining the advantages of bulk silicon. The efficiency of thin-film Si solar cells critically depends on optical absorption in the silicon layer since silicon has low absorption coefficient in the red and near-infrared (IR) wavelength ranges due to its indirect bandgap nature. This thesis aims at understanding, designing, and fabricating novel photonic structures for efficiency enhancement in thin-film Si solar cells. We have explored a previously reported a photonic crystal (PC) based structure to improve light absorption in thin-film Si solar cells. The PC structure combines a dielectric grating layer and a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) for effcient light scattering and reflection, increasing light path length in the thin-film cell. We have understood the operation principles for this design by using photonic band theories and electromagnetic wave simulations. we discover that this DBR with gratings exhibit unusual light trapping in a way different from metal reflectors and photonic crystals. The light trapping effects for the DBR with and without reflector are numerically investigated. The self-assembled anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) technique is introduced to non- lithographically fabricate the grating structure. We adjust the AAO structural parameters by using different anodization voltages, times and electrolytes. Two-step anodization is employed to obtain nearly hexagonal AAO pattern. The interpore periods of the fabricated AAO are calculated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. We have also demonstrated the fabrication of ordered patterns made of other materials like amorphous Si (a-Si) and silver by using the AAO membrane as a <b>deposition</b> <b>mask.</b> Numerical simulations predict that the fabricated AAO pattern exhibits light trapping performance comparable to the perfectly periodic grating layer. We have implemented the light trapping concepts combining the self-assembled AAO layer and the DBR in the backside of crystalline Si wafers. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the light absorption is improved in the near-IR spectral range near the band edge of Si. Furthermore, different types of thin-film Si solar cells, including a-Si, mi- crocrystalline Si ([mu]-Si) and micromorph Si solar cells, are investigated. For demonstration, the designed structure is integrated into a 1 : 5 [mu]m thick [mu]c-Si solar cell. We use numerical simulations to obtain the optimal structure parameters for the grating and the DBR, and then we fabricate the optimized structures using the AAO membrane as a template. The prototype devices integrating our proposed backside structure yield a 21 % improvement in efficiency. This is further verified by quantum efficiency measurements, which clearly indicate stronger light absorption in the red and near-IR spectral ranges. Lastly, we have explored the fundamental light trapping limits for thin-film Si solar cells in the wave optics regime. We develop a deterministic method to optimize periodic textures for light trapping. Deep and high-index-contrast textures exhibit strong anisotropic scattering that is outside the regime of validity of the Lambertian models commonly used to describe texture-induced absorption enhancement for normal incidence. In the weak ab- sorption regime, our optimized surface texture in two dimensions (2 D) enhances absorption by a factor of 2. 7 [pi]n, considerably larger than the classical [pi]n Lambertian result and exceeding by almost 50 % a recent generalization of Lambertian model for periodic structures in finite spectral range. Since the [pi]n Lambertian limit still applies for isotropic incident light, our optimization methodology can be thought of optimizing the angle/enhancement tradeoff for periodic textures. Based on a modified Shockley-Queisser theory, we conclude {{that it is possible to}} achieve more than 20 % efficiency in a 1 : 5 [mu]m thick crystalline Si cell if advanced light trapping schemes can be realized. by Xing Sheng.

Limit-cycle solutions defining continuous cyclic ALD reactor operation are computed with a fixed point algorithm based on collocation discretization in time, resulting in an unambiguous definition of film growth-per-cycle (gpc). A key {{finding of this study}} is that unintended chemical vapor <b>deposition</b> conditions can <b>mask</b> regions of operation that would otherwise correspond to ideal saturating ALD operation. The use of the simulator for assisting in process design decisions is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Gate Oxide failure {{analysis}} during technology qualification led to {{discovery of the}} polysilicon hole defects in large (> 200 K m 2) PMOS capacitors. In-line KLA inspections confirmed that polysilicon holes were formed during the salicide block process module. It is hypothesized that a three way interaction between the P+ source/drain implanted boron, heat added during salicide block <b>mask</b> <b>deposition,</b> and NH 4 + in the BOE causes the polysilicon hole. By replacing the BOE (Buffered Oxide Etchant) with a 100 : 1 HF solution, the creation of polysilicon holes was eliminated as confirmed by KLA and VBD testing.

Mask alignment with crystal planes prior to wet-etching {{is found to be}} essential {{in order to avoid the}} appearance of additional planes during long etching. <b>Mask</b> <b>deposition</b> processes have been also evaluated. Among the different employed mask materials, Cr/Au gives the best results. It is then shown that cavities as deep as 1 mm with low roughness sidewalls can be simply produced with potassium hydroxide solution with periodic piranha cleanin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{demonstrate}} the repeated utilization of self-assembled colloidal spheres for rapid nanopattern generations. Highly ordered micro-/nanosphere arrays were interlinked and confined by a soft transparent polymer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), {{which can be}} used as light-focusing elements/photomasks for area-selective exposures of photoresist in contact. Because of the stiffness of the colloidal spheres, the photomasks do not encounter feature-deformation problems, enabling reliable production of highly uniform patterns over large areas. The geometrical feature of the patterns, including the size, pitch, and even the shape, can be finely tuned by adjusting the mask design and exposure time. The obtained patterns could be used as <b>deposition</b> or etching <b>mask,</b> allowing easy pattern transfer for various applications...|$|R
30|$|After rinsing the alumina mask in {{distilled}} water, the obtained alumina mask {{was set on}} an n-type GaAs substrate [Si-doped, 2.35 – 2.67 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  Ω cm, (100) crystal orientation]. Subsequently, a 30 -nm-thick Au layer was evaporated {{through the}} alumina mask using a vacuum deposition system by the resistance heating formula (ULVAC KIKO Inc., VPC- 410) with a pressure below 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  Pa (Fig.  1 a). The thickness of the Au layer was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance, and the deposition rate of Au was 0.02  nm s− 1.

40|$|Stencil Lithography (SL) is a {{technique}} based on shadow <b>mask</b> <b>deposition</b> that does not require any resist processing, energy radiation or chemical solvents. This technique {{has been used to}} fabricate sub-micrometric structures, like nanodots [1] and nanowires [2]. It is suitable for patterning on substrates with high topographies, fragile structures and with materials damaged by radiation or solvents. SL also offers the potential for rapid nanopatterning of structures using the stencils several times [3]. However, SL still faces challenges for nanopatterning, like the blurring of the deposited structures due to the stencil-substrate gap [4]. Herein we show advances in the analysis, characterization and application of nanostructures deposited by SL. In this contribution, we present a quantitative study of the blurring {{as a function of the}} gap. We show the patternin...|$|R
