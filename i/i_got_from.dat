I wanted to make a movie {{for a new generation of}} audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema—hadn't seen them at all maybe—and to give them the same thrill that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> watching them. But kind of contemporise it, pump up the action and the blood and guts." [...] Cinematic influences on Doomsday include: ...|$|E

Sometimes I feel like the company's psychiatrist, but I do feel like listening to people and hearing about their problems (personal and professional) cleans out the cobwebs and keeps the organization humming.” ...|$|E
500|$|Khloé married {{basketball}} player Lamar Odom during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009. He later {{had a major}} role {{as part of the}} supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the amount of backlash <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get." [...] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed. In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.|$|E

500|$|Ross favorably {{compared}} the recording sessions to his past in school. He mused, [...] "it's like everybody is a student: You {{walk into a}} session, and it's all about the subject at hand." [...] The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo, composed by producer Bink!. Bink! is most famous for his contributions to Jay-Z's album, The Blueprint, which has been described a [...] "pioneering album" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal and was West's big break as a producer. West and Bink! originally became friends while producing another Jay-Z album, [...] in the late 1990s. Bink! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual respect for each other. Bink! commented on {{the first time he}} showed the composition to West, saying [...] "the reaction <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> him after I played the beat for the first time was real intense." [...] Immediately Bink! knew that West was going to use the production. Initially, he wasn't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album, and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album's release.|$|E

It's just that, right now I'm ready to try something different and to get my name and face out there in a different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when I look at my Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> French writing. And I just {{took a couple of}} lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as sort of like a Bob Dylan song." [...] It was Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional [...] percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.|$|E

His donations to restore and beautify the White House led to an invitation by Hillary Clinton for a black-tie celebration. She warmly received him and posed for a photograph on the same day her husband's sex scandal hit the press. Scaife told the New York Post that he appreciated Mrs. Clinton's invitation. [...] "I'm honored", he said, [...] "Lord knows, it's more than <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> [...] George Bush".|$|E
2500|$|Liberace {{began playing}} the piano at age four. While Sam took his {{children}} to concerts to further expose them to music, {{he was also a}} taskmaster demanding high standards from the children in both practice and performance. Liberace's prodigious talent was evident from his early years. By age seven, he was capable of memorizing difficult pieces. He studied the technique of the Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski. At age eight, he met Paderewski backstage after a concert at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee. [...] "I was intoxicated by the joy <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the great virtuoso's playing. My dreams were filled with fantasies of following his footsteps…Inspired and fired with ambition, I began to practice with a fervor that made my previous interest in the piano look like neglect". Paderewski later became a family friend.|$|E
2500|$|Korzeniowski and {{conductor}} Terry Davies {{recorded a}} 60-piece orchestra at London's Abbey Road Studios in April 2011, concentrating on purely the emotional {{states of the}} characters, and did not concern himself too much with differentiating the periods of the film. In an interview with Variety, the composer said that for the scenes featuring Simpson, {{he tried to make}} the score be more modern than the scenes featuring Winthrop. Madonna wanted Korzeniowski to keep the score simple and direct. She felt that Korzeniowski being a classically trained musician, he would be cerebral in his approach to music and would over complicate the score. [...] "It is not the type of score where you go through crazy harmonic changes and modulations," [...] said the composer. [...] "This was one of the very precise notes <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> Madonna, that I was not supposed to over-think this music." [...] The main inspiration behind the score was the irrational love as portrayed in the film, which Korzeniowski said could be [...] "just an illusion". He wanted the music to reflect those powerful and conflicting emotions through the melodies, repeating between despair and sorrow, and hope and joy.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, Chappell {{alleged that}} he was a victim of a [...] "racist attack" [...] at the Bhubaneshwar Airport in January 2007 when a fan [...] "whacked him" [...] behind his ear, and accused the BCCI of {{covering}} up the issue. He also went on to say, [...] "As I said to the BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one seemed to care. The reply came back talking about my racist comments." [...] and added [...] "There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the BCCI asked me whether it really happened." [...] In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, [...] "No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [...] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection. The local police also provided us with support."
