40|$|Amino acids are {{not only}} {{substrates}} for various metabolic pathways, but can also serve as signaling molecules controlling signal transduction pathways. One of these signaling pathways is mTOR-dependent and is activated by amino acids (leucine in particular) in synergy with insulin. Activation of this pathway inhibits autophagy. Because activation of mTOR-mediated signaling also stimulates protein synthesis, it appears that protein synthesis and autophagic protein degradation are reciprocally controlled by the same signaling pathway. Recent developments indicate that amino acid-stimulated mTOR-dependent signaling is subject to complex regulation.

40|$|Rose is a polycarpic plant which {{presents}} {{the ability to}} flower {{several times during the}} year (reccurent blooming. Continuous flowering is due to a mutation of RoKSN a floral repressor homolog to TERMINAL FLOWER 1. In spring, after blooming in once-flowering rose, RoKSN transcripts increase and inhibit nex bloomings. Moreover, the exogenous application of gibberellins (GA) inhibits flowering in spring in once-flowering rose and has no effect on continuous flowering roses. This link between GA and TFL 1 was never found before. The main objectives of this study are to understand the function and the regulation of RoKSN and to study the link between RoKSN and GA. By overexpression of RoKSN in Arabidopsis tfl 1 mutant we validate floral repressor function of RoKSN. Roses that express ectopically RoKSN, never bloom after few months in greenhouse. In spring exogenous application of GA during floral transition induces RoKSN transcription. The accumulation of RoKSN transcripts correlated with floral inhibition. GA also induces RoFD and Rolfy in a RoKSN-I independent way. To understand the mode of action of RoKS we demonstrate that RoKSN interacted with RoFD. Moreover, there was a competition between RoFT (homologue of FT) and RoKSN FOR RoFD.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{role of the}} faecal {{stream in}} the {{maintenance}} of the inflammation in Crohn's disease has been studied. Small bowel effluent and a sterile ultrafiltrate of it were reintroduced into the defunctioned colon of patients with Crohn's colitis treated by split ileostomy. The systemic effect of these challenges on the patients was assessed clinically and by laboratory tests, and the effect on the local disease was assessed by endoscopy, histology, and quantitative analysis of lamina propria plasma cell populations. There was little response to the ultrafiltrate challenge. In contrast the clinical responses to challenge with ileostomy effluent were marked in some patients. One patient relapsed and eight others had clinically detectable responses. On the other hand changes in laboratory, endoscopic, histological, and morphometric tests in response to the faecal challenge were less pronounced. The only significant changes in the laboratory results were a relative lymphopenia (p< 005) and a raised ESR (p< 002) after seven days challenge with the effluent. The plasma cell density also increased but not significantly. In conclusion, these results suggest that factors greater than 0 O 22 microns in the faecal stream are responsible for the maintenance and exacerbation of inflammation in Crohn's disease.

40|$|Key words: medical ozone, {{erythrocyte}} membrane fluidity, electron paramagnetic resonance, spin labelling The {{effects of}} ozone at different concentrations (10, 30, 45 g/m 3) on fluidity and thermotropic properties of erythrocyte membranes were investigated by EPR using two spin probes: 5 -doxylstearic acid (5 -DSA) and 16 -doxylstearic acid (16 -DSA). The effect of ozone on the erythrocyte membrane fluidity was a dose-dependent process. The ozone at concentration of 10 g/m 3 caused rigidization of the membrane while at concentration of 45 g/m 3 increased fluidity {{both on the}} surface and in the deeper hydrocarbon region of the membrane. Temperature transitions close to the polar heads region (monitored by 5 -DSA) were not sensitive to an increase in ozone concentration. In the case of 16 -DSA, low temperature thermotropic transition (around 20 �C) gradually decreased with the increase of ozone concentration. High temperature transition (around 40 �C) significantly differed at the ozone concentration of 10 g/m 3 and 45 g/m 3, being higher and lower, respectively, as compared to untreated cells. For the ozone concentration of 45 g/m 3 the disappearance of the low temperature break and the appearance of two breaks at 37 �C and 16 �C were observed. Autotransfusions of ozonized blood or infusions of gaseous ozone into blood vessels and body cavities are believed to exert therapeutic effects in some pathological states (Shiratori et al., 1993; Washuttl, 1988; Burgard, 1990).

We examined the genetic epidemiology of dementia {{in a recent}} genetically isolated Dutch population founded around 1750. The series of 191 patients ascertained comprised 122 probable Alzheimer's disease patients with late onset and 17 with early onset, and 22 with possible Alzheimer's disease. It further included 10 patients with vascular dementia, nine with Lewy body dementia and six with frontotemporal dementia. All patients, except those with vascular dementia, were more closely related than healthy individuals from the same area. Clustering was strongest for patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease or Lewy body dementia. Although 14 % of late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients had evidence of autosomal dominant disease, consanguinity was found in three late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a recessive or polygenic model underlying the trait. We found no clustering of vascular dementia, implying a difference in genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Mutations in known genes could not explain the occurrence of dementia, but the population attributable proportion of apolipoprotein E gene (APOE* 4) was high (45 %) due to a high frequency of APOE* 4 carriers.

40|$|Technological {{change is}} widely {{recognised}} {{as a key}} factor in economic progress, as it enhances the productivity of factor inputs. In recent years also the notion has developed that targeted technological development is a main means to reconcile economic ambitions with ecological considerations. This raises the issue that assessments of future trajectories of for example en-ergy systems should take into account context-specific technological progress. Rather than tak-ing characteristics of existing and emerging technologies as a given, their development should be a function of dedicated Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) and market de-ployment under varying external conditions. Endogenous technological learning has recently shown to be a very promising new feature in energy system models. A learning, or experience curve, describes the specific (investment) cost {{as a function of the}} cumulative capacity for a given technology. It reflects the fact that tech-nologies may experience declining costs as a result of its increasing adoption into the society due to the accumulation of knowledge through, among others, processes of learning-by-doing and learning-by-using. This report synthesises the results and findings from experiments with endogenous technologi-cal learning, as reported separately within the EU TEEM project. These experiments have been carried out by three TEEM partners using three models: ERIS (PSI), MARKAL (ECN and PSI), and MESSAGE (IIASA). The main objectives of this synthesis are: to derive common methodo-logical insights; to indicate and assess benefits of the new feature, but also its limitations and issues to solve; and to recommend further research to solve the main issues. This synthesis shows that all model applications are examples of successful first experiments to incorporate the learning-by-doing concept in energy system models. Incorporating the learning-by-doing concept makes an important difference. The experiments demonstrate and quantify the benefits of investing early in emerging technologies that are not competitive at the moment of their deployment. They also show that the long-term impact of policy instruments, such as CO 2 taxes or emission limits and RD&D instruments, on technological development can be assessed adequately with models including technology learning. Adopting the concept of endogenous learning, several types of RD&D interventions can be addressed that aim at accelerating the market penetration of new technologies. The directions into which such interventions might lead have been illustrated in some of the experiments.

No data on sympathovagal balance are available in patients with Cushing's syndrome, in whom cardiovascular risk is high. We studied 10 patients with newly diagnosed Cushing's syndrome (1 male/ 9 females; age mean+/-SD, 47 +/- 10 yr) and 10 control subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index, and cardiovascular risk factors. In both groups there were 7 patients with arterial hypertension, 3 with diabetes mellitus, and 2 with obesity. Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by analysis of short time heart rate variability (HRV) measures in frequency domain over 24 -h, daytime, and nighttime. The 24 -h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography were also performed. In comparison with controls, patients with Cushing's syndrome had lower 24 -h (1. 3 +/- 0. 6 vs 3. 7 +/- 1. 5, mean+/-SD, p< 0. 01), daytime (2. 0 +/- 1. 4 vs 4. 5 +/- 1. 6, p< 0. 01), and night-time (1. 0 +/- 0. 4 vs 3. 5 +/- 2. 3, p< 0. 01) low-frequency/ high frequency (LF/HF) power ratio. In the presence of similar LF power, the difference was due to elevation in HF power in Cushing's syndrome compared to controls: 24 -h, 12. 7 +/- 6. 7 vs 5. 8 +/- 2. 8, p< 0. 01; daytime, 10. 2 +/- 7. 3 vs 4. 5 +/- 2. 1, p< 0. 05; nighttime, 14. 2 +/- 7. 0 vs 7. 8 +/- 4. 7, p< 0. 05.

40|$|Methylation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{chemical}} modifications of biologically active molecules and it occurs in all life forms. Its functional role is very diverse and involves many essential cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcriptional control, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Here, we provide further insight into the enzymatic methylation in S. cerevisiae by conducting a comprehensive structural and functional survey of all the methyltransferases encoded in its genome. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition, we found that the S. cerevisiae methyltransferome comprises 86 MTases (53 well-known and 33 putative with unknown substrate specificity). Structural classification of their catalytic domains shows that these enzymes may adopt nine different folds, the most common being the Rossmann-like. We also analyzed the domain architecture of these proteins and identified several new domain contexts. Interestingly, we found that the majority of MTase genes are periodically expressed during yeast metabolic cycle. This finding, together with calculated isoelectric point, fold assignment and cellular localization, was used to develop a novel approach for predicting substrate specificity. Using this approach, we predicted the general substrates for 24 of 33 putative MTases and confirmed these predictions experimentally in both cases tested. Finally, we show that, in S. cerevisiae, methylation is carried out by 34 RNA MTases, 32 protein MTases, eight small molecule MTases, three lipid MTases, and nine MTases with <b>still</b> <b>unknow...</b>|$|R

40|$|The SnRK 1 (SNF 1 -related kinase 1) protein kinase, the {{ortholog}} of {{the yeast}} SNF 1 (Sucrose non-fermenting 1) kinase and animal AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), {{acts as a}} key metabolic sensor in plants. It integrates both endogenous developmental cues and diverse environmental stress conditions, that affect photosynthesis, respiration, or carbon allocation, triggering a coordinated response to ensure the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis and survival. This involves metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming, also affecting plant growth. However, how exactly SnRK 1 is activated upon increased energy demand or decreasing energy supply and how this affects growth and development <b>is</b> <b>still</b> largely <b>unknow.</b> To address these questions, we first developed and optimised a novel reporter to assess in vivo SnRK 1 activity. The reporter {{is based on a}} peptide sequence of the well-known AMPK target Acetyl CoA Carboxylase 1 (ACC 1) with S 79 phosphorylation site, that is fused to an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) tag (for subcellular localisation) and a double hemagglutinin (HA) tag (for protein expression analysis). The phosphorylation status of the reporter is evaluated using a commercially available phospho-ACC antibody. This construct can be used to study SnRK 1 activity in vivo in isolated leaf mesophyll protoplasts or in intact Arabidopsis reporter plants constitutively expressing the reporter. After heterologous expression in bacteria and purification, it can also be used for in vitro kinase assays. Specific and conserved phosphorylation of the reporter was also confirmed in yeast using the S. cerevisiae snf 1 mutant. Trehalose- 6 -phosphate (T 6 P), an intermediate of plant trehalose biosynthesis and an important novel growth regulator, was suggested to repress SnRK 1 activity in young tissues under optimal growth conditions (Zhang et al., 2009). A major objective of this work is to study the molecular mechanisms involved. Using cellular (transient expression) and in vitro assays (using the ACC reporter), we confirmed that T 6 P regulates SnRK 1 especially in younger tissues, and that T 6 P is not a direct regulator of the heterotrimeric SnRK 1 complex, but requires an additional intermediary protein. We then explored the possible conserved regulation of yeast SNF 1 by T 6 P, which would enable the use of powerful yeast genetics to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms in more detail. T 6 P regulation of SNF 1 was suggested by the observation that the additional mutation of Snf 1 in the tps 1 mutant rescued the growth defect of this mutant on rapidly fermentable carbon sources. However, SNF 1 T-loop phosphorylation, ACC reporter phosphorylation, and Mig 1 (SNF 1 target transcription factor) localisation in the WT and tps 1 mutant indicated that T 6 P does not regulate SNF 1 activity. Further investigation of gene expression, protein stability and activity of two SNF 1 regulated enzymes fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (encoded by FBP 1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK 1), revealed a role for T 6 P in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, downstream and independent of SNF 1 activity. The involvement of two SNF 1 -regulated transcription factors, Cat 8 and Sip 4, was assessed, but neither transcription factor seems to be involved in mediating the T 6 P regulation. The role of SnRK 1 signalling in growth and development was investigated by gene expression profiling of growing leaves. Previous analyses in Arabidopsis rosette leaf series identified a remarkable peak in the expression of DIN 6 (DARK-INDUCIBLE 6), a well-characterized SnRK 1 target, suggesting a SnRK 1 -mediated metabolic and/or developmental transition, coinciding with the growth of the petiole and reduced sugar accumulation. Early leaf development involves a transition from cell division to cell expansion. Using the mesophyll protoplast assay, we found that SnRK 1 can repress cyclin (CYCD 3; 1 and CYCB 1; 1) promoter activity, providing a direct link with growth control. Interestingly, transient expression of regulatory components in fully differentiated mesophyll leaf cells system {{can be used as a}} tool to study cell cycle regulatory machinery. However, the observed peak in DIN 6 expression in developing leaves occurs after the transition from cell division to cell expansion. It also does not correspond to the juvenile-adult transition in larger rosettes. The expression of genes involved in sink and source activities indicate that the peak in DIN 6 expression (and thus SnRK 1 activity) might rather be associated with the transition from sink (net sucrose importing) to source (active photosynthesis and net sucrose exporting) activity, although in cellular assays overexpression of the SnRK 1 catalytic subunit KIN 10 mainly induced genes involved in sink activities. Finally, given its vital role in plant growth and development, further analyses of SnRK 1 function are highly needed and would greatly benefit from specific direct small molecule SnRK 1 activators and inhibitors. We therefore optimised the protoplast transient expression system for high throughput compound screening. New luciferase reporter constructs, using the deep sea shrimp nanoluciferase, were made resulting in an increased bioluminescence signal and simplification of the protocol to a one step process and optimal protoplast concentrations were determined. nrpages: 171 status: publishe...|$|R
