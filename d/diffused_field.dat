Thirty-two regular PMS users and 32 nonregular PMS users underwent cVEMP testing using alternating polarity 500 Hz tone bursts.

As a continuation of our previous work focusing on the normal incidence case, a three dimensional model is established which allows the consideration of oblique and diffused sound impingement on an absorber of finite dimension. The extreme case having a large panel dimension is used to approximate an absorber of infinite dimension, which is compared numerically with Maa's formula to show {{the validity of the}} model. It is observed that the grazing modes of the backing cavity can be efficiently excited under the grazing incidence. These grazing modes contribute significantly to the total {{sound absorption}}, which contrasts with the case of normal incidence.

40|$|Elastic wave {{scattering}} from randomly {{rough surfaces}} and a smooth surface are essentially different. For ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) the scattering from defects with smooth surfaces {{has been extensively}} studied, providing fundamental building blocks for the current inspection techniques. However, all realistic surfaces are rough and the roughness exists in two dimensions. It is thus very {{important to understand the}} rough surface scattering mechanism, which would give insight for practical inspections. Knowledge of the stochastics of scattering for different rough surfaces would also allow the detectability of candidate rough defects to be anticipated. Hence the main motivation of this thesis is to model and study the effect of surface roughness on the scattering field, with focus on elastic waves. The main content of this thesis can be divided into three contributions. First of all, an accurate numerical method with high efficiency is developed in the time domain, for computing the scattered waves from obstacles with arbitrary shapes. It offers an exact solution which covers scenarios where approximation-based algorithms fail. The method is based on the hybrid idea to combine the finite element (FE) and boundary integral (BI) methods. The new method efficiently couples the FE equations and the boundary integral formulae for solving the transient scattering problems in both near and far fields, which is implemented completely in the time domain. Several numerical examples are demonstrated and sufficiently high accuracy is achieved with different defects. It enables the possibility for Monte Carlo simulations of the elastic wave scattering from randomly rough surfaces in both 2 D and 3 D. The second contribution relates to applying the developed numerical method to evaluate the widely used Kirchhoff approximation (KA) for rough surface scattering. KA is a high-frequency approximation which limits the use of the theory for certain ranges of roughness and incidence/scattering angles. The region of validity for elastic KA is carefully examined for both 1 D and 2 D random surfaces with Gaussian spectra. Monte Carlo simulations are run and the expected scattering intensity is compared with that calculated by the accurate numerical method. An empirical rule regarding surface parameters and angles is summarized to establish the valid region of both 2 D and 3 D KA. In addition, it is found that for 3 D scattering problems, the rule of validity becomes stricter than that in 2 D. After knowing the region of validity, KA is applied to investigate how the surface roughness affects the statistical properties of scattered waves. An elastodynamic Kirchhoff theory particularly for the statistics of the <b>diffused</b> <b>field</b> is developed with slope approximations for the first time. It provides an analytical expression to rapidly predict the expected angular distribution of the scattering intensity, or the scattering pattern, for different combinations of the incidence/scattering wave modes. The developed theory is verified by comparison with numerical Monte Carlo simulations, and further validated by the experiment with phased arrays. In particular the derived formulae are utilized to study the effects of the surface roughness on the mode conversion and the 2 D roughness caused depolarization, which lead to unique scattering patterns for different wave modes.

30|$|Since {{microtremor}} {{consists of}} both body and surface waves, a full-wave description is desirable {{to interpret the}} H/V. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>field</b> approximation {{is one of the}} promising theories to accomplish it. The <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> concept originated in acoustics and was firmly established for elasticity by Weaver (1982). But the roots of the idea {{can be traced back to}} the pioneering work of Aki (1957) who used ambient seismic noise (ASN) in the SPAC method (for spatial autocorrelation). The short-range cross-correlations of noise in a small array and its azimuthal average allow, through the argument of the Bessel function of zero order, to retrieve the phase velocity of Rayleigh waves. Aki’s pioneering work addressed first ideas and issues that were later formalized by Weaver (1982) as <b>diffuse</b> <b>fields.</b> The connection with 2 D elasticity was pointed out by Sánchez-Sesma and Campillo (2006). It has been proposed that the coda of earthquakes can be seen as a realization of a <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> (Shapiro et al. 2000; Hennino et al. 2001; Margerin 2009). In several instances, the ASN allows Green’s function retrieval from the average of cross-correlation between two receivers within a <b>diffuse</b> seismic <b>field.</b> Shapiro and Campillo (2004), Sabra et al. (2005), and Shapiro et al. (2005) confirmed that ASN is generally diffuse. We assert that the key of this fact lies in multiple scattering. The properties and the conditions of emergence of a <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> have been explored by many researchers worldwide (e.g., Weaver and Lobkis 2001; Sánchez-Sesma and Campillo 2006; Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2008). For the applications, the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> assumption allows to get useful approximations of the Green’s Function from cross-correlation of recorded motions. Even Mulargia (2012) who claims that ASN is not diffuse accepts that it holds significant imaging properties. Based on the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> approximation, the directional energy density is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green’s function when source and receiver coincide with each other both in position and direction (Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2008). The FW H/V is then expressed as the square root of the sum of imaginary parts of the horizontal components of Green’s function to that of the vertical counterpart (Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2011). In the <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> description, the imaginary part of the Green’s function incorporates naturally the contributions of both body (BW) and surface waves (SW). Therefore, an explanation on the origin of H/V is achieved by full-wave.|$|R

The DEDs are proportional to the imaginary part of Green’s function for given directions and correspond to the power injected into the system by a unit harmonic load. They are the sum of contributions from a radiation episode and from the waves returning to the source.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to define 1 D shear wave {{velocity}} (Vs) models with depth for crustal structures in the Campanian Plain (southern Italy). This objective is achieved by the non linear inversion with Hedgehog method of Rayleigh wave dispersion data of fundamental mode extracted by FTAN multifilter technique from two station noise cross-correlation (NCF), combined with regional data. The Campanian Plain is a graben like structure mainly filled of Miocene-Pleistocene alluvial, terrigenous and marine sediments deposited on Mesozoic carbonate platform lying at depths greater than 3 km. It is bordered by quiescent volcanoes in the North (Roccamonfina) and in the South (Campi Flegrei and Vesuvio) and seat of past volcanic activity as testified by lava bodies detected in deep drillings. The definition of Vs models in such context {{is very important to}} detect high temperatures related to magmatic activities. Vs velocity reductions have been detected beneath Campi Flegrei and the bay of Napoli at ~ 10 km depth; at a depth of about ~ 5 km or at 8 - 10 km depth below Vesuvio; at 6 - 9 km beneath Roccamonfina; 10 - 15 km depth, beneath two paths crossing the Campanian Plain. Seismic noise measurements have been performed during the period April 2009 – April 2010, using Kinemetrics Q 330 broadband stations equipped with Episensor ES–T FBA (Force balanced Accelerometer). The stations have been set at the borders of the Campanian Plain and noise recordings have been also cross-correlated with those of the INGV-Osservatorio Vesuviano network (OV) at Campi Flegrei. The cross-correlation of a <b>diffused</b> <b>field,</b> recorded at a pair of receivers, is related to the Green function of the medium. According to many researches in the last years, this is true also for one side NCF, coming out from a preferential source-receivers distribution. A total of 19 NCF have been analysed but only 7 average dispersion curves of Rayleigh group velocities have been computed. One-side cross-correlations have resulted being the sea the source of the recorded noise. Stability analysis shows that the computed NCF change daily but preserve monthly, even after some year. Dispersion data from NCF are relative to higher periods than those from earthquake recordings and are in very good agreement at the same periods. Despite some path, only the vertical component of the cross-correlation function has given reliable results. The dispersion data extracted from the NCF and some earthquake signals with T ≥ 3 s, have been combined with regional group and phase dispersion data (7 - 10 s < T < 150 s) in the Hedgehog inversion, allowing to investigate a maximum depth of 73 km. The main features of the Vs models in {{the central part of the}} Campanian Plain are the top of Mesozoic carbonatic sequences at about 4 km and the presence of Vs velocity reductions at 15 km. Such low velocity layer rises to 6 - 8 km in the south-eastern part of the Plain, towards Vesuvio. The Vs reductions (about 10 %) can be explained with the presence of partially melted material, in agreement with the studies at Vesuvio and Campi Flegrei. Moreover, a sharp increase of Vs to 3. 85 km/s at about 8 - 9 km of depth, above the low velocity layer, resembles the models at Roccamonfina and Colli Albani of a cooling magma chamber. These results are in agreement with the noticeable thickness of lava found in deep drillings and can be considered as the seismic signature of a widespread volcanic activity in the Campanian Plain as hypothesized on the basis of volcanological and geochemical studies (Campanian Volcanic Zone) ...|$|E

30|$|We review briefly the {{relationship}} between ensemble average correlations within a <b>diffuse</b> <b>field</b> and the imaginary part of Green’s functions.
