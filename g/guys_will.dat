[...] "There is an opinion that A-quality <b>guys</b> <b>will</b> find B-quality women, B-quality <b>guys</b> <b>will</b> find C-quality women, and C-quality men will find D-quality women," [...] says Huang Yuanyuan. [...] "The people left are A-quality women and D-quality men. So {{if you are}} a leftover woman, you are A-quality." [...] A University of North Carolina demographer who studies China's gender imbalance, Yong Cai, further notes that [...] "men at the bottom of society get left out of the marriage market, and that same pattern is coming to emerge for women at the top of society".|$|E

[...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when I feel my blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you <b>guys</b> <b>will</b> hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

In an interview with Eamonn Holmes for Sky News Sunrise in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] was released as a promotional single for the re-release of Overcome and for Christmas. During an interview talking about the song for Virgin Media in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] is a [...] "very special song" [...] and that despite it being a [...] "very emotional song to sing", it is one of her most favourite songs on Overcome.|$|E

500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he {{was added to the}} 40-man roster. Though he batted only [...]217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him." [...] Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. [...] "'s [...] not his personal catcher... Of course you <b>guys</b> <b>will</b> write whatever you want to write. If you want him to be his personal catcher, go right ahead. But I'll handle it anyway, so it doesn't matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} well received. On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} an 87% 'Fresh' rating based on 54 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 72 (generally {{favorable}} reviews) out of 100 based on 23 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Pi is a thriller. I am not very thrilled these days by whether the bad <b>guys</b> <b>will</b> get shot or the chase scene will end one way instead of another. You have to make a movie like that pretty skillfully before I care. But I am thrilled when a man risks his mind in the pursuit of a dangerous obsession." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, writing: [...] " [...] transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling. Reality is a fragile commodity, but, because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed, it's not hard to suspend disbelief....It probably deserves 3.1416 stars, but since my scale doesn't support that, I'll round it off to three." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Winston {{only being}} added {{late to the}} show, the writers {{developed}} the Nick–Winston dynamic in season 1 and sought to figure out Winston's relationship with the other loftmates in season 2. The writers noticed late during the first season that Morris seemed better suited to play a smart character and act as the loft's voice of reason, although Meriwether found that when Winston [...] "finally does blow up, he's crazier than all of them" [...] and that he works better [...] "in these kind of crazy, comedic runners, small pieces of the episode" [...] that contrast the relationship dramas of the other main characters. The Winston–Schmidt friendship was developed significantly {{in the second half}} of season 2 when the story focus moved to Nick and Jess. The Nick–Jess relationship affects the three guys' friendship as Nick starts being more considerate of Jess' feelings regarding shenanigans. Damon Wayans Jr. was planned to reprise his role as Coach in at least four episodes in the third season, according to Meriwether [...] "at a time when the roommates are at odds with each other" [...] and [...] "The guys are all fighting for his friendship." [...] The three <b>guys</b> <b>will</b> get intimidated by Coach's return, as he has [...] "this alpha male aggression" [...] and is [...] "that macho, tough-talking guy that they all think is so cool".|$|E
