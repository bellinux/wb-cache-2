The simulation of this model has to cope with the existence of largely disparate time scales for electrical and thermal effects.

Recent studies exhibit that incorporation of metal and/or semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) can further increase the PCE for OSCs. In this present work, we have synthesized SiO 2 NPs of various sizes (25, 50, 75 and 100 nm) using the modified Stober method and incorporated them into P 3 HT:PCBM photoactive layer and ZnO based electron transport layer (ETL) in order to investigate the light trapping effects in an OSC. Absorption studies have shown a considerable increase in photo absorption in both cases. The fabricated devices demonstrated 13 % increase in the PCE when SiO 2 NPs are incorporated in P 3 HT: PCBM photoactive layer, whereas PCE was increased by 20 % when SiO 2 NPs are incorporated in ZnO based ETL.

It aims to create an ecosystem of connected objects and provide ubiquitous connectivity between trillions of multi-role devices, such as sensors and actuators. Although recent advancements in miniaturization of devices with higher computational capabilities and ultra-low power communication technologies have enabled the vast deployment of sensors and actuators everywhere, such an evolution calls for fundamental changes in hardware design, software, network architecture, data analytic, data storage and power sources. A large portion of IoT devices cannot be powered by batteries only anymore, as they will be installed in hard to reach areas and regular battery replacement and maintenance is infeasible.

40|$|Current work {{presents}} a quantitative analysis of Joule heating by temperature measurements using infrared thermography and heat estimation of organic {{light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) and their correlation with <b>device</b> <b>life</b> <b>time.</b> These temperature measurements were performed at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mA/cm(2) current densities and studied with operational time. The temperature rise of the device has increased from 9. 8 to 16. 6 degrees C within 168 h at an operating current density of 40 mA/cm(2). This has been ascribed as due to the external contamination by water, oxygen, and dust particles as well as by internal heat generation. Encapsulation of the device avoids external degradation of OLEDs by preventing the destruction caused by these external contaminations. In this way, encapsulation has led to the decreased temperature rise of 12. 4 degrees C within the duration of 168 h, which reflects the improved stability of the device. The temperature measured has been used to calculate the heat generated inside the device by solving the heat conduction equation using a transverse matrix approach. It has been found by these calculations that about 97 %- 98 % of the power supplied to the device are converted into the heat for un-encapsulated device and results in rapid degradation of device with time, which in turns leads to the increase in operating voltage and decrease in luminous intensity with operational time. Proper encapsulation has reduced the heat generated inside the device by about 3 %- 4 %, thereby, increasing the life time of the device. However, the glass encapsulation reduces the possibilities of the device cooling by heat convection to the atmosphere and prohibited the maximum utilization of encapsulation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the fabrication and characterization of ultrathin insulator films. These {{are essential for}} nanoscale semiconductor device fabrication. When the insulator layer thickness {{is only a few}} times the molecule diameter, it is crucial that both film homogeneity and the insulator/semiconductor interface quality are as high as possible. The small dimensions must also be taken into account in characterization, because the established measurement techniques and analyses used in more traditional MOS characterization are not necessarily valid any more. In this work, the metal/silicon dioxide/silicon structure (especially oxide and oxide/semiconductor interface quality) and various silicon dioxide fabrication methods are discussed. The focus in the experimental work is on the studying the plasma assisted oxidation of silicon in an ultra high vacuum chamber and on characterizing the fabricated films. Some of the film properties are found to be excellent: interface smoothness is of a very high quality and interface state densities are low (1011 eV- 1 cm- 2 or lower in the mid-gap) even without any annealing. Process control also seems to be good, as is the breakdown field. The oxide charge, however, is quite high. This may cause considerable harm. One of the consequences is an increased leakage current. This also significantly decreases the <b>device</b> <b>life</b> <b>time</b> by increasing current generated defects. In the annealing experiments carried out, the oxide charge was seen to decrease, indicating that the quality of the silicon dioxide films can be significantly improved by optimization of the thermal treatments. The molecular beam epitaxy system used in processing is designed mainly for research purposes, offering possibility to gain much information about the oxidation process itself. Other, and cheaper, thermal oxidation procedures have in recent years already been developed to a very high level, which means that the process developed is not necessarily the best choice for conventional IC manufacturing purposes. It offers, however, useful applications for research into silicon-based nanostructures, such as silicon/silicon dioxide heterostructures. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Vacuum field {{emission}} devices {{have become a}} promising candidate for emerging display technology due to their interesting properties compared to conventional thermionic emission devices that require high temperature and power to operate. Unlike thermionic emission, {{field emission}} devices can induce the electrons to emit at low temperature; sharp and thin emitters on the cathode are desired {{in order to increase}} the field emission. Many candidates from other research groups, such as Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), SiC and ZnO, appear to have high field emission, but their complicated fabrication processes are the drawback. The silicon nanowhiskers produced by Geological & Nuclear Sciences (GNS) using Electron-Beam Rapid Thermal Annealing (EB-RTA) are an alternative material that is fast, inexpensive and uncomplicated to produce. They are based on the thermal desorption of silicon oxide, which forms silicon nanowhiskers on the silicon wafer in a short duration. Field emission diode structures on Silicon on Insulator (SOI) wafers were fabricated in order to investigate the field emission due to these GNS silicon nanowhiskers. An uncomplicated fabrication process using photolithography and etching process was developed. Electron beam lithography (EBL) was also used to create the different feature sizes directly onto the SOI wafer. The silicon nanowhiskers grown on these structures are as high as 35 nm with density distribution up to 30 µm⁻¹. The electrical characteristics of these devices are diode-like when the voltage range from - 40 V to 40 V is applied. The best samples produced an emitted current as high as 2 mA, which is suitable for many applications, such as flat panel displays, x-ray sources and high frequency devices.

40|$|A {{microscale}} plasma transistor {{capable of}} high speed switching was manufactured using microfabrication techniques and operated using microplasma discharges. Such a device has feature sizes {{on the order}} of 25 ?m, is robust against spikes in power, high temperatures, as well as electromagnetic interference and capable of low cost production through microfabrication. In this work two aspects of the Microscale Plasma Device development were investigated; (1) the microplasma properties and (2) the manufacturing of the MPD. To study the required plasma discharges and develop them to become better suited for the task at hand, Direct Current (DC) plasma discharge characteristics were investigated under pressures from atmospheric to 1. 65 MPa while varying current from 0. 1 mA to 4. 5 mA and gap length from 5 ?m up to 250 ?m. This testing was carried out in a high pressure test chamber fitted with a micrometer for variable electrode spacing and gas inlets and outlets for varying the working gas and pressure. Voltage and current measurements along with microscopic imaging and optical emission spectroscopy were taken for discharges in the varying gases to determine discharge V-I characteristics, sizes and temperatures. Data gathered was used to understand the microdischarge characteristics and tailor the plasma for application in the microtransistor. Discharges with diameters as small as 7 ?m have been achieved in Nitrogen and 16. 7 ?m in Helium by operating at low current, 0. 5 mA, and at pressures of 1. 65 MPa and 0. 34 MPa respectively. Paschen type, Pd, scaling is observed both in breakdown voltages, steady state voltage, and discharge size from 0. 1 MPa to 1. 65 MPa. The discharges operated in a normal glow regime with near constant normalized current densities and relatively flat voltage current characteristics indicating normal glow discharge behavior in the microplasmas. During device development small diameter metal wires, 25 ?m and 50 ?m, were used to carry out experiments on the microscale device to aid in electrode and substrate material selection. Robust electrode and substrate materials were required to withstand high discharge temperatures in order to prolong the <b>device</b> <b>life</b> <b>time.</b> As material selection was narrowed down microfabrication techniques were utilized to achieve smaller electrode geometry and electrode gap spacing with greater consistency.

Aluminum, Nickel, Copper and Titanium were deposited onto Alumina (Al_(2) O_(3)) and Ceria Stabilized Zirconia (CSZ) ceramic substrates, where only the latter two electrode materials proved to be robust enough to withstand the discharge temperatures. Superficial oxide layers on the electrode surfaces provided a protective coating, prolonging electrode lifetime in atmospheric air from 360 seconds to greater than 400 seconds without metal evaporation occurring.

We report on an experiment with a superconducting SRF gun, which can maintain a vacuum of nearly 10 - 12 torr because of cryo-pumping at the temperature of 4. 2 K. With conventional activation, we obtained a QE of 3 % at 532 nm, with lifetime of nearly 3 days in the preparation chamber. We plan to use this cathode in a 1. 3 GHz 1 / 2 cell SRF gun to study its performance. In addition, we studied the multipacting {{at the location of}} cathode. A new model based on the Forkker-Planck equation which can estimate the bunch length of the electron beam is discussed in this paper. Future particle accelerators such as eRHIC and ILC require high brightness, high current polarized electrons Recently, using a superlattice crystal, the maximum polarization of 95 % was reached. Activation with Cs,O lowers the electron affinity and makes it energetically possible for all the electrons excited in to the conduction band and reach the surface to escape into the vacuum. Presently the polarized electron sources are based on DC gun, such as that at the CEBAF at Jlab. In these <b>devices,</b> the <b>life</b> <b>time</b> of the cathode is extended due to the reduced back bombardment in their UHV conditions. However, the low accelerating gradient of the DC guns lead to poor longitudinal emittance. The higher accelerating gradient of the RF gun generates low emittance beams. Superconducting RF guns combine the excellent vacuum conditions of the DC guns with the higher accelerating gradients of the RF guns and provide potentially a long lived cathode with very low transverse and longitudinal emittance. In our work at BNL, we successfully activated the GaAs. The quantum efficient is 3 % at 532 nm and is expected to improve further. In addition, we studied the multipacting at the location of cathode. A new model based on the Forkker-Planck equation which can estimate the bunch length of the electron beam is discussed in this paper...|$|R
