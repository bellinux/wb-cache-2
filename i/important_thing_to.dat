5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the most}} important things to happen to PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer called it the best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012.

PC PowerPlay said DayZ was the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> happen to PC gaming in 2012.|$|E
25|$|La Luz was {{eventually}} {{expelled from the}} Puerto Rico Socialist Party because his ideals no longer aligned with the organization. Labeled a “Social Democrat” instead of being primarily nationalist, La Luz decided instead to become active in Democratic Party politics. He also began a career as an organizer for several unions, which sought to organize the growing Hispanic workforce in the low wage manufacturing and service sectors. For him, it had become clear that the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was {{to improve the lives}} of people who needed basic rights.|$|E
25|$|One <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} when assessing the urban forest's effect on air quality is that trees emit some biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} (BVOCs). These are the chemicals (primarily isoprene and monoterpenes) {{that make up the}} essential oils, resins, and other organic compounds that plants use to attract pollinators and repel predators. As mentioned above, VOCs react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to form ozone. BVOCs account for less than 10% of the total amount of BVOCs emitted in urban areas. This means that BVOC emissions from trees can contribute to the formation of ozone. Although their contribution may be small compared with other sources, BVOC emissions could exacerbate a smog problem.|$|E

25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
25|$|Ælfric {{was asked}} by Æthelweard to {{translate}} the book of Genesis up {{to the story of}} Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that is, into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of what the Bible said was the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E

Despite the date reflecting the arrival of the First Fleet, contemporary celebrations are not particularly historical in their theme. There are no large-scale re-enactments and the national leader's participation is focused largely on events such as the Australian of the Year Awards announcement and Citizenship Ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|Ben Parker's {{wife and}} Peter's aunt. Field said {{the main reason}} {{she felt she had}} to be in the film was because of {{producer}} Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have." [...] Webb said that while [...] "we all love Aunt May", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. [...] "He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment? That can create some tension, but you want there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{thought it was a}} [...] "quintessential" [...] Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a [...] "fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show". The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Mirkin while making the episode was {{to make sure that the}} elephant would be a [...] "bastard" [...] and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of putting people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant [...] "never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode [...] "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" [...] in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode [...] "Large Marge", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the [...] "slack-jawed yokels" [...] gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.|$|E

When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E
