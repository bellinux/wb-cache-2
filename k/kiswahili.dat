Within the EAC, there are two countries whose official language is French: Rwanda and Burundi. Numerous local languages are also spoken: for example, there are 56 local languages spoken in Uganda and 42 local languages in Kenya. Kinyarwanda is spoken in Rwanda and Uganda. In Kenya and Uganda, the medium of instruction in all schools is English.|$|E
25|$|Swahili {{is used in}} {{parliamentary}} debate, in {{the lower}} courts, and as a medium of instruction in primary school. English is used in foreign trade, in diplomacy, in higher courts, and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education, The Tanzanian government, however, has plans to discontinue English as a language of instruction. In connection with his Ujamaa social policies, President Nyerere encouraged the use of Swahili to help unify the country's many ethnic groups. Approximately 10 percent of Tanzanians speak Swahili as a first language, and up to 90 percent speak it as a second language. Many educated Tanzanians are trilingual, also speaking English. The widespread use and promotion of Swahili is contributing to the decline of smaller languages in the country. Young children increasingly speak Swahili as a first language, particularly in urban areas. Ethnic community languages (ECL) other than <b>Kiswahili</b> are not allowed as a language of instruction. Nor are they taught as a subject, though they might be used unofficially (illegally) in some cases in initial education. Television and radio programmes in an ECL are prohibited, and {{it is nearly impossible}} to get permission to publish a newspaper in an ECL.

500|$|The rebels, {{who called}} {{themselves}} [...] "Simbas" [...] (from the <b>Kiswahili</b> for [...] "lion"), had a populist but vague ideology, {{loosely based on}} communism, which prioritised equality and aimed to increase overall wealth. Most of the active revolutionaries were young men who hoped that the rebellion would provide them with opportunities which the government had not. The Simbas used magic to initiate members and believed that, by following a moral code, they could become invulnerable to bullets. Magic was also {{very important to the}} rebels who also made extensive use of witchcraft to protect themselves and also demoralise their ANC opponents. As they advanced, the rebels perpetrated numerous massacres in the territory they captured in order to remove political opposition and terrorise the population. ONUC {{was in the process of}} withdrawing when the rebellions started and had only 5,500 personnel, most whom were deployed in the eastern part of the country and stranded by the conflict. Straggling Western missionaries retreated to their respective embassies, which in turn requested UN assistance. A small force of peacekeepers was assembled and subsequently dispatched to the Kwilu region to retrieve fleeing missionaries. Rescue operations continued throughout March and April and resulted in the successful recovery of over 100 missionaries.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Kilimanjaro" [...] is not {{precisely}} known, {{but a number of}} theories exist.

2500|$|Often polysynthesis is {{achieved}} when languages have extensive agreement between elements verbs and their arguments {{so that the}} verb is marked for agreement with the grammatical subject and object. In this way a single word can encode information about all the elements in a transitive clause. In Indo-European languages the verb is usually only marked for agreement with the subject (e.g. Spanish hablo [...] "I speak" [...] where the -o ending marks agreement with the first person singular subject), but in many languages verbs also agree with the object (e.g. the <b>Kiswahili</b> word nakupenda [...] "I love you" [...] where the n- prefix marks agreement with the first person singular subject and the ku- prefix marks agreement with a second person singular object).|$|E
2500|$|In the 19th century, Mzizima (<b>Kiswahili</b> for [...] "healthy town") was {{a coastal}} fishing {{village on the}} {{periphery}} of Indian Ocean trade routes. In 1865 or 1866, Sultan Majid bin Said of Zanzibar began building a new city very close to Mzizima and named it Dar es Salaam. The name is commonly translated as [...] "abode/home of peace", based on the Arabic dar ("house"), and the Arabic es salaam ("of peace"), as opposed to the [...] "house of war" [...] (dar al-harb). Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the German East Africa Company established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, the OAU was disbanded and {{replaced}} by the African Union (AU). The AU adopted the Constitutive Act previously drawn up by the OAU in 2000. In Article 25, it is stated that the working languages of the Union and its institutions are Arabic, English, French and Portuguese, and if possible, all African languages. The AU also recognizes the national languages of each of its member institutions as stated in their national constitutions. In 2003, the AU adopted a protocol amending the Act such that working languages shall be renamed as official languages, and would encompass Spanish, <b>Kiswahili</b> and [...] "any other African language" [...] {{in addition to the}} four aforementioned languages [...] However, this Amendment has yet to be put into force, and the AU continues to use only the four working languages for its publications.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{languages}} {{other than}} English have equivalent colloquial terms for {{the tip of}} the tongue experience, suggesting that it is a common experience across cultures. In a study by B. L. Schwartz (1999), 45 of the 51 languages surveyed have an idiom referring to {{the tip of the}} tongue phenomenon that references the tongue, mouth, or throat as a metaphor. The direct English translations of these idioms are [...] "on the tongue", [...] "on the tip/point/head of the tongue", [...] "on the top of the tongue", [...] "on the front of the tongue", [...] "sparkling {{at the end of the}} tongue", and [...] "in the mouth and throat". Notably, the languages studied that did not have an equivalent idiom for the tip of the tongue were American Sign Language, Amharic, Icelandic, Indonesian, Kalenjin, and <b>Kiswahili.</b> [...] However, tip of the finger experiences are reported by signers.|$|E
2500|$|Eric Edward Khasakhala {{was born}} at Ebwali village in the British Colony and Protectorate of Kenya in Western Kenya, to Zakayo [...] "Daktari" [...] Kwendo and Damary Oyando on 26 March 1926. His father was an illustrious local preacher, and the first medical doctor and a {{clinical}} officer in Bunyore; hence the nickname of [...] "Daktari" [...] (<b>Kiswahili</b> term for physician). [...] His parents were the Luhya (Bantu Kavirondo) people of Bunyore; a gerontocratic acephalous society with a representative system of governance and collegial leadership structure composed of mainly a council of elders, theirs was a collegial system of Barraza to which his grandfather had been a member. [...] Thus, Khasakhala's formative years were spent as an apprentice of his father—often assisted him with his various preaching and doctoring initiatives; it's also quite likely that Khasakhala, as the eldest son, was at his father's side the Barraza sessions. This might account for his amicable reconciliatory political style since the Nyore council of elders were key instruments of resolving conflicts among the populaces of their boroughs, {{as well as any}} inter-clan disputes.|$|E
2500|$|Xylophones {{are widely}} used in music of west and central Africa. The name marimba stems from Bantu marimba or malimba, 'xylophone'. According to some Western sources, the word 'marimba' is formed from ma 'many' and rimba 'single-bar xylophone,' however {{the use of the}} term marimba and/or {{derivative}} terms is not present in any West African language. The instrument itself is present, but is called balafon or heri in Mali and/or Guinea, while it is known as gyil among the Akan peoples in and around Ghana. The word marimba and derivative words is used widely in East, Central and Southern Africa. A survey of the literature on the African marimba and related instruments, like the Xylorimba, likembe and ilimba indicate a relationship between the word marimba and the various lamellaphones found all over Central and East Africa. Other sources credit the creation of the marimba and the kalimba to Queen Marimba of the Wakambi people, who live south of Lake Victoria. In the Shona language [...] "imba" [...] means song. Kuimba is to sing. Marimba, is said to be the [...] "mother of song" [...] and the creator of all the instruments, including the marimba. Mama means mother in <b>Kiswahili,</b> so it makes perfect sense that the word mother would be combined with the word [...] "imba" [...] which is the unconjugated verb for 'sing'. The karimba is also said to have been created by Queen Marimba. In much of East & Central Africa the karimba is seen as a hand-held version of the marimba.|$|E
