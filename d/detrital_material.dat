The ESR signal intensity and CI values {{have been used to}} distinguish sources of sediments, such as eolian dusts from various deserts in western China (e.g., Nagashima et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2007). We focused on the quartz fraction because it is the most common mineral in <b>detrital</b> <b>materials</b> and is resistant to physical and chemical weathering. Moreover, its specific gravity is close to the average of <b>detrital</b> <b>materials,</b> meaning that size-sorting effects are minimal. The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize quartz in the sediments discharged from each tributary of the Yangtze River based on ESR signal intensity and CI values and (ii) test whether the relative contribution of <b>detrital</b> <b>materials</b> derived from different tributaries is accurately reflected in ESR signal intensity and CI values of quartz in sediments deposited along the mainstream and discharged from the rivermouth.|$|R

Alluvium is sand, clay, or other similar <b>detrital</b> <b>material</b> deposited by running water. [...] The distinction between colluvium and alluvium relates to the involvement of running water. Alluvium specifically refers to the geomorphic processes involved with flowing water and so alluvium is generally fine-grained clay and silt material that has the capacity to be entrained in water currents and eventually deposited. For these same reasons, alluvium is also generally well sorted material while colluvium is not.|$|E

This interspecific competition affects the N. serricornis very little due to their generalized diet but when the two do interact Corydalus cornutus dominates.

50|$|After the Barremian/Aptian boundary, {{marked by}} another high stand of the sea, {{there were four}} more sea-level {{oscillations}} during the Aptian and the Albian, bringing about a very significant sediment accumulation (in some places up to 3000 m). Due to sinking grabens in the Atlantic domain, the water masses of the Atlantic and the Tethys mixed for the first time. The Aptian/Albian sediments are characterised by the competitive interplay between fine-grained terrigenic and organic material.

40|$|AbstractThe late Paleozoic {{evolution}} of the Wulijishanhen (WSH) -Shangdan (SD) area near to the Chaganchulu Ophiolite belt is reinterpreted. Analysis of the upper Carboniferous to lower Permian sedimentary sequence, biological associations, <b>detrital</b> <b>materials,</b> sandstone geochemistry and volcanic rocks indicates that the SD area was an epicontinental sea and rift during the late Paleozoic rather than a large-scale ocean undergoing spreading and closure. This study reveals that the actual {{evolution of}} the study area is from the late Carboniferous to the early Permian. The fusulinids Triticites sp. and Pseudoschwagerina sp. in the limestones demonstrate that the Amushan Formation develops during the late Carboniferous to the early Permian. The limestones {{at the base of the}} SD section indicate that it is a stable carbonate platform environment, the volcanic rocks in the middle of the sequence support a rift tectonic background, and the overlying conglomerates and sandstones are characteristic of an epicontinental sea or marine molasse setting. The rift volcanism made the differences in the fossil content of the SD and WSH sections and led to two sections expose different levels within the Amushan Formation and different process of tectonic evolution. Moreover, the geochemical characteristics and <b>detrital</b> <b>materials</b> of the sandstones show that the provenance and formation of the sandstones were related to the setting of active continental margin. The quartz-feldspar-lithic fragments distribution diagram indicates that the material source for the sandstones was a recycled orogenic belt. Thus, the source area of the sandstones may have been an active continental margin before the late Carboniferous–early Permian. The characteristics of the regional tectonic {{evolution of the}} area indicate that the region may form a small part of the Gobi–Tianshan rift of southern Mongolia...|$|R

50|$|Channel iron {{deposits}} {{are formed}} by accumulation of massive deposits {{of what is}} generally referred to as “pisolite iron gravels”, which are ooids and pisoids of goethite. CIDs were initially considered to be analogous to accumulations of pisolite gravels within palaeochannels via sedimentary means. Modern evidence points to an in-situ formation of the classic pisoilitic textures. Goethite ooids and pisoids show evidence of being formed by concretion of layers of goethite (cortex) around a core fragment (nucleus) which is typically ferruginised wood fragments, but may be quartz grains, hematite grains or other <b>detrital</b> <b>material.</b> It is considered that the mechanism for enrichment and formation of the goethite cortex is related to near-surface alteration of an existing highly ferruginous material by groundwater action. Ferruginised wood is ubiquitous and {{a major component of}} CIDs, existing as porous, friable limonite. Fossilised wood fragments are present but are usually extremely rare and of very small size (<50 mm). The goethite pisolites are cemented via a variety of agents, usually a mixture of goethite, clays, carbonate minerals (magnesite, calcite and sometimes siderite), and occasionally silica. This process may form an in-situ concretion of pisolites which may be very resistant to erosion - some mesas in the Pilbara, and Yilgarn are in fact old cemented ferruginous pisolite river gravels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{lacustrine}} sediments, aragonite is {{a widespread}} mineral, whereas monohydrocalcite is a rare carbonate mineral. In the cold and high-attitude Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau, where aragonite has been commonly found in lacustrine sediments, there is no aragonite, but low-Mg calcite, monohydrocalcite and trace dolomite. The lake receives solutes primarily from surface runoffs and remains fairly constant water chemistry for a long time. The total CaCO 3 percentage in sediments could be controlled by evaporation and inflow of <b>detrital</b> <b>materials.</b> The absence of aragonite is unusual {{when compared to other}} lacustrine sediments from the Tibetan Plateau.
