In a similar list, IGN staff ranked the episode as Lost's 51st best, and {{observed}} that [...] "despite [...] dark past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> to love the character even more after this episode." [...] MTV ranked the episode the 32nd best of the series. Writing for Zap2it in 2008, Ryan McGee said he particularly enjoyed the episode and deemed it {{one of his top}} ten favorite episodes that had aired up to that point. McGee explained that [...] "Solitary" [...] contains [...] "a lot of enclosed encounters between two people, set against a gorgeously shot B story that warms the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|At the February 19, 2011, date of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Born This Way" [...] as {{a second}} encore, using the same general attire and choreography as the Grammy performance, however the incubation vessel was not present and slight alterations {{were made in the}} outfits of her dancers. The track was then added to the set-list of the concert tour. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger was most impressed with the performance, calling it {{one of the highlights of}} the concert. He added that [...] "reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> to wish she could get back to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out." [...] Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in May 2011, along with another song from Born This Way, [...] "You and I". Sitting atop a high stool, Gaga—in a red leather blazer, a floppy mask-like hat and see-through leopard bodysuit—played a piano made out of a wire high-heel structure.|$|E
500|$|Voodoo {{incorporates}} musical {{elements of}} jazz, funk, hip hop, blues, and soul, {{as well as}} ambient music with a musical layer shaped by guitar-based funk. It features vintage influences and a looser, more improvisational structure, which contrasts the more conventional song structure of Brown Sugar. Music writer Greg Kot has considered the album a production of the Soulquarians, calling it [...] "the most radical of the many fine records" [...] conceived by the collective's members. In {{an interview with the}} New Orleans Times-Picayunes Shawn Rhea, D'Angelo attributed the album's experimental and jam-like atmosphere to {{the fact that most of}} Voodoo was recorded [...] "live and its first take". On its eclectic and conceptual style, Rhea commented [...] " [...] seems to have channeled the brilliance of his musical forefathers, living and dead, during the crafting of this album. It is a complex, intricate collection of songs that, like voodoo, is simultaneously secular and spiritual, sensual and sacred, earthbound and ethereal". Recording engineer Russell Elevado's analog mixing and old school production techniques contributed to the album's jazz element and vintage sound. On its jazz influence, D'Angelo stated [...] "because a lot of the album was cut live and has free playing on it, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> to go in a jazz direction".|$|E

500|$|The {{first episode}} of the series was {{screened}} privately to media on 17 January 2008, prior the media had been treated with extracts and trailers promoting the series. On 3 January 2008, The Sydney Morning Herald's critic Michael Idato declared the series [...] "The Blue Murder of its time", referring to the critically acclaimed 1995 ABC TV drama Blue Murder, {{considered by many to}} be the finest crime drama ever produced in Australia. In a review on his blog on 17 January 2008, David Knox, stated that Underbelly [...] "is our own Sopranos", and awarded it 4.5 out of 5. He also commented [...] "If there are any criticisms to be found with Underbelly, they are few. One or two shots give away that period Melbourne was actually shot in 2007. And while watching these gangsters thrive on power with ballsy disdain, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> to think of the behaviour of some television executives in recent history. This aside, Underbelly looks set to be one of the highlights of the 2008 television year." [...] A review appeared in the Herald Sun on 18 January 2008, in which critic Paul Anderson quoted: [...] "Whether you followed the Melbourne gangland war or not, there's a fair chance you will be blown away by the coming TV series Underbelly. [...] is a slick, violent and sexually charged dramatisation backed by a ripping soundtrack." [...] In an article appearing on 31 January 2008, The Daily Telegraph's TV editor, Marcus Casey, said of Underbelly after viewing the first four episodes: [...] "If the quality is maintained then, while not perfect, Underbelly should equal, if not better, Australia's best ever crime dramas – the Phoenix series and Blue Murder." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. He {{felt it was}} {{refreshing}} to have a story about aliens that weren't invading and opined that [...] "the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale-like moans of agony from the beast tug on a few heartstrings." [...] However, he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as [...] "basically a giant, moaning turd {{sitting in the middle}} of a warehouse" [...] and [...] "a large lump of putty with eyes". He felt that the episode gave Rhys [...] "a chance to step into the spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story" [...] and felt his reaction to the existence of aliens to be [...] "perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced". Despite this, he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood put an end to the [...] "fun" [...] of Gwen [...] "keeping secrets and concealing her double life" [...] and expressed disappointment that Jack didn't wipe his memory at the end of the episode. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a [...] "messy, odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters" [...] but felt the episode had several weak points. He felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> to see Rhys as [...] "a buffoon" [...] and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation. He also felt that it pushed [...] "beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects" [...] and the creature itself looked like [...] "a hand puppet". Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the [...] "Welsh heart of the show" [...] and praised his role in the episode for being [...] "actually rather entertaining, approaching everything with invigorating gusto." [...] However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being [...] "daftly mawkish" [...] and opined that [...] "it’s always impossible to care about CGI characters".|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Hetero", with lyrics {{written by}} Stevenson, drew some {{negative}} remarks. Reviewing the band's May 25, 1995 performance at Irving Plaza, Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "openly homophobic, {{and it goes}} on to describe the narrator as a 'cigarette smokin', seal killin' redneck. Jon Ginoli, openly gay frontman of the queercore band Pansy Division, called it [...] "an obviously anti-gay backlash song. In it [...] proclaims himself as a normal straight guy who can't get laid, and he's blaming gay guys. What? In his words, 'the only way you're cool is if you're gay or dead'. Huh? 'Maybe I should pierce my butt or get a few tattoos / Maybe I should wear a dress and be a homo like you / Normal, hetero, straight guy / Yeah that's right, I'm a straight, normal, girl fuckin', coffee drinkin', titty suckin', cigarette smokin', seal killin', redneck-ass bastard from hell'. Hmm, I don't think the gay guys are to blame for that [...] Hearing the song, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> to take it personally [...] At the same time I felt sad for the guy, who so obviously appeared threatened by gay people having more visibility and acceptance." ...|$|E

I came out into more open slope, but steeper, and harder to cling on. Ledges cropped out, cliffs and ravines {{obstructed}} my passage and trees were not close enough to help me much. Some long slopes of dark, mossy, bare earth I actually ran down, trusting to light swift steps rather than slow careful ones. It was exhilarating, that descent under the shady spruces.
