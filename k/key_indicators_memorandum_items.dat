30|$|When {{designing}} appropriate welfare measures, {{two approaches}} can be differentiated {{with respect to}} the indicators, namely either establishing an integrated indicator (composite or aggregated indicator) or designing a set of <b>key</b> <b>indicators</b> (dashboard). A composite indicator condenses the welfare construct into a single value. This can be monetary, as particularly {{in the case of the}} so-called GDP revisions [e.g., Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) or the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW)], as well as non-monetary, as in the case of multi-component indicators [e.g., Human Development Index (HDI) or Gross National Happiness Index (GNH)]. By contrast, in the cases where a set of <b>key</b> <b>indicators</b> is used, welfare can be described by means of a selection and combination of various indicators, which are themselves mostly the result of several aggregation stages: from raw data via partial <b>indicators</b> to <b>key</b> <b>indicators.</b> The <b>key</b> <b>indicators</b> represent the situation or development of a subdomain of welfare and are not finally condensed (e.g., such as those stated in the Eurostat Monitoring Report 2013).|$|R

This study developed <b>key</b> <b>indicators</b> for useful-energy demand for end-use sectors such as industry, commerce, and residence. <b>Key</b> <b>indicators</b> for transport sector and non-energy use sectors were developed on transport mobility demand and end-use fuel demand.
