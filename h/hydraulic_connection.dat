40|$|Hydraulic {{architecture}} prescribes {{water flow}} in plants and is, therefore, fundamental to {{many areas of}} plant physiology. It is usually analysed destructively, or on excised material. A method is explored here based on displacement transducers for the continuous, nondestructive assessment of functional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> within the intact plant. The graft union was chosen as a test system. The technique involves repeated application of water {{at some point in}} the system, while simultaneously observing patterns of swelling (increase in water status) at other points. Such patterns will reflect the hydraulic resistance of the intervening pathways. It is demonstrated that the major <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> within the graft union of tomato become functional over a period of about 48 h from the fifth day after grafting.

50|$|Most {{downhole}} {{safety valves}} are controlled hydraulically from the surface, meaning they are opened using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> linked {{directly to a}} well control panel. When hydraulic pressure is applied down a control line, the hydraulic pressure forces a sleeve within the valve to slide downwards. This movement compresses a large spring and pushes the flapper downwards to open the valve. When hydraulic pressure is removed, the spring pushes the sleeve back up and causes the flapper to shut. In this way, it is failsafe and will isolate the wellbore {{in the event of}} a loss of the wellhead. The full designation for a typical valve is 'tubing retrievable, surface controlled, subsurface safety valve', abbreviated to TR-SCSSV.|$|E

50|$|Saltwater {{intrusion}} is {{the movement}} of saline water into freshwater aquifers, {{which can lead to}} contamination of drinking water sources and other consequences. Saltwater intrusion occurs naturally to some degree in most coastal aquifers, owing to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> between groundwater and seawater. Because saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher water pressure. As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater. Certain human activities, especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells, have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas. Water extraction drops the level of fresh groundwater, reducing its water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland. Other contributors to saltwater intrusion include navigation channels or agricultural and drainage channels, which provide conduits for saltwater to move inland, and it can also make sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion can also be worsened by extreme events like hurricane storm surges.|$|E
50|$|Warren County {{citizens}} {{argued that}} the toxic waste landfill regulations {{were based on the}} fundamental assumption that the EPA's conceptual dry-tomb landfill would contain the toxic waste. This assumption informed the siting of toxic waste landfills and waivers to regulations that were included in EPA's Federal Register. For example, in 1978, the base of a major toxic waste landfill could be no closer than five feet from ground water, but this regulation and others could be waived. The waiver to the regulation concerning the distance between the base of a toxic waste landfill and groundwater allowed the base to be only a foot above ground water if the owner/operator of the facility could demonstrate to the EPA regional administrator that a leachate collection system could be installed and {{that there would be no}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> between the base of the landfill and groundwater. Citizens {{argued that the}} waivers to the siting regulations were discriminatory mechanisms facilitating the shift from scientific to political considerations concerning the siting decision and that in the South this would mean a discriminatory proliferation of dangerous waste management facilities in poor black and other minority communities. They also argued that the scientific consensus was that permanent containment could not be assured. As resistance to the siting of the PCB landfill in Warren County continued and studies revealed that EPA dry-tomb landfills were failing, EPA stated in its Federal Register that all landfills would eventually leak and should only be used as a stopgap measure.|$|E

30|$|Another common {{error in}} {{vulnerability}} validation is the ignorance of lateral contaminant fluxes. By definition, aquifer vulnerability {{accounts for the}} vertical susceptibility {{of the system and}} is not considered for any lateral crossflows of contaminant plumes from adjacent hydrogeological units. Hence, practically validation with measured contaminant values at the saturated zone should be only performed at hydrologically “closed” systems, without any <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> with other units (surface or underground); if not, then potential migrations of contaminant plume(s) have {{to be taken into account}} prior to validation.|$|R

Two cross-borehole flow tests were completed. Each test involved measurement and analysis of transient flow in a newly installed deep corehole with a long open interval during short-term pumping and recovery in an adjacent shallow well with a short open interval. The cross-borehole flow test in the mudstone identified a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> through a dipping fractured bed between the pumped interval in the well and a flow zone at an intermediate depth in the corehole. The presence of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> between the pumped well and the corehole was not obvious because the water-level response in the corehole was dominated by a shallow zone of high transmissivity, which was hydraulically isolated from the pumped interval. In the sandstone, the cross-borehole flow test identified a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> along dipping fractured beds as well as a connection to a deep high-angle fracture that cuts across bedding.

40|$|International audienceThe {{geometry}} and connectivity of fractures exert {{a strong influence}} on the flow and transport properties of fracture networks. We present a novel approach to stochastically generate three-dimensional discrete networks of connected fractures that are conditioned to hydrological and geophysical data. A hierarchical rejection sampling algorithm is used to draw realizations from the posterior probability density function at different conditioning levels. The method is applied to a well-studied granitic formation using data acquired within two boreholes located 6 m apart. The prior models include 27 fractures with their geometry (position and orientation) bounded by information derived from single-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired during saline tracer tests and optical televiewer logs. Eleven cross-hole <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> between fractures in neighboring boreholes and {{the order in which}} the tracer arrives at different fractures are used for conditioning. Furthermore, the networks are conditioned to the observed relative hydraulic importance of the different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> by numerically simulating the flow response. Among the conditioning data considered, constraints on the relative flow contributions were the most effective in determining the variability among the network realizations. Nevertheless, we find that the posterior model space is strongly determined by the imposed prior bounds. Strong prior bounds were derived from GPR measurements and helped to make the approach computationally feasible. We analyze a set of 230 posterior realizations that reproduce all data given their uncertainties assuming the same uniform transmissivity in all fractures. The posterior models provide valuable statistics on length scales and density of connected fractures, as well as their connectivity. In an additional analysis, effective transmissivity estimates of the posterior realizations indicate a strong influence of the DFN structure, in that it induces large variations of equivalent transmissivities between realizations. The transmissivity estimates agree well with previous estimates at the site based on pumping, flowmeter and temperature data...|$|R
40|$|A {{geological}} medium that exhibits two distinct types of flow {{is known as}} dual-permeability medium. Unconsolidated deposits composed of coarse (3 ̆e 2 mm diameter) clasts (gravel, talus, rockslide debris), engineered systems (heap leach piles, capillary barriers, rock fill), and mine/construction waste fall into this category. The large inter-clast pores that are characteristic {{of this type of}} media will drain at near zero matric potentials constraining flow to the interiors of porous clasts and/or the clast surfaces. In either case, water must pass through hydraulic bridges (porous contacts and/or pendular water) that form physical connections between neighboring clasts. Therefore, properties of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> place a primary control on flow structure. This dissertation presents three projects designed to study the influence of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> on unsaturated flow in dual-permeability media. A numerical experiment performed to examine how the cross-sectional area and hydraulic conductivity of a bridge influence steady-state flow through a spherical clast is presented in the second chapter of the dissertation. The cross-sectional area of the bridges relative to that of the clast (Ar) was varied across six orders of magnitude between simulations. The ratio of hydraulic conductivity between bridges and clasts (Kb/Kc) was varied across 12 orders of magnitude to consider resistive, neutral, and conductive bridges. Results show a non-linear dependency of volumetric flow through the clast on both Ar and Kb/Kc. The intra-clast flow distribution shifts outwards as Ar increases. Conductive bridges promote this process and resistive bridges impede it. The third chapter presents a series of bench-scale experiments performed to evaluate the geometry of a pendular bridge under different flow rates through it and at different inclinations. Results show that bridge size increases in a nonlinear fashion with flow rate and decreases with inclination from vertical. The vertical profile of the bridge closely resembled a parabola in all experiments, in contrast to the profile of a static bridge that resembles the arc of a circle. Bridge geometry was independent of flow history. Flow is active through the entire volume of the bridge and exhibits non-laminar characteristics. The fourth chapter describes a series of bench-scale experiments designed to explore the influence of matrix-to-matrix <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> on two-dimensional transient wetting of a porous matrix. Cross-sectional area of the connection (Ar) relative to that of the matrix block and location of the connection relative to edges of the block were varied between trials. Results show that the rate of imbibition into the porous block nonlinearly increases with Ar. Moving the connection towards an edge of the block significantly decreases the imbibition rate. Saturation increase of the matrix block before the wetting front reaches all edges remains consistent independent of the connection. The last chapter summarizes results of the research and discusses about future research on this topic...|$|R

The fractures provide rapid <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> but little fluid mass storage, whereas the porous matrix represents high storage but low <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection.</b> The flow model incorporated in COSFLOW is similar to the conventional flow model; i.e. the flow in the fracture (cleat) system is controlled by the pressure gradient and is described using Darcy’s law, whereas, the desorption (flow in the matrix) is controlled by the concentration gradient and is described using Fick’s law. The relationship between gas concentration and pressure is a non-linear function and is described using Langmuir equations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{convective}} drying of {{a natural}} porous material, limestone, is investigated in this study, with both experimental and numerical approaches. The first experimental campaign, which focuses {{on the influence of}} samples ’ slenderness, suggests the presence of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> layer between the porous water and the external environment, in spite of the very fine pore structure of the material. This hydraulic transfer enables the fast water evaporation {{at the beginning of the}} drying test, when external conditions drive the kinetics. Furthermore, the results show that this layer does not exceed 30 mm deep from the external surface, given the drying conditions of the test. A second experimental campaign aims to analyse, by mean of an X-ray tomography tool, the internal water content during the drying. It confirms that water transfer takes place within the limestone in two distinct stages. The first stage being faster than the second one with a homogeneous desaturation along the sample, it is consistent with the hypothesis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> layer. Finally, the finite element modelling makes possible to identify the main mechanisms of water transfer, namely liquid convection and vapour diffusion...|$|E
