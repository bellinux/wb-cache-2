40|$|International audienceThe {{main part}} of the Cluster Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations (STAFF) {{experiment}} consists of triaxial search coils allowing the measurements of the three magnetic components of the waves from 0. 1 Hz up to 4 kHz. Two sets of data are produced, one by a module to filter and transmit the corresponding waveform up to either 10 or 180 Hz (STAFF-SC), and the second by the onboard Spectrum Analyser (STAFF-SA) to compute the elements of the spectral matrix for five components of the waves, 3 × B and 2 × E (from the EFW experiment), in the frequency range 8 Hz to 4 kHz. In order to understand the way the output signals of the search coils are calibrated, the transfer functions of the different parts of the instrument are described as well as the way to transform telemetry data into physical units across various coordinate systems from the spinning sensors to a fixed and known frame. The instrument sensitivity is discussed. Cross-calibration <b>inside</b> <b>STAFF</b> (SC and SA) is presented. Results of cross-calibration between the STAFF search coils and the Cluster Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) data are discussed. It is shown that these cross-calibrations lead to an agreement between both data sets at low frequency within a 2 % error. By means of statistics done over 10 yr, it is shown that the functionalities and characteristics of both instruments have not changed during this period...|$|E
