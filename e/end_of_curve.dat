As the analytic form is exact for infinite short length region, for finite length segregation, the omitted items should be retrieved to get high precision. Based on the unit orthogonal transformation in geometrical field theory, the Frenet formula is reformed for finite length region. Then, for given triple at the initial <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>curve,</b> using the curve parameters of curvature and torsion, the exact finite element formulation of Frenet formula is obtained to get the triples at any length position until the end point of curve.

In this study we seek to understand the mechanism of the distributed heat on the curve surface {{with the goal of}} identifying preferred methods to predicting jet performance. The goals that have been achieved in the numerical results displayed are determine the influence of impingement jet characteristics on thermal and flow field on a curve surface, determine the variation of Nusselt numbers (NuD) along the curve surface {{in order to understand the}} heat transfer characteristics and study the effect of position (in the center, in the mid and in the end) and angle (α= 90 °, 60 ° and 30 °) of jet impingement on curve surface, different Reynolds numbers (ReD) in range of (5000, 6000, 7000, 8000 and 9000). The program, which was extracted results it is (GAMBIT 2. 4. 6) and (FLUENT 6. 3), simulation is (2 -D) in submerged jet flow and the continuity, momentum and energy equations were solved by means of a finite volume method (FVM). This study covers the effect of different Reynolds numbers (ReD) on average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg) and local Nusselt numbers (NuD). From the result, the average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg) increased with the increase of Reynolds numbers (ReD) for all cases, in comparison between different positions (center, mid and end), of nozzle on curve surface at angle (α= 90 °) the maximum value of average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg= 388. 3) is found when the nozzle locate in the end followed by the mid position and smallest value of average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg= 182. 25) in the center of curve surface. In case of slant angle (α= 60 º) the maximum value of average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg= 387. 47) is found when the nozzle locate in the end followed by the mid position and smallest value of average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg= 308. 3) in the center of curve surface. In case of slant angle (α= 30 º) the maximum value of average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg= 323. 8) is found when the nozzle locate in the mid followed by the center position and smallest value of average Nusselt numbers (Nuavg= 185) in the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> surface. The effect of jet impingement in the center, mid and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> surface at different slant angles (α= 30 °, 60 ° and 90 °) on the contours of velocity and temperature are also presented, it is clearly found that the strong mixing or high turbulence flow beside the stagnation point in the right and left sides in case of the nozzle in the center and in the mid, and also noted that the flow beside the stagnation point in the one sides only in case of the nozzle in the end which leading to provide the many vortices and this vortices increases with increase the Reynolds numbers (ReD). The highest mixing flow and vortices was noted at highest Reynolds number (ReD= 9000) the flow was found weak at smallest Reynolds number (ReD= 5000). The variations of local Nusselt numbers (NuD) with (s/B) for different Reynolds numbers (ReD) were also presented. It is clearly seen that the local Nusselt numbers (NuD) increases with the rise of Reynolds numbers (ReD) for the nozzle for all cases...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 - 18 A Root Cause Failure Analysis (RCFA) for {{repeated}} {{impeller blade}} failures in a five stage centrifugal propane compressor is described. The initial failure occurred in June 2007 {{with a large}} crack found in one blade on the third impeller and two large pieces released from adjacent blades on the fourth impeller. An RCFA was performed to {{determine the cause of}} the failures. The failure mechanism was identified to be high cycle fatigue. Several potential causes related to the design, manufacture, and operation of the compressor were examined. The RCFA concluded that the design and manufacture were sound and there were no conclusive issues with respect to operation. A specific root cause was not identified. In June 2009, a second case of blade cracking occurred with a piece once again released from a single blade on the fourth impeller. Due to the commonality with the previous instance this was identified as a repeat failure. Specifically, both cases had occurred in the same compressor whereas, two compressors operating in identical service in adjacent Liquefied natural Gas (LNG) trains had not encountered the problem. A second RCFA was accordingly launched with the ultimate objective of preventing further repeated failures. Both RCFA teams were established comprising of engineers from the End User (RasGas), the OEM (Elliott Group) and an independent consultancy (Southwest Research Institute). The scope of the current investigation included a detailed metallurgical assessment, impeller modal frequency assessment, steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) assessment, finite element analyses (FEA), fluid structure interaction (FSI) assessment, operating history assessment and a comparison change analysis. By the process of elimination, the most probable causes were found to be associated with: Vane wake excitation of either the impeller blade leading edge modal frequency from severe mistuning and/or unusual response of the 1 -diameter cover/blades modal frequency: Mist carry over from third side load upstream scrubber; <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> operation in the compressor rear section...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{importance}} of the most commonly used factors in models of the term structure and contingent claims prices, as well as {{the importance of}} one seldom used factor. To this end, the paper develops a continuous-time, four-factor model of the term structure. The factors include the instantaneous interest rate, its volatility, its long-run mean, and a factor that is "independent" of, i. e., not a component of, the interest rate process. In addition, the model incorporates systematic jump risk in the interest rate process. Closed form solutions for bond prices are derived. Using the Fourier transform of a bond yield's transition density, we obtain continuous-time estimates for all parameters. Results indicate that jumps and volatility have a relatively minor impact on asset prices, with jumps being more important of the two at the long <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the yield <b>curve</b> and volatiliy more important in the middle. The interest rate, as expected, is the most important factor for the entire curve, particularly for the short <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>curve.</b> The independent factor, seldom used in term structure models, is found to be the next most important factor on average, especially for the long <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the yield <b>curve.</b> The long-run mean is found to be important for the long <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>curve,</b> as well, though not as important as the interest rate o...|$|R
