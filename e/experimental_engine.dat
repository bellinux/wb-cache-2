25|$|The only large three-drum boiler used in {{a railway}} {{locomotive}} was Nigel Gresley's <b>experimental</b> <b>Engine</b> 10000 of 1924 for the LNER company. Having observed the benefits of higher pressures and compound engines in marine practice, Gresley was keen to experiment with this approach in a railway locomotive. As with the land-based boilers, Harold Yarrow was keen to expand the market for Yarrow's boiler.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot {{designed}} a two-seat pusher configuration landplane fighter aircraft, (possibly designated the P.V.3). Although {{this was not}} built, Port Victoria was ordered to build a floatplane derivative for reconnaissance operations, being required to carry a Lewis gun and radio and to have an endurance of eight hours. The resultant aircraft, the Port Victoria P.V.4, had sesquiplane wings and a small streamlined nacelle for the two crew, which {{was attached to the}} upper wing. It was to be powered by a 150hp (112kW) Smith Static radial engine, an <b>experimental</b> <b>engine</b> which, while light, promised excellent fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|The Air Ministry still {{saw little}} {{immediate}} {{value in the}} effort (they regarded it as long-range research), and having no production facilities of its own, Power Jets entered into an agreement with steam turbine specialists British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to build an <b>experimental</b> <b>engine</b> facility at a BTH factory in Rugby, Warwickshire. Work progressed quickly, {{and by the end}} of the year 1936 the prototype detail design was finalised and parts for it were well on their way to being completed, all within the original £2,000 budget. However, by 1936, Germany had also started working on jet engines (Herbert A. Wagner at Junkers and Hans von Ohain at Heinkel) and, although they too had difficulty overcoming conservatism, the German Ministry of Aviation (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) was more supportive than their British counterpart.|$|E

25|$|Based upon designs {{produced}} by Power Jets, Rolls-Royce produced more advanced and powerful turbojet engines. Beyond numerous improvements {{made to the}} Welland engine that powered the early Meteors, Rolls-Royce and Power Jets collaborated to develop the more capable Derwent engine, which as the Rover B.26 had undergone a radical re-design from the W.2B/500 while at Rover. The Derwent engine, and the re-designed Derwent V based on the Nene, was installed {{on many of the}} later production Meteors, the adoption of this new powerplant led to considerable performance increases. The Meteor often served {{as the basis for the}} development of other early turbojet designs; a pair of Meteor F.4s were sent to Rolls-Royce to aid in their <b>experimental</b> <b>engine</b> trials, RA435 being used for reheat testing, and RA491 being fitted with the Rolls-Royce Avon, an axial-flow engine. From their involvement in the development of the Meteor's engines, Armstrong-Siddeley, Bristol Aircraft, Metropolitan-Vickers, and de Havilland would also independently develop their own gas turbine engines.|$|E
500|$|The Coandă-1910, {{designed}} by Romanian inventor Henri Coandă, was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft {{powered by a}} ducted fan. Called the [...] "turbo-propulseur" [...] by Coandă, its <b>experimental</b> <b>engine</b> consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi-bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct. The unusual aircraft attracted attention at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris in October 1910, being the only exhibit without a propeller, but the aircraft was not displayed afterwards and it fell from public awareness. Coandă used a similar turbo-propulseur to drive a snow sledge, {{but he did not}} develop it further for aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The I-185, {{designed}} in early 1940, {{was based on}} the I-180, which was itself a development of the I-16, but was virtually a new design. The monocoque fuselage was similarly built of 'shpon', molded birch plywood, and also had an integral fin, but it was considerably longer than that of the I-180. The two-spar, all-metal wing was smaller and thinner than the I-180's wing, nearly as thin as that of the Supermarine Spitfire's wing at 13% at the root and tapered to 8% at the wing tip. The wing had a NACA-230 profile and was skinned in duralumin. Pneumatically powered split flaps and leading edge slats were fitted. The outer wing panels had 3° of dihedral. The fabric-covered control surfaces were framed in duralumin. The protected [...] fuel tanks were mounted between the wing center section spars. The I-185 used a conventional undercarriage with a retractable tailwheel. The unproven 1,492kW (2,000hp) 18-cylinder, two-row Tumansky M-90 radial engine was carried on welded steel tubes. It was fitted with a ducted spinner to improve cooling with the air expelled through gills as in the I-180 to provide additional thrust. The synchronized armament was mounted in the fuselage, two [...] ShKAS machine guns and two [...] Berezin UBS machine guns. A [...] bomb could be carried under overload conditions. The first prototype was completed in May 1940, but the only available example of the M-90 did not provide enough power for take-off. The prototype was modified to use another <b>experimental</b> <b>engine,</b> the [...] Shvetsov M-81 radial, but this was not nearly powerful enough for flight tests. The I-185 (M-81) finally took to the air on January 11, 1941, but it was decided not to waste further development and await a more powerful engine which was fortunate as the M-81 was cancelled in May 1941.|$|E

In early 1947, the parent Bristol Aeroplane Company submitted a proposal for a medium-range bomber to the same specification B.35/46 which led to the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. The Bristol design was the Type 172 and was to be powered by four or six Bristol engines of [...] thrust to the Ministry engine specification TE.1/46.|$|E
