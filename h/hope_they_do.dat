2500|$|Skinny Puppy {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, VIVIsectVI, in 1988; the albums {{name is a}} pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the [...] "666 sect"). The group's primary aim with the album was to bring attention {{to the topic of}} vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album's subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track [...] "Dogshit" [...] was released as a single in 1988 under the name [...] "Censor"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single [...] "Testure", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No.19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, [...] "Testure" [...] was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their [...] "anti-vivisectionist" [...] message. [...] "It's the only song I think {{they will be able to}} play on the radio" [...] said Ogre, continuing [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> play it because it's the only way we can go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message". [...] "Testure" [...] also featured several well-chosen samples from the film The Plague Dogs, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. Melody Maker named VIVIsectVI one of the best albums of 1988, scoring thirteenth place in the magazine's year end list.|$|E

Mohammed was a demon-possessed whoremonger and pedophile who contrived a 300-page work of Satanic fiction: The Quran!

We won't have any strike, our people understand when they're well off, they've got all the work they can do, they're sending fortunes back to the old country or piling them up in the banks. It's all bluff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well observed, my boy!" [...] cried Bob. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for {{your good}} wife.

Now, it wasn't," [...] cried Bob, [...] "for the sake of {{anything}} {{he might be able}} to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful.

60|$|The Republic of Regicide, with an annihilated revenue, with defaced manufactures, with {{a ruined}} commerce, with an uncultivated and half-depopulated country, with a discontented, distressed, enslaved, and famished people, passing, with a rapid, eccentric, incalculable course, from the wildest anarchy to the sternest despotism, has {{actually}} conquered the finest parts of Europe, has distressed, disunited, deranged, and broke to pieces all the rest, and so subdued {{the minds of}} the rulers in every nation, that hardly any resource presents itself to them, except that of entitling themselves to a contemptuous mercy by a display of their imbecility and meanness. Even in their greatest military efforts, and the greatest display of their fortitude, they seem not to <b>hope,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not even appear to wish, the extinction of what subsists to their certain ruin. Their ambition is only to be admitted to a more favored class in the order of servitude under that domineering power.|$|E

60|$|Mary was now crowned Queen. She was thirty-seven {{years of}} age, short and thin, {{wrinkled}} in the face, and very unhealthy. But {{she had a}} great liking for show and for bright colours, and all the ladies of her Court were magnificently dressed. She had a great liking too for old customs, without much sense in them; and she was oiled in the oldest way, and blessed in the oldest way, and done all manner of things to in the oldest way, at her coronation. I <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> her good.|$|R

50|$|To start, nine {{boxes were}} placed on a board, each with a number between 1-9. Each {{contestant}} picked a box. The one who picked the lowest number would go first, the middle second, and the highest last.

5000|$|In a TV Guide {{magazine}} article in March 2001, Mackenzie Astin, who played Andy Moffett on The Facts of Life from 1985-88, {{was asked about}} the reunion and he was quoted as saying: [...] "I keep hearing about that too. I hope it's not happening, because nobody's called me! If it does, I <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> call."

They stand for different specific qualities. So if Frank cracks open a jar and a bilat comes out, that means one thing. If he cracks it open and a jivacomes out, that means something else.

5000|$|Cognitive {{linguists}} {{emphasize that}} metaphors serve {{to facilitate the}} understanding of one conceptual domain, typically an abstract one like [...] "life" [...] or [...] "theories" [...] or [...] "ideas", through expressions that relate to another, more familiar conceptual domain, typically a more concrete one like [...] "journey" [...] or [...] "buildings" [...] or [...] "food". Food for thought: we devour a book of raw facts, try to digest them, stew over them, let them simmer on the back-burner, regurgitate them in discussions, cook up explanations, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not seem half-baked. Theories as buildings: we establish a foundation for them, a framework, support them with strong arguments, buttressing them with facts, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> will stand. Life as journey: some of us travel hopefully, others seem to have no direction, many lose their way.|$|R

5000|$|A {{petition}} {{initiated by}} a number of religious groups including the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland, the Irish Council of Imams, and the Galway branch of the Reformed Presbyterian Church on 15 April called for a [...] "conscience clause", which would allow individuals and businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples in the provision of goods and services. In response, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: [...] "The Government has made its decision very clear here in respect to the question that the people will be asked on the 22nd of May.

5000|$|In 2008 Ferry {{alluded to}} {{support for the}} UK Conservative Party, {{referring}} to himself as [...] "conservative by nature", but essentially apolitical.

He also alluded to an opposition to [...] "left-wing bitterness" [...] and the spectre of [...] "political correctness", but the model of free speech he cited was the anarchic 1970s, and not the Thatcher era, or a more distant past. In a 2009 interview, Ferry stated: I would support a Cameron government. I have met him, and he's a bright guy. I <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> well. I don't {{like the way the}} present Government has done things, most of all putting my son in prison for four and a half months, totally unlawfully ... and that's not just my opinion: judges, all sorts, have said it was a stitch-up. It was politically motivated. The poor lad just wants to live the traditional country life.|$|E
