25|$|An import or <b>export</b> <b>tariff</b> (also called {{customs duty}} or impost) is a {{charge for the}} {{movement}} of goods through a political border. Tariffs discourage trade, {{and they may be}} used by governments to protect domestic industries. A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay government to maintain a navy or border police. The classic ways of cheating a tariff are smuggling or declaring a false value of goods. Tax, tariff and trade rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on industrial policy, investment policy, and agricultural policy. A trade bloc is a group of allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other, and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc. A customs union has a common external tariff, and the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union.|$|E
5000|$|Tariffs: Typically, tariffs (or taxes) {{are imposed}} on {{imported}} goods. Tariff rates usually {{vary according to}} the type of goods imported. Import tariffs will increase the cost to importers, and increase the price of imported goods in the local markets, thus lowering the quantity of goods imported, to favour local producers. Tariffs may also be imposed on exports, and in an economy with floating exchange rates, <b>export</b> <b>tariffs</b> have similar effects as import <b>tariffs.</b> However, since <b>export</b> <b>tariffs</b> are often perceived as [...] "hurting" [...] local industries, while import tariffs are perceived as [...] "helping" [...] local industries, <b>export</b> <b>tariffs</b> are seldom implemented.|$|R

60|$|There is {{also another}} system in China, chiefly {{inherited}} {{from the time of}} the Taiping rebellion, namely the erection of internal customs barriers at various important points. This plan is still adopted with the internal trade. But merchants dealing with the interior and sending goods to or from a Treaty Port can escape internal customs by the payment of half the duty charged under the external tariff. As this is generally less than the internal tariff charges, this provision favours foreign produce at the expense of that of China. Of course the system of internal customs is bad, but it is traditional, and is defended on the ground that revenue is indispensable. China offered to abolish internal customs in return for certain uniform increases in the import and <b>export</b> <b>tariff,</b> and Great Britain, Japan, and the United States consented. But there were ten other Powers whose consent was necessary, and not all could be induced to agree. So the old system remains in force, not chiefly through the fault of the Chinese central government. It should be added that internal customs are collected by the provincial authorities, who usually intercept them and use them for private armies and civil war. At the present time, the Central Government is not strong enough to stop these abuses.|$|E

50|$|A tie of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar {{implemented}} by economist Domingo Cavallo in 1991 reduced export competitiveness somewhat, though the resulting stability led to record investments in agricultural infrastructure {{and led to}} strong growth in harvests during the late 1990s. These trends were accompanied by the federal approval of GMO crops in 1995. A devaluation of the peso in 2002 and a sustained rise in commodity prices since has further encouraged the sector, leading to record production and exports, helping finance record public works spending through <b>export</b> <b>tariffs,</b> a centerpiece of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner's economic policies.

According to tradition, Saint Maurice and his southern Egyptian companions of the Theban Legion were martyred in Acaunum during the reign of Maximian (286-310). Around 360-370 Theodul, the first Bishop of Valais, built a basilica in Acaunum in their honor. The basilica became a popular pilgrimage site.

We first show empirically that structural constraints to forest conservation policies are particularly pronounced in one third of countries where REDD+ programs are planned to be rolled out.
