40|$|SUMMARY: Isolated {{colonies of}} {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{can be obtained}} in a layer of agar enclosed between a watch-glass and a glass plate. They can be examined and removed without difficulty. The excuse for introducing yet another way of isolating anaerobic bacteria is that it possesses some advantages over existing methods and should prove of value in small laboratories not provided with special apparatus. In deep nutrient agar, discrete, well-developed colonies can be obtained with regularity but their examination and removal can be difficult. This can be overcome by cultivating the microbes in a layer of agar contained between two plates of <b>glass</b> <b>clamped</b> on a U-shaped metal support (Mason, 1930). Unfortunately, because {{the edges of the}} agar are then exposed to air, contamination and shrinkage of the medium is the rule with this method. These disadvantages are removed in the method to be described. The apparatus required consists of watch-glasses of between 5 and 10 ml. capacity, glass plates about 10 cm. square, nutrient agar, serum, drawn-ou...|$|R
50|$|The {{array of}} gel {{elements}} on a glass slide is prepared by ‘’’photopolymerization‘’’. The acrylamide solution to be polymerized {{is applied to}} the polymerization chamber. Polymerization chamber consists of a quartz mask, two Teflon spacers, and a microscopic <b>glass</b> slide, <b>clamped</b> together by two metal clamps. The inner side of quartz mask has ultraviolet (UV)-transparent windows arranged in a specified spatial manner in a non-transparent chromium film. Assembled chamber containing the acrylamide gel is exposed to UV light to allow polymerization in only those positions of the chamber that are situated directly under the transparent windows.|$|R

40|$|We report {{here the}} use of {{plasmonic}} metal nanostructures {{in the form of}} silver island films (SiFs) to enhance the fluorescence emission of five different phycobiliproteins. Our findings clearly show that the phycobil-iproteins display up to a 9 -fold increase in fluorescence emission intensity, with a maximum 7 -fold decrease in lifetime when they are assembled as a monolayer above SiFs, as compared to a monolayer assembled on the surface of amine-terminated glass slides of the control sample. The study was also repeated with a thin liquid layer of the phycobiliproteins sandwiched between two glass substrates (and a SiFs and a <b>glass</b> substrate) <b>clamped</b> together. Similarly, the results show a maximum 10 -fold increase in fluorescence emission intensity coupled with a 2 -fold decrease in lifetime of the phycobiliproteins in the SiF-glass setup as compared to the glass control sample, implying that near-field enhancement of phycobiliprotein emission can be attained both with and without chemical linkage of the proteins to the SiFs. Hence, our results clearly show that metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) can potentially be employed to increase the sensitivity and detection limit of the plethora of bioassays that employ phycobiliproteins as fluorescence labels, such as in fluoro-immunoassays where the assay can be tethered on the surface of SiFs, and also in flow cytometry where analytes in the liquid phase could potentially flow through channels coated with SiFs without actually being attached to the silver. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{simulation}} of laminated glass loaded by air blast waves is complex. The behaviour of Polyvinylbutyral (PVB) under short term loading shows an elastic-hardening behaviour. The Young’s modulus and the hardening factor {{depend on the}} strain rate. Several numerical models are investigated to find a model which represents {{the failure of the}} glass {{as well as of the}} PVB interlayer. Layered elements with a special failure criterion can be used very efficiently. The integration points over the thickness use different materials. After the failure of an integration point in glass, the stresses in this integration point are set to zero if the strains are positive. The material can still react to compression stress. If the interlayer reaches the failure criterion of PVB, the element is eroded. The layered model shows a good correlation with experiments – also in cases where the interlayer fails. In comparison to this a full 3 D solid model is presented, where the behaviour of the combination of the glass splinters and the interlayer can be investigated. A new experiment with laminated glass is performed to validate the numerical results. The laminated <b>glass</b> is <b>clamped</b> to a metal frame and loaded by an air blast wave using a shock tube. The experiments are compared with calculations. The numerical model can represent the experimental behaviour and can be used to simulate the failure of laminated glass loaded by air blast waves. JRC.

40|$|Abstract. Developing {{efficient}} onsite {{damage detection}} and safety evaluation methods for glass curtain wall {{is still a}} challenging task. In this work, a simple approach to predict the failure and risk of falling down of curtain wall glass was developed through {{the relationship between the}} natural frequency changes and the declined reliability of the structures. Natural frequencies of the curtain wall <b>glass</b> under various <b>clamping</b> conditions were determined using dynamic tests. It was discovered that, with the decrease of the clamping force at the boundary of the glass specimen, the measured natural frequencies decreased linearly. Thus, the in-service capacity in edge clamping (e. g. boundary is loosed or failure of the supporting structure) of the curtain wall glass can be identified by its natural frequency changes. The expected lowest safety natural frequency of a curtain wall glass (given elastic parameters, shape and size) is given. The implementation of this detection method is described, and the practicability and feasibility validated...|$|R
40|$|A single <b>glass</b> {{micropipette}} voltage <b>clamp</b> technique with intracellular dialysis {{was used}} to {{study the effects of}} the trapidil derivatives AR 12 - 456 and AR 12 - 463 on Ca channel currents carried by Ba 2 + in isolated ventricular cells from mice hearts. Inspite of a more potent inhibition of the cAMP phosphodiesterase from heart (Bartel et al. 1985) a reversible Ca channel blocking action of both compounds could be observed. The concentration of half maximal block was calculated to about 50 mumol/l for both derivatives tested. Neither a shift in the current-voltage relationships nor a significant change in the potential for half maximal activation was found. The maximal Ba 2 +-conductance was reduced. The steady state inactivation was shifted towards more negative potentials by application of 100 mumol/l AR 12 - 463. The decay of the Ba currents was accelerated in the range of the applied test potentials between - 20 and + 20 mV. It is concluded that the new trapidil derivatives with more potent inhibitory action on cardiac phosphodiesterase than trapidil can block myocardial Ca channels. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Curtain wall systems {{typically}} rely {{on pressure}} equalization {{to achieve a}} good watertightness. The insulating <b>glass</b> unit is <b>clamped</b> to the mullion between two gaskets, functioning as a rain screen and airtightness layer. When the curtain wall system is subjected to wind driven rain and a pressure difference, water may penetrate past the first gasket into the drained cavity. Depending on the airtightness of the interior and exterior gaskets, the pressure equalisation will determine the actual pressure over the exterior gasket. That pressure, in combination with hydrostatic pressure from water runoff, {{is the most important}} driving forces for water ingress. In this paper, the watertightness and drainage of water in curtain wall systems is investigated. In an experimental setup, a fullscale curtain wall system was subjected to a range of pressure differences under static and cyclic test procedures. For each condition, the water ingress into the drained cavity was measured. Next to that, the phenomenology of water ingress was analyzed based on airtightness measurements, dynamic watertightness tests, and pressure equalisation...|$|R

40|$|A reduced {{finite element}} model for {{determining}} the maximum principal stress of a glass pane subjected to dynamic impact load is developed and compared to a full dynamic {{finite element model}}. The reduced model {{is based on the}} Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Ritz vectors used are determined by simple static load-cases. The model is applicable to centrically and eccentrically applied impact and to glass of various support conditions. It is demonstrated that the model performs well for various types of supported glass panes and impact applied at different locations on the glass pane. The applicability to small or medium sized glass panes is shown through a parametric investigation in which the results are compared to linear and nonlinear finite element solutions. For large glass panes, especially at smaller glass thickness, geometric nonlinear effects must be considered in the analysis. An outline of how to expand the model to include nonlinear geometric effects is given. Finally, it is shown that the reduced model performs excellently in the modeling of a standard laminated <b>glass</b> balustrade with <b>clamp</b> fixings. Apparently, the model is very well suited for strength design of commonly used glass structures...|$|R
40|$|Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is {{the most}} common and most {{aggressive}} malignant type of brain tumor in humans. GMBs are of a high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity with respect to the presence of diverse cell types and the complex cell-cell communication network forming a dynamic and hierarchical cell society. In clinical oncology, one of the great importances of quantifying heterogeneity of the tumor and the immune cells will improve identification of the functional state of tumors and, correspondingly, the anticipated personal response to treatment. We are implementing our high-density microchip platform to interrogate heterogeneity of tumor cells, immune cells and their co-culture. The microfluidic device was fabricated from PDMS and glass using standard microfabrication techniques. The PDMS slit consists of 5000 + sub-nanoliter microchambers where we can isolate single and multi-cell combinations. The glass slide is patterned form mutli-plex antibody barcode array for quantifying secreted proteins from each microchambers. Individual cells from glioma alone, macrophage alone cultures or from glioma-macrophage co-cultures were seeded randomly in each microchamber and antibody-patterned (flow based micropatterning) <b>glass</b> slide was <b>clamped</b> on top on PDMS block. Prior to the experiment, macrophage and glioma cells were stained with green and red live cell tracker dyes (Invitrogen). The clamped device was imaged and replaced into the incubator overnight for the protein secretion. Upon removal of the PDMS block, the glass slide was developed for protein detection using antibodies and fluorescent probes. We analyzed the intensity of the antibody barcode array in order to quantify the heterogeneity of the cells in terms of protein secretion profile. Our high-throughput microfluidic protein detection platform will be useful to reveal cellular heterogeneity levels in terms of protein expression not only for tumor or immune cells but also for their complex interactions...|$|R
