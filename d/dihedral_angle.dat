In stereoselective reactions, there are 2 effects of allylic strain on the reaction which is the sterics effect and the electronic effects.

This contradicts a common textbook assertion that the p orbitals would be unable sustain such a bond.

Our proof provides a simple example of the “method of continuity”, the technique used in clas-sification theorems on polyhedra by Alexandrow [4], Andreev [5], and Rivin-Hodgson [18]. Given a combinatorial description C of a polyhedron having E edges, the space of <b>dihedral</b> <b>angles</b> of all compact hyperbolic polyhedra that realize C is generally not a convex subset of RE.
