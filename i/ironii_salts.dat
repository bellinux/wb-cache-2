This thesis sought to explore the {{chemical}} and physical properties {{of a series of}} cyclotriand polyphosphazenes with substituted tridentate ligands coordinated to iron(II) and ruthenium(II). There were two main objective of this research i) to graft spin crossover (SCO) groups to a polymer backbone, potentially making a new malleable material, ii) to demonstrate that ruthenium(II) complexes can be used to link groups to a polyphosphazene backbone. Seven cyclotriphosphazene (L 1 –L 7) and four polyphosphazene (L 1 P–L 4 P) ligands 1 were synthesised with 2, 6 -di(pyridine- 2 -yl) pyridine- 4 (1 H) -onate (OTerpy); 4 -(2, 6 - di{pyridin- 2 -yl}-pyridine- 4 -yl) phenolate (OPhTerpy); 2, 6 -di(1 H-benzimidazol- 2 - yl) pyridine- 4 (1 H) -onate (Obbp); and 4 -(2, 6 -di{ 1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl}pyridine- 4 - yl) phenolate (OPhbpp) moieties. These ligands were subsequently coordinated to either iron(II) or ruthenium(II) and the optical, vibrational, electrochemical and magnetic properties of the subsequent small molecule complexes and polymers were measured. Sixteen iron(II) complexes were synthesised by reacting <b>iron(II)</b> <b>salts</b> with the respective ligand (L 1 –L 7). Where X-ray crystal structures have been obtained, each of the small molecule iron complexes were homoleptic. Using electronic absorbance, resonance Raman (rR), magnetic and Mössbauer spectroscopy, it was shown that the polymer complex cores in the resulting cross-linked polymers were the same as those of the small molecule analogues (SMA). In addition, these techniques confirmed that the iron complexes formed with the ligands L 1, L 2, L 1 P and L 2 P were each determined to be low spin (LS), while those formed with L 3 displayed SCO, and the iron complex formed with L 4 remained high spin (HS) for all temperatures while its polymeric analogue remained LS for all measurable temperatures. Fourteen ruthenium(II) small molecule complexes were synthesised by reacting ruthenium complexes of the appropriate co-ligands (2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine (Terpy); 2, 6 - di(pyridin- 2 -yl) - 4 -phenylpyridine (PhTerpy); 2, 6 -di(1 H-benzimidzol- 2 -yl) pyridine (bbp); and 2, 6 -di(1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl) pyridine) with the respective ligand (L 1 –L 4). Using electronic absorption and rR spectroscopy it was determined that only the polymers L 1 P and L 2 P formed complexes ([Ru(L 1 P) (Terpy) ]Cl 2, [Ru(L 1 P) (PhTerpy) ]Cl 2, [Ru(L 2 P) (Terpy) ]Cl 2 and [Ru(L 2 P) (PhTerpy) ]Cl 2) analogous to that of their SMA ([Ru(L 1) (Terpy) ](PF 6) 2, [Ru(L 1) (PhTerpy) ](PF 6) 2, [Ru(L 2) (Terpy) ](PF 6) 2 and [Ru(L 2) (PhTerpy) ](PF 6) 2), and are therefore the most suitable for linking groups to polyphosphazenes. Although the ruthenium-bbp-terpy based complexes proved to be unsuitable for attaching groups to a phosphazene due to the low loading of metal complex on the polymer (L 3 P), the SMA ([Ru(L 1) (bbp) ](PF 6) 2, [Ru(L 2) (bbp) ](PF 6) 2, [Ru(L 3) (Terpy) ](PF 6) 2 and [Ru(L 3) (PhTerpy) ](PF 6) 2) displayed a dependence on the basicity of the solution.

Further, OH. scavengers were effective inhibitors only when EDTA was present. Inhibition by catalase and desferrioxamine confirmed that H 2 O 2 and iron salts were essential for these reactions. The results suggest that, in the absence of EDTA, iron ions bind to the carbohydrate detector molecules and bring about a site-specific reaction on the molecule. This reaction is poorly inhibited by most OH. scavengers, but is strongly inhibited by scavengers such as mannitol, glucose and thiourea, which can themselves bind iron ions, albeit weakly.

The reaction of complex 15 with CO gave two different products, which were both characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. One (19) is the dicarbonyl iron(II) complex of the triphosphane ligand 11, the other (3) is the carbonyl iron(II) complex of the tetraphosphane C 5 H 3 N[CMe(CH 2 PMe 2) 2] 2 (1). This suggests an intermol. mechanism for the C-P bond formation in question. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{magnetite}} nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4) {{were obtained}} by co-precipitation of <b>iron(II)</b> and (III) <b>salts</b> in a basic medium, under a nitrogen atmosphere [12]. Five different magnetic amino-functionalized silica-based materials were synthesized and tested as potential adsorbents for copper(II) ions. Each of examined adsorbents was synthesized {{on the basis of}} sol-gel procedure, which is detailed described in papers [10, 11]. In order to compare sorption measurements, three different monomers containing different number and structure of amino groups were used to modify surface of magnetic silica materials (Table  1).|$|R
40|$|Firstly, a short {{overview}} on supramolecular chemistry including definitions, {{basic principles}} and examples {{taken from the}} literature of 2 D and 3 D self-assembly processes is given in Chapter 1. The introduction is completed by some general ideas of dendrimer chemistry. In the second Chapter the techniques used in this thesis are introduced with a special focus on scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Besides the mode of operation and the data processing, the historical background is briefly described. The following four Chapters present STM studies of monolayers formed by different types of compounds, all functionalised with Fréchet-type dendrons. Not only static features of monolayers such as conformational analysis of single molecules have been investigated, but also dynamic processes such as delayed conversion of a whole domain and conformational changes by protonation have been examined. The 2 D properties of monolayers on a graphite surface have been compared with the X-ray data of 3 D single crystals. For two compounds, the same molecular arrangement has been detected in monolayers on graphite and in single crystals. Together with organic molecules, the self-assembly of metal complexes possessing tpy ligands and organometallic species with platinum(II) bis(alkynyl) units has been examined. Not all of these metal complexes were stable under the scanning conditions used in STM. A synthetic programme leading to dendrimer-functionalised organic and organometallic compounds has been developed. Discussions of synthetic routes are given {{at the beginning of}} each Chapter. Chaptercompares X-ray diffraction methods with STM, the two main analysis tools used for investigation of self-organised assemblies in the solid state in this thesis. In the second part of Chapter 7, the results presented in the previous Chapters are discussed with some general reflections on the self-assembling properties of Fréchet-type dendrimers with pendant octyl groups. Additional to the studies of self-assembled monolayers, the formation of metallomacrocycles has been investigated using two novel homoditopic tpy ligands. This work is presented in Chapter 8. It was demonstrated that the ring-size depends on the metal used for the cyclisation. Furthermore, some of the macrocycles formed self-assembled monolayers on graphite, which have been examined using STM. One homoditopic ligand formed a molecular square by complexation with an <b>iron(II)</b> <b>salt</b> which was analysed using single crystal X-ray diffraction. This thesis has brought together the realms of chemical design with studies of the physical behaviour of the envisioned molecules on the surface. It has been demonstrated that Fréchet-type dendrimers with octyl end-groups are a general motif for visualisation of static and dynamic behaviour using STM...|$|R
30|$|The {{synthesis}} of the chitosan/magnetite nanocomposites is presented. Composites were prepared by co-precipitation of <b>iron(II)</b> and iron(III) <b>salts</b> by aqueous ammonia in the 0.1  % chitosan solution. It was shown that magnetite synthesis in the chitosan medium {{does not affect the}} magnetite crystal structure. The thermal analysis data showed 4.6  % of mass concentration of chitosan in the hybrid chitosan/magnetite composite. In the concentration range of initial Gd-DTPA solution up to 0.4  mmol/L, addition of chitosan to magnetite increases the adsorption capacity and affinity to Gd-DTPA complex. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were applied to describe adsorption processes. Nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential thermal analysis (DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and specific surface area determination (ASAP) methods.|$|R
