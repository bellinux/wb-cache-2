25|$|Just as higher-income {{groups are}} more likely to enjoy {{financial}} gains when economic times are good, they are also likely to suffer more significant income losses during economic downturns and recessions when they are compared to lower income groups. Higher-income groups tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources related to capital income (business income, capital gains, and dividends), as opposed to labor income (wages and salaries). For example, in 2011 the top 1% of income earners derived 37% of their income from labor income, versus 62% for the middle quintile. On the other hand, the top 1% derived 58% of their <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> as opposed to 4% for the middle quintile. Government transfers represented only 1% of the income of the top 1% but 25% for the middle quintile; the dollar amounts of these transfers tend to rise in recessions.|$|E

2500|$|In late 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century Paris, wealth was growing rapidly, {{and it became}} {{increasingly}} concentrated. [...] Paris from 1872 to 1927 was a [...] "rentier society". Rentiers (that is, people who relied primarily on inherited wealth) made up about 10% of the population, but owned 70% of aggregate wealth; they spent heavily on luxuries as their <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> assets could sustain a living standard far beyond what labor income alone would permit. [...] Paris became world-famous for making consumerism a social priority and economic force, especially through its grand department stores and upscale arcades filled with luxury shops. These were [...] "dream machines" [...] that set the world standard for consumption of fine products by the upper classes {{as well as the}} rising middle class. Aristide Boucicaut, the son of a small clothing-shop owner, became partner in a variety store called Le Bon Marché in Paris in 1848. He became owner in 1852 and transformed it into the first modern department store in Paris with high-volume buying, low profit margins, seasonal sales, discounts, advertising, a mail-order catalog, and entertainment and prizes for customers, spouses and children.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} be argued that in a democracy, because the {{government}} is the party performing the act of imposing taxes, {{society as a whole}} decides how the tax system should be organized. The American Revolution's [...] "No taxation without representation" [...] slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, [...] "An old tax is a good tax". Conservatives advocate the [...] "fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government 'services'." [...] Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision {{of a wide range of}} services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits. As argued by Tony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital. Many libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty.|$|E

Since 2009, if there is more than £10000 in savings each £500 of savings (or part thereof) results in an extra £1 a week in income being assumed in the calculation of income.

40|$|One of {{the best}} known results in modern public finance is the Chamley-Judd result showing that the optimal tax rate on capital income is zero in the long-run. In this paper, we reexamine this result by {{analyzing}} a series of generalizations of the Chamley-Judd formulation. We show that in a model with human capital, if the tax code is sufficiently rich and there are no pure profits <b>from</b> accumulating human <b>capital,</b> then all distorting taxes are zero in the long-run under the optimal plan. In this sense, <b>income</b> <b>from</b> physical <b>capital</b> is not special. To {{gain a better understanding of}} these two conditions, we study examples in which they are not satisfied and show that the optimal tax rate on <b>income</b> <b>from</b> physical <b>capital</b> does not go to zero. In those cases where the limiting tax rate is non-zero, we calculate its value for alternative specifications of the marginal welfare cost of taxation. Our results indicate that even for conservative specifications, tax rates of 10 % and higher are possible under the optimal code. ...|$|R

50|$|Taxpayers {{with middle}} and higher income who mainly receive <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> gains have usually an {{advantage}} from this new method of taxation.

50|$|Taxes on <b>income</b> derived <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> (e.g., {{financial}} assets, {{property and}} businesses) primarily affect higher income groups, {{who own the}} vast majority of capital. For example, in 2010 approximately 81% of stocks were owned by the top 10% income group and 69% by the top 5%. Only about one-third of American households have stock holdings more than $7,000. Therefore, since higher-income taxpayers have a much higher share of their income represented by capital gains, lowering taxes on capital income and gains increases after-tax income inequality.|$|R
