Because the map from W(n) into W(nm) preserves the compact operators, it descends into an embedding &beta; : Mn(C(T)) &rarr; Mnm(C(T)).

40|$|We give an {{overview}} of mathematical music theory {{as it has been}} developed in the past twenty years. The present theory includes a formal language for musical and musicological objects and relations. This language is built upon topos theory and its logic. Various models of musical phenomena have been developed. They include harmony (function theory, cadences, and modulations), classical counterpoint (Fux rules), rhythm, motif theory, and the theory of musical performance. Most of these models have also been implemented and evaluated in computer applications. Some models have been tested empirically in neuro-musicology and the cognitive science of music. The mathematical nature of this modeling process canonically <b>embedds</b> the given historical music theories in a variety of fictitious theories and thereby enables a qualification of historical reality against potential variants. As a result, the historical realizations often turn out {{to be some kind of}} “best possible world ” and thus reveals a type of “anthropic principle” in music. These models use different types of mathematical approaches, such as—for instance—enumeration combinatorics, group and module theory, algebraic geometry and topology, vector fields and numerical solutions of differential equations, Grothendieck topologies, topos theory, and statistics. The results lead to good simulations of classical results of music and performance theory. There is a number of classifiaction theorems of determined categories of musical structures. The overview concludes by a discussion of mathematical and musicological challenges which issue from the investigation of music by mathematics, including the project of “Grand Unification ” of harmony and counterpoint and the classification of musical performance. ...|$|R

A group is a diagram group {{if it is the}} fundamental group of a Squier complex. In this paper, we describe hyperplanes in these cube complexes. As a first application, we determine exactly when S(P,w) is a special cube complex, as defined by Haglund and Wise, so that the associated diagram group embeds into a right-angled Artin group. A particular feature of Squier complexes is that the intersections of hyperplanes are "ordered" by a relation ≺. As a strong consequence on the geometry of S(P,w), we deduce, in finite dimensions, that its univeral cover isometrically <b>embedds</b> into a product of finitely-many trees with respect to the combinatorial metrics; in particular, we notice that (often) this allows to embed quasi-isometrically the associated diagram group into a product of finitely-many trees. Finally, we exhibit a class of hyperplanes inducing a decomposition of S(P,w) as a graph of spaces, and a fortiori a decomposition of the associated diagram group as a graph of groups, giving a new method to compute presentations of diagram groups. As an application, we associate a semigroup presentation P(Γ) to any finite interval graph Γ, and we prove that the diagram group associated to P(Γ) (for a given base word) is isomorphic to the right-angled Artin group A(Γ).

40|$|International audiencePollen grains are <b>embeddded</b> in an {{extremely}} resistant wall. Apertures are well defined places where the pollen wall is reduced or absent that permit pollen tube germination. Pollen grains are produced by meiosis and aperture number definition appears to be linked with the partition that follows meiosis and leads {{to the formation of}} a tetrad of four haploid microspores. In dicotyledonous plants, meiosis is simultaneous which means that cytokinesis occurs once the two nuclear divisions are completed. A syncitium with the four nuclei stemming from meiosis is formed and cytokinesis isolates simulataneously the four products of meiosis. We propose a theoretical morphogenetic model which takes into account part of the features of the ontogeny of the pollen grains. The nuclei are considered as attractors acting upon a morphogenetic substance distributed within the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. This leads to a partition of the volume of the cell in four domains that is similar to the observations of cytokinesis in the studied species. The most widespread pattern of aperture distribution in dicotyledonous plants (three apertures equidistributed on the pollen grain equator) can be explained by bipolar interactions between nuclei stemming from the second meiotic division, and observed variations on these patterns by disturbances of these interactions. In numerous plant species, several pollen grains differing in aperture number are produced by a single individual. The distribution of the different morphs within tetrads indicates that the four daughter cells can have different aperture number. The model provides an explanation for the duplication of one of the apertures of a three-aperture pollen grain leading to a four-aperture one and in parallel it gives an explanation for how heterogeneous tetrads can be formed...|$|R

We may think of x as a trap, and tau_x as {{the depth of the}} trap at x. We are interested in the trap process, namely the process that associates to time t the depth of the currently visited trap. Our first result is the convergence of the law of that process under suitable scaling. The limit process is given by the jumps of a certain alpha-stable subordinator at the inverse of another alpha-stable subordinator, correlated with the first subordinator. For that result, the requirements for the embedded random walk are a) the validity of a law of large numbers for its range, and b) the slow variation at infinity of the tail of the distribution of its time of return to the origin: they include all transient random walks as well as all planar random walks, and also many one dimensional random walks. We then derive aging results for the process, namely scaling limits for some two-time correlation functions thereof, a strong form of which requires an assumption of transience, stronger than a, b. The above mentioned scaling limit result is an averaged result with respect to tau. Under an additional condition {{on the size of the}} intersection of the ranges of two independent copies of the <b>embeddded</b> random walk, roughly saying that it is small compared with the size of the range, we derive a stronger scaling limit result, roughly stating that it holds in probability with respect to tau.

40|$|This study {{draws on}} 6 months of {{fieldwork}} to explore spiritualist ritual practice, and {{the relation between}} these performances, the selves of the participants, {{and some of the}} sosiocultural traits of the larger context in which they are set. As experienced by the performers themselves, these rituals are "healing" and provide for their "spiritual development". This thesis explores the meaning of these terms, <b>embedds</b> them within spiritualis cosmology, and seeks to explain the underlying embodied processes on which they are based. I argue, drawing on the insights of practice theory (e. g. Bourdieu 1977, 1984) and theories of embodiment (Csordas 1990, 1993) that spiritualist ritual practice effects a transformation of the embodied self that, on the one hand, incorporates into it moral dispositions that accord with those sanctioned by Spiritualism as such and, on the other, are experienced as beneficial and positive in phenomenological terms; thus these rituals come to effect what spiritualist discourse objectifies as "spiritual development" and "healing". Consequently, I show how the structure of practice in spiritualist ritual performance accord with the personal dispositions embodied by individual mediums and others, and how these are considered to be forms of "spiritual" practice and moral action that are regarded as 'better' than those held to dominate contemporary "materialistic" society. Drawing on sociological and anthropological theory and research on contemporary modern/late-modern society (esp. Giddens 1991), I show also that these practices break with the logic of modern institutions and argue that this is a major reason why they are performed. Research and theorising on modernity/late-modernity point out how it is a social order which gives rise to certain forms of suffering. I argue that this is an important thing to consider if we want to understand the healing efficiency of spiritualist ritual practice. Thus, spiritualist ritual practice comes to stand as a form of resistance to and a means of coping with certain features of the social order of modernity/late-modernity and the afflictions it generates. I draw on Catherine Bell's (1992) notion of the "ritualization" of practice to explore this continuity between ritual, self, and the larger social context in which it is set. Although earlier studies of Spiritualism (Skultans 1974, Cherrytree 2003) have pointed out the experienced therapeutic efficiency of their practices, none, to my knowledge, have systematically related this efficiency and the practices as such to the larger structures of modernity/late-modernity. On the theoretical level, this thesis formulates a conception of 'sickness' in terms of the "preobjective" (Csordas 1990, 1993) and the "senses of the socially informed body" as developed by Bourideu (1977 : 124) and use it to understand "healing" as an genuinely embodied process and to understand how the social order of modernity can and does create bodily real affliction. By emphasising the embodied nature of spiritualist cosmology this thesis also argue for the methodological need of personal embodied experience and participation in practice on behalf of the researcher, if genuine insight into the nature of spiritualist practice is to be gained. If ommitted, the result would most likely severely miss the point. </p...|$|R
