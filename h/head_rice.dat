40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of milling conditions on milling quality of medium grain rough rice M 202. Using a McGill No. 3 mill, the conditions studied were milling weight and duration, and polishing weight and duration. This research examined the relationships among the milled rice quality parameters, namely total rice yield, <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield, whiteness index, and total lipid content. <b>Head</b> <b>rice</b> yield was more sensitive to changes in milling conditions than total rice yield. It decreased by 4. 6 percentage points when milling weight was increased from 2. 72 to 6. 36 kg. Milling weight and milling duration had more influence on <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield than polishing weight and duration. For both milling and polishing, using lower weights for a longer duration could increase <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield without changing the whiteness compared to the standard procedures of the USDA Federal Grain Inspection Service. The total lipid content of milled rice, measured using a near‐infrared (NIR) method, correlated well with the whiteness index.

Over‐milling significantly decreased <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield with little improvement in whiteness.

This study evaluated <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield and chalkiness in dry season of PTT 1 from different regions of Thailand. Samples of dry season 2011 crop of PTT 1 were collected from the Upper North, Lower North, Central, East, and Northeast. Sixty-seven paddy samples were dehulled and milled individually. The milled rice of each sample was separated into head and broken rice to determine percentage of <b>head</b> <b>rice.</b> Percentage of chalkiness was determined by weight of chalky grain, in both whole and broken grain. The Central region had the highest percentage of chalkiness (49. 1 %) and <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> (46. 4 %), while the lowest percentage of <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> was found in rice from the Upper North (29. 8 %) and Northeast (26. 6 %).

40|$|Global warming affects {{not only}} rice yield but also grain quality. A better {{understanding}} of the effects of climate factors on rice quality provides information for new breeding strategies to develop varieties of rice adapted to a changing world. Chalkiness is a key trait of physical quality, and along with <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield, is used to determine the price of rice in all markets. In the present study, we show that for every ∼ 1 % decrease in chalkiness, an increase of ∼ 1 % in <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield follows, illustrating the dual impact of chalk on amount of marketable rice and its value. Previous studies in controlled growing conditions report that chalkiness is associated with high temperature. From 1980 - 2009 at IRRI, Los Baños, the Philippines, annual minimum and mean temperatures, and diurnal variation changed significantly. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine how climate impacts chalkiness in field conditions over four wet and dry seasons. We show that low relative humidity and a high vapour pressure deficit in the dry season associate with low chalk and high <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield in spite of higher maximum temperature, but in the opposite conditions of the wet season, chalk is high and <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield is low. The data therefore suggest that transpirational cooling is a key factor affecting chalkiness and <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield, and global warming per se might not be the major factor that decreases the amount and quality of rice, but other climate factors in combination, that enable the crop to maintain a cool canopy...|$|E
40|$|Differences {{have been}} {{observed}} in the milling and functional properties of different rice cultivars, particularly between hybrid and pureline cultivars. Co-mingling of rice cultivars commonly occurs during harvest, storage and drying operations.

Two long-grain, hybrid (H) cultivars CL XL 745 and CL XL 729 and two long-grain, pureline (P) cultivars CL 151 and Wells were used to prepare CL XL 745 /CL 151 (H/P), CL XL 745 /CL XL 729 (H/H) and Wells/CL 151 (P/P) co-mingles, mixed in various proportions. Milled rice yield (MRY), <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> yield (HRY), surface lipid content (SLC), <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> color, <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> chalkiness and gelatinization and pasting properties of <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> flour were measured for individual lot samples, as well as the above mentioned co-mingled samples. Kernel dimensions, total lipid content (TLC), chalkiness and bulk density of brown rice samples of the individual cultivar lots were also studied to determine the effect of brown rice properties of individual cultivar lots on the milling and functional properties of co-mingled samples. The MRYs, HRYs, <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> chalkiness and pasting properties of the co-mingled samples increased or decreased with the increasing percentage of a given cultivar in the co-mingled samples. The differences in <b>head</b> <b>rice</b> whiteness and yellowness of the co-mingled samples milled to the same DOM were negligible, indicating that co-mingling did not affect the color of rice after milling to the same DOM. An investigation of gelatinization curves showed that the co-mingled samples retained characteristics of the gelatinization properties of the individual cultivars used in those co-mingles. For example, the onset gelatinization temperature (To) of a co-mingled sample was equivalent to the To of that cultivar in the co-mingle with the lower To. These findings will help to make key decisions regarding the use of co-mingles depending on the brown rice, milling and functional properties of the individual cultivar lots used for co-mingling...|$|E
