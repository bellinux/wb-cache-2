5|$|The tariff levels {{had been}} a major {{political}} issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election.

5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal <b>improvements</b> <b>and</b> $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate floor in 1828.

The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
