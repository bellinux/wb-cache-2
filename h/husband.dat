40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between acculturation and multiple dimensions of marital conflict among Mexican American <b>husbands</b> and wives. Participants were 151 <b>husbands</b> and wives who were recruited from a health maintenance organization in northern California and individually interviewed. More acculturated <b>husbands</b> and wives engaged in less avoidance of conflict and were more expressive of their feelings in an argument. <b>Husbands</b> who were more acculturated reported more conflict concerning sex and consideration for the other. Bicultural and more acculturated <b>husbands</b> re-ported that their wives were more verbally and physically aggressive, compared with mono-Mexican <b>husbands.</b> The findings provide evidence that more acculturated hus-bands and wives are involved in more direct expressions of conflict in their marriages, compared with less acculturated <b>husbands</b> and wives. • Mexican American • marital conflict • acculturation • bicultural Despite the growing literature on Mexican American families and an increase in re-search on family relationships, relatively fe...|$|R
