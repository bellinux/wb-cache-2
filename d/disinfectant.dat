5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical <b>disinfectant,</b> and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a <b>disinfectant.</b> Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Diseases and infections {{have always}} been a major concern to {{intensive}} poultry production industry. Pathogen contamination of farming environments can be prevented using proper health care products such as <b>disinfectants.</b> This study evaluated the efficiency of commonly used <b>disinfectants</b> against bacteria occurring in intensive poultry farming environments in Imo State, Nigeria. The efficacy of six commercial <b>disinfectants</b> namely; Izal ®, Z-germicide ®, Diskol ®, Virkon ®, Vox ® and CID 20 ® in reducing the number of micro-organisms was assessed. Among the tested <b>disinfectants,</b> Virkon ® (oxidizing agents) was the most efficient, reducing the micro-organisms by 95 %. The in vitro test carried out to verify the effectiveness of <b>disinfectants</b> did not consider the adverse conditions found in the poultry farms. Therefore, the evaluation of the efficacy of on-farm reconstituted <b>disinfectants</b> over time was also carried out. The results indicated that efficacy of all the <b>disinfectants</b> was reduced during the afternoon. However, efficacy gradually increased during the evening for all the <b>disinfectants</b> {{but not as much as}} was observed in the morning.

In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a <b>disinfectant,</b> calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed <b>disinfectant</b> chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E

Therefore, {{the occurrence of}} nosocomial infections give great emphasis on proper prevention which includes primarily the optimal use of <b>disinfectants</b> and antiseptics, and regular microbiological testing and controls. Antiseptics and <b>disinfectants</b> are widely used in hospitals and other medical facilities in different topical applications and hard surfaces. Mechanical cleaning before application of <b>disinfectants</b> is essential. Mechanisms of antibacterial <b>disinfectants</b> are summarized in several large critical reports worldwide.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{testing of}} <b>disinfectants</b> against Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains from broilers and pigs was investigated. The filtration method European standard EN 1040 was adapted to Campylobacter cultures and validated with reference strains. Two <b>disinfectants</b> were tested: 1 % benzalkonium chloride active matter, as quaternary ammonium compound, and 0. 63 % sodium hypochlorite as chlorine-releasing agent. Both <b>disinfectants</b> were effective against the 34 Campylobacter strains tested after 5 min exposure under in vitro conditions.

5|$|As some {{scientists}} such as Dlussky believed Sphecomyrma {{was not an}} ant, {{they thought it was}} solitary and semi-communal. Further statements include that the morphology of sphecomyrmines would prevent workers from transporting larvae or engaging in trophallaxis (transfer of food between two nestmates) with them. However, wasps with antennal proportions similar to sphecomyrmines are able to feed their own larvae. The presence of the metapleural gland also shows that Sphecomyrma was a eusocial (the highest level of organisation of animal sociality) insect and lived in colonies, as this gland possibly acts as a <b>disinfectant</b> in order to nest in soil and leaf litter without infecting the colony's nestmates and brood. The large eyes, long appendages and thin exoskeleton suggests that workers were epigaeic, where they foraged above ground and out in the open. Fossil evidence further suggests that they foraged socially with other worker ants.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with <b>disinfectant</b> agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common <b>disinfectant,</b> elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E

40|$|Background : Even with {{advances}} in medicine, patients susceptible to infection have been increasing, {{and so the}} prevention of infection remains an important problem. The most useful method to prevent infection may be the identification and blocking of the infection route, and accurate sterilization and disinfection are necessary for this. Sterilization is performed for objects. However, disinfection is performed for objects and people, and, therefore, its application range is marked. General bacteria and viruses are inactivated by heating. Human bodies and some medical instruments cannot be heated, and so <b>disinfectants</b> are used. <b>Disinfectants</b> are classified according to their antimicrobial spectra and purposes of use into high-, intermediate-, and low-level <b>disinfectants.</b> High-level <b>disinfectants</b> with marked effects show inhalation toxicity and induce contact dermatitis in the human body; therefore, their use {{is limited to the}} disinfection of medical instruments. Although intermediate- and low-level <b>disinfectants,</b> which can be used for the human body, are widely employed, the development of microorganisms resistant to these has presented problems and requires caution. Another problem is the adverse effect of <b>disinfectants.</b> Many previously reported cases of adverse effects developed because the indicated subjects, concentration, and contact time were not observed. To prevent these adverse effects, instructions for appropriate use should be strictly followed. In this report, we make general comments regarding differences in antimicrobial effects among high-, intermediate-, and low-level <b>disinfectants,</b> the characteristics of <b>disinfectants</b> used for the human body and medical instruments, and previously reported adverse effects of <b>disinfectants</b> on the human body...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} {{different}} <b>disinfectants</b> {{in the food}} and pharmaceutical industry provides a possibility for application of certain level of assurance related to microbiological cleanness by using different types of <b>disinfectants</b> which have different spectrum of operation. Used <b>disinfectants</b> residues which stay on the critical points of the equipment after cleaning become potential contaminants of the products {{and they can be}} unsafe for the users’ health. Because of this reasons, the Good Manufacture Practice standards recommend validation of the production equipment cleaning procedures including the aspects of microbiological cleanness and determination of residues of <b>disinfectants...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{mainland}} China, officials used {{helicopters to}} airdrop relief goods to Guangdong. By {{three days after}} the storm, workers distributed 2,000tents and 1,000beds. Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of <b>disinfectant</b> {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million). After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided ¥1million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a <b>disinfectant</b> in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual <b>disinfectant</b> in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual <b>disinfectant</b> after the primary disinfection process.
