(M14) If I may {{judge from}} {{the minutes of}} the members of the cabinet on the papers circulated, most of them stood with their chief, and not one of them, not even Milner Gibson nor Villiers, was ready to proceed onward from a sort of general leaning towards Mr. Gladstone’s view to the further stage of making a strong {{stand-up}} fight for it. The controversy between him and his colleagues still raged at red heat over the whole ground of military estimates, the handling of the militia, and the construction of fortifications. He wrote memorandum upon memorandum with untiring energy, pressing the cabinet with the enormous rate in the increase of charge; with the slight grounds on which increase of charge was now ordinarily proposed and entertained; and, most of all, with the absence of all attempt to compensate for new and necessary expenditure by retrenchment in quarters where the scale of outlay had either always been, or had become unnecessary. He was too sound a master of the conditions of public business to pretend to take away from the ministers at the head of the great departments of expenditure their duty of devising plans of reduction, but he boldly urged the reconsideration of such large general <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> as the military expenditure in the colonies, then standing at an annual burden of over two millions on the taxpayers of this country. He was keen from the lessons of experience, to expose the ever indestructible fallacy that mighty armaments make for peace.|$|E

It is assumed that customers are heterogeneous in their risk attitudes toward uncertain repair costs incurred after the warranty expires. The objective is to determine a joint dynamic pricing and warranty policy for the lifetime of the product, which maximizes the manufacturer's expected profit. In {{the first part of}} the analysis, we {{consider a}} linearly decreasing price function and a constant warranty length. We first study customers' purchase patterns under several different pricing strategies by the manufacturer and then discuss the optimal pricing and warranty strategy. In the second part, we assume that the warranty length can be altered once during the product lifetime in developing a joint pricing and warranty policy. Numerical studies show that a dynamic warranty policy can significantly outperform a fixed-length warranty policy. Dynamic pricing Dynamic warranty Risk aversion...|$|R

The subjects were 64 healthy persons and 60 patients with cardiac infarction. The HPPQ comprised four subscales including 12 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> well-beings, 12 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> feeling <b>of</b> disability, 10 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> despondency, and 6 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> social inhibition. The Japanese version was made by researchers, five specialized translators and two native proofreaders. In the comparison among the healthy group, the group with cardiac rehabilitation, and the group without cardiac rehabilitation, except for the sub-scale of social inhibition, no significant differences were found. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0. 66 - 0. 80. Four factors having the similar structure to the sub-scales were extracted. The first factor included nine <b>items</b> <b>of</b> well being and one <b>item</b> <b>of</b> despondency, which were in the initial categories. The second factor included four <b>items</b> <b>of</b> feeling of disability and two <b>items</b> <b>of</b> well-being. The third factor included five <b>items</b> <b>of</b> social inhibition and one <b>item</b> <b>of</b> feeling of disability and the fourth item included four <b>items</b> <b>of</b> despondency and one <b>item</b> <b>of</b> feeling of disability. From these results, it was clarified that the Japanese version of HPPQ is at an almost allowable level. 本研究は,心筋梗塞患者の心理状態の査定と看護介入評価を行うためにThe Heart Patient Psychologic Questionnaire(以下HPPQ) の日本語版を作成し,初期段階の検討を行うことを目的とした。対象者は健康人 64 名,心筋梗塞患者 60 名である。HPPQは,Well-being(安寧) 12 項目,Feeling of disability(障害の感覚) 12 項目,Despondency(落胆) 10 項目,Social inhibition(社会的抑制) 6 項目の 4 つの下位尺度から構成されている。日本語版の作成は,研究者を含め 5 名の翻訳専門家および 2 名のnative speakerが実施した。その結果,健康群,心臓リハビリテーション実施群,心臓リハビリテーション非実施群における対象群別の比較では,社会的抑制の下位尺度以外は,対象群間で有意差は認められなかった。Cronbach alpha係数は, 0. 66 〜 0. 80 であり,主因子分析では第 1 因子は,初期カテゴリーにおいて安寧に含まれる 9 項目と落胆 1 項目。第 2 因子は,障害の感覚 4 項目と,安寧 2 項目,第 3 因子は,社会的抑制の 5 項目と障害の感覚 1 項目,第 4 因子は,落胆 4 項目と障害の感覚 1 項目が抽出された。これらの結果から,日本語版HPPQは,ほぼ許容できるレベルであることが明らかとなった...|$|R
