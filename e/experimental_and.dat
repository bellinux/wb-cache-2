5|$|Celestiial is {{a funeral}} doom metal band. However, Desolate North has been {{described}} as taking the genre in new directions with comparisons to ambient, goth, <b>experimental,</b> <b>and</b> dark folk music being made. The music has also been described as meditative and medieval.|$|E

5|$|Parachutes was {{recognised}} to have {{an alternative}} rock sound similar to English band Radiohead in their Bends era.

Released on October18, 2005, Crime and Dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics. The album has attracted comments on Morricone's <b>experimental</b> <b>and</b> innovative compositional style, often {{in contrast to}} the spare-sounding westerns he is known for.|$|E

5|$|At that time, the {{university}} {{did not offer}} a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program so Massey undertook a Master of Science (MSc) course, with both <b>experimental</b> <b>and</b> theoretical components. The former, in cooperation with Courtney Mohr, dealt with soft X-ray deflection from metal surfaces; the latter with wave mechanics. This involved translating numerous articles from German journals such as Zeitschrift für Physik, Annalen der Physik and Physikalische Zeitschrift. His external examiner was Ralph Fowler from the University of Cambridge, who was Paul Dirac's PhD supervisor.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often <b>experimental,</b> <b>and</b> had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E

Non-rap {{artists such as}} English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen, New Zealand artist Lorde, American electropop singer Halsey, English rock band Arctic Monkeys, Sergio Pizzorno of English rock band Kasabian and the American indie rock bands MGMT and Yeah Yeah Yeahs have cited West as an influence. <b>Experimental</b> <b>and</b> electronic artists such as James Blake Daniel Lopatin, and Tim Hecker have also cited West's work as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's <b>experimental</b> <b>and</b> problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E

5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the <b>experimental</b> <b>and</b> control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II both {{submarines}} {{participated in}} cruises to Mediterranean ports. Both submarines were captured by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After refit, they saw service as <b>experimental</b> <b>and</b> training vessels with the Regia Marina as Francesco Rismondo and Antonio Bajamonti respectively. They were both scuttled in September 1943 following the Italian surrender, Francesco Rismondo by the Germans following her capture, and Antonio Bajamonti by the Italians themselves.|$|E
