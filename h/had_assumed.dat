5|$|In {{a little}} under a month after Boyd <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> the vice chancellorship, then-Georgia Tech {{president}} Arthur G. Hansen resigned. Chancellor George L. Simpson appointed Boyd as Acting President of the Georgia Institute of Technology, a post he held from May 1971 to March 1972.|$|E
5|$|The British, with no army in {{the field}} and behind in rearmament, was in no {{position}} to challenge French strategy, which <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> the prominent role of the Western Alliance.

5|$|After Tobruk, the 9th Division {{was sent}} to Palestine and Syria {{in order to train}} and rest, and to {{undertake}} garrison duties as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established their following the Syria–Lebanon campaign. Under their new commander, Lieutenant Colonel Heathcote Hammer—who <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> command after Windeyer took over the 20th Brigade—the 2/48th proceeded to train in high terrain and temperatures.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided {{a more accurate}} localization, and what Metzger <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> to be a variable star was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were hesitant to publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May10 Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute published his discovery, which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this discovery, the {{condition}} became known as trisomy21. Even before the discovery of its cause, the presence of the syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed. Medical texts <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> it was caused by a combination of inheritable factors that had not been identified. Other theories had focused on injuries sustained during birth.|$|E

5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> that the Discovery {{would be free}} from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine / Darth Sidious, a Senator of Naboo who is {{eventually}} elected Chancellor of the Republic. McDiarmid {{was surprised when}} Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine because he <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> that a younger actor would play the part in the prequel films.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, {{while still}} serving as {{lieutenant}} governor, Black <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> {{the presidency of}} the John A. Black National Bank of Barbourville, named for and founded by his older brother. He became chief prohibition inspector for Kentucky in 1920. Later, he served as director of the Barbourville Cemetery Company. While working as Ninth Congressional District campaign manager for Senator Alben Barkley in 1938, Black developed pneumonia and died on August 5, 1938. He is entombed in a mausoleum at Barbourville Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Mary's mother Molly {{initially}} ran {{the fossil}} business after Richard's death, {{but it is}} unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer, but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> the leading role in the family business.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{contribution}} to gravitational theory was {{to unify the}} motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a law of gravity that {{could account for the}} celestial motions that had been described earlier using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E

5|$|No Doubt became {{frustrated}} {{at the lack}} of progress they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they built their own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn't want any songs to be released in an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded The Beacon Street Collection in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in one long weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> they were recording a third single.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1921, {{the upper}} Colorado River above the {{confluence}} with the Green River in Utah <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> various names. Fathers Dominguez and Escalante named it Rio San Rafael in 1776. Through the mid-1800s, the river between Green River and the Gunnison River was most {{commonly known as}} the Grand River. The river above the junction with the Gunnison River, however, was known variously as the Bunkara River, the North Fork of the Grand River, the Blue River, and the Grand River. The latter name did not become consistently applied until the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|What {{would replace}} ADBA {{was the subject}} of discussions between the Australian and New Zealand chiefs of staff that were held in Melbourne between 26 February and 1 March 1942.

5|$|When he {{returned}} from that expedition eight days later, Brigadier General Richard Montgomery <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> command of the invasion due to Schuyler's illness. Montgomery, likely not wanting the troublemaker in his camp, again sent him out, this time to raise a regiment of French-speaking Canadiens. Accompanied by {{a small number of}} Americans, he again set out, traveling through the countryside to Sorel, before turning to follow the Saint Lawrence River up toward Montreal, recruiting upwards of 200 men.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{rendezvous}} with Robert E. Lee's retreating forces at Farmville, Virginia, Breckinridge moved south to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he, Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory, and Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan joined Generals Joseph E. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard to urge surrender. Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin initially resisted, but eventually asked Major General William T. Sherman to parley. Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> the presidency on Lincoln's assassination on April 15) rejected them as too generous. On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet Richard Taylor in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men {{would refuse to}} fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at Appomattox.|$|E
5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States <b>had</b> <b>assumed</b> the role of mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E
