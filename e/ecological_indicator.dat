By applying theoretical concepts from policy analysis and social studies of science about knowledge utilization, problem structuring and the boundaries between science and policy {{to the issue of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators,</b> we aim to contribute to our understanding not only of the development but more importantly of the actual use of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> in policy processes and the importance of political context. Our interest is in those <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> that attempt to measure the ecological quality of ecosystems and that can be or are specifically developed to be used as instruments to evaluate the effects of policies on nature. We claim that these indicators, although they are highly dependent on scientific knowledge, cannot be solely science-based, due to the complexity of ecosystems and the normative aspects involved in assessing ecosystem quality. As a result, we situate <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> in a fuzzy area between science and policy and between the production and the use of scientific knowledge. We will argue that <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> can be expected to be used or rejected strategically, dependent on policy context. Furthermore we will argue that <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> cannot be evaluated with traditional scientific quality criteria alone. The article concludes with some lessons for future indicator development one of them being the inclusion of stakeholder perspective...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the {{condition}} of the environment, to provide an early warning signal of changes in the environment, or to diagnose the cause of an environmental problem. Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system. Three concerns hamper the use of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> as a resource management tool. (1) Monitoring programs often depend on a small number of indicators and fail to consider the full complexity of the ecological system. (2) Choice of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> is confounded in management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives. (3) Management and monitoring programs often lack scientific rigor because of their failure to use a defined protocol for identifying <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators.</b> Thus, <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> need to capture the complexities of the ecosystem yet remain simple enough to be easily and routinely monitored. <b>Ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> should meet the following criteria: be easily measured, be sensitive to stresses on the system, respond to stress in a predictable manner, be anticipatory, predict changes that can be averted by management actions, be integrative, have a known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time, and have low variability in response. The challenge is to derive a manageable set of indicators that together meet these criteria. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe world's {{extensive}} and often remote arid landscapes are receiving increasing attention {{to maintain their}} ecological and productive values. Monitoring and management of these lands requires indicators and evidence of ecosystem condition and trend, generally derived from widely distributed and infrequently repeated site-based records. However adequate geographic representation and frequent site revisits are difficult to achieve because of the remoteness and vast extent of these landscapes. Interpreting such sparse ecological indicators is difficult, particularly within landscapes that are highly variable in space and time. To interpret <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> data collected in such environments long-term patterns of natural landscape variability need to be understood. This paper presents a framework of landscape spatio-temporal variability within which to interpret <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> data. This framework is based on long-term patterns of vegetation growth across the Australian arid zone, derived from twenty-five years of high temporal resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery. We present {{a case study of}} the extensive Alinytjara Wilurara (AW) Natural Resource Management (NRM) region in far western South Australia to illustrate new insights about landscape function gained from this approach, and their implications for collection and interpretation of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> data. We illustrate how variability in vegetation response is expressed across the region, and how stratification based on active vegetation response differs from more commonly used biogeographic stratifications in this region. Lastly we demonstrate the unique patterns of long-term vegetation response for the major vegetation response classes. Average amount, seasonality, magnitude, timing and variability of vegetation response over time are used to characterise the natural “envelope” of variability of the new landscape classes. The study region showed low vegetation response in summer and higher response in winter. Onset of growth was earlier in the north and in ecosystems dominated by mallee vegetation. Cyclonic influence from the west was evident at the southern margin of the study region. The study demonstrates the landscape functional response of the study region, and presents a method whereby remote sensing reveals the landscape context within which to better interpret <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> data collected in a highly variable landscape...|$|E

40|$|Ecosystem-based {{management}} (EBM) {{in marine}} ecosystems considers impacts caused by complex interactions between environmental and anthropogenic pressures (i. e., oceanographic, climatic, socio-economic) and marine communities. EBM depends, in part, on <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> that facilitate understanding of inherent properties and {{the dynamics of}} pressures within marine communities. Thresholds of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> delineate ecosystem status because they represent points at which a small increase in one or many pressure variables results in an abrupt change of ecosystem responses. The difficulty in developing appropriate thresholds and reference points for EBM lies in the multidimensionality of both the ecosystem responses and the pressures impacting the ecosystem. Here, we develop thresholds using gradient forest for a suite of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> in response to multiple pressures that convey ecosystem status for large marine ecosystems from the US Pacific, Atlantic, sub-Arctic, and Gulf of Mexico. We detected these thresholds of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> based on multiple pressures. Commercial fisheries landings above approximately 2 – 4. 5 t km− 2 and fisheries exploitation above 20 – 40 % of the total estimated biomass (of invertebrates and fish) of the ecosystem resulted in {{a change in the}} direction of ecosystem structure and functioning in the ecosystems examined. Our comparative findings reveal common trends in ecosystem thresholds along pressure gradients and also indicate that thresholds of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> are useful tools for comparing the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic pressures across multiple ecosystems. These critical points can be used to inform the development of EBM decision criteria...|$|R

The datasets were extracted from the database EKOO consisting of 650 sampling sites in the Netherlands including 855 species. Using these datasets, exergy of five trophic functional groups (carnivores, detritivores, detritivore¿herbivores, herbivores, and omnivores) were calculated for each sampling site on the basis of the biomass data. Exergy of each trophic group was used as input data of the SOM. By training the SOM the sampling sites were classified into five clusters and the classification was mainly related to water types of the sampling sites. Exergy of different trophic groups responded differently to different water types displaying characteristics of target ecosystems. Finally, the results show that exergy is an effective <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> and patterning changes of exergy is an effective way to evaluate target ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented here was to determine and compare the habitat conditions of the two adjacent dune areas in the Narew River Valley. For the comparative studies we used the <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> value method and the index of forest soil trophism (ITGL), both of which revealed differences between the investigated habitats. Values of ITGL indicate {{that in the case of}} the Uroczysko Serwańce dune, which is covered by a mixed coniferous forest (Serratulo-Piceetum), the habitat is oligotrophic, while the habitat on the Ławki Małe dune is dominated by a not yet fully developed Tilio-Carpinetum plant community which displays a mesotrophic character. Similar differences were observed using <b>ecological</b> <b>indicator</b> values. Soil indices calculated for the oak-hornbeam stand on the Ławki Małe dune indicate the presence of fresh, mesotrophic, humus-mineral soils made of sandy loam or silt substrate with a near-neutral pH. From these results we can deduce that climatic conditions, affected by peatlands, have a greater impact on the development of vegetation on inpeatland dunes than relatively poor soils.

Our major findings in France were that <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> were never optimised for the present market or political arena. Instead EI development was typically recycling previous tools that were elaborated for other purposes by environmentally committed outsiders, without regular funding. We found that regular funding for monitoring an EI was only provided when it matched an institution's goal.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to assess the ecosystem health of Daya Bay benthic habitat, investigate the effects of anthropogenic nutrients, and evaluate the application of <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> for benthic health assessment. Environmental indicators and macrobenthic communities, were investigated during summer and winter 2015. Results indicated a strong seasonality in biotope of intertidal and subtidal zones. Lower macrobenthic diversity were calculated from subtidal inner bay, reflecting the effects of anthropogenic nutrients. However, intertidal sites in that part were indicated {{to be in a}} relatively healthier ecological status. Seasonal effects of excess nutrients on benthic habitat were reflected in <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators.</b> It is concluded that the excess nutrients at spatiotemporal scales, influences on the health of benthic habitat. Eventually, it is recommended by this research that, with considering the natural/anthropogenic circumstances, the taxonomic and phylogenetic <b>ecological</b> <b>indicators</b> would be helpful tools to evaluate the benthic health of a typical sub-tropical semi-enclosed bay.
