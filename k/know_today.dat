The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and the Americas.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we <b>know</b> <b>today</b> took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E

5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we <b>know</b> <b>today</b> came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Legends of vampires {{have existed}} for millennia; {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Mesopotamians, Hebrews, ancient Greeks, and Romans had tales of demonic entities and blood-drinking spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we <b>know</b> <b>today</b> as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century Southeastern Europe, particularly Transylvania as verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire itself. Belief in such legends became so rife that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.|$|E
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we <b>know</b> <b>today,</b> most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|The Turtle was {{the first}} {{submersible}} vessel used for combat {{and led to the}} development of what we <b>know</b> <b>today</b> as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare and the face of naval warfare. As such, the Turtle has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it has changed, and the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the Turtle as “the greatest of the wartime inventions.” The Turtle remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell’s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was “constructed with great simplicity,” and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with “precise and comprehensive descriptions of his submarine,” which aided the replication process.|$|E
