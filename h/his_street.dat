5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is upset}} after being {{identified}} {{in a magazine}} as an actor behaving normally, far from the insane persona {{he is trying to}} maintain. To re-establish <b>his</b> <b>street</b> cred, Tracy gets a dragon tattoo on his face, but is later identified as made of sharpie. At the same time, Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) is told that he is to receive a special gift from Liz Taylor (Rachel Dratch) as a response to an impression he did of the actress on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Liz Taylor sneaks into the 30 Rock studios and, upset over Josh's impersonation, brutally beats him with a fire extinguisher.|$|E
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for <b>his</b> <b>street</b> address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E

25|$|Recurring {{features}} of Kinkade's paintings are their glowing highlights and pastel colors. Rendered in highly idealistic values of American scene painting, his works often portray bucolic and idyllic settings such as gardens, streams, stone cottages, lighthouses and Main Streets.

He also depicted various Christian themes including the Christian cross and churches.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of privileged groups {{may not be}} a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as underproduction of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect <b>his</b> <b>street</b> light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.|$|E

He did not reveal himself, but it was apparent that it was a masked Sakuraba and that he signed with K-1 and FEG. A day later, Sakuraba appeared at a FEG press conference to announce he would fight in Hero's. His defection to Hero's was a culmination of several signs that suggested he was leaving Pride. It was reported that Sakuraba left Takada Dojo (run by Pride's general manager, Nobuhiko Takada), and conspicuously was not entered into Pride's 2006 Open Weight Grand Prix Tournament.|$|E

25|$|Van Damme {{has been}} married five times to four {{different}} women. He was married to his third wife, bodybuilder Gladys Portugues - {{with whom he has}} two children: Kristopher (born 1987) and Bianca (born 1990) - until 1992, when he began an affair with actress Darcy LaPier, whom he married in February 1994. That same year he had an affair with <b>his</b> <b>Street</b> Fighter co-star Kylie Minogue during filming of that movie in Thailand. LaPier, who was pregnant at the time with their son, did not become aware of this until Van Damme publicly admitted it in 2012. After leaving LaPier, Van Damme remarried bodybuilder Portugues in 1999, and they later again separated. In early 2015, Portugues has filed for a second divorce from Van Damme– citing irreconcilable differences. However, in May 2015 they appeared to have reconciled and called off the divorce.|$|E
25|$|A {{struggling}} {{high school}} chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), is diagnosed with inoperable, advanced lung cancer. On a ride-along with his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), Walter sees {{a former student}} of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), fleeing the scene of a meth lab. He later contacts Jesse and devises a scheme to become partners in an attempt to combine their skills to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, with Walter cooking the product and Jesse using <b>his</b> <b>street</b> connections to distribute it. Walter says he wants to provide financial stability for his pregnant wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn) and disabled son, and to pay for his expensive cancer treatment. During Walter and Jesse's first days of selling Albuquerque's finest meth, they encounter a series of problems with local drug dealers. He continues to produce meth despite these setbacks using the alias 'Heisenberg'.|$|E
25|$|Jesse {{threatens to}} report Walter {{to the police}} if he is arrested, but Walter offers him Gale's {{position}} at the lab.

Jesse gets romantically involved with a woman he meets in his rehab group and learns her kid brother, age 11, was put up by Gus and <b>his</b> <b>street</b> dealers to kill Combo. Jesse decides to avenge Combo. Walter aids Jesse in escaping from Gus' wrath. Gus begins to lose trust in Walter and asks Gale {{to take over the}} lab. He orders his henchmen to kill Walter and Jesse. After he is abducted by the henchmen, Walter instructs Jesse over the phone to kill Gale in order to force Gus not to kill Walter (and, by extension, Jesse) lest he eliminate his only remaining trained chemist.|$|E

He took his name from the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders, and much of his work is composed of square ceramic tiles inspired by video game characters.

500|$|Peter Dunne {{was born}} on July 10, 1867, in Chicago, the son of Irish immigrants; he added the first name [...] "Finley", his mother's maiden name, in his early twenties. A {{precocious}} boy, he did well in elementary school but finished last in his high school class of 50, possibly because {{of the death of}} his mother, and was sent to work at about age 17 in 1884. [...] Dunne got a menial job on the Chicago Tribune, where superiors soon noticed <b>his</b> <b>street</b> smarts, and made him police reporter. Over the next few years, Dunne worked for several Chicago papers, gaining in salary and responsibility, and by 1888 at age 21 was city editor and a political writer for the Chicago Times.|$|E
500|$|Steve Huey from AllMusic gave it five stars, stating [...] "The {{album that}} reinvented East Coast rap for the gangsta age, Ready to Die made the Notorious B.I.G. a star.

In 2006, Time magazine included it on their 100 Greatest Albums of All Time list, and stated [...] "On Ready to Die, Wallace took <b>his</b> <b>street</b> corner experiences and filtered them through his considerable charm. The result was a record that mixed long stretches of menace with romance and lots of humor. No rapper ever made multi-syllabic rhymes sound as smooth".

He claims it is Gus who is ultimately responsible for Gale's death, not they, and insists Victor cannot produce the meth Gus needs. Gus maintains his silence, even while changing into hazmat gear and selecting a box cutter, while Victor grins in anticipation. Never changing his demeanor, Gus suddenly slices Victor's throat, startling the others. Through the killing, Gus simultaneously punishes Victor while delivering a stern message to Walt and Jesse. Gus drops the body {{to the floor and}} coldly eyes the duo to ensure his message was received. Gus quietly returns to <b>his</b> <b>street</b> clothes, then walks out of the lab, pausing only to say, [...] "Well, get back to work." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{time each}} car {{set on the}} first day {{determined}} the time they set off on the second day, hence Szisz's first-day time of 5hours and 45minutes meant he started at 5:45am. Following the same principle, Clément began at 6:11am and Nazzaro at 6:26am. This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings. A horse, which had been trained before the race to be accustomed to the loud noise of an engine starting, towed each competitor out of parc fermé to the start line. As neither driver nor mechanic could work on their car until they had been given the signal to start the day's running, Szisz and Clément began by heading directly to the pit lane to change tyres and service their cars. Clément completed his stop more quickly than Szisz, and Nazzaro did not stop at all, and so Clément closed his time gap to Szisz and Nazzaro closed on Clément. Jenatzy and Lancia, who were both suffering eye problems from the first day, had intended to retire from the race and be relieved by their reserve drivers. As planned, [...] "Burton" [...] took over Jenatzy's car, but Lancia was forced to resume in <b>his</b> <b>street</b> clothes when his replacement driver could not be found when the car was due to start.|$|E
