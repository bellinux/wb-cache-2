2500|$|La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement {{with the}} entire Jackson family and {{returned}} home to Hayvenhurst. Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s {{very kind}} of you," [...] said Miss Drewitt, coldly, [...] "but <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> uncle wants any more furniture; the room is pretty full now." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had many}} friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{disposition}} was then very affectionate.|$|E
6000|$|Under these circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> politeness in {{applying}} no harder adjective than [...] "Jesuitical" [...] to these proceedings is not properly appreciated.|$|E

6000|$|... "I fancy," [...] said he, [...] "that if I were to die, {{and then}} walk, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> widow looked better {{in one of}} those caps than any other kind of head-dress." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD (with emotion). <b>I</b> don't <b>think,</b> Cicely, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> dear {{wife would}} {{misunderstand}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Herr Zamenoy," [...] {{began the}} Jew, [...] "you are, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> aware <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father has {{purchased}} from your friend and brother-in-law, Josef Balatka, certain {{houses in the}} Kleinseite, in one of which the old man still lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{blessing of}} the Great One be upon you, sahib, and take you safely to camp. As for myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> race is run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not like}} to travel very much," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{do not like}} the cooking, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> tastes are what you would call very civilized." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will go {{and help}} pull them. I can do my share at that, {{and should be}} of no use {{on one of those}} little rafts; indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> weight would bury it under the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Furnival, <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{mother will}} hardly have strength {{to sustain the}} trial. She is so depressed that I almost fear her mind will give way; and {{the worst of it}} is that I am altogether unable to comfort her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. Up {{till now}} I {{have been at}} college. My uncle is rather partial, I fear, and may have spoken too highly of me. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> hand {{is not a bad}} one. At least it is legible." ...|$|R
60|$|CHRIST. Little did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> once, <b>that</b> when <b>my</b> husband went on pilgrimage, I {{should ever}} have followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Help {{yourself}} to cigarettes," [...] Norgate invited, passing the box across. [...] "Do the thing properly. Sit well {{back in the}} taxicab, although I'm hanged if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> friend Boko stands an earthly. Plenty of money in your pocket?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, sire, but {{on my own}} terms, not on yours, for if I {{took these}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{marriage}} would lack blessings. Nor, indeed, would Rosamund wish to wed a servant of your Prophet, who if it pleased him might take other wives." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{that moment}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> heart broke--at least I know that nothing {{has had the}} power to move me greatly since, though this memory moves me day by day and hour by hour, till I die and go to seek my son.|$|E
40|$|The present paper titled Marital Rape in Shashi Deshpande’s fiction {{tries to}} explore the issues like rape in {{marriage}} in the novels of Shashi Deshpande. Shashi Deshpande's fiction explores the search of the woman to fulfil herself basically as a human being, independent of her various traditional roles as daughter, wife, mother and so on. Shashi Deshpande strongly agrees with Simone de Beavouir's that “that {{fact that we are}} human is much more important than our being and women”. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> idea of feminism. Women have been quite suppressed, quite oppressed. We, middle class people with education, are quite lucky. But a large section of Indian women are suffering even toda...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Burns at {{this point}} {{looked at me with}} an air of curiosity. <b>I</b> began to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{predecessor}} was a remarkably peculiar old man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> god Fate also bows to Faith. Perhaps, indeed, Faith shapes Fate, not Fate, Faith. But whence comes {{that faith}} which even I {{with all my}} {{learning}} cannot command? Why is it denied to me and given to you and Bastin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand--how should you? But, Mr. Monk, {{there are}} strange things and strange {{people in this}} world, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{daughter}} Stella {{is one of the}} strangest of them. Fey like the rest--only a fey Norse woman would sing in such a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did love}} you, Arthur, {{from the very}} first, {{but it was not}} that kind of love. I know that I should never have felt it for you. I did not know that you were my brother, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> heart must have known it." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. My {{mother was}} a very poor woman who had no {{reasonable}} choice but to do as she did. You were a rich gentleman; and you did {{the same for the}} sake of 35 per cent. You are a pretty common sort of scoundrel, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>That</b> is <b>my</b> opinion of you.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is <b>my</b> duty {{to put a}} stop, a {{peremptory}} stop {{to anything}} like a love affair between my son and your niece." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was no noise," [...] Bathurst said; [...] "if {{they had}} had pistols, and had used them, {{it might have been}} different. Heaven knows, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> then, with her life at stake, I should have flinched; I had made up my mind they would have pistols, but <b>I</b> hope--I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> nerves would not have given way then." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> mind {{must have}} wandered, for when my soul was {{swallowed}} in this deepest pit of hell, {{it seemed to}} me that he whom I had worshipped as a heavenly patron, St. Hubert, appeared striding by my horse with a shining countenance and said to me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not see}} him," [...] went on Noie fiercely, [...] "nor would I have pardoned him if I had. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{father and}} his family pardon him; I think that they wait to bear {{testimony}} against him before the Lord of the dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, citizen, {{for your}} solicitude on my behalf, {{but you will}} understand, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> visit to the {{prisoner}} has been almost more than I could bear.

He was the favorite son, you know, and <b>I</b> sometimes <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father may {{have told him}} more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, {{but there is no}} light from within, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then,' {{said his}} lordship, 'I dare {{say you have}} got a lapdog or a broken fan; <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could soar above them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is about <b>my</b> tether.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mr. Hawtrey,' Captain Hampton replied, after a pause, 'I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{would rather}} not come. I have been unfortunate enough to offend Miss Hawtrey deeply already, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{presence}} at such a council would be in any way agreeable to her, and that being so, I need hardly say {{that it would not}} be pleasant to me.' ...|$|R
