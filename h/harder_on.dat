5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the occupying authority in Norway started cracking down <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> opposition. A strike over milk rations in September led to the arrest and execution of the two labour leaders Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm. This was followed by several high-profile arrests – among them Einar Gerhardsen – and Lie had to flee the country. He left his house only hours before the Germans appeared to arrest him. From Sweden {{he made his way}} to the United Kingdom, where he worked as a propaganda secretary for the exiled Norwegian labour movement in London. He made two visits to the United States to gather support and financial aid, the first time he went from New York City to Seattle where he held a series of lectures and radio-interviews before he travelled through Canada from the west- to the east coast. The second trip was as a labour attaché with diplomatic status. While Haakon was in exile, his brother Per, who was also a labour activist, was arrested in Norway in 1942. He was imprisoned and eventually sent to Dachau, where he died from typhoid fever in March 1945.|$|E

Measurements in late January by the University of Navarra indicated that Clinton and Obama were receiving roughly equal amounts of global media attention, once Obama won the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
25|$|Skins may be shaved {{prior to}} {{mounting}} or afterwards, {{or may be}} de-haired by liming. Liming weakens skins; some djembefolas also claim that limed skins are <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> their hands and do not sound as good as untreated skins.|$|E
25|$|The CIO found {{organizing}} textile {{workers in}} the South even harder. As in steel, these workers had abundant recent first-hand experience of failed organizing drives and defeated strikes, which resulted in unionists being blacklisted or worse. In addition, the intense antagonism of white workers toward black workers and the conservative political and religious milieu made organizing even <b>harder.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, some independent left-wing unions, such as Mine, Mill and the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union of America.|$|E

25|$|Austrian Poles {{experienced}} an enormous rise in religiosity {{during the late}} 19th century. From 1875 to 1914, the number of Polish nuns increased sixfold in Galicia; at the same time, German Poland had a less marked increase and in Russian Poland it decreased. Historian William Galush noted that many nuns were from the peasant class, and young women choosing marriage were {{faced with the prospect}} of hard farm work. Polish peasants in Galicia were forced to work <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> smaller size farms than those they had grown up on as a result of Poland's rapid population growth.|$|E

Quick Actions and shortcuts are added to apps that support the 3D Touch feature and are triggered by pressing slightly <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> the app icon. It also introduces actions known as Peek and Pop, which lets users firmly hold to preview ("Peek") at any kind of content in a hovering window, before they optionally apply more pressure to enter ("Pop") the content into full view.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{the release}} of their second album Ascendancy, Trivium were {{identified}} as melodic metalcore with strong elements of thrash metal, with the third track on the album “Pull <b>Harder</b> <b>on</b> the Strings of Your Martyr” becoming a permanent fixture in the band's set lists {{and the rest of}} the album selling itself to gold status. Ascendancy was even featured as one of Metal Hammer’s Albums of the Decade. Later releases have marked changes in the band. The Crusade was seen as a major shift in musical direction due to the change in vocal style, namely the absence of screaming, and some of the melodies featured.|$|E

25|$|The Earth is not {{a perfect}} sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an {{equatorial}} diameter about 43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, {{during most of the}} year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> one side of the Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.|$|E
25|$|As {{the strike}} entered its fourth week, the police cracked down even <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> the Wobblies. The Los Angeles {{headquarters}} of the KKK handed out a pamphlet to local citizens to get more supports and help the police force break up the strike. Members of the Ku Klux Klan, with or without their hoods regularly came to the San Pedro docks to be a force of intimidation. The latter began to look on the dispute as a free-speech fight and continued to hold meetings near the water front at a point known as Liberty Hill, a privately owned parcel of land used {{with the permission of}} the owner. Local sympathizers and members of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the IWW leaders in seeking to maintain rights of free speech. They included such prominent Los Angeles and Pasadena figures as Upton Sinclair.|$|E
25|$|The Amalgamated {{solidified}} its {{gains and}} extended its power in Chicago {{through a series}} of strikes in {{the last half of the}} 1910s. The Amalgamated found it <b>harder,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, to make gains in Baltimore, where it was able to sign an agreement with one of the largest manufacturers that, like HSM (Hart Schaffner and Marx) in Chicago, sought labor peace, it found itself at odds with an unusual alliance of UGW locals, the corrupt head of the Baltimore Federation of Labor, and the Industrial Workers of the World, who undermined the Amalgamated's strikes and attacked strikers. Complicating the picture further were the ethnic bonds between the many Lithuanian members of the IWW and the subcontractors whom the Amalgamated was trying to put out of business and the anarcho-syndicalist politics of many Lithuanian workers, who had developed their politics in opposition to czarist oppression in their homeland. The Amalgamated eventually prevailed, as the contradictions between the IWW's politics and its alliance with small contractors and the AFL eventually undercut its support among Lithuanian workers.|$|E

500|$|According to Young, {{the music}} on Fascination was a {{progression}} for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, [...] "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here. While {{we still have the}} bluegrass and roots music influences, we really wanted to push ourselves <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> this one, something a bit more challenging to play live." [...] She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is [...] "our own little sound". The track [...] "The Crystal Merchant" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance.|$|E

A second sweep followed two days later, also to the Amrun Bank. While on this operation, a British submarine attempted to torpedo Lützow without success. Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Friedrich Boedicker, the deputy commander of the I Scouting Group, temporarily raised his flag aboard the ship from 29 March to 11 April. On 21–22 April, Lützow joined the rest of the High Seas Fleet for a sortie into the North Sea that failed to locate any British warships.|$|E
500|$|Sanz {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence. His song [...] "Sí, He Cantado Mal" [...] (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from No Es lo Mismo references this, with Sanz saying [...] "I'm laughing a little at myself so that I can laugh at other things. Sometimes, I'm <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> myself than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that." [...] Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a [...] "heavy metal radical". He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where [...] "Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing.

500|$|Development on Remastered began shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} The Last of Us in June 2013. Though initially under light development, the team began working <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> Remastered {{when they saw the}} demand for it; work on the game's code did not begin until a larger team was introduced to Remastered in February 2014. As development on the original game ended, the programmers expected that the game would be ported to the PlayStation 4, but planning and preparation did not begin until The Last of Us had launched. The team aimed at creating a [...] "true" [...] remaster, maintaining the [...] "same core experience" [...] and not changing any large story or gameplay elements. For the game's frame rate, the team was initially split, with some preferring 30 frames per second rather than 60; when the game was running at the latter, the whole team became convinced. The team that worked on Remastered was significantly smaller than the team for The Last of Us; in particular, the team did not include any designers, which led to various design issues remaining from the original game. Druckmann attributed this to the fact that Remastered was developed as a recreation of the original, altering only technical and graphical aspects.|$|E
