5000|$|Round-leaf cassia grows well in poor soils. It {{requires}} only low to moderate rainfall, with the minimum requirement being 400 mm, making it well {{adapted to the}} sub-humid and semi-arid conditions in Africa. It performs best in light, sandy soils with good drainage and is drought-resistant, but not when left ungrazed for extended periods of time. Conversely, it is not tolerant of flooding and is not suited to <b>hard-setting</b> or clay soils which can take on too much moisture. [...] It is also successful in acid soils with a high content of exchangeable aluminum, as exemplified by cases in Central and Southern China.|$|E
40|$|Many soils have a <b>hard-setting</b> behavior, {{also known}} as {{cohesive}} or "coesos". In such soils, the penetration resistance increases markedly when dry and decreases considerably when moist, creating serious limitations for plant emergence and growth. To evaluate the level of structure degradation in <b>hard-setting</b> soils with different texture classes and to create an index for assessing soil hardness levels in <b>hard-setting</b> soils, six soil representative profiles were selected {{in the field in}} various regions of Brazil. The following indices were tested: S, which measures soil physical quality, and H, which analyzes the degree of hardness and the effective stress in the soil during drying. Both indices were calculated using previously described functions based on data from the water-retention curves for the soils. The <b>hard-setting</b> values identified in different soils of the Brazilian Coastal Tablelands have distinct compaction (hardness) levels and can be satisfactorily measured by the H index. The S index was adequate for evaluating the structural characteristics of the <b>hard-setting</b> soils, classifying them as suitable or poor for cultivation, but only when the moisture level of the soil was near the inflection point. The H index showed that increases in density in <b>hard-setting</b> soils result from increases in effective stress and not from the soil texture. Values for Bd > 1. 48 kg dm- 3 classify the soil as <b>hard-setting,</b> and the structural organization is considered "poor"...|$|E
40|$|CBH {{recognises}} {{the need}} to change their existing method of manually covering grain in open bulkheads with tarpaulins. This is a hazardous activity which CBH hope to eliminate from their open bulkheads within ten years. The objective of this project was to improve the safety and efficiency of covering grain in open bulkheads through the design of an appropriate covering material. This was achieved through an in-depth research phase into the existing tarpaulin method, concept design analysis and a formulation of the project constraints which were used throughout the design process to assess the relevance of all ideas to CBH. The use of a <b>hard-setting</b> spray foam cover {{was selected as the}} most promising design and two different foam compositions were tested. While the first composition did not produce a <b>hard-setting</b> foam, testing of the second composition is producing more promising results. Through the in-depth research and testing of the spray foam cover concept, this project has acted as a feasibility study for CBH who can use the analysis to determine if they wish to pursue the concept towards implementation...|$|E
40|$|Four bullock-drawn tillage {{implements}} (mouldboard plough, chisel plough, sweeps, and shovels) were evaluated on a <b>hard-setting</b> Alfisol. Measurements included draft requirement, bulk density, cone index, soil crust strength, water {{content of the}} plough-layer and crop yield. Changes in bulk density and cone index due to tillage decreased with time and were negligible {{by the end of}} the growing season. After tillage with a mouldboard plough the crust was stronger than after tillage with other implements. The shovel cultivator enabled the soil to store more water, and required least draft per unit effective area of cu...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of native pastures {{requires an understanding}} of what the bounds of pasture composition, cover and soil surface condition are for healthy pastoral landscapes to persist. A survey of 107 Aristida/Bothriochloa pasture sites in inland central Queensland was conducted. The sites were chosen for their current diversity of tree cover, apparent pasture condition and soil type to assist in setting more objective bounds on condition ‘states’ in such pastures. Assessors’ estimates of pasture condition were strongly correlated with herbage mass (r =  0. 57) and projected ground cover (r =  0. 58), and moderately correlated with pasture crown cover (r =  0. 35) and tree basal area (r =  0. 32). Pasture condition was not correlated with pasture plant density or the frequency of simple guilds of pasture species. The soil type of Aristida/Bothriochloa pasture communities was generally <b>hard-setting,</b> low in cryptogam cover but moderately covered with litter and projected ground cover (30 – 50 %). There was no correlation between projected ground cover of pasture and estimated ground-level cover of plant crowns. Tree basal area was correlated with broad categories of soil type, probably because greater tree clearing has occurred on the more fertile, heavy-textured clay soils. Of the main perennial grasses, some showed strong soil preferences, for example Tripogon loliiformis for <b>hard-setting</b> soils and Dichanthium sericeum for clays. Common species, such as Chrysopogon fallax and Heteropogon contortus, had no strong soil preference. Wiregrasses (Aristida spp.) tended to be uncommon {{at both ends of the}} estimated pasture condition scale whereas H. contortus was far more common in pastures in good condition. Sedges (Cyperaceae) were common on all soil types and for all pasture condition ratings. Plants identified as increaser species were Tragus australianus, daisies (Asteraceae) and potentially toxic herbaceous legumes such as Indigofera spp. and Crotalaria spp. Pasture condition could not be reliably predicted based on the abundance of a single species or taxon but there may be scope for using integrated data for four to five ecologically contrasting plants such as Themeda triandra with daisies, T. loliiformis and flannel weeds (Malvaceae) ...|$|E
40|$|An anionic {{polyacrylamide}} (PAM) at {{the rate}} of 7 kg ha- 1 applied to the surface of a degraded <b>hard-setting</b> soil increased the germination of cotton seeds by 84 %. Significant improvement in soil physical properties was also observed in treated soils. A cross-linked PAM {{at the rate}} of 0. 03 and 0. 07 % increased the amount of water retained by a sandy soil by 23 and 95 %, respectively. Consequently the water use efficiency of soybean plants grown in PAM treated soils was increased by 12 and 19 times, respectively. Increasing amounts of PAM in sandy soil enabled to extend the irrigation interval without any adverse effect on the grain yield of soybeans. An anionic PAM {{at the rate of}} 10 kg ha- 1 reduced the turbidity of water in a sodic soil by 83 %. However, PAM combined with small amounts of gypsum was highly effective in reducing the turbidity of water without significant effect on the percolation rate of water through the soil...|$|E
40|$|Production, {{regeneration}} {{and persistence}} of summer-growing pasture legumes were studied in plots (26 accessions) in 3 sub-coastal environments (> 600 m elevation) and in rows (92 accessions) in 3 inland environments ( 30 m) during the experiment. In the row experiments, legume establishment and production were restricted by drought {{on the red}} earth and grey clay soils, and by waterlogging on a <b>hard-setting</b> solodic soil. After 4 years of drought and grazing, none of the 72 legumes sown on the fertile red earth had survived, although there was subsequent regeneration from seed. Desmanthus species and Clitoria ternatea were most productive and persistent, over 15 years, on the cracking clay soil, and Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca and S. hamata cv. Verano were the only sur-vivors on the solodic soil. Environmental limita-tions of the current pasture legume cultivars have been identifi ed and legume genera are suggested for further evaluation and development under commercial grazing management and for special purpose pastures in these environments...|$|E
40|$|Work aimed {{towards the}} {{realisation}} of an embedded ultrasonic system for structural condition monitoring is described. Alien fibres embedded within carbon fibre reinforced composite plates could be utilised to guide ultrasound to strategic release {{points for the}} interrogation of the test sample, with minimal structural degradation. In particular, an array of fibre waveguides could be utilised to deliver periodic stresses to a plate-type structure to excite Lamb wave propagation. With such a system several problems need to be addressed. Ideally, single mode propagation in the fibre waveguide is required to provide increased control of the coupling of ultrasound from the waveguide to the desired Lamb wave mode. The choice of a suitable waveguide material and geometry is also crucial to ensure the guided ultrasound does not leak into the structure at undesirable locations and that the structural integrity of the test sample is maintained. Consequently, various waveguide configurations are investigated to establish an arrangement capable of meeting the system requirements. Finally, So Lamb wave generation and detection in a <b>hard-setting</b> polymer plate and a carbon fibre reinforced composite plate is demonstrated utilising embedded active acoustic waveguides sensors...|$|E
40|$|This {{laboratory}} study assessed removability of endodontic alkaline cements and resin sealers using coronal cross-sectional slices of roots with single canals. Materials were labelled with 0. 1 % (w/w) sodium fluorescein prior to mixing so that confocal microscopy {{could be used}} to quantify material remaining on the walls of post spaces, to assess cleanliness. Roots of extracted teeth were prepared using rotary NiTi instruments then obturated using lateral condensation with gutta percha and epoxy resin sealers (AH-Plus™ or Zirmix™), or were filled by injecting mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) cement (GC Nex™ MTA or MTAmix™) or a <b>hard-setting</b> calcium hydroxide cement (Supercal™). Brown (# 3) ParaPost™ drills were used at 600 rpm with a torque setting of 3 N cm- 1 for 2 min to remove 5 mm of the root filling. Roots were embedded and coronal slices examined by confocal microscopy, with the perimeter of the drill channel divided into clean, unclean and non-accessible regions. The choice of material affects cleanliness, with MTA being the most difficult and calcium hydroxide cement the easiest to remove. With epoxy resin-based sealers, almost half of the accessible canal walls remained coated with remnants of sealer after post space preparation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} use of {{commercial}} swine as an in vivo model for studying pulp healing in response to direct capping agents. Methods: Six swine sus scrofa domesticus (Landrace X Large White) {{were used in the}} experiment. Under anesthesia, class V cavities were prepared with a pulp exposure, which was directly capped with <b>hard-setting</b> calcium hydroxide (Dycal??, Dentsply, Petr??polis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Restorations were performed with resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Vitremer?? 3 M Espe St Paul, MN, USA). After 7 or 70 days (n = 6), the animals were died; the teeth were extracted, formalin-fixed and prepared for histological evaluation. The biological response was categorized using the following criteria: inflammatory response, soft tissue organization, reactionary and, reparative dentin formations. Results: After seven days pulp in most specimens inflammatory response was present and after 70 days reparative dentin was formed at the pulp exposure area in almost all the animals. These responses were similar to those previously reported in human in similar periods of evaluation. In addition, the swine model showed another advantages: easy handling and economical feasibility compared to other animal models. Conclusion: The commercial swine model seems to be an adequate animal model to test pulp biocompatibility...|$|E
40|$|Page(s) : 9 (1), 1 - 18, 18 Ref. A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} impact of clay content, ECe and SAR on the soil strength as indicated by modulus of rupture (MOR) of fifty-seven surface soil samples belonging to some Vertisols' (Gezira) and an Aridisol's (Al-Rawakeeb) series. Regression {{analysis of the data}} obtained using natural soil samples showed significant increase in MOR with decrease in clay content (R 2 = 0. 263) and increase in ECe (R 2 = 0. 210), but they rendered very low accountability of the variation of MOR. No correlation was found between MOR and SAR or ESP. However, samples equilibrated with NaCl-CaCl 2 salt solutions exhibited significant increase in MOR with increase in SAR and decrease in salt concentration. The MOR versus SAR relationships at constant salt concentration (C) values significantly fitted polynomial and linear trend lines, with coefficients of determination ranging between 87. 4 to 99. 9 %. Both models gave a base line MOR value (intercept) that can be used as an index for identifying a <b>hard-setting</b> soil. However, the linear model was preferred because unlike the other one, it gives a sodium sensitivity value (slope) independent of SAR. According to the criterion set previously by Aylmore and Sills (1982), the Aridisol is a hard setting soil; and although the Gezira Vertisols gave relatively high base line MOR value, they did not meet the criterion even under an ionic environment most conducive to dispersion.

40|$|The {{development}} of 2 -wheel tractors (2 WT) with planters attached {{has given rise}} to one-pass seeding, and the possibility of minimum tillage and conservation agriculture suitable for smallholder agriculture. The main advantages of minimum tillage techniques include: soil water conservation, targeted placement of seed and fertiliser, lower rates of fertiliser and seed, less labour and fuel required, and less time required to sow a crop (Haque et al. 2010). Germination, emergence and early seedling growth of cool and dry (rabi) season crops (such as chickpea and lentil) grown on residual soil moisture can be limited in the silty clay soils of the High Barind Tract, Bangladesh due to rapid drying and <b>hard-setting</b> of the surface soil. One-pass seeding can minimise the time taken from rice harvest to sowing of the next crop and increases the probability that the surface soil retains sufficient moisture for crop establishment (Kumar et al. 2007). Minimum tillage is also a practice often used to conserve water in the soil profile and {{it has been reported that}} in conditions of less tillage there was greater soil water storage in the profile or greater soil water storage at depth in the profile later in the growing season (Barzegar et al. 2003). The objective of this work was to determine the effect of tillage type on: (i) seed-bed conditions and early chickpea establishment; and (ii) available water content and crop water use...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} {{molasses}} as a fertiliser has recently become of interest {{due to the}} rapid devaluation of the Rand and the reliance of South African agriculture, including the sugar industry, on mainly imported N and K fertiliser. Molasses is used primarily {{as a source of}} potassium but it has other significant advantages such as increasing organic matter in the soil and microbial activity associated with nitrification. Molasses also contains secondary elements in small quantities such as phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and magnesium, as well numerous trace elements. Application of molasses also improves soil aggregation and reduces surface crusting in <b>hard-setting</b> soils. There are disadvantages to the use of molasses on farm such as the risk of ground water pollution if incorrectly applied and its variable nutrient composition, which create difficulties in applying it evenly infield. Its viscosity also makes it difficult to handle and its large volume gives rise to application problems on steeper lands. Molasses also needs to be collected rateably from the mill whereas its optimum application is not necessarily rateable resulting in storage requirements. All the above factors are quantified and the economic value of molasses compared with inorganic fertiliser, to help growers make an informed and cost effective decision regarding use of molasses on the farm. Also the demand for industrial alcohol and ethanol, which uses molasses as a feedstock is increasing. A by-product of alcohol and ethanol production is vinasse or in a concentrated form Condensed Molasses Solids (CMS), which also has value primarily as a source of K fertiliser...|$|E
