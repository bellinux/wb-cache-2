5|$|This breed {{is equally}} {{suitable}} as a <b>family</b> <b>dog</b> or a working terrier, {{given the right}} training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the United Kingdom's first major fiction film. Some four hundred prints were sold at a price of £8 each, and they circulated for at least four or five years. The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's <b>family</b> <b>dog</b> Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance of a dog in a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} good <b>family</b> <b>dog</b> {{while it}} has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E

5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the <b>family</b> <b>dog</b> to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E
5|$|Brian, the <b>family</b> <b>dog,</b> asks Kevin {{to explain}} why he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Labradors have a {{reputation}} as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent <b>family</b> <b>dog.</b> This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source ("alarm barking"), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.|$|E

5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} <b>family</b> <b>dog,</b> Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|The breed {{standard}} describes the Schapendoes as friendly, high spirited, and affectionate. He {{is not a}} guard dog or aggressively protective, and if properly socialised while young, would most likely make a good <b>family</b> <b>dog,</b> {{as well as a}} good dog for active sports. Lively and intelligent dogs must receive regular training and outings. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.|$|E

25|$|The Airedale Terrier, {{like most}} terriers, has been bred to hunt independently. As a result, {{the dog is}} very intelligent, independent, strong-minded, stoic, and can {{sometimes}} be stubborn.

When Lauer Ward returned home that evening, Starkweather shot and killed him. Starkweather and Fugate filled Ward's black 1956 Packard with stolen jewelry from the house and fled Nebraska.|$|E
25|$|First and {{foremost}} a <b>family</b> <b>dog,</b> the Leonberger's temperament {{is one of its}} most important and distinguishing characteristics. Well socialized and trained, the Leonberger is self-assured, insensitive to noise, submissive to family members, friendly toward children, well composed with passersby, and self-disciplined when obliging its family or property with protection. Robust, loyal, intelligent, playful, and kindly, they can thus be taken anywhere without difficulty and adjust easily to a variety of circumstances, including the introduction of other dogs.However, a Leonberger attacked a child. Proper control and early socialization and training are essential, as this is a giant breed.|$|E
