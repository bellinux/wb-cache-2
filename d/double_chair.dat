25|$|The last {{establishment}} of a major skifield in NSW came {{with the development of}} Blue Cow Mountain in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss-designed Skitube Alpine Railway opened to deliver skiers from Bullocks Flat, on the Alpine Way, to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987. The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2011 Perisher had 47 lifts covering 1,245hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley (elevation 1720m), Blue Cow Terminal (1890m), Smiggin Holes (1680m) and Guthega (1640m). The resort is spread across seven mountain peaks, with the highest lifted point being Mount Perisher <b>Double</b> <b>Chair</b> at 2,034m and the greatest vertical drop on a single run being 355m from the Ridge Chair at Blue Cow.|$|E
