A survey fifteen years ago in Great Britian showed that the primary elements used for flow measurement of steam and gases were square law devices, with limited turndown and high sensitivity to velocity profile. This showed the need for a primary device able to give accurate readings over a wide turndown; long life handling hostile fluids; presenting the fewest possible installation problems.

50|$|Cone meters are a newer <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> {{metering}} <b>device</b> first {{launched in}} 1985 by McCrometer in Hemet, CA.

Upstream requirements are between 0-5 diameters compared to up to 44 diameters for an orifice plate or 22 diameters for a Venturi. Because cone meters are generally of welded construction, it is recommended they are always calibrated prior to service. Inevitably heat effects of welding cause distortions and other effects that prevent tabular data on discharge coefficients with respect to line size, beta ratio and operating Reynolds numbers from being collected and published. Calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty up to +/-0.5%. Un-calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty of +/-5.0%.|$|R

However, microfluidic systems having enhanced functionality, e. g. <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors, dosing <b>devices</b> and pumps, require active components that include electrically driven actuators. Up to now, only piezo-cantilevers, electromagnetic and thermo-pneumatic actuators have been engineered for the LTCC integration [1 - 4]. Due to their specific properties, they are not suitable for all applications that require an actuator. Therefore, a review on actuators capable of being integrated in LTCC is given. On the one hand, the actuators are compared according to their functional properties, e. g. stroke and switching energy, so that actuators can be figured out that fulfil the requirements of a microfluidic system to be designed. On the other hand, the technological challenges to be coped with in {{the integration of the}} actuators are listed. Both the functional properties of an actuator and the possibility to integrate it decide on the suitability for a specific application. Using our evaluation method, we introduced actuators for two different microfluidic applications, a piezo-electrically controlled throttle for a DMFC (direct methanol fuel cell) application and an electrostatic valve for a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor...|$|R

40|$|An {{occlusion}} {{device is}} placed in an abnormal opening of the heart or its surrounding vessels to regain normal blood flow. There are various occlusion devices available for treatment of various congenital heart defects like PDA, ASD, etc. However, they have limitations like residual shunting, erosion of tissue, displacement and breakage of device, thrombus formation and sudden death. To improve efficiency and to reduce failure of occlusion devices, {{it is important to}} simulate blood flow through defect before and after placement of device. It is also important to evaluate stresses and forces exerted by blood flow on device and by the device on the vessel wall. Contact friction between device and vessel wall plays a crucial role in anchoring the device. The objective is to develop a framework to determine conditions to restrict dislocation of device in terms of contact friction. Typical occlusion devices are porous initially and later due to thrombogenesis, their porosity reduces until eventually it acts as a natural permanent plug. Thus, a porous sponge is a good model for an occlusion device. The mathematical model developed here is for <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> causing incipient movement of device, and minimum value of contact friction for restricting movement of the device for two shapes, cylindrical and conical, in uncompressed as well as pre compressed forms. The model for <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is fitted by conducting physical experiment with sponge. Mathematically, porosity is modeled using viscous resistance and inertial resistance which are calculated by experiment and simulation with ANSYS. We perform computer experiments (simulations) on a cylindrical device in a cylindrical vessel and on a conical device in a tapered vessel to determine the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> across the <b>device</b> and hence contact friction with varied porosity under boundary conditions as in body. The contact friction required to retain device is lesser in case of conical device compared to cylindrical device. As compression of device increases, friction require to retain it decreases. Hence, lesser porosity results in larger <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> and lesser compression which will eventually need higher friction values to retain the device...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − The {{measurement}} of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is widely employed in the petrol industry for determining the flow rate, level, blockage of filters and the oil-water interface. The calibration of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> transmitters is usually made at atmospheric pressure, since there is little concern about the static pressure influence on the transducer performance. As a main contribution, this paper presents a calibration methodology of <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> transmitters. The ranges of the studied static pressure (from 0 to 20000 kPa) and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> (from 40 to 250 kPa) cover Petrobras production and exploration operating conditions. To achieve the results, a <b>pressure</b> amplification <b>device</b> was developed and used at each port of the pressure transmitter. Thus, during the calibration of a pressure transmitter, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> at the transmitter ports is deduced from the measured value at nearly atmospheric pressure and the amplification factor. The uncertainty of the results was estimated and the methodology {{was used for the}} calibration of a pressure transmitter, showing that its calibrating curve varies with the operating pressure...|$|R

Segmented flow regimes of immiscible fluids are generated and subsequently separated into their component phases through an array of high aspect ratio, laser machined, separation ducts (36 µm wide, 130 µm deep) in a planar, integrated, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) microdevice.

40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors are two {{among the}} most widely employed sensors for vortex flowmeter application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor. The output signals of the piezoelectric sensor and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor under no flow condition are compared to obtain the background noise due to piping vibrations and electrical interferences. These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|After three {{cycles of}} WAG, {{when there was}} no more oil production, an ASP slug was {{injected}} into the core and then displaced by alternate injection of water and CO 2. There was an increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> during the ASP slug injection which shows a flow resistance related to the formation and propagation of the oil bank in the core due to ASP injection. The increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the mobilization of residual oil which persisted until oil bank breakthrough. The mobilized oil creates an oil bank in front of the ASP slug. As the oil bank size increases, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> increases until oil bank breakthrough occurs.

After the second oil bank breakthrough and microemulsion production, the conditions in the core and the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> profile are similar to that in the previous WAG process but slightly higher. This is possibly due to chemical slug effects such as adsorption and wettability changes.|$|R
