500|$|The Game of Chess is {{not merely}} an idle amusement; several very {{valuable}} qualities of the mind, useful {{in the course of}} human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and {{in which there is a}} vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it.

500|$|BBC drama bosses {{worked on}} {{introducing}} an Asian family, {{who would be}} central to the show, {{for a couple of}} years. Berridge commented on the casting: [...] "After a search which has taken more than two years, and <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> met literally hundreds of people, we have finally found the perfect cast for our dynamic new family. We're delighted to welcome the Ferreiras to Albert Square and I'm sure the viewers will be too." [...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. I thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted. We workshopped constantly, trying out different improvisations with the actors and the characters evolved." ...|$|E
500|$|By contrast, author Fay Weldon, while {{admitting that}} {{the series is}} [...] "not what the poets hoped for", {{nevertheless}} goes on to say, [...] "but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose". The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times, stating: [...] "There are not many writers who have JK's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep – openly, with tears splashing – and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes... We have lived through a decade <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> followed {{the publication of the}} liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written". Charles Taylor of Salon.com, who is primarily a movie critic, took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have [...] "a valid cultural point – a teeny one – about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art", he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes. Taylor also argued that Philosopher's Stone, said to be the most light-hearted of the seven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series' success: the book opens with news of a double murder, for example.|$|E

2500|$|But now, we may ask, how {{are these}} 'consequences' {{to test the}} 'truth' claimed by the assertion? Only by {{satisfying}} or thwarting that purpose, by forwarding or baffling that interest. If they do the one, the assertion is 'good' and pro tanto 'true' if they do the other, 'bad' and 'false'. Its 'consequences,' therefore, when investigated, always turn out to involve the 'practical' predicates 'good ' or 'bad,' and to contain a reference to ' practice' in the sense <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> used that term. So soon as therefore we go beyond an abstract statement of the narrower pragmatism, and ask what in the concrete, and in actual knowing, 'having consequences ' may mean, we develop inevitably the fullblown pragmatism in the wider sense.|$|E

2500|$|Lt.Colonel Herbert Brander, Commander of the Mission Escort at Changlo Manor, {{decided to}} strike against the Tibetan force {{assembling}} at Karo La without consulting Brigadier-General Macdonald, who was two days' riding away. Brander consulted Younghusband instead, who declared himself {{in favour of}} the action. Perceval Landon, correspondent of The Times who had sat in on the discussions, observed that it was [...] "injudicious" [...] to attack the Tibetans, {{and that it was}} [...] "quite out of keeping with the studious way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> hitherto kept ourselves in the right." [...] Brander's telegram setting out his plans reached Macdonald at New Chumbi on 3 May and he sought to reverse the action, but it was too late. The battle at Karo La on 5–6 May is possibly the highest altitude action in history, won by Gurkha riflemen of the 8th Gurkhas and sepoys of the 32nd Sikh Pioneers who had climbed and then fought at an altitude in excess of 5,700m.|$|E

2500|$|Abigail Adams {{wrote about}} the {{troubles}} and concerns she had as an eighteenth-century woman and she was an advocate of married women's property rights, more opportunities for women, particularly {{in the field of}} education. Women, she believed, should not submit to laws not made in their interest, nor should they be content with the simple role of being companions to their husbands. They should educate themselves and thus be recognized for their intellectual capabilities, so they could guide and influence the lives of their children and husbands. She is known for her March, 1776 letter to John and the Continental Congress, requesting that they, [...] "remember the ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power {{into the hands of the}} Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could.

2500|$|E. J. Lowe, of Durham University, {{denies that}} holding to {{indirect}} realism (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> access only to sensory features internal to the brain) necessarily implies a Cartesian dualism. He agrees with Bertrand Russell that our [...] "retinal images"—that is, the distributions across our retinas—are connected to [...] "patterns of neural {{activity in the}} cortex" [...] (Lowe 1986). He defends {{a version of the}} Causal Theory of Perception in which a causal path can be traced between the external object and the perception of it. He is careful to deny that we do any inferring from the sensory field, a view which he believes allows us to found an access to knowledge on that causal connection. In a later work he moves closer to the non-epistemic theory in that he postulates [...] "a wholly non-conceptual component of perceptual experience", but he refrains from analyzing the relation between the perceptual and the [...] "non-conceptual". Most recently he has drawn attention to the problems that hallucination raises for the direct realist and to their disinclination to enter the discussion on the topic.|$|E

After all these eliminations we remain with a mixed function and mixed traditions, and it is necessary now to look a little into the nature of this mixture.|$|E
60|$|We {{determined}} to proceed thither by another {{branch of the}} river which would take us through a totally new, and in some respects different, country from that <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> already travelled, and <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> {{the course of a}} few weeks, would carry us again into the neighbourhood of the gorilla country.|$|R
