5|$|The {{situation}} on the front was chaotic during the day September 1. The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the Kihang ferry, captured Agok, and scattered A Company, 9th Infantry at its positions from Agok northward. A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river. From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers {{on many of the}} ridges surrounding them, most of them moving east. After several hours, 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night, returning later with much needed water, rations, and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|American air, artillery, mortar, and {{tank fire}} now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made slow progress and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> I Company's position without orders.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces {{at the bottom of a}} hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{industry}} in Byron was cedar logging from the Australian red cedar (Toona ciliata). The timber industry is {{the origin of}} the word [...] "shoot" [...] in many local names - Possum Shoot, Coopers Shoot and Skinners Shoot - where the timber-cutters would [...] "shoot" [...] <b>the</b> logs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> be dragged to waiting ships.|$|R

50|$|Little Cranberry Lake {{is located}} within Anacortes Community Forest Lands on Fidalgo Island {{in the northwestern}} corner of the U.S. state of Washington. The lake is deepened by a dam on the {{northern}} end which was constructed in the 1930s. The previous dam had broken in 1921 releasing {{a large amount of}} water which crashed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making their way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered {{the bodies of the}} American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
25|$|Close to {{the summit}} of Forbury Hill, and {{stretching}} out towards Saint Clair {{to the south and}} the outer suburb of Concord to the west is the large suburb of Corstorphine. This suburb, which contains a large proportion of state houses, was built during the 1930s-1950s. Lower <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the east, close to Caversham and Forbury, lies the smaller but more prosperous suburb of Kew.|$|E
25|$|The Hume {{collection}} of birds was packed into 47 cases made of deodar wood constructed on site without nails {{that could potentially}} damage specimens and each case weighing about half a ton was transported <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> a bullock cart to Kalka and finally the port in Bombay. The material {{that went to the}} British Museum in 1885 consisted of 82,000 specimens of which 75,577 were finally placed in the museum. A breakup of that collection is as follows (old names retained). Hume had destroyed 20,000 specimens prior to this as they had been damaged by dermestid beetles.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the Swedes {{brought forward}} {{the rest of}} their cavalry and {{infantry}}, which had been lagging behind. The battle started with a salvo from the few Swedish cannons, whereupon Charles XI and his Household cavalry charged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> Danish left wing. Soon the Swedes also charged on the left wing and in the center. After 15 minutes the Danish left wing was scattered. In the center the Danish infantry put up a determined fight, with a powerful counter-attack from a cavalry unit that tried to break through the Swedish lines, but only one squadron made it through.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of October 24, 1838, Captain Bogart's unit had camped {{along the banks of}} Crooked River in Bunkham's Strip. Patten and the Mormon rescue company {{approached}} from the north along the main road. At daybreak on the 25th, the Mormons encountered the militia's sentries. A brief firefight ensued with each side testifying that the other had fired first. One of the sentries, John Lockhart, shot Patrick Obanion, the Mormons' scout. Obanion later died from this wound. Lockhart and the other guards then fled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the militia camp which took up a defensive position.|$|E
25|$|At the Limebank Quarry near Loerie, quarried {{limestone}} {{was crushed}} and loaded into buckets carried on an overhead ropeway from the quarry to bunkers at Loerie. In 1954, the cement company doubled its quarry output capacity when a second parallel ropeway {{was placed in}} service. A limitation in {{the capacity of the}} limestone trains throughout the steam haulage era was that double heading by Garratt locomotives was not permitted to protect their pivots from excessive stresses. It therefore became common practice to run heavier Garratt-headed trains of up to 14 wagons with a Class NG10 helper cut in to the train some eight to ten wagons back. From a passing loop at Summit, the Garratt would continue to Chelsea unassisted whilst the helper returned <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Loerie.|$|E
25|$|Tom {{suffers a}} serious wound on his cheek, and the camp guards realize {{it will not}} be {{difficult}} to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E
60|$|We do {{not know}} enough of the {{circumstances}} of this case, to know exactly why our Lord reproved the nobleman; and what want of faith He saw in him. Some think that the man's fault was his mean notion of our Lord's power; his wish that He should come <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> Capernaum, and see the boy Himself, in order to cure him; whereas {{he ought to have}} known that our Lord could cure him--as He did--at a distance, and by a mere wish, which was no less than a command to nature, and to that universe which He had made.|$|R

25|$|A further ten cars, {{numbered}} 116 to 125, {{were obtained}} {{during the year}} and during their life proved popular with the crews. They were top-covered, with normal stairs, and bodies built by the United Electric Car Company of Preston. They were fitted to Brill 21 E trucks and had two 40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors with Dick, Kerr controllers and equipment, and B.T.H. magnetic slipper brakes. In May, one of these, no. 121, was demonstrated to the Committee, showing {{the action of the}} ârun backâ preventer and of the combined magnetic and mechanical track brake. At a later date this car was involved in an incident. It was foggy at the time, and both driver and conductor alighted near the top of Derby Road to find their whereabouts. On returning to their car they found that it had run away backwards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Gregory Street, where it collided with another car, knocking the latter into some gardens.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1863, during Gettysburg, Roebling {{was one of}} {{the initial}} {{officers}} on Little Round Top. Observing signs of Confederate troops approaching, he hurried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> report to Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, for whom Roebling was aide-de-camp. General Warren and Roebling then descended the hill to find troops to secure this important tactical position. Roebling assisted in hoisting artillery up the hill, while Warren sent two of his aides, one of whom was Lt. Ranald S. Mackenzie, searching for infantry support. The two aides were able to secure a brigade from the Union V Corps. This brigade was commanded by Col. Strong Vincent whose brigade immediately occupied the hill and defended the left flank of the Army of the Potomac against repeated Confederate attacks. As Vincent's brigade began moving into position, Warren and Roebling had left the hill and Roebling was able to send the 140th New York Volunteers to the hill, not knowing that Vincent's brigade was already engaging advancing Confederate troops. However, the 140th New York provided much needed reinforcements.|$|E
500|$|Members of the Irish Hell Fire Club, {{which was}} active in the years 1735 to 1741, used Mount Pelier lodge as a meeting place. Stories of wild {{behaviour}} and [...] and occult practices and demonic manifestations have become part of the local lore over the years. The original name of the lodge has been displaced and the building is generally known as the Hell Fire Club. When the lodge was damaged by fire, the members of the Hell Fire Club relocated <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the nearby Stewards House for a brief period. This building also has a reputation for being haunted, most notably by a massive black cat.|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} during this period, the {{building}} was damaged by fire. There are several stories connected with this incident. One holds that the club {{set fire to the}} building when William Conolly's son refused to renew the lease on the lodge. An alternative story claims the club members did it to give the building a hellish appearance. Another story recounts that, following a black mass, a footman spilled a drink on [...] "Burn-Chapel" [...] Whaley's coat. Whaley retaliated by pouring brandy over the man and setting him alight. The fire spread around the building and killed many members. Following the fire, the club relocated further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Killakee Stewards House. However, the club's activities declined after this incident.|$|E
500|$|D'Estaing's plan {{of attack}} called for three columns to attack {{the back side of}} the fortifications with bayonets, while a small fourth {{detachment}} made a demonstration from a location where the British might more reasonably expect an attack, in other words a decoy or distraction. On the evening of July 3rd these formations moved out. The columns, each numbering 300 men, were led by Arthur Dillon, his brother Ãdouard, and the comte de Noailles. Arthur Dillon's column was [...] accompanied by an advance guard of 180 under the comte de Durat, and the demonstration force numbered just 200. At 4:00 am on the 4th the demonstration force opened fire, while the other three columns charged up Hospital Hill. The British defenders panicked and most fled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the apparent safety of Fort George.|$|E
500|$|The {{first such}} boom, {{covering}} {{the early years}} of the city, rode on the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as Yesler Way won the nickname [...] "Skid Road", supposedly after the timber skidding <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Henry Yesler's sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row.) Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 1885â1886. This violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma). In 1900, Asians were 4.2% of the population. Authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder.|$|E

This movement was initiated in 1945 by Alhaji Mamman Na-Aura, the 25th Emir of Karshi. Initially Karshi was part of Zaria Emirate; the Turakin Zazzau (Zaria) who represented the Emir of Zaria was the overseer of the Administration of Karshi. However, {{with the advent of}} colonial era and indirect rule, the colonial masters decide to merge Karshi with the Keffi Native Authority (NA). This solved the problem of distance from Karshi to Zaria and the cumbersomeness of the administrative framework.|$|R

The eastern bailey stretched <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the stream, and may have held two fishponds. Another fishpond called [...] "the Fishers", further along the stream to the south-east of the castle, was also probably linked to the castle site.
