25|$|According to a {{study by}} the Joint Women’s Programme of the Bangalore for National Commission for Women, girls who have to accept {{becoming}} a devadasi, few reasons were provided, which included <b>dumbness,</b> deafness, poverty, and others. The life expectancy of devadasi girls is low compared to the average of the country, it is rare to find devadasis older than fifty.|$|E
25|$|Nymphs {{tended to}} {{frequent}} areas distant from humans {{but could be}} encountered by lone travelers outside the village, where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool, either during the noon heat or {{in the middle of}} the night. They might appear in a whirlwind. Such encounters could be dangerous, bringing <b>dumbness,</b> besotted infatuation, madness or stroke to the unfortunate human. When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck, they would pray to Saint Artemidos.|$|E
500|$|Monroe's screen persona {{centered}} on her blonde {{hair and the}} stereotypes associated with it, especially <b>dumbness,</b> naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was [...] "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with double entendres {{that came to be}} known as [...] "Monroeisms". For example, when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, [...] "I had the radio on". Having begun her career as a pin-up model, Monroe's hourglass figure was one of her most often noted features. Film scholar Richard Dyer has written that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and in her publicity photos often posed like a pin-up. Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body, earning her the nickname [...] "the girl with the horizontal walk".|$|E
500|$|... "Girly Edition" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. It {{was named the}} fifth best episode with a sports theme of the series by Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode, full of more than the normal quota of good jokes", adding, [...] "best of all is Lisa's revenge on Bart, and the mad cat-lady who goes around chucking her cats at people." [...] Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating and stated that he enjoyed the subplot with Mojo more than the main plot. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] takes [...] "a clever concept and turns into something more than expected as it digs into the usual Bart/Lisa rivalry. I’m not quite sure why Bart reacts so sadly to Lisa’s comments about his stupidity when 'Lisa the Simpson' just delved into the <b>dumbness</b> of the male Simpsons. There’s enough to like here to make the episode fun, though." ...|$|E
500|$|Morton was a {{formidable}} personality, detested by his enemies, and vilified in opposition newspapers. According to one account, Morton had no leavening wit, no humor, no breadth of intellect, no sparkle of conversation, to attract those who disagreed with [...] him politically. Another Republican {{was said to}} have declared, [...] "His presence is a deadly poison" [...] and [...] "He is a sphinx; and I am repressed into <b>dumbness</b> when trying to hold a conversation with that man." [...] According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions, Morton was [...] "a vice-reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness, leprous ulcers and caustic bandages, who loads down with plagues and pollutions the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass." [...] Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully, highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing, even defaming his enemies, and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer, forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor's mansion. One Democratic journalist wrote, [...] "There is not, probably, in this country, a more conscienceless, corrupt, and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton" [...] and [...] "He is rotten physically, morally and politically." [...] It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease, brought on by his habits. When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage, the Saint Paul Pioneer was not surprised. [...] "Why shouldn't Morton espouse the woman's cause?" [...] it asked. [...] "It is woman that has made him what he is -- so the gossips say." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice {{wrote in}} a {{positive}} review that [...] "this [...] pushes right past competent into mostly legitimately enjoyable" [...] but added that [...] "the movie is still dumb as catbutt. It's an honest and accomplished <b>dumbness,</b> however, where the stupidest stuff seems to be there because the movie would be less fun without it." [...] The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy was critical about the film's use of 3D and accurate reflection of the franchise's comic book and cartoon origins, but predicted it would still earn better than its predecessor, [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of [...] "B-", calling it [...] "well-executed technocratic action fluff" [...] and commented: [...] "In its dehumanized and trivial way, it's a triumph of razor-sharp, hyper-violent style over formulaic substance ... Hollywood has now evolved {{to the point that}} it can deliver these kinds of thrills with maximum brute force and keep the impact so light that the result can still be regarded as a 'harmless' diversion for 14-year-olds." [...] Glen Heath Jr. of Slant Magazine gave it two out of four stars, criticizing the film's [...] "cut-happy style" [...] and plot, but lauding the action sequences and Chu's direction as [...] "poetry in high-speed motion." [...] Writing for Indiewire's The Playlist Blog, Todd Gilchrist gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] and wrote: [...] "As one might expect, there are more than a handful of loose ends once justice has been served, but there’s something to be said for a film which aims to please in a sincere and straightforward way, without attempting to be the biggest ever. 'Retaliation' is no masterpiece, but it’s a movie whose fun doesn’t feel like a four-letter word" ...|$|E
2500|$|Leah Rozen, of People magazine, {{said the}} characters' [...] "unrelenting <b>dumbness</b> and dim-witted {{behavior}} is at first amusing and enjoyable but eventually grows wearing." [...] But Rozen said the performances are a redeeming factor, especially that of Pitt, who she {{described as a}} standout who [...] "manages simultaneously to be delightfully broad and smartly nuanced." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{impetus for}} {{developing}} a classification of mental disorders in the United States was the need to collect statistical information. The first official attempt was the 1840 census, which used a single category: [...] "idiocy/insanity". Three years later, the American Statistical Association made an official protest to the U.S. House of Representatives, stating that [...] "the most glaring and remarkable errors {{are found in the}} statements respecting nosology, prevalence of insanity, blindness, deafness, and <b>dumbness,</b> among the people of this nation", pointing out that in many towns African-Americans were all marked as insane, and calling the statistics essentially useless.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1841 Leskov {{began his}} formal {{education}} at the Oryol Lyceum. After five years of poor progress all he could manage was a two-year graduation certificate. Later, scholar B. Bukhstab, comparing Leskov's school failures with those of Nikolay Nekrasov who had had similar problems, argued that, [...] "...apparently, {{in both cases the}} reasons were – on the one hand, the lack of a guiding hand, on the other – [...] loathing for the tiresome cramming routine and the deadly <b>dumbness</b> of state education, both having lively temperaments and an eagerness to learn more of real life".|$|E
2500|$|While at Bride's, Fisher {{delivered}} funeral orations for {{two women}} of the congregation: Mrs Holgate and Mrs Baker. He published these, with an introduction penned on 25 September 1654 at Thornton, under the title: A Love-Token for Mourners: Teaching Spiritual <b>Dumbness</b> and Submission under Gods Smarting Rod. He was described as [...] "Samuel Fisher M.A., late preacher at Bride's, London, now at Thornton in Cheshire." [...] The valedictions were accompanied by An antidote against the fear of death, a reflection he had written during the difficult days of summer 1650 at Shrewsbury, advertised as Some thoughts which the author used to flatter and allure his soul to be well pleased with death, when he with the Rev. Mr. Blake stayed in Shrewsbury (in the time of God's last visitation of that place by the pestilence) to execute their pastoral office amongst their people that did abide there in that doleful time, when they were under the continual expectation of arrest." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director Brian De Palma, whose previous movie, a Warner Bros. comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing Sisters, De Palma's first horror film, New Yorker critic Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter {{to the people who}} want their gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but why is there so much gratuitous <b>dumbness</b> too?... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make a}} simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the so-called blaxploitation genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) and who had appeared in several New World pictures, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.|$|E

6000|$|They all sat down, four on the bed; and Milt's {{inner ear}} heard a mute snicker from the Gilsons and Saxton. He tried to talk. He couldn't. Bill {{looked at him}} and, perceiving the <b>dumbness,</b> gallantly helped out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Love him,' she {{finished}} eagerly, silencing me into an appalled <b>dumbness.</b> 'How true! how true! But {{when you think}} that no one knew him so well as I! I had all his noble confidence. I knew him best.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be silent," [...] I {{whispered back}} and passed round the table till I came {{face to face}} with Quilla. Then a strange <b>dumbness</b> fell upon me like a spell or dead Upanqui's curse, so that I could not speak.|$|E

60|$|It was {{too much}} for John. 'Upon my heart and life, my dea--' he began. Here Bob's letter {{crackled}} warningly in his waistcoat pocket as he laid his hand asseveratingly upon his breast, and he became suddenly scaled up to <b>dumbness</b> and gloom as before.|$|E
60|$|This {{occurrence}} made us rather {{suspicious of}} our host; nor could we afterward account for his conduct, except by supposing that his feigning <b>dumbness</b> might {{in some way}} or other assist him in the nefarious pursuits in which it afterwards turned out that he was engaged. This conclusion, however, was not altogether satisfactory.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Aline {{that on this}} {{particular}} afternoon a strange <b>dumbness</b> had descended on her.

6000|$|Now {{he caught}} sight of her and stayed there, staring. She tried to speak, to welcome him, but could not, no words would come. He also seemed to be smitten with <b>dumbness,</b> and thus the two of them {{remained}} a while. At last he took off his hat almost mechanically, as though from instinct, and said vaguely, ...|$|E
60|$|To {{shorten the}} account {{as much as}} possible, all things were {{concluded}} to their mutual satisfaction, and in about a fortnight's time they set forward for Wales, where Dickory, notwithstanding his <b>dumbness,</b> behaved himself with so much diligence and affability, that he not only gained {{the love of the}} family where he lived, but of everybody round him.|$|E
60|$|Her spirit raged {{within her}} at the <b>dumbness,</b> the {{paralysis}} that had fallen upon her. Grace, confidence, the power of movement even, seemed gone from her.
