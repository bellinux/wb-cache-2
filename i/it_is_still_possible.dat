5|$|Mary Russell Mitford {{lived in}} Reading {{for a number}} of years and then spent the rest of her life just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield. The fictional Belford Regis of her eponymous novel, first {{published}} in 1835, is largely based on Reading. Described with topographical accuracy, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to follow the steps of the novel's characters in present-day Reading.|$|E
5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to {{lose all}} three {{hydraulic}} systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E

5|$|The small moon Dia, 4 {{kilometres}} in diameter, {{had gone}} missing since its discovery in 2000. One {{theory was that}} it had crashed into the much larger moon Himalia, 170 kilometres in diameter, creating a faint ring. This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> that a different moon may have been involved.|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
50|$|This {{then was}} the {{motivation}} for the Living Linen Project, which aimed to collect recollections of this great industry while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|R

25|$|Despite {{these efforts}} by the French administration, the {{institution}} of slavery persisted {{through much of the}} colony and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> in 1958 to purchase a slave in Timbuktu.|$|R
5|$|The newer {{technologies}} of road and rail {{led to the}} navigation falling into disuse. Some lengths of the system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation. Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became less obvious, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to identify remains of the original locks. The threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and Residents Association and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{estimate}} was passed within {{seconds of the}} auction opening. Six bidders pushed the price towards a million pounds and Tullie House was forced to drop out at £1.7 million. Two remaining bidders took the bid past £2 million; the winning bidder, an anonymous UK resident and fine art collector bidding by phone, paid a total of £2,330,468.75 including the buyer's premium and VAT. The outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the Treasure Act to be revised, though British Archaeology noted that {{the circumstances of the}} helmet's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> that the helmet could come into public ownership; if the winning bidder wishes to export it, an export licence would have to be applied for and if a temporary export bar was placed on it an opportunity could arise for funds to be raised by a public institution to purchase the helmet.|$|E
5000|$|The Commission {{concluded}} that the school [...] "used frequent and severe corporal punishment", which was [...] "systemic and pervasive", and that even when a child behaved <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> {{for him to be}} beaten.|$|R
25|$|Microsoft {{also argued}} that Felten's tool did not even {{completely}} remove web-browsing capability from the system since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to access the web through other Windows executables besides iexplore.exe, such as the Windows help system.|$|R
50|$|Günter Herlitz resumed {{business}} operations {{as early as}} the summer of 1945 (in a basement, at first), initially dealing in bargains of all kinds. At that time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to supply customers in East Germany.|$|R

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to take {{a walking}} tour through the tunnel to Wapping from Rotherhithe and back, but these are {{infrequent}} and on an ad-hoc basis as they can only take place when that section of the line is closed for maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the slots}} are {{slightly}} {{longer than the}} biscuits, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to slide the panels sideways after the joint is assembled (before the glue sets). This fact makes the biscuit joiner easy to use, {{because it does not}} require extreme accuracy or jigs to achieve perfect joints.|$|E

50|$|With {{the death}} of King Fahd in August 2005, some felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> that Yamani {{would return to the}} Saudi Government under King Abdullah, most likely as an ambassador, but sources close to Yamani {{indicated}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> highly unlikely.|$|R
25|$|Since 2002, SKM {{tickets are}} not valid on other PKP Group trains. Previously PKP Przewozy Regionalne tickets {{could be used}} on SKM trains, and SKM tickets could be used on PKP Przewozy Regionalne trains on SKM routes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to buy a monthly ticket valid on both companies.|$|E
25|$|For polyhedra with self-crossing faces, {{it may not}} {{be clear}} what it means for {{adjacent}} faces to be consistently coloured, but for these polyhedra <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to determine whether it is orientable or non-orientable by considering a topological cell complex with the same incidences between its vertices, edges, and faces.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Absolute Radio Network has {{restricted}} {{the access to}} the internet radio on their own website to UK listeners only, and removed their apps for iPhone and Android in non-UK app stores. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to access the internet radio outside the UK via the direct link or www.radioplayer.co.uk (which links to the official stream).|$|E
50|$|Hill {{missed the}} pool games, and days out from England's quarterfinal clash with Wales, scans {{on the injured}} {{hamstring}} initially revealed grim prospects, but Hill was encouraged by the team physios that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> to recover {{in time for the}} semi-final.|$|R
50|$|The first closure came in 1917, {{although}} services {{had been}} suspended {{for the most}} part since 1915, to save money and resources for the war effort. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>possible</b> for diverted trains and excursions or other special services to use the line.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} largely {{neglected}} from 1945 onwards. In May 1992, the marble slabs were removed and all references to Bismarck were erased.
