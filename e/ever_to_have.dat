5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Henry has {{received}} many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards; {{in those two}} seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players' Player of the Year titles. Henry is the only player <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times (2003, 2004, 2006), and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions. Henry was voted into the Premier League Overseas Team of the Decade in the 10 Seasons Awards poll in 2003, and in 2004 he was named by football legend Pelé on the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.|$|E
5|$|President Arthur was {{purchased}} in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned American Palestine Line to begin regular service between New York, Naples, and Palestine. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly {{became the first}} ocean liner to fly the Zionist flag at sea and the first ocean liner <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the Los Angeles Steamship Company for Los Angeles–Honolulu service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in Honolulu Harbor in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.|$|E

5|$|The element {{seaborgium}} {{was named}} after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg was still alive, which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in Discover magazine's review {{of the year in}} science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. Seaborgium is the first element <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is oganesson, in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.|$|E

White had actually travelled through France on trains, for family holidays in Italy with his mother as a child.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described {{living species}} of molluscs vary from 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of living molluscs at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the living molluscs. In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described living species at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. Molluscs are second only to arthropods in numbers of living animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 but well ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 living species in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> existed, whether or not preserved, must be many times greater than the number alive today.|$|E
5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 nuclear artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest nuclear artillery, and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its nuclear artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The American Palestine Line was a {{steamship}} company, {{formed in}} 1924 in the U.S., {{for the purpose}} of providing direct passenger service from New York to Palestine. It was reportedly the first steamship company owned and operated by Jews. The company negotiated to purchase three ocean liners from the United States Shipping Board, but it was only able to purchase one, , a former North German Lloyd steamer that operated as Princess Alice before being seized by the United States during World War I. After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when President Arthur sailed on her maiden voyage. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and Yiddish. The company claimed that President Arthur was the first ocean liner to fly the Zionist flag at sea and the first ocean liner <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> female officers.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 NBA {{season with the}} newly-renamed Pelicans {{with a pair of}} double-doubles, posting 20 points and 12 rebounds against Indiana on October 30 and 26 points and 17 rebounds against Orlando on November 1. In the Orlando game, Davis became the {{youngest}} player in franchise history to record 25 points and 15 rebounds in a game. In the third game of the season against Charlotte on November 2, Davis established career-highs with 6 blocks and 6 steals, while helping New Orleans to its first victory. He also became the first player with 6 blocks, 6 steals and 25 points in a game in the last 20 years and only the fifth with at least 5 blocks, 5 steals and 25 points in that period. For the week, Davis earned an NBA Player of the Week nomination, but lost out to Kevin Love. On November 8, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Davis scored a career-high 32 points and tied a career high with 6 blocks, along with 12 rebounds, becoming the youngest player <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks in an NBA game. On November 16, he established a new career high with 8 blocks against Philadelphia. He again had 8 blocks on November 20 against the Utah Jazz. With two 8-block games in the Pelicans' first 11 games of the 2013–14 NBA season, Davis matched the number of 8-block games that Roy Hibbert had at that time in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 NBA seasons combined. No other players had two 8-block games as recently. According to ESPN, while drawing a charging foul from Amar'e Stoudemire, Davis suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand in the first quarter against the New York Knicks on December 1. Yahoo! Sports claims the injury came on an attempted alley oop. On December 3, the Pelicans announced a 4-6 week layoff was expected. The injury came the night before he was supposed to play in his hometown of Chicago, marking {{the second year in a}} row that he was sidelined for his chance to play in his hometown.|$|E
