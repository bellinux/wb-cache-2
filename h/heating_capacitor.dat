Models are developed to predict the experimental system's warming trend and magnetic field decay. The models are validated with a good agreement between simulations based on these models and experimental results. Potential performance advantages of a solid nitrogen cooled permanent HTS (SN 2 /HTS) magnet system over a liquid helium cooled LTS (LHe/LTS) system are explored for various applications. The SN 2 /HTS system design includes a second solid <b>heat</b> <b>capacitor</b> that cools a radiation shield. Recooling of the <b>heat</b> <b>capacitors</b> is performed with a detachable cryocooler. The SN 2 /HTS system offers both improved stability and improved portabilit over an LHe/LTS system design. (cont.) Design codes are constructed to comiiie the SN 2 /HTS system design with a LHe/LTS design for two different applicatiohs. The first application is a general permanent superconducting magnet employing a room temperature bore. The second application is a superconducting mine countermeasures system (SCMCM) that is used to sweep passive magnetic influence mines. The codes predict the important system attributes, namely minimum volume and minimum weight, that should be expected fora given set of design requirements (i. e. field magnitude and bore size, or magnetic dipole moment) and a given set of conductor properties. Their results indicate that present HTS conductor critical current and index are not yet sufficient for producing SN 2 /HTS systems of a size that is comparable to that expected for a LHe/LTS system. However, the conductor properties of Bi 2223 /Ag have been consistently improving over the last decade, and new HTS conductors are expected to be developed in the near future. Therefore, the codes are used to determine the minimum HTS properties that are necessary for constructing a cryocooled SN 2 /HTS system with a size comparable to that expected for a LHe/LTS system. by Benjamin J.

This approach {{is designed to}} replace the existing harmonic limits detailed in IEC 61000. 3. 6 and IEEE 519.

The new limits are low frequency weighed VTHD, high frequency weighed VTHD and the even harmonic components of VTHD. It is proposed to keep the VTHD limit to make {{a total of four}} limits. The four limit types have been selected because they each correspond directly to known critical physical effects on customer equipment and network components that need to be managed.

The effect of harmonics in current due to lagging power factor are the increase in current flow in the capacitors which results in additional <b>heating</b> of the <b>capacitors</b> and reduce its life, increased magnitudes of neutral currents in three phase systems, over-heating in transformers and induction motors.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a measuring system, that allows determining, in analogy to the well-known temperature-programmed desorption measurement of NH 3 (NH 3 -TPD), the acidic properties of zeolites (H-ZSM- 5 with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios from 30 to 1000). This new method, denoted IS-TPD, is based on a combination of NH 3 -TPD with impedance spectroscopy measurements (IS). The IS-TPD new method, with a zeolite sensor, is used for the NH 3 detection instead of the usual one based on gas chromatography, whose functionality is based on the impedance spectroscopic measurement of the proton conductivity. With these developments it was possible to refinement the known mechanistic picture to the adsorption behaviour of NH 3 in H-form-zeolites, which finally led to a new understanding of the functional principle of NH 3 -Sensors based on H-form-zeolites. Both impedance and NH 3 -TPD measurements were accomplished to provide a basis for the methodical development of the IS-TPD. The results of these measurements as well as the detailed picture of a model for the ammonia supported proton transport, which were developed in the so far completely independently regarded methods, provided a consistent picture of the supported proton transport mechanism in zeolites. Hence, the transition of a Grotthus-like, vehicle and hopping mechanisms, respectively, depending on the loading of the sample with NH 3, was derived from the impedance measurements. These are compatible with the interpretation of the NH 3 -TPD profiles. This again forms the basis for the following combination of the two methods {{for the development of a}} new IS-TPD measuring system. Therein, the zeolite samples were coated in form of a thick-film on a directly <b>heated</b> inter-digital <b>capacitor</b> (idc) chip, with which the sample quantity was reduced of approximately 80 mg by the NH 3 -TPD to 0, 5 mg. The outcome of this was a clearly smaller time of contact with same flow rate. This was manifested in a shift of the desorption maxima around 60 °C (for the low temperature (LT) peak) and around 90 °C (for the high temperature (HT) peak) and is to be explained by decreased readsorption. Furthermore it was found that the quantity of desorbed NH 3 became smaller for each Brønsted acid site with decreasingly SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios. This disagreed in first glance to the assumption that the samples were saturated with NH 3. Hence, a new model picture for the functionality of the zeolite sensors was derived, which included the fact that the saturation measured by means of IS corresponds presumanly just to a saturation within surface-near range, which in this work was denoted “electrical saturation”. Accordingly, the samples will already achieve a constant impedance value in ammonia, if the conductivity within near-surface by far exceeds the volume saturation. In this case a further volume saturation obviously does not lead to a further increase of the conductivity. For model verification in the new IS-TPD measuring system the zeolites H-Y and H-beta were investigated, which showed similar behaviour than H-ZSM- 5. Thus the work represents a new experimental basis for the characterisation of Brønsted acid sites in solids...|$|R
