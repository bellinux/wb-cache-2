50|$|An <b>internal</b> <b>sort</b> is any data sorting {{process that}} takes place entirely within the main memory of a computer. This is {{possible}} whenever the data to be sorted is small enough to all {{be held in the}} main memory. For sorting larger datasets, {{it may be necessary to}} hold only a chunk of data in memory at a time, since it won’t all fit. The rest of the data is normally held on some larger, but slower medium, like a hard-disk. Any reading or writing of data to and from this slower media can slow the sortation process considerably. This issue has implications for different sort algorithms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{high level}} of {{subcellular}} compartmentalization is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells. This intricate internal organization was present already in the common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes, and {{the determination of the}} origins and early evolution of the different organelles remains largely elusive. Organellar proteomes are determined through regulated pathways that target proteins produced in the cytosol to their final subcellular destinations. This <b>internal</b> <b>sorting</b> of proteins can vary across different physiological conditions, cell types and lineages. Evolutionary retargeting – the alteration of a subcellular localization of a protein in the course of evolution – has been rampant in eukaryotes and involves any possible combination of organelles. This fact adds another layer of difficulty to the reconstruction of the origins and evolution of organelles. In this review we discuss current themes in relation to the origin and evolution of organellar proteomes. Throughout the text, a special focus is set on the evolution of mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteomes, which are two organelles for which extensive proteomic and evolutionary studies have been performed...|$|R
40|$|Load {{balanced}} parallel radix sort {{solved the}} load imbalance problem present in parallel radix sort. By redistributing {{the keys in}} each round of radix, each processor has exactly {{the same number of}} keys, thereby reducing the overall sorting time. Load balanced radix sort is currently known as the fastest <b>internal</b> <b>sorting</b> method for distributed-memory multiprocessors. However, as the computation time is balanced, the communication time emerges as the bottleneck of the overall sorting performance due to key redistribution. We present in this report a new parallel radix sorter that solves the communication problem of balanced radix sort, called partitioned parallel radix sort. The new method reduces the communication time by eliminating the redistribution steps. The keys are first sorted in a top-down fashion (left-to-right as opposed to right-to-left) by using some most significant bits. Once the keys are localized to each processor, the rest of sorting is confined within each processor, hence eliminating the need for global redistribution of keys. It enables well balanced communication and computation across processors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Burstsort is a cache-oriented sorting {{technique}} {{that uses a}} dynamic trie to efficiently divide large sets of string keys into related subsets small enough to sort in cache. In our original burstsort, string keys sharing a common prefix were managed via a bucket of pointers represented as a list or array; this approach {{was found to be}} up to twice as fast as the previous best string sorts, mostly because of a sharp reduction in out-of-cache references. In this paper we introduce C-burstsort, which copies the unexamined tail of each key to the bucket and discards the original key to improve data locality. On both Intel and PowerPC architectures, and {{on a wide range of}} string types, we show that sorting is typically twice as fast as our original burstsort, and four to five times faster than multikey quicksort and previous radixsorts. A variant that copies both suffixes and record pointers to buckets, CP-burstsort, uses more memory but provides stable sorting. In current computers, where performance is limited by memory access latencies, these new algorithms can dramatically reduce the time needed for <b>internal</b> <b>sorting</b> of large numbers of strings. ...|$|R
40|$|All {{living cells}} require {{specific}} mechanisms that target proteins {{to the cell}} surface. In eukaryotes, {{the first part of}} this process involves recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum of amino-terminal signal sequences and translocation through Sec translocons, whereas subsequent targeting to different surface locations is promoted by <b>internal</b> <b>sorting</b> signals(1). In bacteria, N-terminal signal sequences promote translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, which surrounds the entire cell, but some proteins are nevertheless secreted in one part of the cell by poorly understood mechanisms(2, 3). Here we analyse localized secretion in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, and show that the signal sequences of two surface proteins, M protein and protein F (PrtF), direct secretion to different subcellular regions. The signal sequence of M protein promotes secretion at the division septum, whereas that of PrtF preferentially promotes secretion at the old pole. Our work therefore shows that a signal sequence may contain information that directs the secretion of a protein to one subcellular region, in addition to its classical role in promoting secretion. This finding identifies a new level of complexity in protein translocation and emphasizes the potential of bacterial systems for the analysis of fundamental cell-biological problems(4) ...|$|R
