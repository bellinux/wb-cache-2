5|$|On May 28, 1956, Dale Long of the Pirates {{took what}} one author has stated was the first-ever curtain call <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> after hitting {{home runs in}} eight {{consecutive}} games caused fans to cheer for five minutes.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1890, Young's {{major league}} debut, he pitched a three-hit 8 - 1 {{victory over the}} Chicago Colts. While Young was on the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a {{baseball}} statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pennock was {{regarded}} as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> Mack later called his sale of Pennock to the Red Sox his greatest mistake. Pennock died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1948; later that year, he was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 {{title was}} the sixth <b>in</b> LSU <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> tying Texas {{for the second}} most {{national}} championships <b>in</b> college <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> and Mainieri joined Skip Bertman as the only LSU baseball coaches to win a national championship.|$|R
50|$|During the 1943-1944 season, the Marianao team {{became part}} of three rare occurrences <b>in</b> Cuban <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} three Minor League Baseball clubs named Alacranes de Durango (Durango Scorpions) <b>in</b> Mexican <b>Baseball</b> <b>History.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Merkle play {{remains one}} of the most famous <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> The ball used in the Merkle play was sold at an auction in the 1990s for $27,500, making it one of the four most {{valuable}} baseballs based on purchase price. Evers' role in Merkle's boner cemented his legacy as a smart ballplayer.|$|E
5|$|Though Evers and Tinker {{were part}} {{of one of the most}} {{successful}} double-play combinations <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> the two despised each other off of the field. They went several years without speaking to each other after one argument. When Chance once named Tinker the smartest ballplayer he knew, Evers took it as a personal affront.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Bonds {{left the}} Pirates {{to sign a}} lucrative free agent {{contract}} worth a then-record $43.75 million ($ million today) over six years with the Giants, with whom his father had spent the first seven years of his career, and with whom his godfather Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. The deal {{was at that time}} the largest <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> in terms of both total value and average annual salary.|$|E
5000|$|Rose {{is remembered}} {{as one of}} the best foreign players <b>in</b> Japanese <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> He was 71 at-bats shy of passing Leron Lee for the top spot in career batting average (at least 4000 at-bats are {{required}} to qualify for the record), and hit over [...]300 for seven of his eight seasons in Japan. He also hit three cycles during his career (the most <b>in</b> Japanese <b>baseball</b> <b>history).</b>|$|R
50|$|In his 2010 season, Park {{became the}} first catcher <b>in</b> Korean <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to {{accomplish}} 300 career home runs.|$|R
25|$|Texas' 3-2 {{win in the}} regionals against Boston College went 25 innings, {{marking the}} longest game <b>in</b> NCAA <b>Baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2002, the Red Sox {{asked the}} Yankees for {{permission}} to interview one of George Steinbrenner's assistants, former Yankees general manager Gene Michael, for their vacant general manager position, but Steinbrenner declined their request. Boston Red Sox then hired Theo Epstein, a protégé of Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, as general manager, and at 28 years old, he was the youngest general manager <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league pitcher to pitch four no-hitters and the eighth pitcher to pitch a perfect game <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> Despite his {{comparatively}} short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and Nolan Ryan are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|On July 12 and September 28, 1951, Reynolds threw no-hitters. He was {{the first}} American League pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a season and only the second player to do so <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> after Johnny Vander Meer threw {{consecutive}} no-hitters in 1938. This is still the MLB record for most no-hitters in a single season, a record that Reynolds and Vander Meer share with Virgil Trucks (1952), Nolan Ryan (1973), Roy Halladay (2010), and Max Scherzer (2015).|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{became the}} third player <b>in</b> modern <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to win 20 games and collect 20 {{hits in the}} same season.|$|R

5|$|Since {{moving to}} Progressive Field, the Indians have won nine Central Division titles and have hosted playoff games in ten seasons, {{the most recent}} being in 2017. Progressive Field {{is one of the}} few {{facilities}} <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and games of the World Series in the same season, which occurred in 1997. The Indians have hosted games of the American League Championship Series in five seasons and have advanced to the World Series three times at the park.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees did {{not reach}} the World Series in 1997, but came back {{with one of the}} better seasons <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> in 1998, which culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series. The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card, they did not seriously contend for the {{division}} title. They ultimately lost their ALDS.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm {{was nearly}} 30 {{years old when}} he entered the major leagues, and pitched until he was nearly 50. He retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> After {{retiring}} as a player in 1972 Wilhelm held longtime coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in Sarasota, Florida for many years, and died there in 2002.|$|E
50|$|He {{started his}} career at shortstop but now plays mainly center fielder. Lee is {{considered}} one of the best five-tool players <b>in</b> Korean <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Among {{pitchers}} with {{at least}} 300 career decisions, Ford ranks first with a winning percentage of [...]690, the all-time highest percentage <b>in</b> modern <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|R
50|$|Texas {{defeated}} Boston College 3-2 in 25 innings, which {{broke the}} record of the longest game <b>in</b> NCAA <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> lasting more than seven hours.|$|R
5|$|Winning {{the pennant}} {{once again in}} the 1927 season, Huggins matched Cap Anson's mark of five pennants in seven seasons. That year, the Yankees benefited from the {{development}} of George Pipgras and Wilcy Moore, and set an American League record with 110 regular season victories, winning the AL by 19 games. The Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series. This team became known as Murderers' Row, and is considered the one of the greatest teams <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{began the}} 1991 season with Buffalo. The Pirates {{promoted}} Banister from {{the minor leagues}} on July 23, 1991, when catcher Don Slaught was injured and placed on the disabled list. Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as a pinch hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek {{in the eighth inning}} of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a ball from Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's throw to first base. Banister is one of only 15 batters (excluding pitchers) <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to record a hit in his only major league plate appearance.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, Bell threw three no-hitters while {{pitching}} in the Appalachian League. The only other person {{to do this}} <b>in</b> professional <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> is Tom Drees.|$|R
50|$|Koza had {{a modest}} minor league career, easily forgotten. But he {{will forever be}} remembered as the hero of the longest game <b>in</b> {{professional}} <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bottomley {{also holds}} the single-season {{record for most}} unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley {{is also known as}} the only man to be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was not looking. He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, a {{labor dispute}} {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience would not allow him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. Sunday was named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for their 1998 season, the Yankees replaced general manager Bob Watson with Brian Cashman. The club made many player acquisitions, gaining {{the services of}} third baseman Scott Brosius, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández. The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games—a stretch that concluded with a perfect game pitched by Wells—and by August were 76–27. The 1998 Yankees are considered by some writers {{to be among the}} greatest teams <b>in</b> <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season wins against 48 losses. After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers and Indians, New York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive World Series games for their 24th Series title.|$|E
50|$|On 8 August 1987, Kondoh {{became the}} first player <b>in</b> Japanese <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to throw a no-hitter on debut in a 6-0 victory over the Yomiuri Giants.|$|R
25|$|From 1997 to 2016, the Longhorns {{were led}} by head coach Augie Garrido, the winningest coach <b>in</b> NCAA <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> The team plays its home games at Disch-Falk Field.|$|R
50|$|Dibble {{recorded}} his 500th career strikeout in fewer innings—368—than any other pitcher <b>in</b> modern <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> {{up to that}} point (a record that is currently held by Craig Kimbrel).|$|R
