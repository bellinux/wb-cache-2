40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} federal government of Nigeria’s revenue and <b>expenditure</b> <b>profile</b> for the period 1970 to 2011. With the aid of E-view statistical package- version 7. 0, granger causality tests were carried out on a time series data and to avert the emergence of spurious results, unit root tests were conducted. Other econometric advances of co- integration test and descriptive statistics were deployed to ascertain the order of co- integration {{and the level of}} relationships. Outcome of study provides us with mixed results. First, there is a significant unidirectional causal movement from expenditures to revenues for 4 of the 8 revenue–expenditure pairs. This represents an average level of adherence to the Spend-Revenue hypothesis. Second, a significant bidirectional causal effect exists between 4 of the 8 receipt –expenditure pairs. This also indicates that Revenue – Expenditure relationship at the federal level of government in Nigeria finds prevalence in the fiscal synchronization hypothesis. It was ascertained that, ratio of Nigeria’s oil revenue to her federally collected revenue stood at 81 %., while that of non –oil accounted for 19 % of the total. That is a clear manifestation of her age’s long dependence on crude oil exports. It was equally noted that, the ratio of federal government’s retained revenue to her federally collected revenue stood at about 39 %.

Physical fitness was simultaneously estimated by measuring the work load at which a heart rate of 150 bpm was reached on a standardized exercise test. The median energy expenditure from leisure time activities above the basal metabolic rate was 195 kcal/day; 19 % of these activities were classified as heavy, 37 % as moderate and 43 % as light intensity. The median energy expenditure from job physical activity was 1, 676 kcal/day including basal metabolic rate. The median physical fitness level was 125 W. The leisure time activity score {{was significantly related to}} physical fitness through the light and the heavy intensity subscores. Independently, job physical activity was also significantly related to physical fitness. However, both activity scores accounted for only 2 % of the variance in physical fitness.

The results suggest that demographic changes in Kenya can produce significant effects on the economy. The results also suggest that other factors such as real per capita income, relative price of public to private goods, and external debt obligations influence growth of some government expenditure categories. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{resource}} congruence, {{the degree to}} which the <b>expenditure</b> <b>profile</b> of a focal lines of business (LB) resembles others in its parent's portfolio. Taking each individual LB as a focal point, we examine {{the degree to which}} its resource allocation profile resembles or differs from the profiles of the other businesses in the corporation. We argue that business lines are most efficient and profitable when their resource allocation patterns are highly similar to those of the parent's other businesses, a condition we term resource congruence. The results show that the more closely LB is aligned with its parent's dominant logic-that is, the more congruent it is-the better it performs and the lower its costs relative to competitor LBs in the focal LB's industry. Improved performance and cost are not found when a LB is embedded within similar two-digit standard industrial codes (SICs) as those of other LBs within its parent's portfolio. Even though the SIC classification system has been used as a measure of 'output' relatedness based on similarity of product and customer market characteristics, the results suggest that resource congruence (and resource-based views of the firm) are better predictor of synergies and competitive advantage at the business level than is output relatedness. We also suggest that theories of managerial capability, dominant logic, and monitoring can explain our discovery of spillover and congruence effects that are not explained by economies of scope or resource sharing-based explanations alone.

Other econometric tools of co- integration, Vector Auto Regression technique as well as Granger causality tests were deployed to ascertain the order of co integration {{and the level of}} relationships existing between the dependent and independent variables. Findings of study reveal that while Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) maintained a negative significant relationship with Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in Nigeria at both 1 % and 5 % Alpha levels; Imports and National Savings had a positive significant relationship with GFCF at both the short and long runs.

40|$|Given the {{inadequacy}} of the revenue base {{to cope with the}} targeted level of economic activities due to the ever-increasing demands of the populace, governments of developing countries (including Ghana) often engage in deficit financing. There is now a consensus among interested parties on the need to address the problem effectively. An appraisal of the budgetary process in Ghana shows that annual expenditure proposals are always anchored on projected revenue, thus the accuracy of revenue projection is a necessary condition for devising an appropriate framework for fiscal deficit management in Ghana. This study, therefore, analyses the revenue collection of the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) for the period 2008 - 2012 to devise a reasonably accurate projection for the individual tax components. This will assist in the design of an appropriate <b>expenditure</b> <b>profile</b> as a means of averting any future fiscal deficit in the country. The data were sourced from the Research and Monitoring Department of CEPS and was analyzed using time series analysis. Overall, the study reports a satisfactory level of revenue performance of the three tax heads; Import Duty, Import VAT and Petroleum Tax. The study concludes that the current revenue profile of CEPS is sustainable with prospect for significant improvement in subsequent years. The accuracy measures were employed on the various tax inputs and their mean percentage errors, mean absolute deviation and mean squared deviations were compared to decide on which method will be the pest model for revenue projection. As regard to the results obtained the growth curve model will be the preferred method in forecasting revenues in the Customs Excise and Preventive Service in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: to {{investigate}} total daily energy expenditure in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients during a rehabilitation programme. Design: observational study involving a case and a control group. Subjects: ten COPD patients (six with {{body mass index}} (BMI) 18. 5 kg/m 2) were evaluated for their energy <b>expenditure</b> <b>profile.</b> Four additional healthy age-matched volunteers were also included for methodology evaluation. Interventions: measurements of total daily energy expenditure (TEE), resting energy expenditure (REE) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and energy intake were undertaken by indirect calorimetry and bicarbonate-urea methods and dietary records. Results: REE in COPD patients was not significantly different from that predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation. Before the exercise day the mean TEE was 1508 kcal/day and physical activity level (PAL as calculated by TEE/REE) was 1. 52. On the exercise day the TEE increased to 1568 kcal/day and PAL was 1. 60, but neither of these changes were significant. The energy cost of increased physical activity during rehabilitation exercise was estimated to be 191 kcal/day. No significant change was found in DIT between the two patient groups. However, overall energy balances were found to be negative (- 363 kcal/day). Conclusion: the rehabilitation programme did not cause a significant energy demand in COPD patients. TEE in COPD patients was not greater than in free-living healthy subjects. Patients, who were underweight, did not have a higher TEE than patients with normal weight. This suggested that malnutrition in COPD patients was not due to an increased energy expenditure. On the other hand, a significant negative energy balance due to insufficient energy intake was found in seven out of 10 patients.

This paper aims to profile expenditure patterns before, during and after the economic crisis, and how they affect destinations. Clustering methods and compositional data analysis is used as an appropriate statistical approach to analyze share. Incoming tourists to Spain are segmented by trip budget share using repeated cross-sections of official statistics data (2006 - 2012). One of the main findings is that segments are heterogeneous in their cutting back on expenditure during the economic crisis, and segments increasing in size during the crisis not only spend less but also have the lowest activity share. Furthermore, the paper identifies one of the segments being particularly attractive for destinations in terms both of total expenditure and <b>expenditure</b> <b>profile,</b> with a high activity expenditure share and usually flying with low-cost airlines.

Reinforcing this is our third finding that households are observed to recycle their debts to a substantial extent as evidence by over 27 % of borrowings being used to finance various kinds of borrowings (including MFI and SHG borrowings). The fact that most of these borrowings are taken as small sums from several entities also does not boost the use of these funds towards productive purposes. All this points towards some pressing issues {{that need to be addressed}} in the fast-track growth of the microfinance sector in urban India...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the Minnesota Recreational Trail Users Association (MRTUA) {{embarked}} on an ambitious project to simultaneously identify both the <b>expenditures</b> and <b>profiles</b> of the various trails user groups they represent. Supported by funds administered by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the Carlson Chair for Travel, Tourism and Hospitality, a series of mail questionnaires were developed and administered to their MRTUA represented groups.

40|$|Purpose: An {{examination}} of budget performance’ relationship with fiscal administration in selected countries of sub-saharan Africa is {{the thrust of}} this study. Secondary data from 12 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for the period (2002 - 2016) was sought and analysed. Methodology/methods: Analytical tools deployed for statistical analysis include the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression method, correlation analysis, variance inflation factor (VIF) tests for multicollinearity, and Breusch-Pagan/Cook Weisberg test for heteroskedasticity. 5 % level of test of significance was employed to measure the altitude of statistical association between all variables. Scientific aim: Efforts were made to empirically ascertain by means of available statistics the relationship between budget deficits and fiscal administration in SSA. Findings: Indications from this study implied that countries SSA recorded trends of significant levels of revenue decline and fiscal balances have deteriorated despite the various acclaimed adjustments in the <b>expenditures</b> <b>profiles</b> by governments in the region. Also a significant relationship was found between budget deficit and fiscal administration among countries in SSA. Conclusion: Since budget deficit has remained a recurring decimal in SSA, {{countries in the region}} have resorted to high reliance on borrowed funds to finance the increasing amounts of budget deficits; the consequence being the exposure of countries in SSA to high cost of borrowing...|$|R
