2500|$|Brandeis then {{created a}} [...] "groundswell" [...] in Massachusetts with his {{campaign}} to educate the public. His efforts, {{with the help of}} progressive businessmen, social reformers, and trade unionists, {{led to the creation of}} a new [...] "savings bank life insurance" [...] system. By March 1907, the Savings Bank Insurance League had 70,000 members and Brandeis's face and name now appeared regularly in newspapers. He next persuaded the former governor, a Republican, to become its president, and the current governor stated in his annual message his wish for the legislature to study plans for [...] "cheaper insurance that may rob death of half of its terrors for the worthy poor." [...] Brandeis drafted his own bill, and three months later the [...] "savings bank insurance measure was signed into law."

2500|$|The {{shutting}} of Harvard’s {{gates has}} determined {{the character of}} the protest and the criticism made against it. [...] Whereas Occupy Boston has attracted all kinds of wild characters, the atmosphere at Occupy Harvard is calm and polite. [...] The occupiers are almost invariably well-groomed and articulate. [...] The donation jar took in $130 one day, most of it in $20 bills, and it didn’t disappear when no one had their <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> [...] It is, to use a word popular in Dewey Square, [...] "bougy" [...] (fancy, bourgeois). [...] Many holders of Harvard IDs have a decent shot of joining the 1% if they weren’t already born into it. [...] The occupiers in the Yard say this privilege – earned through hard work in many cases, inherited in others – gives them more obligation to try to fix the system rather than less.|$|E

5000|$|The {{emblem of}} <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a cup or plate {{apparently}} reflects popular devotion {{to her as}} protector of sight, because of her name, Lucia (from the Latin word [...] "lux" [...] which means [...] "light").
