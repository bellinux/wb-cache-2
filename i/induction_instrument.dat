40|$|Geiger, CathleenUsing sea ice {{as a test}} material, this {{dissertation}} explores how electromagnetic responses {{interact with}} low-induction-number composite materials {{as a function of}} instrument footprint size and shape. This research combines several interdisciplinary topics including electrical engineering, materials science in composites, signal processing, and the geophysics of sea ice itself. Specifically, this work explores the development of new best practices that address consistency issues with electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>instruments</b> used on sea ice that employ electrical conductivity as a material property measurement. It does so by using two methods: modeling and measurements. For modeling, a three-dimensional, full-physics, heterogeneous model is used to investigate the electromagnetic field response of several sea ice cases. These cases include changing the material makeup of the sea ice, as well as using different transmitter locations and orientations, with the focus being how instrument footprint varies in each simulated case. For measurements, a co-calibration routine, among two physically different EM <b>induction</b> <b>instruments</b> in terms of instrument footprint, is developed and analyzed. Since these types of instruments are commonly used to measure conductivity in sea ice environments, historical calibration routines are only valid for one instrument at a time. The developed method presented herein provides a statistical solution for the material conductivities of both sea ice and seawater, as well as a solution for the actual ice thickness. These solutions are all based on field measurements made on sea ice during a data collection event held in Barrow, Alaska, in March 2013.

They are truly light instruments, which are able to measure both the apparent electrical conductivity and the apparent magnetic susceptibility of the ground. During a field test on Bahrain Island where the soil has a high clay content and a high salt content, surprisingly high values of in-phase response were obtained at all inter-coil spacings using CMD “Mini-Explorer” (GF Instruments Ltd., Brno, Czech Republic) at 30 kHz in both horizontal coplanar and vertical coplanar configurations, and the horizontal coplanar and vertical coplanar susceptibility variations were in total opposition. This apparent discrepancy is explained by considering the in-phase responses {{to be dominated by}} the relative dielectric permittivity. Using the raw and in-phase vertical coplanar and horizontal coplanar data, it is possible to determine and map the apparent permittivity and apparent magnetic susceptibility. For this case of slated soils with high clay content, the relative permittivity is strong but in agreement with both experimental data at lower frequencies and theoretical models reported in the literature...|$|R

An ice roughness criterion was applied to distinguish between level and rough or ridged ice. Ice thickness modes in the probability density functions (PDFs) derived from drill-hole and IEM measurements agreed well, with modes at 1. 5 - 1. 6 m and 1. 8 - 1. 9 m for all data from level ice. The PDFs derived from SEM measurements show that the primary modes are at 0. 1 and 1. 1 m in 2003 and 0. 7 m in 2004. In 2002 and 2004, significant fractions (between one third and one half) of level ice were found to consist of rafted ice segments. Snow depth varied significantly between years, with 2004 data showing more than half the snow cover on level ice to be at or below 0. 05 m depth in late spring. Ice growth simulations and examination of ice drift and deformation history indicate that impacts of atmospheric and oceanic warming on level ice thickness in the region {{over the past few decades}} are masked to a large extent by variability in snow depth and the contribution of deformation processes. In comparison with submarine sonar ice thickness data from previous decades, a reduction in ice thickness by about 0. 5 to 1 m is in part explained by the replacement of multi-year with first-year ice over the Chukchi and Beaufort shelves...|$|E

The probability density function of total thickness shows that a major peak appears at around 1. 5 m thickness in very close pack ice, presumably corresponding to second-year or deformed ice.

The spatial patterns estimated by the four methods using EM 38 survey datasets of various sample sizes were compared with those generated by each method using the entire sample size. Spatial similarity was evaluated using difference index (DI) between the maps created using various sample sizes (i. e., target maps) and the maps generated with the entire sample size (i. e., the reference map). The results indicated that universal kriging had the best performance owing to the inclusion of residuals and spatial detrending in the kriging system. DI showed that spatial similarity between the target and reference maps of apparent electrical conductivity decreased with the reduction in sample size for each prediction method. Under the same reduction in sample size, the method retaining the most spatial similarity was universal kriging, followed by ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighed, and local polynomial. Approximately, 70 % of total survey data essentially met the need for retaining 90 % details of the reference map for universal kriging and ordinary kriging methods.

These EMI instruments are cost effective and are gaining wider use due to their nondestructive nature, rapid response, and ease of integration into a mobile platform, from which real-time measurements can be made. The EMI-based ECa measurements can be used in conjunction with soil sampling, directed from the ECa surface response (Lesch et al., 1995 a, 1995 b).

40|$|International audienceProximal sensing of soil {{electromagnetic}} properties {{is widely}} used to map spatial land heterogeneity. The mapping instruments use galvanic contact, capacitive coupling or electromagnetic induction. Regardless {{of the type of}} instrument, the geometrical configuration between signal transmitting and receiving elements typically defines the shape of the depth response function. To assess vertical soil profiles, many modern instruments use multiple transmitter-receiver pairs. Alternatively, vertical electrical sounding can be used to measure changes in apparent soil electrical conductivity with depth at a specific location. This paper examines the possibility for the assessment of soil profiles using a dynamic surface galvanic contact resistivity scanning approach, with transmitting and receiving electrodes configured in an equatorial dipole-dipole array. An automated scanner system was developed and tested in agricultural fields with different soil profiles. While operating in the field, the distance between current injecting and measuring pairs of rolling electrodes was varied continuously from 40 to 190 cm.

Thereafter, topsoil and subsoil clay maps were obtained using 23 clay analyses, 77 theta g ((- 1. 5 MPa)) and 4048 ECa measurements and employing standardized ordinary co-kriging. Finally, three potential management zones were identified based on both top and subsoil clay content.

A fitting procedure allowed modelling the conductivities of both subsurface layers, after which the four simultaneous ECa measurements were combined to model the depth of the interfaces between the three layers. The predictions were validated by 16 depth observations along a 150 m transect. A correlation coefficient of 0. 91, with an average error of 023 m, was found between the predicted and measured depths of the clay-sand interface.

Initially, a discussion on supply chain management and sustainability is presented to define the conceptual framework of the research reported and then, models of sustainable supply chain management are examined. These chains aim to achieve simultaneously economic, social and environmental positive impacts in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development, concept that in the business context has the triple bottom line (TBL) model as one of its most important expressions. A case study is, then, presented and it involves two supply chains based on biodiversity assets and encompasses six organizations upstream of the focal company.

One reason is that agricultural water withdrawal accounts for approximately 69 % of freshwater use. In order to improve water use efficiency, knowledge of the spatio-temporal variation in the soil volumetric water content (Ɵ) is essential. Apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by non-invasive electromagnetic (EM) <b>induction</b> <b>instruments</b> is increasingly being used but mostly limited to map average Ɵ.

The thesis introduces the quasi- 2 d inversion of ECa and its application for mapping Ɵ by horizontal slices and vertical crosssections.

In particular, physiological parameters have been rarely included to assess the effectiveness of mood induction procedures. Adopting a dimensional model of mood, we investigated the persistence of four different moods (positive higharousal, positive low-arousal, negative high-arousal, negative lowarousal) induced by four film clips ("sport", "nature", "torture", "slum") during a 9 -minute computer task. We measured subjective mood state (valence and arousal), respiration, skin conductance level (SCL), heart rate, and corrugator activity in 76 subjects. Viewing of the selected film clips induced the expected effects both subjectively and physiologically. Corrugator activity was higher {{at the end of}} the negative clips than the positive clips, and ventilation and SCL were higher for the arousing clips than for the less arousing clips. People who watched the negative clips still reported more negative valence after the computer task and also showed more facial frowning (cf. figure) and lower SCL during the task than people who watched the positive clips. No arousal effects persisted throughout the task. The results suggest that induced changes in the valence dimension of moods are maintained throughout an intervening task and are physiologically best reflected by corrugator activity and SCL, whereas induced changes in the arousal dimension dissipate quickly. The findings of this study enrich, first, our knowledge concerning the relationships between subjective feelings and their physiological substrate. Second, they inform us about the effectiveness of film clips as a mood <b>induction</b> <b>instrument.</b> Third and most important, they suggest that induced changes in valence last longer than induced changes in arousal. High-arousal moods can last for an extended period of time in daily life, but they seem to be short-lived when induced in the lab. An important methodological consequence is that investigating the effect of the arousal dimension of a person's mood induced in the lab may be only possible when the subsequent task is relatively short. Finally, the findings show which physiological measures may be useful in tracking mood states...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Several {{experimental}} time-domain EM <b>induction</b> <b>instruments</b> {{have recently}} been developed for unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection and characterization that use multiple transmitting and receiving coil combinations. One such system, the US Geological Survey’s ALLTEM system, is unique in that it measures both the electrodynamic response (i. e., induced eddy currents) and the magneto-static response (i. e., induced magnetization). This allows target characterization based on the dyadic polarizability of both responses. This paper examines the numerical response of the ALLTEM instrument due to spheroidal, conductive, and permeable UXO targets; and to conductive and optionally viscous magnetic earth. An inversion scheme is presented for spheroidal targets that incorporates fully polarimetric measurements for both magneto-static and electro-dynamic excitations. The performance of the inversion algorithm is evaluated using both simulated and surveyed data. The results are examined {{as a function of}} the number of coil combinations, number of instrument locations, and uncertainty in sensor location and orientation. Results from the specific cases tested (prolate spheroids lying horizontally) show that 1) that collecting data from more than 12 sensor locations or from more than four coil combinations reduced the chances that inversion solutions would be from a local minimum, and 2) that uncertainties in position greater than 3 cm or in orientation greater than 10 degrees cause errors in the estimated spheroid principal lengths of greater than 100 %. Soil conductivities less than 1 S/m contribute negligible interference to the target response, but viscous magnetic soils with permeabilities greater than 10 − 6 MKS units do cause detrimental interference...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{parameters}} of the subsurface such as electrical conductivity are of great interest for non-destructive determination of soil properties (e. g., clay content) or hydrologic state variables (e. g., soil water content). In the past decade, several non-invasive geophysical methods {{have been developed to}} measure subsurface parameters in situ. Among these methods, electromagnetic (EM) induction appears to be the most efficient one that is able to cover large areas in a short time. However, this method currently does not provide absolute values of electrical conductivity due to calibration problems, which hinders a quantitative analysis of the measurement. In this study, we propose to calibrate EM induction measurements with electrical conductivity values measured with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). EM induction measures an apparent electrical conductivity at the surface, which represents a weighted average of the electrical conductivity distribution over a certain depth range, whereas ERT inversion can provide absolute values for local conductivities as a function of depth. EM induction and ERT measurements were collected along a 120 -metre-long transect. To reconstruct the apparent electrical conductivity measured with EM induction, the inverted ERT data were used as input in an electromagnetic forward modelling tool for magnetic dipoles over a horizontally layered medium considering the frequencies and offsets used by the EM <b>induction</b> <b>instruments.</b> Comparison of the calculated and measured apparent electrical conductivities shows very similar trends but a shift in absolute values, which is attributed to system calibration problems. The observed shift can be corrected for by linear regression.

The 0. 43 ha study area {{is located in the}} Blackland Prairies and is a Vertisol known to contain gypsum at the time of site selection. Apparent EC using a model EM 38 electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>instrument</b> was measured at 200 locations in July and November 2003, using a sampling grid with 5 -m spacings. Representative rows and columns were selected from the map of apparent electrical conductivity, and soil cores taken to a depth of 1. 5 m at 29 points. Soil samples were obtained by dividing cores into depth increments of 0 to 25 cm, 25 to 75 cm, and 75 to 150 cm. Laboratory analyses were run for each sample and included moisture content, EC and soluble cations and anions of the saturated paste extract, and percent gypsum. Elevation measurements were made to determine if changes in elevation related to EC measurements. Apparent EC proved to be more successful at detecting soluble salts during the dry sampling period (July) when the effect of soil moisture content was less. For July data, EC and gypsum were significantly correlated in the deepest samples (r 2 = 0. 51 and 0. 15, respectively) to apparent EC. Further, soluble sulfate was significantly correlated to apparent EC (r 2 = 0. 30) at a depth of 25 to 75 cm. Results suggest that the EM 38 can be used successfully to map variability of soil salinity across a field, but although correlation exists between apparent EC and sulfate-bearing materials, it is not sufficiently strong to serve as a good predictor for conditions surrounding lime-induced heave in soil...|$|E
40|$|Emotions are an {{important}} factor in human-computer interaction. One of the challenges in building emotionally intelligent systems is the automatic recognition of affective states. We are developing and evaluating a method for measuring user affect that incorporates psychological, behavioral, and physiological measures. During affective stimulation, breathing parameters, skin conductance level (SCL) and corrugator EMG activity correlate with self-reported levels of valence and arousal. Valence, at the level of subjective experience, summarizes how well one is doing, whereas arousal refers to a sense of energy. A stimulus activates appetitive or defensive motivation (the valence dimension) with some degree of energy mobilization (the arousal dimension). In the laboratory, moods are induced using different procedures. Only few studies have investigated the critical question of how long induced moods actually last. Further, knowledge concerning the persistence of physiological responding, when the stimuli are withdrawn, remains spare. The goals of this study were first, to assess the somato-physiological activity during affective stimulation (film clip viewing) and its relation to valence and arousal, and second, to determine if the response patterns persist, dissipate or otherwise change when the stimuli are withdrawn and the subjects perform a computer task. Seventy-six participants viewed a neutral film clip (an educational program) and completed immediately afterward the task (control condition). Then, they viewed either a positive high-arousal clip (sport scenes), a positive low-arousal clip (takes from landscapes), a negative high-arousal clip (scene depicting captives forced to play Russian roulette) or a negative low-arousal clip (a documentary about a slum in Belgium) and completed the task a second time (experimental condition). The task required participants to shop on an e-commerce website for office supplies. After each clip and each task, the participants rated their current mood. We tested valence and arousal effects during the last 90 s of the films, the first and last 90 s of the task of the experimental condition. Viewing of the selected film clips resulted in increasing defensive and appetitive activation in the expected ways both subjectively and physiologically. Corrugator EMG activity was higher {{at the end of the}} negative clips than the positive clips, and minute ventilation and SCL were higher for the arousing clips than for the less arousing clips. After the approximately 9 -minute task, people who viewed the negative clips still reported more negative valence than those who viewed the positive clips. On the contrary, there were no differences in the arousal ratings. The valence effect in the mood state was paralleled by valence effects in the somato-physiological measures during the task. Increased facial frowning at the end of the negative clips was maintained during the task indicating persistence of defensive activation. SCL was lower for the negative film groups, especially at the end of the task, suggesting that sympathetic activation was lowered in subjects in the negative mood as compared with subjects in the positive mood. The findings of this study have several implications. First, they enrich our knowledge concerning the relationships between subjective feelings and their physiological correlates. Second, they inform us about the effectiveness of film clips as a mood <b>induction</b> <b>instrument.</b> Third, they suggest that induced changes in arousal are quickly overridden by the degree of activation "imposed" by the cognitive task, whereas induced changes in valence are more resistant and thus likely to impact the execution of the task. Finally, they show which physiological measures may be useful in tracking mood states during human-computer interaction (i. e., corrugator EMG activity and SCL). Feedback from these parameters could be used by computers to recognize mood states in the user...|$|E

40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} spatial estimates of field soil salinity aid farmers and researchers {{in understanding the}} development of salinization and identifying areas in the field where special management practices are required to control its speed. Apparent soil electrical conductivity, measured by electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>instruments,</b> has been widely used as an auxiliary variable to estimate spatial distribution of field soil salinity owing to the high-efficient and non-invasive nature. Methods {{used for this purpose}} are mostly a series of kriging-based algorithms. This study adopted stochastic simulation algorithms, sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) and sequential Gaussian co-simulation (SGCS), to generate equiprobable realizations of soil salinity patterns, to evaluate the uncertainty associated with those patterns, and to determine which algorithm is more reliable for the local and spatial uncertainty assessment. Results showed that experimental semivariograms were generally isotropic at all directions with the identical nugget, sill and range parameters despite the limited data in X and Z directions. Nugget contributions comprised from 19. 5 to 40. 1 % of model sill values at the horizontal orientation, which negligibly ranged from 2. 1 to 6. 0 % at the vertical orientation. The spatial patterns of soil salinity generated by SGS and SGCS algorithms showed consistency with the actual values. It was found that the distribution of soil salinity was generally normal and there existed the probability of secondary salinization across the spatial domain. The estimation precision of SGS algorithm was superior to that of SGCS algorithm. In addition, accuracy plots and standard deviation maps both indicated that SGS approach performed better in terms of modelling local uncertainty and propagating the spatial uncertainty. Thus, the SGS method was suitable for the spatial estimation of the soil property, distribution type and data arrangement in our study. We concluded that the SGS algorithm with data conversion (converting EM measurements at unsampled sites to soil salinity values) prior to simulation modeled the uncertainty better than the SGCS algorithm (soil salinity as primary variate and EM measurements as covariate) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLow <b>induction</b> number EMI <b>instruments</b> {{are able}} to {{simultaneously}} measure a soil's apparent magnetic susceptibility and electrical conductivity. This family of dual measurement instruments is highly useful {{for the analysis of}} soils and archeological sites. However, the electromagnetic properties of soils are found to vary over considerably different ranges: whereas their electrical conductivity varies from ≤ 0. 1 to ≥ 100 mS/m, their relative magnetic permeability remains within a very small range, between 1. 0001 and 1. 01 SI. Consequently, although apparent conductivity measurements need to be inverted using non-linear processes, the variations of the apparent magnetic susceptibility can be approximated through the use of linear processes, {{as in the case of}} the magnetic prospection technique...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{the past}} forty years {{electromagnetic}} prospecting instruments {{have played a}} growing role in the mapping of soil EM properties in the very low-frequency (VLF) range for a large variety of applications and they {{are now beginning to}} be applied in the medium-frequency range. Measurement interpretations, however, necessitate expressing the results in terms of physical properties. This step allows not only comparisons and joint interpretation with data generated by different electromagnetic <b>induction</b> (EMI) <b>instruments</b> but also with other types of field measurements e. g., vertical electrical sounding (VES) or electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) or laboratory tests on samples. The calibration process here proposed is based on comparisons between the instrument responses and: (1) an exact 1 D multi-layer analytical modelling that takes the three EM properties into account, i. e., the electrical conductivity, the complex magnetic susceptibility and the complex dielectric permittivity when the instrument is elevated above a layered ground; (2) the response to purely conductive metallic spheres, which only depends on the diameter of the spheres. It is applied to two instrument prototypes: one in the VLF frequency range and the other in the medium-frequency (MF) range...|$|R
40|$|Owing to conducive {{economic}} conditions and a suitable climate Andalucía {{has become the}} largest olive oil producing area in the world. However, extensive rill and severe gully erosion are threatening sustainability. To conserve the soil, land management strategies have to be implemented that minimize erosion and enhance {{at the same time}} rain water conservation to safeguard crop yields. An indicator of soil quality and the success of soil management will be organic matter content (OM—%). There is therefore a need to measure, map, manage and monitor its content. Proximal sensors such as electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>instruments</b> may be useful in mapping this because the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa—mS/m) is related to clay, salinity and mineralogy, which influence organic matter content. In this research we collect data from a single frequency and multiple-coil DUALEM- 21 along a transect and across an olive grove in the “La Manga” catchment in Setenil de las Bodegas in the southwest of Spain. We inverted the data using EM 4 Soil software and developed calibrations between estimates of true electrical conductivity (σ—mS/m) with depth against measured OM % using the quasi- 2 d algorithm along a single transect. We did this by using a fitted linear regression model and by varying the forward modelling algorithm (cumulative function and full solution), inversion algorithm (S 1 and S 2) and damping factor (λ) to determine a suitable electromagnetic conductivity image for 2 -d and 3 -d mapping. Our results along a detailed transect showed promise and suggest differences in OM content could be mapped down a topographic sequence. We applied this calibration to a quasi- 3 d model across the entire olive grove and to predict OM at various depths. The results across the olive grove were compromised in some locations and within geomorphological complex locations in the landscape, such as near the erosion gully where frequent erosion and deposition occurs. We conclude that better results may have been achieved if more detailed ECa data collection was undertaken in and around the gully and also across a larger extent.

40|$|Electromagnetic. <b>induction</b> (EM) <b>instruments</b> {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} sea-ice thickness because of the large contrast in the conductivities of sea ice and sea water, and are currently used in investigations of sea-ice thickness. In this study we analyze several snow, ice and sea-water samples and attempt to derive an appropriate formula to transform the apparent conductivity obtained from EM measurements to the total thickness of snow and ice for all regions and seasons. This was done to simplify the EM tuning procedure. Surface EM measurement transects with the instrument at varying heights above the ice were made in the Chukchi Sea, off East Antarctica, in the Sea of Okhotsk and in Saroma-ko (lagoon). A standardized transformation formula based on a one-dimensional multi-layer model was developed that also considers the effects of water-filled gaps between deformed ice, a saline snow slush layer, and the increase in the footprint size caused by increasing the instrument height. The overall average error in ice thickness determined with the standardized transform was < 7 %, and the regional average errors were 2. 2 % for the Arctic, 7. 0 % for the Antarctic, 6. 5 % for the Sea of Okhotsk and 4. 4 % for Saroma-ko...|$|R
40|$|As {{highlighted}} by many authors, classical or geophysical techniques for measuring soil moisture such as destructive soil sampling, neutron probes or Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) have some major drawbacks. Among other things, they provide point scale information, are often intrusive and time-consuming. ElectroMagnetic <b>Induction</b> (EMI) <b>instruments</b> are {{often cited as}} a promising alternative hydrogeophysical methods providing more efficiently soil moisture measurements ranging from hillslope to catchment scale. The overall objective of our research project is to investigate whether a combination of geophysical techniques at various scales {{can be used to}} study the impact of land use change on temporal and spatial variations of soil moisture and soil properties. In our work, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) patterns are obtained with an EM multiconfiguration system. Depth profiles of ECa were subsequently inferred through a calibration-inversion procedure based on TDR data. The obtained spatial patterns of these profiles were linked to soil profile and soil water content distributions. Two catchments with contrasting land use (agriculture vs. natural forest) were selected in a subtropical region in the south of Brazil. On selected slopes within the catchments, combined EMI and TDR measurements were carried out simultaneously, under different atmospheric and soil moisture conditions. Ground-truth data for soil properties were obtained through soil sampling and auger profiles. The comparison of these data provided information about the potential of the EMI technique to deliver qualitative and quantitative information about the variability of soil moisture and soil properties...|$|R
40|$|Apparent soil {{electrical}} conductivity (ECa) is typically mapped to define soil spatial variability within an agricultural field. Knowledge of the vertical variability of ECa is desired {{to define the}} site‐specific behavior of the soil profile. A pneumatic angular scanning system (PASS) was developed to sense horizontal and vertical changes of ECa on‐the‐go with an electromagnetic <b>induction</b> (EMI) <b>instrument</b> using an angular scanning method. This sensor system consists of a sled with a rotating mechanism, an EMI sensor, an inclinometer, and a pneumatic actuator. The system was evaluated at the University of Nebraska‐Lincoln Agricultural Research and Development Center (ARDC) near Mead, Nebraska. The PASS was towed by an all‐terrain vehicle (ATV) and operated from a field computer with specially designed data acquisition software. Rotation of the instrument allowed continuous transition between horizontal and vertical modes of operation. Nine discrete field locations with different soil conditions were used to compare PASS estimates with measurements obtained using a manual ECa probe. With the assumption of two fixed‐depth layers, the R 2 value was 0. 91 for the linear regression between corresponding measured and predicted ECa values, and R 2 was 0. 54 for {{the difference between the}} ECa of deep and shallow soil. Unfortunately, solving the system of linear equations for a more complex model of a soil profile required inversion of an ill‐conditioned (close to singularity) matrix, which was not feasible without regularization and an inversion procedure with non‐negative constraints to be pursued in the future...|$|R
40|$|Under the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) program, sea-ice {{thickness}} {{has been}} routinely monitored off Lützow–Holm Bay (East Antarctica) {{during the summer}} (mid-December to early January) since 2000 / 01, using an electromagnetic <b>induction</b> (EM) <b>instrument</b> onboard the icebreaker Shirase. Analysis of these data over a 10 -year period, combined with visual observations using a simplified form of the ASPeCt (Antarctic Sea ice Processes and Climate) protocol, suggests a strong interannual variability in sea-ice thickness in this region. For the repeat pack-ice observation area, where the sea-ice thickness averaged over the nine seasons is ∼ 1. 9 m, mean thicknesses of observed sea-ice in 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12 are exceptionally large, at ∼ 3. 3 and ∼ 5. 8 m, respectively. This result is strongly related to regional patterns of sea ice dynamics. Ice convergence caused by anomalous northerly winds was particularly high in 2011 / 12, suggesting that the extremely thick ice observed in that season resulted largely from sea-ice deformation processes (including pressure ridging). Longer-term analysis of data from the past 34 years confirms that sea-ice conditions and thickness off Lützow–Holm Bay in summer are determined mainly by the large-scale pattern of atmospheric pressure in December. リュツォ・ホルム湾沖流氷域では、日本南極地域観測隊による夏期の海氷観測が 2000 / 01 年から行われている。 10 年間のEM観測と目視観測の結果を基に、この海域の海氷厚の経年変動を明らかにし、その要因を議論した。流氷域の中でも観測が集中していた海域においては、 9 年間の平均全氷厚が~ 1. 9 mであったのに対して、 2010 / 11 年と 2011 / 12 年はそれぞれ~ 3. 3 、~ 5. 8 mと例外的に厚く、大きな経年変動をしていたことが分かった。 2011 / 12 年は北風が卓越しており、海氷が北風によって岸や定着氷縁へ押し付けられ激しい海氷変形が起こり分厚い氷盤が形成されたと考えられる。過去 34 年間の大気再解析データから、リュツォ・ホルム湾沖の夏期の海氷状況や厚さは 12 月の気圧配置から大きな影響を受けていることも示した...|$|R
