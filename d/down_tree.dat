5|$|October 8, 1996- The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Josephine cause 45mph (72km/h) wind gusts and light rainfall {{of up to}} 2.37inches (60mm) in Dover. The rainfall causes river flooding, while the wind knocks <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> limbs.|$|E
5|$|The storm drifted until September9, when it {{accelerated}} while passing east of Bermuda. Relatively {{strong winds}} {{on the island}} caused hundreds of power outages and knocked <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> branches, electrical poles, and other debris. Slight re-intensification took place, with Leslie becoming a hurricane again, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone near Newfoundland on September11. In Atlantic Canada, the storm brought heavy rainfall to both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In the latter, localized flooding occurred, especially in the western portions of the province. Also in Newfoundland, strong winds from Leslie ripped off roofs, destroyed trees, and left 45,000homes without power. Additionally, a partially built house was destroyed and several incomplete homes were damaged in Pouch Cove. Overall, Hurricane Leslie caused $10.1million (2012USD) in damage and no fatalities.|$|E

500|$|As the {{remnants}} of Olivia moved through Australia, they dropped heavy rainfall and brought gusty winds to South Australia. Cape Willoughby recorded gusts of [...] on 12April, strong enough to knock <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> branches on nearby Kangaroo Island. At Port Lincoln, sediment stirred up by Olivia's remnants killed 60,000farmed tuna, worth about A$60million (US$47.5million). The fish were in cages and died due to abnormally high oxygen levels in the water, caused by Olivia's high winds and rough waves. The remnants of Olivia later brought rainfall to the states of Victoria and Tasmania.|$|E
500|$|In New Jersey, {{strong winds}} gusted up to , {{bringing}} <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> limbs that killed two people. A total of 93,816 residences were also left without {{power at the}} height of the storm. High winds on the backside of the storm brought down a power line that sparked a small fire in Galloway Township, burning a total of [...] A total of 8,486 Connecticut residences were left without power and one boy was injured after high winds damaged numerous power lines and tree limbs. In Massachusetts, gusts up to [...] brought down several trees and cut power to residences in Middleborough, Boston, Brookline and Hingham. The Western Massachusetts Electric Company reported that at least 360 residences lost power during the storm. Moderate snow fell across portions of The Berkshires late on February12 as the storm system began entering the Atlantic Ocean, while isolated areas received upwards of [...]|$|E
500|$|Winds {{across the}} rest of the state were moderate, gusting to around [...] at Slidell on the northeastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, so damage outside of Washington Parish was sporadic. Throughout the state, at least 40,000 {{electric}} customers lost power. Located southwest of the storm's core, New Orleans escaped with little damage and relatively benign weather conditions; still, the hurricane triggered minor flooding and brought <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> limbs around the city. Levees along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain were able to contain the lake's large waves, despite initial fears to the contrary. Still, the adverse conditions forced the temporary closure of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The storm led to the deaths of two individuals in the state: one due to a drowning in St. Tammany Parish and another in a traffic accident attributed to the weather. Insured and uninsured damages were worth near $17 million combined, with an additional $500,000 in agricultural losses.|$|E

2500|$|Moths usually {{emerge from}} pupae in July, {{but it can}} vary with {{population}} density and climate. The brown male gypsy moth emerges first, usually {{one or two days}} before the females do. The males fly in rapid zigzag patterns, but are capable of direct flight. Like most moths, the males are typically nocturnal, but can sometimes be seen flying during the day as well. The males fly up and <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> trunks, or other vertical objects in search of females. When heavy, black-and-white egg-laden females emerge, emitting a pheromone that attracts the males. The female has a small gland near the tip of the abdomen which releases the pheromone, with a pumping motion, termed [...] "calling". It can attract males from long distances, tracking the scent through its erratic flight pattern.|$|E
2500|$|The {{iconography}} {{also contains}} two torch-bearing twins (Cautes and Cautopates) framing the bull-slaying image—one holding a torch pointing {{up and the}} other a torch pointing down. These torch-bearers are sometimes depicted with one of them (torch up) holding or associated with a Bull and a tree with leaves, and the other (torch down) holding or associated with a Scorpion and a tree with fruit. Ulansey interprets these torch-bearers as representing the spring equinox (torch up, tree with leaves, Bull) and the autumm equinox (torch <b>down,</b> <b>tree</b> with fruit, Scorpion) in Taurus and Scorpius respectively, which is where the equinoxes were located during the preceding [...] "Age of Taurus" [...] symbolized in the tauroctony as a whole. Thus Ulansey concludes that Mithraic iconography was an [...] "astronomical code" [...] whose secret was the existence of a new cosmic divinity, unknown to those outside the cult, whose fundamental attribute was his ability to shift the structure of the entire cosmos and thereby to control the astrological forces believed at that time to determine human existence, thus giving him the power to grant his devotees success during life and salvation after death (i.e., a safe journey through the planetary spheres and a subsequent immortal existence {{in the realm of the}} stars).|$|E

2500|$|Heavy {{rain from}} the {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Bill affected Ohio on June20. Portions of southwestern Ohio, already suffering {{from the effects of}} protracted rain over the past several days and damage from an intense storm that caused downed trees, power outages and road closures due to heavy water, remained under a flood warning as rain continued to fall. Over [...] of precipitation fell in Athens, which inundated streets and caused water damage at a restaurant. Central Ohio also experienced flooding due to nearly [...] of rain in the Columbus area. Many streets and underpass in the city were inundated, forcing firefighters and police to rescue people from their cars. Several basements, homes, and a swim club building were flooded. On one street, people clung to signs to prevent themselves from being washed away. Organizers of the Columbus Pride festival ended the event nearly seven hours early. The Scioto River, the Big Darby Creek, and the Raccoon Creek overflowed in Licking and Pickaway counties. Additionally, residents of Logan County were evacuated as the Great Miami River and Indian Lake swelled. After the storm, a state of emergency was declared in the county and the Red Cross distributed flood cleanup kits. A tornado spawned in Bartlett knocked <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> limbs, damaged the roof of a home, and carried a boat through the neighborhood.|$|E
60|$|On {{the fourth}} day a happy thought came to the Ork. They had all been racking their brains for a {{possible}} way to leave the island, and discussing this or that method, without finding a plan that was practical. Cap'n Bill had said {{he could make a}} raft of the trees, big enough to float them all, but he had no tools except those two pocketknives and {{it was not possible to}} chop <b>down</b> <b>tree</b> with such small blades.|$|E
60|$|This {{so frightened}} them, that, besides the howling noise they {{made in the}} tree, our men heard a strange clutter {{of them in the}} body of the tree, from whence they {{concluded}} they had made the tree hollow, and were got to hide themselves there. Now, had this been the case, they were secure enough from our men, for it was impossible any of our men could get up the tree on the outside, there being no branches to climb by; and, to shoot at the tree, that they tried several times to no purpose, for the tree was so thick that no shot would enter it. They made no doubt, however, but that they had their enemies in a trap, and that a small siege would either bring them <b>down,</b> <b>tree</b> and all, or starve them out; so they resolved to keep their post, and send to us for help. Accordingly, two of them came away to us for more hands, and particularly desired that some of our carpenters might come with tools, to help to cut down the tree, or at least to cut down other wood and set fire to it; and that, they concluded, would not fail to bring them out.|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{communities}} in the southeast United States have regularly experienced severe hurricane impacts. To better facilitate recovery efforts in these communities following natural disasters, {{state and federal agencies}} must respond quickly with information regarding the extent and severity of hurricane damage and the amount of tree debris volume. A tool was developed to detect <b>downed</b> <b>trees</b> and debris volume to better aid disaster response efforts and tree debris removal. The tool estimates <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> debris volume in hurricane affected urban areas using a Leica Airborne Digital Sensor (ADS 40) and very high resolution digital images. The tool employs a Sobel edge detection algorithm combined with spectral information based on color filtering using 15 different statistical combinations of spectral bands. The algorithm identified <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> edges based on contrasts between tree stems, grass, and asphalt and color filtering was then used to establish threshold values. Colors outside these threshold values were replaced and excluded from the detection processes. Results were overlaid and an “edge line” was placed where lines or edges from longer consecutive segments and color values within the threshold were met. Where two lines were paired within a very short distance in the scene a polygon was drawn automatically and, in doing so, <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> stems were detected. Tree stem diameter–volume bulking factors were used to estimate post-hurricane tree debris volumes. Images following Hurricane Ivan in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 were used to assess the error of the tool by comparing <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> counts and subsequent debris volume estimates with post-hurricane photo-interpreted <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> counts and actual field measured estimates of <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> debris volume. The errors {{associated with the use of}} the tool and potential applications are also presented. JRC. H. 5 -Land Resources Managemen...|$|R
