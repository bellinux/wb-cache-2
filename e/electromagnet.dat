5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an <b>electromagnet</b> attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an <b>electromagnet</b> over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E

50|$|Bitter <b>electromagnets</b> {{are used}} where {{extremely}} strong fields are required. The iron cores used in conventional <b>electromagnets</b> saturate and cease {{to provide any}} advantage at fields above a few teslas, so iron core <b>electromagnets</b> are limited to fields of about 2 teslas. Superconducting <b>electromagnets</b> can produce stronger magnetic fields but are limited to fields of 10 to 20 teslas, due to flux creep, though theoretical limits are higher. For stronger fields resistive solenoid <b>electromagnets</b> of the Bitter design are used. Their disadvantage is that they require very high drive currents, and dissipate large quantities of heat.|$|R

25|$|A {{multiple}} coil magnet is an <b>electromagnet</b> {{that has}} several coils of wire connected in parallel. This increases the total electric current in the <b>electromagnet</b> and therefore generates a stronger magnetic field. It {{was invented by}} American scientist Joseph Henry in 1831.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of an <b>electromagnet</b> over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an <b>electromagnet</b> requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper <b>electromagnet.</b> The secondary winding has connections on the upper <b>electromagnet</b> that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower <b>electromagnet.</b> Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a permanent}} magnet flux-biased magnetic actuator with flux feedback for adjustably suspending an element on a single axis. The magnetic actuator includes a pair of opposing <b>electromagnets</b> and provides bi-directional forces along the single axis to the suspended element.

25|$|Henry {{excelled at}} his studies (so much so, {{that he would}} often help his {{teachers}} teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He {{was the first to}} coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core {{in order to make a}} more powerful <b>electromagnet,</b> improving on William Sturgeon's <b>electromagnet</b> which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest <b>electromagnet</b> at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an <b>electromagnet</b> using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a physics-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm, known as Electromagnetic Field Optimization (EFO). The proposed algorithm {{is inspired by}} the behavior of <b>electromagnets</b> with different polarities and takes advantage of a nature-inspired ratio, known as the golden ratio. In EFO, a possible solution is an electromagnetic particle made of <b>electromagnets,</b> {{and the number of}} <b>electromagnets</b> is determined by the number of variables of the optimization problem. EFO is a population-based algorithm in which the population is divided into three fields (positive, negative, and neutral); attraction-repulsion forces among <b>electromagnets</b> of these three fields lead particles toward global minima. The golden ratio determines the ratio between attraction and repulsion forces to help particles converge quickly and effectively. The experimental results on 30 high dimensional CEC 2014 benchmarks reflect the superiority of EFO in terms of accuracy and convergence speed over other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms...|$|R
