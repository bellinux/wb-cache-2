5|$|Cynesige (died 22 December 1060) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of York between 1051 and 1060. Prior to his {{appointment}} to York, {{he was a}} royal clerk and perhaps a monk at Peterborough. As archbishop, he built and adorned his cathedral {{as well as other}} churches, and was active in consecrating bishops. After his death in 1060, the bequests he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> a monastery were confiscated by the queen.|$|E

5|$|The Lines of Communication Program, which {{represents}} the most significant contribution that the 18th Engineer Brigade <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the economic growth of Vietnam, consisted of about 1,500 kilometers of road upgrade from 1967 to 1972. After a slow start {{in the beginning of}} this work, the Brigade finished some 560 kilometers of highway reconstruction, and improvement in 1970 and another 450 kilometers were scheduled for completion in 1971 by Brigade units.|$|E

Devadasu {{breathes}} his last {{in front of her}} house. Parvati rushes to see him, but the door is closed by her family and she collapses.|$|E

5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, Treloar {{was praised}} for the {{personal}} sacrifices he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> establish the AWM, {{as well as}} for the high quality of the Memorial. The Memorial's storage and display annex at Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory, was subsequently named in Treloar's honour and a commemorative plaque was located outside the AWM's archival research centre until 1985. In 1956 the street behind the Memorial's main building was named Treloar Crescent. In addition, the AWM named a grant it provided to researchers the 'John Treloar Grant'.|$|E

5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, {{and then up}} to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, {{was not interested in}} taking up the hatchet. Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E
5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|Governance of the Jerseys {{also created}} {{problems}} for Andros. James had awarded the territory {{west of the}} Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group, and {{the exact nature of}} the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed, in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Berkeley and Carteret.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 7th century, the West Saxons {{occupied}} {{an area in}} the west of southern England, though the exact boundaries are difficult to define. To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia, {{in what is now}} Devon and Cornwall. To the north were the Mercians, whose king, Wulfhere, had dominated southern England during his reign. In 674 he was succeeded by his brother, Æthelred, who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex, though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere <b>had</b> <b>made.</b> <b>To</b> the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons, in what is now Sussex; and to the east were the East Saxons, who controlled London.|$|E
5|$|Lofton {{decided to}} try out for the Wildcats {{baseball}} team during his junior year. He played in just five baseball games and recorded only one official at-bat while at Arizona but his speed and potential were recognized by baseball scouts, including the Houston Astros' Clark Crist. The Astros later selected Lofton in the 17th round of the 1988 MLB draft. He played minor league baseball during the summer while completing his basketball eligibility at Arizona. The Astros organization asked Lofton to play minor league baseball in the Florida Instructional League but Lofton declined, citing a promise he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> his grandmother to obtain his degree.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March 2012, he {{was once}} again {{detained}} and interrogated over a recent visit he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Kachin State, where local ethnic minority groups were engaged in guerrilla warfare against the government. He was released two days later. The following month, {{he was forced to}} formally cease to be a monk after several monasteries refused him membership, which he said was due to their fear of government reprisals if they were to allow him to enter. He then returned to his birth name of Nyi Nyi Lwin.|$|E

She fought the roll-back of policies removing the gains women <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> enter the work force during World War II and worked to establish feminism as an academic field of study.

5|$|Pre-production for Ruma Maida {{took three}} months. The {{characters}} were written without any particular actors in mind. Atiqah Hasiholan, {{who had previously}} starred in the Academy Award-submitted Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President, 2009), was cast as Maida. Yama Carlos, who played Sakera, was initially cast for another role but received the leading male role after a last-minute switch. The actor cast as Muchlisin, Frans Tumbuan, {{was the only one}} auditioned as Soeriaatmadja thought the role was perfect for him. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that, including extras, Ruma Maida had the largest cast of any film he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> that point.|$|E
5|$|The final treaty also voided Spanish {{guarantees}} of military support that colonial officials <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Native Americans in the disputed regions, greatly weakening those communities’ ability to resist encroachment upon their lands. The treaty represented {{a major victory}} for Washington administration, and placated many of the critics of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, by making the frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. The region that Spain relinquished its claim to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E
