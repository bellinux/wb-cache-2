25|$|In this method, {{similar to}} the probe-and-drogue method but more complicated, the tanker {{aircraft}} released a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> from its wingtip. An aircraft, flying beside it, had to catch the hose with a special lock under its wingtip. After the hose was locked, and the connection was established, the fuel was pumped. It was used on {{a small number of}} Soviet Tu-4 and Tu-16 only (the tanker variant was Tu-16Z).|$|E
25|$|A modern mask {{typically}} {{is constructed}} of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps {{which may be}} tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} rebreather itself. The rebreather {{must have}} at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder; many have two and some have more cylinders. Due to the lower gas {{consumption}} of rebreathers, these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open-circuit dives. Rebreathers may use internal cylinders, or may also be supplied from [...] "off-board" [...] cylinders, which are not directly plumbed into the rebreather, but connected to it by a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> and coupling and usually carried side slung.|$|E

The car's cooling system included Crossflow radiator low-mounted in nose, {{connected to power}} unit by allow pipes and <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses.</b> The oil cooling system included Crossflow alloy oil cooler connected to engine via alloy pipes and high pressure <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses.</b> The fuel system had a 12 gallon fuel cells on each side, in a side panel with twin filters and breathers.|$|R
50|$|Braided {{stainless}} steel brake lines (also known as braided {{stainless steel}} brake <b>hoses)</b> are <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> fitted to a hydraulic brake system. The intent of braided stainless steel brake lines {{is to improve}} brake system effectiveness and longevity as compared to an equivalent system fitted with <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>hoses</b> through near-elimination of hose expansion.|$|R
2500|$|The probe-and-drogue {{refueling}} method {{employs a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> that trails from the tanker aircraft. [...] The drogue (or para-drogue), sometimes called a basket, is a fitting resembling a shuttlecock, attached at its narrow end (like the [...] "cork" [...] nose of a shuttlecock) with a valve to a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> [...] The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight {{and provides a}} funnel to aid insertion of the receiver aircraft probe into the hose. [...] The hose connects to a Hose Drum Unit (HDU). [...] When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU. The receiver has a probe, which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft's nose or fuselage to make the connection. [...] Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high speed aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} hex head or square head and is driven using an allen key or wrench. A manual knockout punch can handle holes from [...] The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to [...] in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems {{but it is the}} easiest to use and can make holes up to [...] in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a new {{approach}} to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. [...] This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible. [...] Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot's body. [...] These inventions are known as [...] "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or [...] pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.|$|E

60|$|Hydraulic mining on the Gold Coast, {{owing to}} the {{conformation}} of the country, will be a far simpler and less expensive process than in California or Australia. In the latter water has first to be bought, and then to be brought in pipes, flumes, leats, or races from a considerable distance, sometimes extending over forty miles. It is necessary to make a reservoir for a fall. The water then rushes through the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose,</b> and is directed by a nozzle against {{the face of the}} excavation. The action is that of a fireman playing upon a burning house. Most works on mining insist upon those reservoirs, and never seem to think of washing from below by the force-pump.|$|E
50|$|An {{resistance}} temperature detector (RTD) is used to acquire temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A pressure transducer is used to account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the rigidity of the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Changes in rigidity affect {{the way that the}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> deflects. The <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more deflection in the flexible rubber hose. The <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> must be repeatable, accurate, and precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model applicable to large strain analysis of composite {{materials such as}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses.</b> A three-dimensional constitutive law, which uses the concept of convected coordinate frame, is developed for materials presenting non linear elastic and linear orthotropic behaviors in the large deformation field. The proposed model is implemented in a finite element home code and the formulation of both the hyperelastic and the orthotropic constitutive laws is presented. Finally, in order to validate our numerical results, an experimental device is developed to exhibit the mechanical behavior of straight <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> {{in the case of}} elementary tests. The model is then compared to these experimental results...|$|R

25|$|Gas-tight {{connections}} between the <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> and rigid fittings are made by using crimped hose clips or ferrules, {{often referred to as}} 'O' clips, over barbed spigots.

40|$|Single and {{two-phase}} {{heat transport}} {{systems for the}} thermal control of large space facilities require fluid lines that traverse joints and either rotate or move in some other manner. <b>Flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> are being considered as one means of traversing these joints. To test the resilience of <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> to bending stress, a test assembly was constructed {{to determine the number}} of flexing cycles the hoses could withstand before losing their ability to maintain a constant pressure. Corrugated metal hoses and Teflon hoses were tested at different pressures with nitrogen gas. The metal hoses had lives ranging from 30, 000 to 100, 000 flexing cycles. But, even after 400, 000 cycles, the Teflon hoses remained essentially intact, though some leakage in the convoluted Teflon is noted...|$|R

50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> or tubing to pipes, {{typically}} has a male-threaded end which {{mates with}} female threads.

Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|E
