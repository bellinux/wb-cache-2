5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the <b>hindbrain</b> (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The <b>hindbrain</b> also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the <b>hindbrain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>hindbrain</b> (or metencephalon) is {{particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest {{part of the}} brain. Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.|$|E
5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in <b>hindbrain</b> herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and <b>hindbrain.</b> At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the <b>hindbrain</b> splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the <b>hindbrain,</b> including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and <b>hindbrain</b> (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and <b>hindbrain.</b> Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The <b>hindbrain</b> and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and <b>hindbrain.</b> Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|Segmentation is a {{basic process}} of {{embryogenesis}} occurring in most invertebrates and all vertebrates by which the body is initially divided into functional units. In the segmented regions of the embryo, cells begin to present biochemical and morphological boundaries at which cell behavior is drastically different – vital for future differentiation and function. In the <b>hindbrain,</b> segmentation is a precisely defined process. In the paraxial mesoderm, however, development is a dynamic and adaptive process that adjusts according to posterior body growth. Various Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in these regions, and, through functional analysis, it has been determined that Eph signaling is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of these segment boundaries. Similar studies conducted in zebrafish have shown similar segmenting processes within the somites containing a striped expression pattern of Eph receptors and their ligands, which is vital to proper segmentation - the disruption of expression resulting in misplaced or even absent boundaries.|$|E
500|$|Like in Jainosaurus {{and most}} other non-avian archosaurs, the <b>hindbrain</b> and {{midbrain}} of A. sp. is relatively poorly preserved in the endocast. In contrast with TMM 40435 {{and a few other}} taxa such as cf. Cetiosaurus oxoniensis and Giraffatitan, no characteristic [...] "nub" [...] of the cerebellum can be seen. As in TMM 40435 and many other archosaurs, the back of the brain is especially narrow in A. sp.|$|E
500|$|The {{cerebellum}} (Latin for [...] "little brain") is a {{major feature}} of the <b>hindbrain</b> of all vertebrates. [...] Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum {{plays an important role}} in motor control, and it may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans.|$|E
500|$|The Orange County Registers {{film critic}} Michael Sragow gave the film grade [...] "A" [...] and commented on three lead characters, [...] "A trio of terrific {{performers}} imbues a riveting AIDS drama with {{heart and mind}} as well as pertinence." [...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else." [...] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine praised McConaughey's performance, highlighting that the movie [...] "traffics in deep <b>hindbrain</b> emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, Donna becomes {{sympathetic}} to the Ood and is horrified by their enslavement. The Doctor also takes {{an interest in the}} Ood, noting that no species could naturally evolve to be servants. He and Donna travel through the complex and find a batch of uncultivated Ood singing together. Instead of a translation sphere, they hold a [...] "hindbrain" [...] that gives them individuality. This <b>hindbrain</b> is being removed and replaced with the translation sphere by the humans to make them subservient, and the Doctor rebukes Halpen for lobotomising the Ood. The Doctor and Donna are captured by Ood Operations' security force. Shortly after, the Ood begin a mass revolution and the complex is evacuated, but everyone from the complex, including Solana, are slaughtered en masse. The Doctor and Donna escape with some help from the Ood (after convincing them to resist their brainwashing) and follow Halpen to a locked warehouse that contains a large brain, which is revealed to be the Ood's collective consciousness. The brain's control of the Ood is limited by a circle of pylons emitting a forcefield. Halpen plans to kill the brain and by extension all of the Ood, but is stopped by the Doctor, Donna, and Dr. Ryder. Dr. Ryder reveals that he is secretly an activist for [...] "Friends of the Ood", and had slowly infiltrated the company {{to gain access to the}} pylons and lower their force field to cause the revolution. Halpen is outraged at his betrayal, so he throws Dr. Ryder into the brain, killing him. Halpen's personal Ood servant, Ood Sigma, has been using Halpen's hair loss medication to slowly convert Halpen into an Ood. Ood Sigma tells the Doctor and Donna that he will take care of Halpen.|$|E
2500|$|The four {{cavities}} of {{the human}} brain are called ventricles. The two largest are the lateral ventricles in the cerebrum; the third ventricle is in the diencephalon of the forebrain between the right and left thalamus; and the fourth ventricle is located {{at the back of the}} pons and upper half of the medulla oblongata of the <b>hindbrain.</b> The ventricles are concerned with the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid ...|$|E
2500|$|Even mammals, {{including}} humans, {{show the}} segmented bilaterian body plan {{at the level}} of the nervous system. [...] The spinal cord contains a series of segmental ganglia, each giving rise to motor and sensory nerves that innervate a portion of the body surface and underlying musculature. [...] On the limbs, the layout of the innervation pattern is complex, but on the trunk it gives rise to a series of narrow bands. [...] The top three segments belong to the brain, giving rise to the forebrain, midbrain, and <b>hindbrain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|More {{than just}} axonal guidance, Ephs have {{been implicated in}} the {{migration}} of neural crest cells during gastrulation. In the chick and rat embryo trunk, the migration of crest cells is partially mediated by EphB receptors. Similar mechanisms {{have been shown to}} control crest movement in the <b>hindbrain</b> within rhombomeres 4, 5, and 7, which distribute crest cells to brachial arches 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In C. elegans a knockout of the [...] vab-1 gene, known to encode an Eph receptor, and its Ephrin ligand vab-2 results in two cell migratory processes being affected.|$|E
2500|$|Locomotion can be {{initiated}} by pathways that {{originate in the}} caudal <b>hindbrain</b> and brainstem and descend to the spinal cord. [...] These descending pathways originate in the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR) and the lateral hypothalamus. [...] These areas project to reticulospinal neurons in the pons and medulla, which themselves project throughout the spinal cord to activate the CPGs involved in locomotion. In particular, the reticular formation in the pons {{plays an important role}} in inducing locomotion. [...] The parapyramidal region (PPR) in the ventral medulla is also known to produce locomotion when stimulated in neonatal rats. [...] Several different command pathways play a role in the initiation of locomotion. Neurons involved in each of these include glutamatergic, noradrenergic (NA), dopaminergic (DA), and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons.|$|E
2500|$|Retinoic acid via the {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} influences {{the process of}} cell differentiation, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the <b>hindbrain</b> transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover {{the same amount of}} space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. [...] Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{peculiarities of}} Lumpsuckers neural system is that they lack Mauthner cell neurons in their <b>hindbrain,</b> while these cells are present in {{virtually}} all other teleost fish. Nevertheless, the lumpsuckers do have a C-startle response, which is apparently mediated by other <b>hindbrain</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|CRABP2 gene {{expression}} is {{abundant in the}} trunk and <b>hindbrain</b> (and {{to a lesser extent}} the forebrain), but are present {{in other areas of the}} body. Structures such as the limbs, <b>hindbrain</b> and cranial neural crest cells have been shown to be excessively sensitive to high levels of retinoic acid. Rhombomere segmentation in the <b>hindbrain</b> and the development of cranial ganglia V, VII, VIII, IX, and X also appear to be partially dependent on CRABP2 expression. CRABP2 is abundant in the dorsal part of the limb during development.|$|E

5000|$|Signals {{that control}} anteroposterior neural {{development}} include FGF and retinoic acid, which {{act in the}} <b>hindbrain</b> and spinal cord. [...] The <b>hindbrain,</b> for example, is patterned by Hox genes, which are expressed in overlapping domains along the anteroposterior axis {{under the control of}} retinoic acid. The 3' genes in the Hox cluster are induced by retinoic acid in the <b>hindbrain,</b> whereas the 5' Hox genes are not induced by retinoic acid and are expressed more posteriorly in the spinal cord. Hoxb-1 is expressed in rhombomere 4 and gives rise to the facial nerve. Without this Hoxb-1 expression, a nerve similar to the trigeminal nerve arises.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hindbrain</b> is {{homologous}} to {{a part of}} the arthropod brain {{known as}} the sub-oesophageal ganglion, in terms of the genes that it expresses and its position in between the brain and the nerve cord. On this basis, {{it has been suggested that}} the <b>hindbrain</b> first evolved in the Urbilaterian—the last common ancestor of chordates and arthropods—between 570 and 555 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Through {{studies of}} human embryos {{performed}} in the late 1890s, Swiss anatomist Wilhelm His identified a portion of <b>hindbrain</b> neuroepithelium that was distinct {{from the rest of}} the <b>hindbrain</b> neuroepithelium in its morphology, sustained chromosomal division into late stages of embryogenesis, and deployment of streams of neurons through the <b>hindbrain</b> periphery. His named this zone [...] "rautenlippe," [...] or rhombic lip, because it seemed to emanate from the rhomboid-shaped opening of the fourth ventricle, much like the shape of a mouth. His proposed that the rhombic lip held the precerebellar precursors that would migrate ventrally to populate the pontine and olivary nuclei, but the methodologies available at the time limited the amount of evidence he could gather. The first real evidence that precerebellar neurons had a dorsal origin was obtained in the 1990s through the use of chick-quail chimeras, a technique in which portions of quail <b>hindbrain</b> neuroepithelium are grafted into chick embryos in ovo. Tracking the ventral migration of the quail daughter cells confirmed His' theory.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hindbrain</b> or rhombencephalon is a {{developmental}} categorization of {{portions of the}} central nervous system in vertebrates. It includes the medulla, pons, and cerebellum. Together they support vital bodily processes.The <b>hindbrain</b> can be subdivided in a variable number of transversal swellings called rhombomeres. In the human embryo eight rhombomeres can be distinguished, from caudal to rostral: Rh8-Rh1. Rostrally, the isthmus demarcates the boundary with the midbrain.|$|E

50|$|In the rhombomeres, {{members of}} the T-box {{transcription}} factor family, {{have been linked to}} the proper development of migrating cells. While the <b>hindbrain</b> is developing, trigeminal cell bodies have been shown to migrate dorsolaterally within rhombomeres 2 and 3, while facial cells move dorsolaterally into r5 near the pial surface. Neurons that form the facial nucleus are produced in r4, but move along the anteroposterior axis of the <b>hindbrain</b> into r6, after which they move dorsolaterally. The vestibuloacoustic neurons are also produced in r4. However, they have a unique migration pattern, where their cell bodies cross the midline to the contralateral side. From this one can conclude that multiple subclasses of motor neurons are produced in specific locations in the developing <b>hindbrain.</b> All of them are related by the expression of Tbx20. Motor neurons produced in the <b>hindbrain</b> have Tbx20 selectively expressed. In Tbx20 mutations, the patterning of the regions of the rhombomeres and motor neurons were normal when they were conditional mutations and the neurons were post-mitotic. Tbx20 mutants pre-mitotic showed many cell migration deficiencies, including abnormal dorsolateral migration of the trigeminal cells, arrested tangential migration of the facial neurons, and a lack of transmedian migration of vestibuloacoustic cells. However, <b>hindbrain</b> motor neurons lacking Tbx20 retained the ability to extend neurites into the periphery. The complete elimination of Tbx20 does not cause trigeminal and facial neurons to switch to hypoglossal neurons. Facial neurons have been shown to migrate tangentially from r4 to r6, while trigeminal neurons that are produced in r2 migrate dorsolaterally non-radially. Vestibuloacoustic cells migrate along the midline at r4 contralaterally in the <b>hindbrain.</b> Tbx20 seems to have context-dependent transcriptional activity. This means that it is able to control different cell migration programs specific to different types of cells. It must be able to regulate these patterns by different means.|$|E
