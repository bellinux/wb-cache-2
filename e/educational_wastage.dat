40|$|The central {{problem to}} {{this study is that}} despite the governments’ {{increased}} funding to education and its commitment to use education as the spring board to attain vision 2030, there is still wastage in the education system. Wastage rates have not been adequately investigated especially in the newly created districts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the 2005, 2006 and 2007 cohort wastage rates of secondary schools in Kathonzweni District. The objectives of the study were to determine repetition rates and drop-out rates for the 2005 – 2007 cohorts in secondary schools of Kathonzweni District by gender and also to suggest policy recommendations on drop out and repetition rates to education policy formulators. The present study is significant in that it may yield empirical data and information on both dropout & repetition rates that will guide educational policy formulators to develop strategies to mitigate <b>educational</b> <b>wastage.</b> The study will also add to a body of knowledge in the area of <b>educational</b> <b>wastage</b> by contributing on wastage rates in Secondary Education. The literature review covered, the concept of internal efficiency, global studies on school drop-out, school drop-out and repetition in Kenya. The study was conducted using a descriptive survey design. The sample size was 18 secondary Schools in the District, and since the study involved a complete enumeration of all schools in the District, it was a census inquiry. Data was collected from the DEO’s office using a proforma. Quantitative data was analysed using the statistical package for social sciences. Findings indicated that cohort wastage rates were decreasing, from a high of 44...|$|E
40|$|Low {{enrolment}} and <b>educational</b> <b>wastage</b> {{are serious}} problems in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly {{in rural areas}} of Ethiopia where participation in formal education is extremely poor. An aspect of both problems is late entry to primary school, which has dire consequences for educational attainment, most notably for girls. This paper provides evidence {{on the extent of}} low enrolment and late entry for a sample of rural households and examines the determinants of each. In particular, the importance of parental and neighbourhood education are considered. We find that the education of both parents is important to enrolment and starting time. Furthermore, education of women in the neighbourhood increases the probability of enrolment. This suggests that {{there are two types of}} external benefit of schooling in terms of intergenerational transfers of human capital. Given the large gender bias in enrolments in rural Ethiopia, these findings have important implications for educational policy. ...|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} {{remains the}} pivot of national development in Nigeria. This {{is because the}} stock of highly-educated individuals produced by higher education institutions {{plays an important role}} in the innovation and the sustainable development of any society. However, over time, these institutions have experienced increase in enrolments and yet the number of candidates seeking admission into these institutions outpaces the available spaces in the institutions. Inadequate fiscal resources have also eroded the desired qualitative higher education and the needed national development. In this paper, challenges facing planning and funding of qualitative higher education in Nigeria are examined. The paper therefore infers the need for proper planning of higher education system to ensure qualitative higher education so as to reduce <b>educational</b> <b>wastages</b> and enhance effective utilization of the available educational scarce resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|Education is the {{backbone}} of a country. Not only it plays {{a vital role in}} the life of every human being but also occupies an important place in the development process of a country, its growth and welfare. Even it is considered {{as one of the most}} important indicators of development in a country according to quality-of-life approach. It has become very crucial perhaps never more so in man’s history than today. In India the importance of education has been highlighted in the Constitution {Article 29 (2), 45 and 46 } which provide for free and compulsory education for all the children belonging to different sections of the society including scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other backward communities. To fulfill this objective enshrined in the Constitution both the Central Government and the State Governments have taken keen interest in increasing the literacy rate in the country. As a result a considerable progress has been made over the last five decades. The present paper in this regard is an attempt to focus and analyze the rate of educational development in the State of Tripura and the wastage involved therein. For the purpose of analysis both primary and secondary data are used in this paper. <b>Educational</b> Development and <b>wastage...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} wastage of the qualified labor force, which takes place both during the education process and when trained personnel try to find jobs in the local market. Methods Secondary sources were used, mainly the Statistical yearbooks of the National Association of Universities and Higher Education Institutions (ANUIES in Spanish). Also, the 2000 Population Census was used to estimate the different sources of labor market wastage. The formulas were modified to estimate <b>educational</b> and labor <b>wastage</b> rates. Results Out of every 1000 students who started a medical training in 1996, over 20 % {{were not able to}} finish the training by 2000. Furthermore, out of every 1000 graduates, 31 % were not able to find a remunerated position in the labor market that would enable them to put into practice the abilities and capacities obtained at school. Important differences can be observed between generalists and specialists, as well as between men and women. In the case of specialists and men, lower wastage rates can be observed as compared to the wastage rates of generalists and women. A large percentage of women dedicate themselves exclusively to household duties, which in labor terms represents a wastage of their capacity to participate in the production of formal health services. Conclusion Women are becoming a majority in most medical schools, yet their participation in the labor market does not reflect the same trend. Among men, policies should be formulated to incorporate doctors in the specific health field for which they were trained. Regarding women, specific policies should target those who are dedicated full-time to household activities in order to create the possibility of having them occupy a remunerated job if they are willing to do so. Reducing wastage at both the educational and labor levels should improve the capacity of social investment, thereby increasing the capacity of the health system as a whole to provide services, particularly to those populations who are most in need. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The main aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{importance}} of guidance and counselling in Malawian Secondary Schools. Given the nature of education and the psycho-social dilemmas in which the students find themselves is guidance and counselling optional or a must? Two public secondary schools in Central West Division were identified for the study. Questions that guided the study were: How prominent is guidance and counselling in Malawian secondary schools? How equipped are teachers for the role of guiding and counselling students and how do they perceive it? What has the Ministry of Education done so far about guidance and counselling students and what it intends to do? A qualitative research design was used to collect data. People were interviewed orally using some questions to guide the interview. An interview schedule was prepared with a list or set of questions or issues which were to be explored during the interviews. The following people were interviewed (1) two Ministry of Education officials, (2) one official from the Guidance, Counselling and Youth Development Centre for Africa, (3) one counsellor from each of the two schools, (4) two students from each school- one representing the junior section and another the senior section, (5) two head-teachers, each representing the schools studied, (6) two teachers, one from each school and (7) two school-dropouts, a boy and a girl. In addition, observation method was also used. The researcher observed some group counselling sessions in one of the schools to appreciate and gain some insights into how counselling is done. Further, secondary materials such as books, magazines, periodicals, news papers, published and unpublished Ministry of Education documents and reports were read. Thus, the information collected from both the primary and secondary sources was analyzed. The results showed that learners had unique needs and concerns that called for the provision of guidance and counselling in schools. It was also found out that while teachers acknowledged the urgency for the provision of guidance and counselling in secondary schools, being a counsellor was perceived as an additional role to teaching. This attitude was due to lack of exposure to guidance and counselling courses in the initial-teacher training and the failure of the top-down mode of in-service trainings. In addition, a good number of teachers are burnt-out, stressed and frustrated. Yet, this is a crucial human resource for the implementation and provision of guidance and counselling in schools. On the other hand, it was found out that when guidance and counselling were provided retention of students in school was improved (reduced dropout rate), academic achievement improved, misbehaviour was minimised, interrelationships improved, pupil s self esteem and self-worth improved, learners got a focus and direction on their future careers, learners made informed choices. On the other hand lack guidance and counselling led to school dropout, <b>educational</b> <b>wastage,</b> underachievement, poor self image and low self esteem, poor interrelationships, lack of focus and direction on future careers, poor choices. Hence, guidance and counselling cannot be left to chance. Another finding was that the aspect of power disparity was evident among pupils, between pupils and counsellors, between teachers and the administration and amongst the teachers themselves...|$|E
40|$|The {{government}} of Lesotho and the parent expect all learners {{to attend school}} daily to receive the best education {{so that they can}} have a bright future. Education prepares the learner for life; if the learner drops out, he/she will struggle to succeed in life. The ever increasing rate of primary school dropouts in Lesotho is of great concern as it has negatively impacted on education in the area. The education system as well as the Basotho community has over the years been affected in various ways. For example, school dropouts become liabilities to the community as they are not able to contribute maximally to nation building. In most cases the dropouts engage in anti-social criminal activities. They also cause <b>educational</b> <b>wastage</b> in the form of resources. For these reasons, it was of paramount importance to determine the reasons for dropouts and establish the possible solutions to this national problem. This study has examined factors influencing learners to dropout. It employed a qualitative research design, using focus group interviews and field notes to succeed in investigating the causal factors of learner dropouts. Purposive sampling was used for the research because it was convenient for the research in terms of time. By using purposive sampling, the researcher was able to include participants according to the relevant criteria based on the emerging research question: What are the factors influencing learner dropout? The main objective was to identify the factors influencing primary school learner dropouts in Teyateyaneng, Lesotho. The focus group interviews were made up of one principal and five educators from each of the three primary schools which are located in Teyateyaneng in the Berea district of Lesotho. This type of sampling was used because the researcher wanted rich information from participants regarding the reasons for learners dropping out of school. It has emerged from the empirical findings of the study that learner dropout is inter alia caused by school and home related factors. The study revealed that some learners dropped out of school because they were orphans, while others dropped out of school after being absent for a number of weeks. Mainstream classrooms were also found to encourage dropping out because educators are not fully trained to address problems that learners with disabilities bring to the classrooms. Lack of parental involvement was found to drive learners away from schools and into the streets. Due to poor financial situations learners leave school and are forced into child labour to better their families‟living conditions. Student educators were found to be a factor because they lack the necessary skills in developing learners. Other learners decided to stop schooling totally after repeating a grade. Due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS many learners are taken out of school {{to take care of their}} ill relatives. Some learners drop out of school after being abused and neglected. Due to the high unemployment rate and poverty in Lesotho, many learners quit school to support their families. All the above causes for learners dropping out of school have been discussed in detail in chapter four. These factors are complex issues, which should be handled by trained people. As learners spend a great ideal of time in their school environments, the educators play an integral part in alleviating the learners' social problems. It is essential that learners with social problems seek professional help at an early stage. Educators are obliged to help these learners although they are not necessarily equipped to give the required assistance. Suggestions and recommendations are mentioned to alleviate the situation. The study recommends that primary school learners should be encouraged to complete their primary level education. The Ministry of Education and Training should develop policy guidelines on inclusive education, facilitate legislation on compulsory basic education, improve teaching and learning conditions in all schools, abolish child labour, create employment opportunities for parents to prevent child labour, regulate traditional circumcision and solicit parental support. All the above suggestions hoped to be solutions to the problems of learner dropouts as discussed in detail in chapter two. Inclusive EducationM. Ed. (Inclusive Education...|$|E
