5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between an {{elephant}} and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed {{part of its}} training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power. He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant, but there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> indicate that these two epigrams {{are about the same}} events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> support these speculations.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E

There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do but rot and die--that <b>is,</b> there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do after {{the night that}} followed the first death. On that night, the mate, the supercargo, the Polish Jew, and four native divers sneaked away in the large whale boat. They were never heard of again. In the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining boats, and there we were.|$|R

5|$|John of Antioch and the Patriarch Nikephoros both {{report that}} Heraclius the Elder {{maintained}} correspondence with Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and former {{commander of the}} army. By that time, Priscus was the son-in-law of Phocas but reportedly held a grudge against the emperor. He allegedly promised Heraclius the Elder support {{in case of a}} rebellion and confirmed it once the rebellion had started. The story is somewhat suspect. While there was major dissension in Constantinople and Priscus did in time defect to Heraclius the Elder, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Priscus helped incite the revolt. Patriarch Nikephoros reports that Heraclius the Elder held council with his brother Gregoras before proclaiming his revolt, possibly indicating that Gregoras was acting as his advisor. He also reports that Gregoras hoped to promote his own son Nicetas to the throne, although this is considered unlikely at best by modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan {{shares a}} final kiss with Jupiter before departing {{permanently}} to another galaxy, while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt, who makes {{no effort to}} defend himself. Nevertheless, he defends his actions, claiming that for world peace to be possible, {{there had to be}} sacrifice. Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity. Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{has called}} for the {{continuation}} of the line to Melrose and Hawick, and eventually to Carlisle. According to the group, Hawick suffered more than any other town in the Borders from the closure of the Waverley Route, and only the return of the railway could halt the area's economic decline. At the time of the closure of the Waverley Route, Hawick was a 70-minute journey from Edinburgh. At Melrose, the southbound station platform and building exist alongside the Melrose Bypass. Network Rail has confirmed that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> prevent the extension of the line beyond Tweedbank, although commentators have remarked that the Bypass could pose problems. A major realignment of the road would be required, as well as the reinstatement of embankments and bridges.|$|E

25|$|Lack of {{democratic}} legitimacy: The monarchy's apparent popularity has only ever been measured in opinion polls, {{never in a}} formal referendum, the ultimate expression of democracy.

25|$|The {{evidence}} whether Wren was a speculative freemason is {{the subject}} of the Prestonian Lecture of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and Aubrey's memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.|$|E

25|$|Acid reflux, or {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease, {{can greatly}} exacerbate the mouth-alcohol problem. The stomach is normally {{separated from the}} throat by a valve, but when this valve becomes herniated, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> stop the liquid contents in the stomach from rising and permeating the esophagus and mouth. The contents—including any alcohol—are then later exhaled into the breathalyzer. One study of 10 individuals suffering from this condition {{did not find any}} actual increase in Breath Ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Sitting Bull went to Fort Qu'Appelle {{to procure}} a Canadian reserve. Sitting Bull’s {{attempts}} failed once again. At the time, Walsh was in Chicago. He spoke to General Hammond of the U.S. Army, who told Walsh that Sitting Bull {{would not have}} to “fear reprisals.” Walsh quickly sent word of the news to Wood Mountain. When Sitting Bull returned from Fort Qu'Appelle he told Légaré that he was ready to leave. “There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> eat here, nothing but turnips,” he said.|$|E

25|$|The act for {{the most}} part simply reiterates {{existing}} provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.|$|E
25|$|The damper, {{instead of}} storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the damping force is {{proportional}} to the velocity, the more the motion, the more the damper dissipates the energy. Therefore, there is a point when the energy dissipated by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to grow into infinity.|$|E

Providing they are still an active member 3 years later, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> stop them getting a further certificate and deferment.|$|E
