As part of a multi-telescope campaign to measure visible and infrared spectra and photometry, we obtained mid-infrared (approx. 8 to 22 micron) photometry and spectroscopy of 2005 YU 55 using Michelle on the Gemini North telescope on UT November 9 and 10, 2011. An extensive radar campaign together with optical light-curves established the rotation state of YU 55. In addition, the radar imaging resulted in a shape model for the asteroid, detection of numerous boulders on its surface, and a preliminary estimate of its equatorial diameter at 380 +/- 20 m. In a preliminary analysis, applying the radar and lightcurve-derived parameters to a rough-surface thermophysical model fit to the Gemini/Michelle thermal emission photometry results in a thermal <b>inertia</b> <b>range</b> of approximately 500 to 1500 J/sq m/ 0. 5 s/K, with the low-thermal-inertia solution corresponding to the small end of the radar size range and vice versa.

The role of nonlinear mode coupling is specifically discussed as a ubiquitous principal interaction mechanism in the dual processes of the generation and back-action of secondary structures on ITG and ETG turbulence. Here two new results are evidently presented {{on the importance of}} the mode coupling interaction: (1) While secondary zonal flows and long wavelength modes are generated through nonlinear mode coupling, the same back-action process can deform the spectral distribution in <b>inertia</b> <b>range</b> from the power-law scaling into an exponential-law dependence. The turbulence may be reduced due to the local and/or nonlocal free energy transfer to stable region. (2) Streamer-like long wavelength fluctuations driven by the most unstable ETG modes, can saturate slab ETG turbulence through producing a yk-mode coupling that corresponds to the toroidal mode coupling in tokamak plasma, suggesting a low ETG fluctuation level and electron transport. Furthermore, the effect of ITG generated zonal flows regarded as a wave-type mean flow on the generation of zonal flows in ETG turbulence is also discussed with an emphasis on the role of nonlinear mode coupling...|$|E

40|$|Near-Earth {{asteroid}} 162173 (1999 JU 3) is {{a potential}} flyby and rendezvous target for interplanetary missions because of its easy to reach orbit. The physical and thermal properties of the asteroid are relevant for establishing the scientific mission goals and also important {{in the context of}} near-Earth object studies in general. Our goal was to derive key physical parameters such as shape, spin-vector, size, geometric albedo, and surface properties of 162173 (1999 JU 3). With three sets of published thermal observations (ground-based N-band, Akari IRC, Spitzer IRS), we applied a thermophysical model to derive the radiometric properties of the asteroid. The calculations were performed for the full range of possible shape and spin-vector solutions derived from the available sample of visual lightcurve observations. The near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU 3) has an effective diameter of 0. 87 +/- 0. 03 km and a geometric albedo of 0. 070 +/- 0. 006. The chi 2 -test reveals a strong preference for a retrograde sense of rotation with a spin-axis orientation of lambda_ecl = 73 deg, beta_ecl = - 62 deg and P_sid = 7. 63 +/- 0. 01 h. The most likely thermal <b>inertia</b> <b>ranges</b> between 200 and 600 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1, about a factor of 2 lower than the value for 25143 Itokawa.

40|$|Clay mineral-bearing {{deposits}} previously {{discovered on}} Mars with near infrared (Œª = 0. 3 - 5 Œºm) remote sensing data are of major significance {{for understanding the}} aqueous history, geological evolution, and past habitability of Mars. In this study, we analyzed the thermal infrared (Œª = 6 - 35 Œºm) surface properties of the most extensive phyllosilicate deposit on Mars: the Mawrth Vallis area. Clay mineral-bearing units, which in visible images appear to be relatively light-toned, layered bedrock, have thermal <b>inertia</b> values <b>ranging</b> from 150 to 460 J m- 2 K- 1 s- 1 / 2. This suggests the deposits are composed of a mixture of rock with sand and dust at 100 -meter scales. Dark-toned materials that mantle the clay-bearing surfaces have thermal <b>inertia</b> values <b>ranging</b> from 150 to 800, indicating variable degrees of rockiness or induration of this younger sedimentary or pyroclastic unit. Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) spectra of the light-toned rocks were analyzed {{with a number of}} techniques, but none of the results shows a large phyllosilicate component as has been detected in the same surfaces with near-infrared data. Instead, TES spectra of light-toned surfaces are best modeled by a combination of plagioclase feldspar, high-silica materials (similar to impure opaline silica or felsic glass), and zeolites. We propose three hypotheses for why the clay minerals are not apparent in thermal infrared data, including effects due to surface roughness, sub-pixel mixing of multiple surface temperatures, and low absolute mineral abundances combined with differences in spatial sampling between instruments. Zeolites modeled in TES spectra could be a previously unrecognized component of the alteration assemblage in the phyllosilicate-bearing rocks of the Mawrth Vallis area. TES spectral index mapping suggests that (Fe/Mg) -clays detected with near infrared data correspond to trioctahedral (Fe 2 +) clay minerals rather than nontronite-like clays. The average mineralogy and geologic context of these complex, interbedded deposits suggests they are either aqueous sedimentary rocks, altered pyroclastic deposits, or a combination of both. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Methods Nine patients with constipation due to total colonic <b>inertia</b> (age <b>range,</b> 39 - 52 years; 7 women, 2 men) {{were enrolled in the}} study. One pacing electrode was applied to each of the 4 potential colonic pacemaker sites, and 2 to 3 temporary recording electrodes were applied distally. A stimulator was embedded subcutaneously in the inguinal area. Home pacing was practiced after patients were trained; the recording electrodes were removed before home pacing was started. Results :Colonic pacing evoked electric waves, which effected defecation in 6 of the 9 patients. Three of these 6 patients had spontaneous defecation after a few months of pacing, and their electrodes and stimulators were removed. In the other 3 of these 6 patients, the pacemakers are still in place and continue to effect rectal evacuation. Colonic pacing did not produce rectal evacuation in 3 patients and is believed to have failed because of an advanced stage of colonic inertia. Conclusion :Colonic pacing induced rectal evacuation in 66. 6 % of the patients with total colonic inertia. No complications were encountered.

The dependency of permeability on frequency which is known as dynamic permeability and its effects on wave attributes of compressional waves are investigated in the present paper. Utilizing the dispersion relation derived for compressional waves, it is shown how the velocity and intrinsic attenuation of waves propagated in water saturated sand may be influenced by dynamic permeability. In low frequency range (viscous dominated flow regime), the dynamic permeability behaves like Darcy steady-state permeability and its effects on wave attributes are negligible. However, deviations from Darcy permeability start to occur at higher frequencies. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} how dynamic permeability controls the behavior of wave velocity and intrinsic attenuation in relatively high frequencies. ¬† For example, it is demonstrated that neglecting dynamic permeability results in overestimation of velocities of fast and slow waves in high frequency <b>ranges</b> (<b>inertia</b> dominated flow regime) ...|$|R

This could imply rock, but is also similar to the average value of thermal inertia found for north polar layered deposits. Furthermore, ILD-B is found to exhibit a bluff and terrace structure. A terrace structure arises naturally in model simulations of the sublimation of large ice deposits. Such a staircase terrain, of course, is a further characteristic of north polar layered terrain. Morphological similarity, thermal <b>inertia</b> in the <b>range</b> of thermal <b>inertias</b> of the north polar cap layered terrain, and relatively high albedo lead us to propose that the ILD-B may consist of residual water ice partially covered by, and perhaps mixed with, varying amounts of dust or sand.

While these ILDs lack the close morphological resemblance to the north polar cap, they share many other common features and appear to be part of the same formation.

The capsule is modelled as a liquid droplet enclosed by a hyperelastic membrane, and its equatorial plane is initially tilted {{out of the plane}} of shear. We find, at low shear rates, the well-accepted tumbling motion is not always stable for both oblate and prolate capsules. For an oblate capsule, the dominant stable modes for increasing dimensionless shear rate are as follows: rolling with the equatorial plane staying in the plane of shear, precessing following Jeffery's orbit [Proc. R. Soc. London A 102, 161 (1922) ], and tumbling. Interestingly, the order of modes is reversed for a prolate capsule: tumbling, precessing, and rolling with increasing dimensionless shear rate. At transitional regimes, we find the stable motion of a capsule can depend on its initial titled angle, even at the same shear rate. At high dimensionless shear rates, a spheroidal capsule undergoes a complicated oscillating-swinging motion: Its major axis oscillates about the plane of shear in addition to the swinging about a mean angle with flow direction found previously, and the amplitudes of both oscillations decrease when increasing the dimensionless shear rate towards a steady tank treading motion asymptotically.

Before these observations, the southern polar regions had been in darkness for approximately five years. Subsurface temperatures in the range 25 50 K are measured. Thermal model calculations of the nucleus near-surface temperatures carried out over the orbit of 67 P, coupled with radiative transfer calculations of the MIRO channels brightness temperatures, suggest that these regions have a thermal <b>inertia</b> within the <b>range</b> 10 - 60 Jm(- 2) K- 1 s(- 0. 5).

A large difference in the brightness temperatures measured by the two MIRO continuum channels is tentatively attributed to dielectric properties that differ significantly from the sunlit side, within the first few tens of centimeters. This is suggestive of the presence of ice(s) within the MIRO depths of investigation in the southern polar regions. These regions started to receive sunlight in May of 2015, and refinements of the shape model in these regions, as well as continuing MIRO observations of 67 P, will allow refining these results and reveal the thermal properties and potential ice content of the southern regions in more detail...|$|R

Hydrodynamic (non-MHD) flow is first considered. The effect of a homogeneous stream-wise magnetic field on the transition characteristics is then studied under the Quasi-static approximation of Magnetohydrodynamics, applicable, when the induced magnetic field is neglected. The Reynolds number of the flows is limited to Re ‚â§ 100 and selected values of the Interaction parameter (N) measuring the relative strength of the Lorentz force over the <b>inertia</b> in the <b>range</b> N ‚àà [0, 100] are considered. The temporal growth rate of the transverse velocity component {{at the location of}} the first (steady-state) maximum along the symmetry-line is shown to be a more informative and a more easily obtainable measure of asymmetry over other steady-state measures usually used in the literature. This growth rate is found to be independent of the symmetric initial conditions used for the computation and can be exploited in faster evaluation of the critical Reynolds number for the symmetric to asymmetric flow transition. An increase in the strength of the applied magnetic field N is found to have a stabilizing influence in general, reducing the growth rates of asymmetry. The (two equally sized) recirculation zone lengths of the steady-state symmetric solution are found to scale linearly with the Reynolds number (Re) for a fixed strength of the applied magnetic field and directly proportional to ReN and N for Re > N cases respectively...|$|R

We found that the tumbling asteroid Apophis has an elongated shape with a mean diameter of 375 + 14 - 10 m (of an equal volume sphere) and a geometric V-band albedo of 0. 30 + 0. 05 - 0. 06. We found a thermal <b>inertia</b> in the <b>range</b> 250 - 800 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1 (best solution at Gamma = 600 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1), which {{can be explained by}} a mixture of low-conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal inertia on the surface. The thermal inertia, and other similarities with (25143) Itokawa indicate that Apophis might also have a rubble-pile structure. If we combine the new size value with the assumption of an Itokawa-like density and porosity we estimate a mass between 4. 4 and 6. 2 √ó 1010 kg, which is more than 2 - 3 times larger than previous estimates. We expect that the newly derived properties will influence impact scenario studies and the long-term orbit predictions of Apophis...|$|R
40|$|Constraining the {{structure}} of the lunar core is necessary to improve our understanding of the present-day thermal structure of the interior and the history of a lunar dynamo, as well as the origin and thermal and compositional evolution of the Moon. We analyze Apollo deep moonquake seismograms using terrestrial array processing methods to search for the presence of reflected and converted energy from the lunar core. Although moonquake fault parameters are not constrained, we first explore a suite of theoretical focal spheres to verify that fault planes exist that can produce favorable core reflection amplitudes relative to direct up-going energy at the Apollo stations. Beginning with stacks of event seismograms from the known distribution of deep moonquake clusters, we apply a polarization filter to account for the effects of seismic scattering that (a) partitions energy away from expected components of ground motion, and (b) obscures all but the main P- and S-wave arrivals. The filtered traces are then shifted to the predicted arrival time of a core phase (e. g. PcP) and stacked to enhance subtle arrivals associated with the Moon s core. This combination of filtering and array processing is well suited for detecting deep lunar seismic reflections, since we do not expect scattered wave energy from near surface (or deeper) structure recorded at varying epicentral distances and stations from varying moonquakes at varying depths to stack coherently. Our results indicate the presence of a solid inner and fluid outer core, overlain by a partial-melt-containing boundary layer (Table 1). These layers are consistently observed among stacks from four classes of reflections: P-to-P, S-to-P, P-to-S, and S-to-S, and are consistent with current indirect geophysical estimates of core and deep mantle properties, including mass, moment of <b>inertia,</b> lunar laser <b>ranging,</b> and electromagnetic induction.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{preliminary results}} from the first 100 sols of ground temperature measurements along the Mars Science Laboratory's traverse from Bradbury Landing to Rocknest in Gale. The ground temperature data show long-term increases in mean temperature {{that are consistent with}} seasonal evolution. Deviations from expected temperature trends within the diurnal cycle are observed and may be attributed to rover and environmental effects. Fits to measured diurnal temperature amplitudes using a thermal model suggest that the observed surfaces have thermal <b>inertias</b> in the <b>range</b> of 265 - 375 ?J m- 2 K- 1 s- 1 / 2, which are within the range of values determined from orbital measurements and are consistent with the inertias predicted from the observed particle sizes on the uppermost surface near the rover. Ground temperatures at Gale Crater appear to warm earlier and cool later than predicted by the model, suggesting that there are multiple unaccounted for physical conditions or processes in our models. Where the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) descent engines removed a mobile layer of dust and fine sediments from over rockier material, the diurnal temperature profile is closer to that expected for a homogeneous surface, suggesting that the mobile materials on the uppermost surface may be partially responsible for the mismatch between observed temperatures and those predicted for materials having a single thermal inertia. Models of local stratigraphy also implicate thermophysical heterogeneity at the uppermost surface as a potential contributor to the observed diurnal temperature cycle. Key Points Diurnal ground temperatures vary with location Diurnal temperature curves are not well matched by a homogeneous thermal model GTS data are consistent with a varied stratigraphy and thermophysical properties ¬© 2014.

50|$|Prior to 1917 {{there were}} {{available}} {{several types of}} instruments for measuring and recording pressures internal combustion engine cylinders. Some of these were refinements of the conventional pressure indicator designed for low-speed steam engines while others were designed primarily for high-speed work {{with a view of}} minimizing the effects of inertia. These instruments were found to be useful for various classes of work, depending on theirdesign and characteristics, although none of them had found more than very limited application in a comparatively few laboratories. Some of the inherent difficulties which have prevented the development of a wholly convenient and successful high-speed indicator are inertia, friction, and backlash in moving parts where mechanical means of recording are adopted; inertia and vibration of the system when a photographic method of magnification is applied to an instrument mounted on the engine; time lag of the gases in the connecting tube where a photographic apparatus is mounted independently of the engine and connects to it by a flexible tube; as well as the usual mechanical difficulties in the construction and operation of instruments of this class. It is noted that these difficulties are increased {{in the case of the}} aircraft engine, which usually must be mounted on a more or less flexible stand and in which at best the mechanical vibrations of the parts are excessive, due to their light weight and lack ofrigidity. An important mechanical consequence of this excessive flexibility of the engine structure seems to have been overlooked, since it has not been discussed in the literature or taken account of other than accidentally in design of any indicator. To illustrate this effect, assume an indicator whose moving parts are mounted on the head of an engine cyIinder. In order to reduce the effect of <b>inertia,</b> the <b>range</b> of motion of the piston or diaphragm is reduced as much as practicable and the motion magnified either mechanically or optically so as to give a readable scale. It should be noted that the motion actually recorded is always the relative motion between the movable part of the indicator and the (supposeclIy) fixed partmounted rigidly on the cylinder head. But if the cylinder head itself flexes under pressure or mechanical vibration, this motion of the fixed support relative to the movable piston is recorded and magnified as well as the motion of the piston relative to its support. Hence it may happen that thus limiting the range of motion of the piston or heavy diaphragm and greatly magnifying the record, increases the bad effects of inertia. on a light flexible engine cylinder since the motions of the cylinder head itself, relative to the moving member, are subject to the same degree of magnification.|$|R
40|$|The near-Earth {{asteroid}} (308635) 2005 YU 55 is {{a potentially}} hazardous asteroid which {{was discovered in}} 2005 and passed Earth on November 8 th 2011 at 0. 85 lunar distances. This was the closest known approach by an asteroid of several hundred metre diameter since 1976 when a similar size object passed at 0. 5 lunar distances. We observed 2005 YU 55 from ground with a recently developed mid-IR camera (miniTAO/MAX 38) in N- and Q-band and with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1. 3 mm. In addition, we obtained space observations with Herschel/PACS at 70, 100, and 160 micron. Our thermal measurements cover {{a wide range of}} wavelengths from 8. 9 micron to 1. 3 mm and were taken after opposition at phase angles between - 97 deg and - 18 deg. We performed a radiometric analysis via a thermophysical model and combined our derived properties with results from radar, adaptive optics, lightcurve observations, speckle and auxiliary thermal data. We find that (308635) 2005 YU 55 has an almost spherical shape with an effective diameter of 300 to 312 m and a geometric albedo pV of 0. 055 to 0. 075. Its spin-axis is oriented towards celestial directions (lam_ecl, beta_ecl) = (60 deg +/- 30 deg, - 60 deg +/- 15 deg), which means it has a retrograde sense of rotation. The analysis of all available data combined revealed a discrepancy with the radar-derived size. Our radiometric analysis of the thermal data together with the problem to find a unique rotation period might be connected to a non-principal axis rotation. A low to intermediate level of surface roughness (r. m. s. of surface slopes in the range 0. 1 - 0. 3) is required to explain the available thermal measurements. We found a thermal <b>inertia</b> in the <b>range</b> 350 - 800 Jm^- 2 s^- 0. 5 K^- 1, very similar to the rubble-pile asteroid (25143) Itokawa and indicating a mixture of low conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal inertia on the surface.

40|$|The near-Earth {{asteroid}} (NEA) 2015 TB 145 had a {{very close}} encounter with Earth at 1. 3 lunar distances on October 31, 2015. We obtained 3 -band mid-infrared observations with the ESO VLT-VISIR instrument and visual lightcurves during the close-encounter phase. The NEA has a (most likely) rotation period of 2. 939 +/- 0. 005 hours and the visual lightcurve shows a peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 0. 12 +/- 0. 02 mag. We estimate a V-R colour of 0. 56 +/- 0. 05 mag from MPC database entries. Applying different phase relations to the available R-/V-band observations produced H_R = 18. 6 mag (standard H-G calculations) or H_R = 19. 2 mag & H_V = 19. 8 mag (via the H-G 12 procedure), with large uncertainties of approximately 1 mag. We performed a detailed thermophysical model analysis by using spherical and ellipsoidal shape models. The thermal properties are best explained by an equator-on (+/- ~ 30 deg) viewing geometry during our measurements with a thermal <b>inertia</b> in the <b>range</b> 250 - 700 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1 (retrograde rotation) or above 500 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1 (prograde rotation). We find that the NEA has a minimum size of 625 m, a maximum size of just below 700 m, and a slightly elongated shape with a/b ~ 1. 1. The best match to all thermal measurements is found for: (i) Thermal inertia of 900 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1; D_eff = 644 m, p_V = 5. 5 % (prograde rotation); regolith grain sizes of ~ 50 - 100 mm; (ii) thermal inertia of 400 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1; D_eff = 667 m, p_V = 5. 1 % (retrograde rotation); regolith grain sizes of ~ 10 - 20 mm. A near-Earth asteroid model (NEATM) confirms an object size well above 600 m, significantly larger than early estimates based on radar measurements.

The spacecraft will {{arrive at the}} near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu (1999 JU 3) in 2018 where it will perform a survey, land and obtainsurface material, then depart in December 2019 and return to Earth in December 2020. We observed Ryugu with the Herschel Space Observatory in April 2012 at far-infrared thermal wavelengths, supported by several ground-based observations to obtain optical lightcurves. We reanalysed previously published Subaru-COMICS and AKARI-IRC observations and merged them with a Spitzer-IRS data set. In addition, we used a large set of Spitzer-IRAC observations obtained in the period January to May, 2013. The data set includes two complete rotational lightcurves {{and a series of}} ten "point-and-shoot" observations, all at 3. 6 and 4. 5 Œºm. The almost spherical shape of the target together with the insufficient lightcurve quality forced us to combine radiometric and lightcurve inversion techniques in different ways to find the object's spin-axis orientation, its shape and {{to improve the quality of}} the key physical and thermal parameters. Handling thermal data in inversion techniques remains challenging: thermal inertia, roughness or local structures influence the temperature distribution on the surface. The constraints for size, spin or thermal properties therefore heavily depend on the wavelengths of the observations. We find that the solution which best matches our data sets leads to this C class asteroid having a retrograde rotation with a spin-axis orientation of (Œª = 310 ¬∞- 340 ¬∞; Œ≤ = - 40 ¬∞ ¬± 15 ¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates, an effective diameter (of an equal-volume sphere) of 850 to 880 m, a geometric albedo of 0. 044 to 0. 050 and a thermal <b>inertia</b> in the <b>range</b> 150 to 300 J m- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1. Based on estimated thermal conductivities of the top-layer surface in the range 0. 1 to 0. 6 W K- 1 m- 1, we calculated that the grain sizes are approximately equal to between 1 and 10 mm. The finely constrained values for this asteroid serve as a "design reference model", which is currently used for various planning, operational and modelling purposes by the Hayabusa- 2 team.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{in order to}} perform a drift off calculation for drillships according to given parameters such as: environmental conditions and water depth. Drift off occurs when there is insufficient thruster force so that the vessel is drifted away from the target position by the environmental forces. For a safe operational drillship {{it is expected that}} the drifting off will be resumed in due time when blackout recovery system starts running and, therefore, enough thrust takes place. Water depth plays an important role when considering the default maximum release of Lower Flex Joint (LFJ) angle for physically disconnecting, which is 10 degrees in the majority of suppliers. This methodology is intended to be applied to drillship design, by comparing the time to stop drifting and the distance from the reference point after a total blackout occurs. Electrical generators sets installed in drillships are designed to work with extreme environmental conditions. Since there is an excess of installed power {{for the majority of the}} operational time, drillships often operate with all high voltage busbars connected to each other improving engine efficiency, decreasing levels of pollution emissions and reducing maintenance. The use of this electrical power configuration is possible because there is no need to turn on all generators at the same time, but only the ones that are needed on that particular moment. However, when a single failure such as a short circuit occurs and the system is not prepared to disable and segregate the failure, all electrical system will crash, causing a total blackout and the drillship will start to drift off. The drifting off time was obtained by numerical simulations conducted by modeling a standard drillship using time domain software. The model took into consideration the vessel hydrodynamics under environmental conditions (wind, current and wave), the drag force in marine drilling riser, and the thrusters in Dynamic Positioning (DP) operation. The simulation is divided into three steps: First, the behavior of the DP system in full operation is simulated until system is stable. After that, all thrusters are turned off to simulate a total blackout. Finally, since the ship will not stop immediately because of its <b>inertia,</b> a time <b>range</b> for the ship‚Äôs inertia was also considered and this time is added to the pre-established blackout duration. The conclusion of the study shows how parameters as water depth, environmental conditions, and blackout recovery time affect the necessary time to stop drifting off, so as to foresee that after a total blackout the standard drillship will remain in safe limits.
