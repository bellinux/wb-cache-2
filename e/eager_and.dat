25|$|The Blackhawks {{immediately}} faced {{salary cap}} constraints {{prior to the}} 2010–11 NHL season. The team was forced to trade many players who played an integral role to their 2009–10 Stanley Cup victory, including Dustin Byfuglien, Andrew Ladd, Kris Versteeg, Brent Sopel , Ben <b>Eager,</b> <b>and</b> Colin Fraser. The team was also unable to agree to terms with starting goaltender Antti Niemi, who left as restricted free agent to the San Jose Sharks. The Blackhawks signed journeyman Marty Turco as his replacement, but eventfully turned to rookie Corey Crawford to become their full-time starting goaltender. The Blackhawks also made a mid-season trade to acquire winger Michael Frolík from the Florida Panthers in exchange for Jack Skille, Hugh Jessiman and David Pacan.|$|E
25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing each other at about ten yards’ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals.

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> happy to do it because the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E
500|$|The {{relative}} importance of the two men's contributions has been debated by critics. David Thomson wrote about [...] "the problem in assessing [...] career: who did what in their collaboration? And what is Donen's real standing as a director?" [...] Thomson remarked that [...] "nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen's retreating crane shot." [...] However set reports state that Kelly rode the camera boom between shots and during camera set-ups. Donen stated that [...] "by the time you hash it through {{from beginning to end}} ten million times, you can't remember who did what except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea." [...] Composer Saul Chaplin said that [...] "Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> talented pupil." [...] During the shooting of On the Town, all memos and correspondence from MGM to the production were addressed exclusively to Donen and not to Kelly.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{was sworn}} in as {{governor}} on January 1, 1963. [...] His initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state's financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention. [...] In 1963, he proposed a comprehensive tax revision package that included a flat-rate state income tax, but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the Michigan Legislature rejected the measure. Romney's early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former Richard Nixon associates. One Michigan Democrat said of Romney, [...] "He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order. He is <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> sometimes impatient." [...] But over his first two years in office, Romney was able to work with Democrats– who often had at least partial control of the legislature– and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives.|$|E

[...] Miguel's lyrics express modesty, yearning, vulnerability, and cheeky humor. Kelley likens his songwriting to Tony! Toni! Toné! and observes [...] "Little Richard-level insinuations" [...] and [...] "absurd provocations in the style of Akinyele". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis views that Miguel eschews braggadocio and is [...] "man enough to admit his own insecurities and question whether he's worthy of love—or lustful indulgence." [...] Kaleidoscope Dream also explores the anxiety and momentary nature of sex and clubbing. Consequence of Sound's Jeremy D. Larson views that Miguel employs a [...] "fangs-out approach to R" [...] similar to Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, writing that [...] "nothing shrouds Miguel and his directives, and worries, and prayers, and cat calls– it's all there, full of light and love, refracting through a kaleidoscope of rocks glasses, rainy windshields, and blood-shot eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Hornung knew Doyle's sister, Constance ("Connie") Aimée Monica Doyle (1868–1924), {{whom he had}} {{met when}} he visited Portugal. Connie was {{described}} by Doyle's biographer, Andrew Lycett, as being attractive, [...] "with pre-Raphaelite looks... the most sought-after of the Doyle daughters". By December 1892, when Hornung, Doyle and Jerome visited the Black Museum at Scotland Yard, Hornung and Connie were engaged, and in 1893 Hornung dedicated his second novel, Tiny Luttrell, [...] "to C.A.M.D." [...] They were married on 27 September 1893, although Doyle {{was not at the}} wedding and relations between the two writers were sometimes strained. The Hornungs had a son, Arthur Oscar, in 1895; while his first name was from Doyle, who was also Arthur's godfather, the boy's middle name was probably after Doyle and Hornung's mutual friend Oscar Wilde and it was by his second name that he was known. In 1894 Doyle and Hornung began work on a play for Henry Irving, on the subject of boxing during the Regency; Doyle was initially <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> paid Hornung £50 as a down payment before he withdrew after the first act had been written: the work was never completed.|$|E
500|$|Addams {{felt that}} the {{community}} benefits from theater plays and thus established an amateur theater in the Hull House in 1899. “The neighborhood Greeks performed the classic plays of antiquity {{in their own language}} and the children of European immigrants produced Shakespeare” as well as others. Early one December, the Greeks performed Odysseus in Chicago. The auditorium was filled with a multi-ethnic crowd and packed too close for comfort. The audience was very <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> gave the performers “rapt attention." [...] They watched neighbors and co-workers execute this primitive play, but it was very powerful, plausible, and personal. The actors seemed to pay “tribute to a noble ancestry” and plea for the respect of the audience. Indeed, they did gain this respect because it was said that not even trained college students could give the same play with as much zeal and patriotism. Chicago's noted improvisational theatre scene has roots in Hull House, as Viola Spolin, noted improvisational techniques instructor, taught classes at Hull House. In 1963, when road tours of Broadway productions became common, the Hull House Theater in the Jane Addams Center at 3212 North Broadway fostered the development of Chicago Theater companies {{for the rest of the}} century. [...] Founder Robert Sickinger created an environment to nourish young talent with professionalism.|$|E

500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

2500|$|The 2010–11 season {{would bring}} a new look to the Edmonton Oilers line-up, when Shawn Horcoff was {{selected}} to succeed Ethan Moreau as team captain. Horcoff had become the Oilers longest-serving player by this point. Taylor Hall, Jordan Eberle and Magnus Paajarvi would all make their NHL debuts for the team. Despite the influx of their young talent, Edmonton would still find themselves {{at the bottom of}} the standings. In an attempt to gain valuable prospects and draft picks, Dustin Penner was traded from the Oilers to Los Angeles on February 28, 2011, in exchange for Colten Teubert, a first-round draft pick in 2011 (Oscar Klefbom) and a conditional third-round pick in 2012. At the end of the season, the Oilers were {{at the bottom of the}} standings and received the right to choose first overall in the upcoming 2011 NHL Entry Draft. The Oilers selected Ryan Nugent-Hopkins with the first overall selection in the Draft, along with several other [...] "blue chip" [...] prospects. During the 2011 off-season, the team again made several moves to bolster the offence and defence, re-acquiring fan favourite Ryan Smyth from Los Angeles in exchange for Colin Fraser and a seventh-round draft pick. The team also traded with the Anaheim Ducks to acquire Andy Sutton for Kurtis Foster. Sheldon Souray, who had played the entire 2010–11 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Hershey Bears, was bought out of the last year of his contract. These moves, coupled with the signings of Eric Belanger, Cam Barker, Ben <b>Eager</b> <b>and</b> Darcy Hordichuk, changed the complexion of the team, to add [...] "grit and toughness." [...] The Oilers, however, were again unable to qualify for the playoffs for the sixth-straight season, as they finished 14th in the Western Conference.|$|E
2500|$|Former United States {{ambassador}} to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, during his conversations with Milošević {{claimed that he}} was not a genuine nationalist, but rather a political opportunist. Zimmerman has claimed that unlike other politicians with whom he had discussions during the collapse of Yugoslavia, such as Franjo Tuđman and Radovan Karadžić, Milošević did not emphasize any hatred of ethnic groups and instead emphasized that Serbia would continue to be a multi-ethnic republic in Yugoslavia. Zimmerman has claimed that Milošević opportunistically used nationalism to allow him to rise to power in the Communist establishment in Serbia as Communism in eastern Europe became increasingly unpopular, and continued to advocate a nationalist agenda to draw in support for his government. On another occasion, however, Milošević revealed to Zimmerman his negative attitude towards ethnic Albanians who had demanded autonomy and in the 1990s, independence from Serbia and Yugoslavia. Milošević told Zimmerman jokingly that the Albanians of Kosovo were the most pampered minority in Europe. Milošević also was known to talk disparagingly about Slovenes, when he in conversation with an interviewer of what he thought of the Slovene delegation's decision to depart the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Milošević made a derogatory joke, calling the Slovene League of Communists delegation, [...] "those stingy Slovenes". Zimmerman later reported that Milošević's unusual and conflicting positions and mannerisms were almost schizophrenic in nature, as at times Milošević would behave in an arrogant, stubborn, authoritarian and aggressive manner towards others, which staunchly supported Serbian nationalism against all opponents, while at other times he would be polite, conciliatory, and be <b>eager</b> <b>and</b> willing to find moderate and peaceful solutions to the crisis in Yugoslavia. Zimmerman has concluded, however, that Milošević constantly demonstrated that he primarily saw Yugoslavia as a state for ensuring the unity of Serbs, and did not have much interest in preserving the unity of Yugoslavia outside areas of Serb national interests.|$|E
