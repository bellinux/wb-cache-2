40|$|Copper {{is known}} as a {{pearlite}} promoter in cast iron and has been used as such for a long time, most often together with low amounts of manganese. Literature data, however, has shown that these two elements act differently on the ferritic and pearlitic transformations. In order to provide more insight in the role of this element on the solid-state transformation of spheroidal graphite (SG) cast iron, this paper investigates the effect of adding copper in small step increments, from 0. 11 to 1 wt. % Cu, to SG irons containing about 0. 15 wt. % Mn. The characteristic temperatures for the stable and metastable <b>eutectoid</b> <b>transformations</b> as recorded during cooling after solidification in standard cups and after austenitizing are presented together with microstructure information. It is found that a copper content of about 0. 6 wt. % is the upper limit over which only small amounts of ferrite could be obtained except at very low cooling rates.

40|$|The <b>eutectoid</b> <b>transformation</b> of {{austenite}} {{can occur}} cooperatively (pearlite transformation) or {{by means of}} a non-cooperative mode (Divorced <b>Eutectoid</b> <b>Transformation).</b> In the cooperative mode, ferrite and cementite grow together, leading to the typical lamellar microstructure of pearlite. In the non-cooperative mode, spheroidal cementite particles grow directly from the undissolved carbides in the austenite phase. The transformation product is a fully spheroidized microstructure. In this study, the parameters promoting the occurrence of DET in a hypereutectoid steel (austenitization temperature, cooling rate, presence of proeutectoid cementite in the initial microstructure) were investigated. It is shown that low undercooling levels and a homogenous distribution of fine carbides in the austenite promote the DET over the lamellar transformation mode. The spheroidized microstructures produced by DET lead to larger ductilities comparing to those obtained by the lamellar transformation mode. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

For the study of phase transformation temperatures of steel S 34 MnV, a differential thermal analysis and dilatometry were used in this study.

Dilatometry, however, unlike differential thermal analysis, is commonly used to determine the temperature of nonequilibrium phase transformations during cooling. Temperatures of the <b>eutectoid</b> phase <b>transformation</b> (A (c 1)) and temperatures of the end of the ferrite to austenite transformation (A (c 3)) were obtained at heating, and temperatures of the start of the ferrite formation (A (r 3)), the temperature of the start of the pearlite formation (A (r 1)) and the temperature of the start of the bainite formation (B (S)) were obtained at cooling using these methods.

To begin with, we extend the Jackson-Hunt-type calculation (previously used to analyze eutectic transformation) to <b>eutectoid</b> <b>transformation</b> by accounting for diffusion in all the phases. Our principal finding is that the growth rates in presence of diffusion in all the phases is different as compared to the case when diffusion in growing phases is absent. The difference in the dynamics is described by a factor 'ρ' which comprises of the ratio of the diffusivities of the bulk and the growing phases, along with the ratios of the slopes of the phase co-existence lines. Thereafter, we perform phase-field simulations, the results of which are in agreement with analytical predictions. The phase-field simulations also reveal that diffusion in austenite as well as ferrite leads to the formation of tapered cementite along with an overall increase in the transformation kinetics as compared to diffusion in austenite (only).

During rapid quenching, two competitive phase transformations, namely martensitic and <b>eutectoid</b> <b>transformation,</b> have occurred, and the region of <b>eutectoid</b> <b>transformation</b> is extended due to the high cooling rates involved. The beta phase decomposed into nonlamellar eutectoid product (bainite) having a globular morphology in Ti- 2. 8 pet Co and Ti- 4. 5 pet Cu (hypoeutectoid) alloys. In the near-eutectoid Ti- 5. 5 pet Cu alloy, the decomposition occurred by a lamellar (pearlite) type, whereas in Ti- 5. 4 pct Ni (hypereutectoid), both morphologies were observed. The interfaces between the proeutectoid alpha and the intermetallic compound in the nonlamellar type {{as well as between}} the proeutectoid alpha and the pearlite were often found to be partially coherent. These findings are in agreement with the Lee and Aaronson model proposed recently for the evolution of bainite and pearlite structures during the solid-state transformations of some titanium-eutectoid alloys.

40|$|There is {{interest}} in modelling the industrially important intermetallic phase transformation of Al 6 (Fe,Mn) to a-Al-(Fe,Mn) -Si that occurs during homogenisation of direct-chill cast ingots of 3 XXX aluminium alloy. The kinetics of this " 6 -to-a" transformation are studied {{to aid the}} modelling. The initial investigation uses an Al- 0. 5 Fe- 1. 0 Mn- 0. 2 Si (wt. %) alloy. The morphology of the transformation and the associated local composition changes are studied using a range of electron optical techniques, including energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (TEM), convergent-beam electron diffraction and field-emission-gun scanning electron microscopy. The <b>transformation</b> proceeds by <b>eutectoid</b> decomposition of the Al 6 (Fe,Mn) phase into a-phase and aluminium solid solution. The transformation requires intake of silicon from the surrounding matrix, which we believe is supplied along the migrating transformation front. This gives a eutectoid growth rate that is comparatively fast; hence nucleation {{is found to be}} the key rate-controlling factor. Intake of manganese is not required for transformation, but does occur on continued annealing. The morphology of transformed particles is not static: eutectoid aluminium coalesces and ripens into "Al-spots", and wetting of Al 6 (Fe,Mn) /a-phase interfaces by the matrix may ultimately lead to fragmentation of two-phase particles. Roll-bonded diffusion couples permit the study of 6 -to-a nucleation by steadily increasing the silicon content in an Al-Fe-Mn alloy (initially containing only Al 6 (Fe,Mn) particles). Nucleation is found to be sporadic. Results also indicate that the transformation preferentially nucleates at boundaries in the matrix - this is confirmed by TEM studies. If there is insufficient <b>eutectoid</b> nucleation, <b>transformation</b> is by the dissolution of Al 6 (Fe,Mn) supplying solute for the growth of a-phase.

40|$|International audienceCopper, {{manganese}} {{and essentially}} tin {{are used as}} alloying elements for obtaining cast irons with a fully pearlitic matrix in the as-cast state. Addition of tin, {{at a level of}} about 0. 10 - 0. 15 mass%, seems to be the only practical way for avoiding growth of ferrite in the stable eutectoid reaction and to fully transform the matrix of the material to pearlite in the metastable eutectoid system. While the role of copper and manganese has been previously rationalized, the way tin affects the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>transformation</b> in cast irons is still a matter of debate. The present work makes use of an assessment of the Fe-Sn system and of experimental data in the Fe-C-Sn system to evaluate the effect of tin on phase equilibria in this latter system. One ternary parameter is estimated and the resulting modification is applied to literature data on Fe-CSi- Sn equilibria. Finally, solid-state phase transformation temperatures are calculated and used to discuss experimental information dealing with pearlitic cast irons. It is proposed that pearlite formation in Sn-bearing cast irons is associated to the transient formation of a Fe 3 SnC compound which has an ordered FCC structure...|$|E
