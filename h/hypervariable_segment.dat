25|$|The mtDNA haplogroups of Europeans are {{surveyed}} {{by using a}} combination of data from RFLP analysis of the coding region and sequencing of the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segment</b> I. About 99% of European mtDNAs fall into one of ten haplogroups: H, I, J, K, M, T, U, V, W or X (Torroni et al. 1996a). Each of these is defined by certain relatively ancient and stable polymorphic sites located in the coding region (Torroni et al. 1996a)... Haplogroup H, which is defined by the absence of an AluI site at bp 7025, is the most prevalent, comprising half of all Europeans (Torroni et al. 1996a, Richards et al. 1998)... Six of the European haplogroups (H, I, J, K, T and W) are essentially confined to European populations (Torroni et al. 1994, 1996a), and probably originated after the ancestral Caucasoids became genetically separated from the ancestors of the modern Africans and Asians. Genetic studies suggest some maternal gene flow to eastern Europe from eastern Asia or southern Siberia 13,000 – 6,600 years BP. Analysis of Neolithic skeletons in the Great Hungarian Plain found a high frequency of eastern Asian mtDNA haplogroups, some of which survive in modern eastern European populations. Maternal gene flow to Europe from sub-Saharan Africa began as early as 11,000 years BP, although the majority of lineages, approximately 65%, are estimated to have arrived more recently, including during the Romanization period, the Arab conquests of southern Europe, and during the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} sequence variation of <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segments</b> of the mtDNA control region was developed. The technique uses hybridization of sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes to DNA sequences {{that have been}} amplified by PCR. The nucleotide sequences of the two <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segments</b> of the mtDNA control region from 52 individuals were determined; these sequences were then used to define nine regions suitable for SSO typing. A total of 23 SSO probes were used to detect sequence variants at these nine regions in 525 individuals from five ethnic groups (African, Asian, Caucasian, Japanese, and Mexican). The SSO typing revealed {{an enormous amount of}} variability, with 274 mtDNA types observed among these 525 individuals and with diversity values, for each population, exceeding. 95. For each of the nine mtDNA regions significant differences in the frequencies of sequence variants were observed between these five populations. The mtDNA SSO-typing system was successfully applied to a case involving individual identification of skeletal remains; the probability of a random match was approximately 0. 7 %.

40|$|AbstractInfectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis virus (IPNV), a birnavirus, is {{an important}} pathogen in fish farms. Analyses of viral proteins showed that VP 2 is the major structural and immunogenic polypeptide of the virus. All neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IPNV are specific to VP 2 and bind to continuous or discontinuous epitopes. In order to determine which parts of the protein are involved in antigenic variations, five IPNV strains were sequenced over the VP 2 coding region. Comparison of the sequences obtained with three previously published strains revealed a central variable domain (positions 183 to 335) which encompasses two hydrophilic <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segments.</b> Viral mutants which escaped neutralization were then selected with anti-VP 2 mAbs directed against discontinuous epitopes. Sequencing of three mutants revealed a single amino acid mismatch in each of them. All of these substitutions occurred in the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segments,</b> suggesting that these regions {{are involved in the}} formation of a discontinuous epitope. Finally, expression of different truncated VP 2 s inEscherichia coliallowed localization of the binding site for neutralizing mAbs which recognize continuous epitopes. One of these mAbs bound to the region adjacent to the C-terminus of the variable domain of VP 2, while two others reacted with the central and C-terminal parts of the variable domain. No antibody reacted with the N-terminus of VP 2. These results suggest that the variable domain of VP 2 and the 20 adjacent amino acids of the conserved C-terminal part are the most important in inducing an immune response for the protection of animals...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} of the fixation mechanisms of mtDNA mutations in humans, we sequenced the first <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segment</b> of the control region in 180 twin pairs and found evidence of site heteroplasmy in 4 pairs. Significant levels of two mitochondrial haplotypes differing by a single point mutation were found in two MZ pairs, and within each pair, both members had similar levels of heteroplasmy. Two DZ pairs were found in which the predominant mitochondrial haplotype differed within the pair. We measured proportions of mitochondrial haplotypes within two twin pairs and their maternal relatives, using primer extension. In both maternal lineages, most family members were heteroplasmic, and the proportions of each genotype varied widely in different individuals. We used the changes in haplotype proportions within mother-offspring pairs to calculate the size range of potential bottlenecks in mitochondrial numbers occurring during development of the offspring. In most individuals, the most likely effective bottleneck sizes ranged from 3 to 20 segregating units, though in two individuals a small bottleneck was very unlikely and there was no upper limit on its possible size. We also used the data from this study, together with unpublished data from other populations, to estimate the frequency of site heteroplasmy in normal human populations. From this, we calculated that the rate of mutation and fixation in the first <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segment</b> of the human mtDNA control region is between 1. 2 x 10 (- 6) and 2. 7 x 10 (- 5) per site per generation.

Classification of the genotypes {{has been made}} based on differences found in restriction fragment analysis of the coding region or in the sequence of the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>segment</b> I. Both methods have shortcomings, as the former may not detect all the important polymorphisms and the latter makes use of a segment containing hypervariable nucleotide positions. Here, we have used conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) to detect polymorphisms within the coding region of mtDNA from 22 Finns belonging to haplogroup U. Sixty-three overlapping PCR fragments covering the entire coding region were analyzed by CSGE, and the fragments that differed in their migration pattern were sequenced. CSGE {{proved to be a}} sensitive and specific method for identifying mtDNA substitutions. The phylogenetic network of the 22 coding-region sequences constituted a perfect tree, free of homoplasy, and provided several previously unidentified common polymorphisms characterizing subgroups of U.

Complete sequence data of the mtDNA yield a more reliable phylogenetic network and a more accurate classification of the haplogroups than previous ones.
