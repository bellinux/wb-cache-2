5|$|As an author, Soeman wrote stories which {{emphasized}} suspense and humour, {{drawing on}} Western detective and adventure fiction {{as well as}} classical Malay literature. His written Malay, with a vocabulary heavily influenced by his east Sumatran background, flowed readily and avoided excessive verbosity. Soeman's most popular work was his novel Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan (1932), whereas his short story collection Kawan Bergeloet (1941) has been considered his most interesting from a literary perspective. Though considered a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period, Soeman has been recognized with an eponymous library and his books <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> at schools.|$|E

30|$|The {{long-term}} {{effect on}} students {{deserves to be}} observed more closely as well because the test {{in the middle of}} the study which contained some independent topics is not an entirely convincing source. A recommendation would be some testing after the topic <b>has</b> <b>been</b> completed and all the videos <b>have</b> <b>been</b> watched. Of course, no other topics should be included in this testing process. Furthermore, some group which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> in a traditional manner and can be used for a suitable comparison would also be needed. In the optimal case we recommend one group which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> in a traditional manner, one group which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> by traditional videos without interactions and one group which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> by videos with interactive components. This would facilitate the analysis of how success is dependent on interactive components.|$|R

5|$|Whether {{horses were}} trained to pull chariots, to be ridden as light or heavy cavalry, or to carry the {{armoured}} knight, much training was required to overcome the horse's natural instinct to flee from noise, the smell of blood, and the confusion of combat. They also learned to accept any sudden or unusual movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one. Horses used in close combat may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught,</b> or at least permitted, to kick, strike, and even bite, thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} aimed at {{examining}} {{the effects of the}} Know-Want-Learn (KWL) strategy on primary school students’ metacognition and physics achievement. A pre-test – post-test control group design was used, where the treatment was the implementation of the KWL strategy. A physics knowledge test and a questionnaire about metacognition were administered to sixth-grade primary school students of both genders. The results obtained were treated statistically, using descriptive statistics and a paired-samples t-test, as well as an independent samples t-test. The analysis of the results obtained showed that for both variables (physics achievement and metacognition) : (1) {{there was no significant difference}} between the pre-test and post-test scores for the group of students who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> traditionally, (2) there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores for the group of students who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> by the use of KWL strategy and (3) there was a significant difference in the post-test scores between the group of students who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> traditionally and the group of students who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> by the use of the KWL strategy. Important insights about the effects of the KWL strategy in learning physics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> generated...|$|R
