5|$|A {{motto is}} a short phrase usually {{appearing}} below the shield as a statement of belief. Catholic bishops and Presbyterian churches use a motto <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> though it is rare among Anglican bishops. A notable exception is the motto on the coat of arms of Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an Orthodox monk (not an abbot) {{displaying}} personal arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would appropriately display a monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
5|$|In February 1307, Bruce reappeared {{and started}} {{gathering}} men, and in May he defeated Aymer de Valence at the Battle of Loudoun Hill. Edward, who had rallied somewhat, now moved north himself. On the way, however, he developed dysentery, and his condition deteriorated. On 6July he encamped at Burgh by Sands, {{just south of}} the Scottish border. When his servants came the next morning to lift him up so that he could eat, he died <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Canada, {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to {{petition}} the Crown for a grant of arms. Canadians who have been appointed to the Order of Canada are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including the ribbon of the Order, or should they already be armigerous, to encircle their extant arms with the ribbon. Amongst others, all members of the Privy Council are entitled to supporters <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> as are the Speakers of the House of Commons and the Senate, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Orders of Military Merit, Merit of the Police Forces, and of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic clergy may not display {{insignia}} of knighthood <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> except awards {{received in}} the Order of the Holy Sepulchre or the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. If entitled, Roman Catholic clergy may display the red Jerusalem Cross for the former or the Maltese cross for the latter behind the shield, or may display the ribbon of their rank in the order. This restriction {{does not apply to}} laymen who have been knighted in any royal or Papal order, who may display the insignia of their rank, either a ribbon {{at the base of the}} shield or a chain surrounding the shield.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the damage}} to the cerebellum, which is {{essential}} for coordinating muscle movements and balance, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy experience problems in coordination, specifically <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> legs, and trunk.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{appealing}} psychological {{aspects of the}} missionary position. It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact {{than in any other}} position; and the couple can hold each other <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over. Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other's hips with their hands.|$|E
25|$|According to Weeks, Bulger {{enforced}} {{strict rules}} over the dealers who were paying him protection. The only people we ever {{put out of}} business were heroin dealers. Jimmy didn't allow heroin in South Boston. It was a dirty drug that users stuck <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> making problems with needles, and later on, AIDS. While people can do cocaine socially and still function, once they do heroin, they're zombies. Weeks also insists that Bulger strictly forbade PCP and selling to children, and that those dealers who refused to play by his rules were violently driven out of the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|These events, {{along with}} the fear of atrocities stirred up by the Nazi {{propaganda}} before, caused a mass panic among the population. Many local and refugee families killed themselves together. The suicides were either performed with guns, razor blades or poison, others hanged or drowned themselves in the Peene and Tollense rivers. Several mothers killed their children before killing themselves, or walked {{into one of the}} rivers with a rock in a backpack and their babies <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> Some families died by walking into the rivers, tied together. A local forester first shot three young children, then their mothers, then his wife and then himself, surviving as a blind man. In another recorded case, a daughter cut the wrists of her parents.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, {{they drive}} to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesley's team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police {{officers}} who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife. The narrator (Ice-T) finishes off by stating that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the newspaper or on TV.|$|E
25|$|Lyme disease, {{also known}} as Lyme borreliosis, is an {{infectious}} disease caused by bacteria of the Borrelia type which is spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that begins {{at the site of}} a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees {{are known}} for {{possessing}} great amount of muscle strength, especially <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> However, compared to humans the amount of strength reported in media and popular science is greatly exaggerated with numbers of four to eight times the muscle strength of a human. These numbers stem from two studies in 1923 and 1926 by a biologist named John Bauman. These studies were refuted in 1943 and an adult male chimp was found to pull about the same weight as an adult man. Corrected for their smaller body sizes, chimpanzees {{were found to be}} stronger than humans but not anywhere near four to eight times. In the 1960s these tests were repeated and chimpanzees were found to have twice the strength of a human when it came to pulling weights. The reason for the higher strength seen in chimpanzees compared to humans are thought to come from longer skeletal muscle fibers that can generate twice the work output over a wider range of motion compared to skeletal muscle fibers in humans.|$|E
50|$|The RKG-3 {{was adopted}} into service in 1950. A {{few years later}} it was {{replaced}} by the RKG-3M and RKG-3EM. In early 1970s the Soviet Army replaced this grenade with the RPG-18, but many other countries and guerrilla movements are still using the RKG-3 <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>armed</b> forces. It was used extensively during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.|$|R
50|$|Neonatal/pediatric {{neurosurgery}} {{is often}} required for avulsion fracture repair. Lesions may heal {{over time and}} function return.

25|$|Some {{years later}} in St. Louis McKeag runs into Lise and her daughter, who is now nearly grown. He reveals to Lise that Clay Basket is the same woman McKeag had told Lise he loved, decades earlier at Lise & Pasquinel's wedding. The townswoman convinces McKeag to confront Pasquinel about this fact, {{since it is the}} reason their friendship-partnership split so long ago. McKeag follows Lise's advice, and goes looking for Pasquinel to tell him of his love for Clay Basket. The {{brothers}} Marcel and Jacques have left on their own, while Pasquinel has taken Clay Basket and his newest daughter Lucinda (Cristina Raines) up into the mountains. In a valley on a small creek, the aged Pasquinel finally finds Lame Beaver's original vein of gold. He joyously plucks gold out of the water, having at last found what he has sought half his life. It is at this moment that McKeag arrives, as do Pawnee braves. The Pawnee shoot Pasquinel with multiple arrows and kill him. The heartbroken Clay Basket and McKeag can only watch, and then hold the dying voyageur <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within {{one week}} {{from the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, Heydrich issued an order to his Einsatzkommandos for the on-the-spot {{execution}} of all Bolsheviks, interpreted by the SS to mean all Jews. One of the first indiscriminate massacres of men, women, and children in Reichskommissariat Ukraine took the lives of over 4,000 Polish Jews in occupied Łuck on 2–4 July 1941, murdered by Einsatzkommando 4a assisted by the Ukrainian People's Militia. Formed officially on 20 August 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ukraine – stretching from prewar east-central Poland to Crimea – had become operational theatre of the Einsatzgruppe C. Within the Soviet Union proper, between 9 July 1941 and 19 September 1941 the city of Zhytomyr was made Judenfrei in three murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26–28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000–18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an incident in Bila Tserkva in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000–15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were put to death and only 260 Jews were spared. In mid-October, during the Krivoy-Rog massacre of 4,000–5,000 Soviet Jews the entire Ukrainian auxiliary police force actively participated. In the first days of January 1942 in Kharkiv, 12,000 Jews were murdered, but smaller massacres continued in this period on daily basis in countless other locations. In August 1942 in the presence of only a few German SS men over 5,000 Jews were massacred in Polish Zofjówka by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police leading to the town's complete sweep from existence.|$|E
500|$|An {{exception}} {{is made for}} Chinese bishops, who avoid using a green hat <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> since [...] "to wear a green hat" [...] is a Chinese idiom for cuckoldry.

The river Tisa flows between Banat and Bačka regions and was a strategic military frontier where the famed Šajkaši <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>armed</b> vessels patrolled the major rivers (Danube, Tisa, Drava, Sava) keeping the Ottomans at bay.|$|R
50|$|The Confederate States of America had {{legislation}} and regulations {{for the use}} of brevets <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>armed</b> forces, provided by Article 61 of the nation's Articles of War, and by their 1861 Army Regulations, which were based on the U.S. Army's 1857 version of their regulations. Although Article 61 was revised in 1862, it ultimately had no practical effect since the Confederate States Army did not use any brevet commissions or awards during its existence.|$|R
500|$|The writers {{believed}} John's {{separation from}} his sons {{throughout the season}} [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing", with Kripke likewise feeling that John was keeping Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines". His death would allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly". The writers originally intended for John to die at the episode's end, with Sam and Dean surviving the crash but John dying <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> His death, however, was pushed back into the second-season premiere because the writers deemed it too dark to kill John after everything else the brothers had gone through in [...] "Devil's Trap".|$|E
500|$|Lhermitte's last {{victim was}} her eldest daughter, Yasmin. The mother called over Yasmin {{and told her}} she had a {{surprise}} for her, just like she had done with Myriam. Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house.
