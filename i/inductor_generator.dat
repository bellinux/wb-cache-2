40|$|Background. Electric {{generators}} of {{wind turbines}} {{must meet the}} following requirements: they must be multi-pole; to have a minimum size and weight; to be non-contact, but controlled; to ensure the maximum possible output voltage when working on the power supply system. Multipole and contactless are relatively simply realized in the synchronous generator with permanent magnet excitation and synchronous <b>inductor</b> <b>generator</b> with electromagnetic excitation; moreover the first one has a disadvantage {{that there is no}} possibility to control the output voltage, and the second one has a low magnetic leakage coefficient with the appropriate consequences. Purpose. To compare machine dimensions and weight of the transformer unit with induction generators and is an opportunity to prove their application for systems with low RMS-growth rotation. Methodology. A new design of the electric inductor machine called in technical literature as machine-transformer unit (MTU) is presented. A ratio for estimated capacity determination of such units is obtained. Results. In a specific example it is shown that estimated power of MTU may exceed the same one for traditional synchronous machines at the same dimensions. The MTU design allows placement of stator coil at some distance from the rotating parts of the machine, namely, in a closed container filled with insulating liquid. This will increase capacity by means of more efficient cooling of coil, as well as to increase the output voltage of the MTU as a generator to a level of 35 kV or more. The recommendations on the certain parameters selection of the MTU stator winding are presented. The formulas for copper cost calculating on the MTU field winding and synchronous salient-pole generator are developed. In a specific example it is shown that such costs in synchronous generator exceed 2. 5 times the similar ones in the MTU...|$|E

On simulation models, the dependences of the energy produced at different speeds of wind turbines depending on {{the speed of the}} wind flow are given. It is shown that the use of auxiliary frequency converters with power up to 20 % of nominal allows to increase electricity production by 3 % to 10 % at the speed of the wind flow ≤ 5 m/S and by reducing the speed of the wind turbine in 2 times. High efficiency is provided by series connection of the rectifier and the adjustment of excitation current of the generator. For increasing the unit capacity of wind turbines WPE Aa to more than 1000 kW it is possible to use high-frequency <b>inductor</b> <b>generators</b> with a combined windings. It is shown that the frequency of the generator 125 Hz approximately twice reduced the weight of the generator when saving power.

50|$|Shellac {{was once}} used for fixing <b>inductor,</b> motor, <b>generator</b> and {{transformer}} windings, {{where it was}} applied directly to single layer windings in an alcohol solution. For multi-layer windings, the whole coil was submerged in shellac solution, then drained {{and placed in a}} warm place to allow the alcohol to evaporate. The shellac then locks the wire turns in place, provides extra insulation and prevents movement and vibration, reducing buzz and hum. In motors and generators it also helps transfer force generated by magnetic attraction and repulsion from the windings to the rotor or armature. In more recent times, synthetic resins, such as glyptol, (Glyptal), have been substituted for the shellac. Some applications use shellac mixed with other natural or synthetic resins, such as pine resin or phenol-formaldehyde resin, of which Bakelite is the best known, for electrical use.

40|$|Objectives To commemorate {{victims of}} {{electrical}} accidents {{that occurred in}} the first decades of radiology and relate these accidents to the evolution of the X-ray apparatus. Methods Digitised newspapers, scientific journals, books and reports of legal procedures were searched for electrical accidents involving X-ray systems. Information on the his-torical systems was retrieved from the scientific literature and brochures from manufacturers. Results We found 51 fatal and 62 non-fatal but serious elec-trical accidents. Most of them occurred between 1920 and 1940 and involved transformers that provided output currents well above the threshold for the induction of ventricular fibrillation. The accidents led to recommendations and regu-lations to improve safety for operators and patients, and spurred manufacturers to technical developments that culmi-nated in fully electrically shockproof systems by 1935. Conclusions Although largely forgotten, the development of the shockproof X-ray systems we take for granted today lasted about 4 decades and was associated with considerable human suffering. The complete solution of the problem is a success story of engineering realised by contributions from all parties involved. Main messages • The development of electrically shockproof X-ray systems took about 4 decades (1895 – 1935). • Between 1896 and 1920 electrical shocks from X-ray systems were common, but their consequences limited. • After 1920, transformers killed by delivering currents above the ventricular fibrillation threshold. • <b>Inductors,</b> static <b>generators</b> and high-frequency coils were generally low-current systems and safe. • We found 51 fatal and 62 serious non-fatal electrical accidents, most occurring from 1920 to 1940.

Using a three-dimensional magnetic flux distribution while maintaining low magnetic losses requires new approaches to magnetic core materials. Soft Magnetic Composites, SMC's, are compounds consisting of magnetic iron particles coated with a thin and electrically insulating layer. Compacting and shaping such particles without reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} electrical insulation layer, while maintaining the magnetic characteristics, presents a major challenge. Furthermore, new motor designs taking into account the new possibilities of SMC's have been investigated only sparingly. The state-of-the-art SMC material today does not meet current requirements. Additional efforts are needed in the following three areas: CVD powder coating processes (for electrical insulation), bulk material characterisation methods (evaluation of magnetic, structural and mechanical bulk properties) and compaction/tooling processes (for bulk material/application production). The goals for the research study included an extensive literature research, the task to design and build a fluidising bed reactor CVD (FBRCVD) system and an exploration of the possibilities to deposit standard qualities of iron powder with various metal oxide films. In the literature research, it was concluded that the amount of published work pertaining to FBRCVD was rather scarce. It was shown that an FBRCVD apparatus could be designed and built.

To protect power systems from excessive electromagnetic stresses, a prior knowledge of the maximum overvoltages that may develop is required. Transient voltages and currents in a power system can be studied by either using miniature models called Transient Network Analysers (TNAs) or from digital solution of mathematical models.
