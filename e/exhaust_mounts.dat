40|$|Removal of bioparticles from {{hospital}} isolation room {{is important in}} reducing the transmission risk of infectious diseases. An effective ventilation system is necessary to protect the patient, doctor and nurses from catching infectious diseases. The goal {{of this study was}} to select the most effective ventilation scenario for the investigated isolation room among the defined scenarios. To select the most effective ventilation scenario, the effect of air exchange rate (ACH), injection angle (Ɵ) and exhaust position on removing the exhaled bioparticles from a patient mouth during coughing process, was investigated. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) was used for predicting the air flow pattern and bioparticle transmission. Bioparticle dispersion and deposition was modelled by an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The mathematical model for air flow was the Reynold Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations with k-ɛ turbulence model. Code-Saturne was chosen as the CFD program and validated by numerical results and empirical equations. The numerical results obtained by Code-Saturne were compared to results publish in the literature. To investigate the Code-Saturne capability to predict particle deposition, particles with different diameter in the range of 1 μm to 10 μm, were injected in a channel. Non dimensional deposition velocity obtained using Code-Saturne was compared to the empirical results available in the literature. The results showed that Code-Saturne has the capability of predicting the air flow pattern, particle dispersion and particle deposition. For analyzing the results and choosing the most effective ventilation system, particle removal efficiency (PRE) and normalized particle concentration in the inhalation zone were compared. Among the six ventilation scenarios with different ACH and Ɵ, scenario with ACH= 15 and Ɵ= 45 ° was selected as the most effective. Finally, effect of exhaust position was investigated. Three scenarios were defined. The first one with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>mounted</b> on a wall near the ceiling, the second one with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>mounted</b> on a wall near the floor and the last one with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>mounted</b> on the ceiling. It is observed that the exhaust position has great influence on the air flow pattern and particle removal. It is found that an <b>exhaust</b> <b>mounted</b> on the ceiling scenario has the best particle removal efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{generation of}} relatively {{large quantities of}} electrical energy in vehicles is becoming an increasingly important issue, {{as a result of}} increasing demands of ancillary equipment and the emergence of hybrid power-train vehicles. An attractive solution to meeting these demands is to extract the electrical energy by means of a generator driven by a high-speed <b>exhaust</b> <b>mounted</b> turbine, a technology that is beginning to emerge commercially. This thesis is concerned with the design of a system, which extends this concept to enable both electrical generation and highly flexible air-management. The heart of the system is a high-speed switched reluctance machine, the rotor of which is located on a common shaft with the turbine and compressor wheels of a standard commercial turbocharger. The design synthesis of a -switched reluctance machine capable of meeting the required performance specification is particularly onerous given the harsh environment in which it operates, specifically in terms of the restricted space envelope, the high ambient temperature and the very high rotational speeds. This thesis describes the design of a switched reluctance machine for a prototype system, a procedure that encompasses the detailed analysis of centrifugal stress in the rotor, aerodynamic losses, iron loss, rotordynainic performance and dynamic performance. The design and analysis of the system is supported by experimental evaluation at both component and system level...|$|R

50|$|The P578's design can {{be traced}} back to the Climax-powered P57 (also called P48/P57) that was raced in 1961. The car's tubular {{spaceframe}} and suspension remained unchanged.

Although it produced about the same power as the Climax, BRM's unit could run up to 11,000 rpm, some 3,500 rpm faster. Mounted to the back of the engine was Colotti's new 6 speed gearbox. However, reliability problems forced BRM to revert to their own, older specification, 5 speed unit.
