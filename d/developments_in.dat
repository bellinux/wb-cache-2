5|$|The architects in the Karnataka region seem to {{have been}} {{inspired}} by architectural <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> northern India. This is evidenced {{by the fact that they}} incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting superstructures) of the Sekhari and Bhumija types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{classify}} existing approaches to analyzing theoretical and methodological aspects of innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems. We also present a new approach based on existing ones that combines advantages, eliminates drawbacks, and offers means of analyzing innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems and that presents optimal models of innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems. The authors develop and approbate - based on the case of present-day Russia - proprietary methodologies for examining innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems. It involves the calculation of an index of innovation development that reflects current levels of innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> economic systems and possibilities and perspectives related to innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> economic systems in the near future. The authors classify approaches to the analysis of theoretical and methodological aspects of innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems as criteria on innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> economic systems. Within this classification, the authors distinguish between and conduct comparative analyses of the following three main approaches: plan-factual, ranking, and indexing, which involve making various theoretical assumptions on innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems and on the use of various methodologies. The authors present a new approach to the analysis of theoretical and methodological aspects of innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems that eliminate drawbacks of existing approaches and that present unique advantages (simple calculations and universal use). In turn, an optimal model of innovation <b>development</b> <b>in</b> modern economic systems is offered...|$|R
