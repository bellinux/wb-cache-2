500|$|On August 4, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{visited the}} {{construction}} site and {{was impressed by the}} project and its purpose. He gave a speech to workers and spectators, closing with this statement: [...] "I leave here today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken; that we are going ahead with a useful project, and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> through for the benefit of our country." [...] Soon after his visit, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and Six Companies, Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam. Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of Parker Dam. The new design, chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver, included several improvements, one of which was the irrigation pumping plant.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{campaign}} for Wired.com, Emma Grey Ellis called it [...] "a relentless marketing siege of every platform you would think of—and some you didn’t ... as crazy and unrelenting as it all is, isn’t this exactly what we want from Deadpool?" [...] Bobby Anhalt at Screen Rant called it possibly [...] "the best film marketing campaign {{in the history of}} cinema", and noted that Deadpool's fourth wall breaking allowed [...] "the marketing team [...] make stunts that appear as though the character himself is crafting them." [...] HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed {{the campaign}}'s success to Reynolds, as well as Fox embracing the film's R rating. He concluded that, [...] "More than anything the Deadpool marketing campaign managed to create a relationship with the people who ended up <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> They were honest, creative, and completely relentless." [...] Alisha Grauso of Forbes felt the campaign's success came from the marketing team understanding the character, having freedom from the usual creative constraints put on film marketers, and not revealing much of the film's actual content. Grauso also praised the marketing team for utilizing Reynolds, and said, [...] "Audiences have been more than ready for the weird and wild, and that's the point—Fox was smart enough to see that and run with it. Most marketing campaigns don't give audiences credit for being all that intelligent or open-minded, but {{the campaign for}} Deadpool didn't hold back ... was just like the character himself. Unpredictable, non sequitur, hilarious, perverse, and popping up in the strangest of places." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid-2014, Monáe had an {{interview}} with Fuse where she teased a follow up to The Electric Lady. [...] "I'm working on a new, cool creative project called 'Eephus, she said. [...] "It's a big concept and you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> coming. It'll just land." [...] Later in 2014, Monáe was featured on Sérgio Mendes' latest album, Magic. She sings on the track titled [...] "Visions of You".|$|E

When Huey, Dewey and Louie tell Donald that the missiles hit the [...] "dark" [...] (far) side of the Moon, Donald is thankful no one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> — [...] "For a minute there, I {{thought we were going}} to have some legal problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, {{rejected}} {{these interpretations}} of the film, saying, [...] "The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, {{so how can you}} say it glorifies war?... I really don't get it." [...] He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that [...] "In the end, people see what they want to see. If you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what." [...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E

500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that my children are frightened of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|R

60|$|It {{was late}} {{when he went}} home, but Mr. Corey had not yet returned, and {{he had time to}} sit down and write the letter which he had decided to send to Statira, instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her. <b>It</b> was not easy to write, but after many {{attempts}} he wrote it.|$|R
500|$|In Canada, public {{sentiment}} widely supported the players. Opinion polls {{taken in the}} aftermath of the brawl saw 87–92% of respondents supporting their actions. Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that [...] "I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that they get them. Imagine how these Russians engineered this whole thing over there just because they've got a lousy team and were scared to go home finishing in sixth place." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{went down}} to breakfast, where Eustace {{appeared}} in full hunting trim, but Harold in the rough coat and long gaiters that meant farming work; and to Eustace's invitations to the run, he replied by saying he heard that Phil Ogden had been {{to ask him about}} some difficulty in the trenching work, and he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> So he spent the daylight hours in one of those digging and toiling tasks of his [...] "that three day-labourers could not end."

Now that they find we can't be bought, they'll try the other way. They mean business sure enough. But, by George, let 'em!

6000|$|I {{thought you}} would {{understand}} that in sending the card for the box I sent an assurance {{that there was nothing}} amiss.

60|$|It was {{the eldest}} Arlington girl's quite audible remark that pa could have eaten two helpings of pudding {{while he had}} been talking, that caused Mr. Arlington to lose the thread of his discourse.
