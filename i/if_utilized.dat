This is only true for specific hybrid systems. There have been hybrids which have used chlorine or fluorine compounds as oxidizers and hazardous materials such as beryllium compounds mixed into the solid fuel grain.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that inducing selective amnesia for particular events or stimuli in patients may be an effective tool in psychotherapy. Alexander (1953) found that administering electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to patients suffering from a traumatic life event induces selective amnesia for the traumatic event without effecting the patient’s surrounding memories. This finding, as well as other similar findings, has been used to form a hypothesis concerning the mechanisms underlying ECT. This hypothesis states that the most decisive effect of ECT is the arousal of the active defensive operations in the brain. They further hypothesize that the arousal of these operations makes ECT an effective treatment for depression and other psychotic disorders in which the brain’s defensive operations are ineffective. This hypothesis would also explain why ECT is an ineffective treatment for disorders in which the defensive operations are overactive such as anxiety disorders. Thus, selective amnesia, <b>if</b> <b>utilized</b> under the correct circumstances, may be useful in a therapeutic setting.|$|E
50|$|From a {{religious}} standpoint, {{the encouragement of}} organ donation or acceptance may vary.

This has been widely debated in Japan where the first heart transplant took place in 1968 and the patient died {{a few months after the}} procedure. Since then, more transplantation procedures have taken place but it is still a controversial subject. Transplantation in naturalist religions and cultures such as Native Americans, Buddhists, and Confucianists tend to dissuade the use of living donors and transplantation. The body is idealized as a home for a soul and the organs belonging to a person are considered perverse <b>if</b> <b>utilized</b> by another person. No religion specifically outlaws the use of beating heart cadavers or prefers them to non beating heart cadavers. Western cultures more widely accept the use of transplantation by beating heart cadavers than more conservative cultures. The main concern of many religions and cultures is ensuring the body is not objectified or disrespected in harvesting and transplantation of organs.|$|E
