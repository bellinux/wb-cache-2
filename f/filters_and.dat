40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{interference}} of noise, filtering technology {{is applied to}} achieve gravity anomaly for airborne gravimetry. Kalman <b>filtering</b> <b>and</b> smoothing are discussed and implemented for data processing of airborne gravimetry in this paper. Firstly, the algorithms of Kalman <b>filtering</b> <b>and</b> smoothing are introduced. Then, the system model for solving the gravity anomaly is established {{which is based on}} the dynamic equation and the hardware design equations. Finally, the result of Kalman <b>filtering</b> <b>and</b> smoothing would be compared with digital FIR low pass <b>filter,</b> <b>and</b> it is proved that Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> smoother could obtain more accurate result than FIR low pass filter as that the solving error of Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> smoother is improved within 1 mGal compared with the theory standard obtained by GT- 1 A software...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} network-based modelling, <b>and</b> fault {{detection}} <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> controller coordinated design for an unmanned surface vehicle. A network-based {{model for the}} unmanned surface vehicle subject to actuator faults and wave-induced disturbances is established {{for the first time}} by introducing an observer-based fault detection <b>filter,</b> <b>and</b> considering network-induced characteristics such as delays and packet dropouts in the control station-to-actuator communication network channel. Based on this model, network-based fault detection <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> controller coordinated design criteria are derived to asymptotically stabilize the residual system. The designed network-based fault detection <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> controller can guarantee the sensitivity of the residual signal to faults and the robustness of the unmanned surface vehicle to external disturbances.

5|$|In the {{diffused}} lighting camouflage project, the Royal Canadian Navy experimented with variable counter-illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships' silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight. During the experiments, {{one side of}} the test ship was faintly illuminated by projectors mounted outboard.

The ship's visibility was reduced, but the technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E

5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including <b>filters,</b> <b>and</b> microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex <b>filters</b> <b>and,</b> as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital <b>filters,</b> <b>and</b> comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
