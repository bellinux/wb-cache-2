40|$|By {{referencing}} {{the historical}} record to expose the NCAA’s one-year rule and per sport scholarship limits as cost-cutting, anticompetitive measures imposing harmful effects upon scholarship-seeking student athletes, this Note argues that despite the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana’s unfavorable ruling in Agnew v. NCAA, a Sherman Act claim against the NCAA linking bachelor’s degrees and scholarships could be legally viable. In particular, just application of the quick look rule of reason, an abbreviated form of antitrust analysis, could lead a court to find the NCAA’s one-year rule and per sport scholarship caps as violative of Section I of the Sherman Act. This follows from {{the origins of the}} targeted scholarship rules in a horizontal agreement among NCAA members informed by motives of crass commercialism, not the romantic NCAA values of amateurism and the educated athlete. A court mindful of this legacy, and possessing evidence of the anticompetitive results that these rules have brought about, could fairly find the one-year rule and per sport scholarship caps to be <b>illegal</b> <b>restraints</b> of trade meant to boost NCAA member revenues at the expense of their student-athlete consumers...|$|R
40|$|A casual {{glance at}} the daily {{newspapers}} would suggest that athletes and sports teams spend almost as much time squaring off in the courts as they do on the playing fields. Professional football players complain that the teams for which they play and the National Football League have conspired to impose <b>illegal</b> <b>restraints</b> {{on their ability to}} offer their services to other teams. A baseball team went to court to challenge the decision by the now-deposed Commissioner of Baseball to shift it from one division to another. College players, coaches, and universities all contend that various rules imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association are unlawful. The list seems endless. Principal among the theories asserted by plaintiffs in many of these cases is that these practices violate the antitrust laws. Yet, challenges in the sports world which assert claims arising under the antitrust laws are nothing new; indeed, they extend back over seven decades. Ever since, courts have sought to adjust the needs of athletes, teams, and sports leagues to the frequently conflicting goals of competition promoted by the antitrust laws. This Article will review many of these past disputes, as well as provide an overview for analysis of the new disputes, which inevitably will arise in the future...|$|R

40|$|Restraints {{are usually}} {{used for the}} {{protection}} of patients and others when medication and verbal therapies are insufficient to control potentially violent patients. Many fear the abuse of restraints as well as their psychological, physical and emotional consequences. In South Africa, according to the Mental Health Care Act No. 17 of 2002, the use of restraints is permissible but subject to certain regulations. Restraint may not be used any longer than is necessary to prevent serious bodily harm to the patient or others. When restraint has the desired effect of settling the patient’s behaviour to the point where control is regained, its further imposition is <b>illegal.</b> <b>Restraints</b> may be classified into three main categories: (i) environmental restraints; (ii) physical restraints; and (iii) chemical restraints. There is much debate over what types of restraint are superior. There may be differences in cost, risk of serious staff injury, requirements of staff time for monitoring and implementation, and impacts on staff and patient attitudes. It is hoped that the use of environmental and physical restraint will be rendered obsolete by advances in the field of psychiatry such psychopharmacology and the therapeutic milieu. In order to reach this goal more research needs to be done on restraint practices across a wide range of psychiatric treatment settings...|$|R

This Note argues that Section 2 (b) of the GPL, which requires that sublicenses be granted at no charge, is a permissible price restraint. The justification for this is [...] . nothing. Or, rather: a price of nothing on future distributions can and should be distinguished from non-zero prices. Although the vast majority of price-fixing is per se <b>illegal,</b> <b>restraints</b> on price that are necessary to achieve important procompetitive goals may be evaluated under the less restrictive rule of reason, which weighs the anticompetitive consequences of a practice against the procompetitive results. Part I demonstrates that GPL-based software could not be freely shared and modified without Section 2 (b) 2 ̆ 7 s restriction on price. The import of this is that Section 2 (b) 2 ̆ 7 s restraint on price is ancillary to goals that serve competition, and thus a per se rule should not be applied. The prohibition on price-fixing arises out of two separate concerns about competition. First, antitrust law seeks to protect consumers from higher prices fixed by cartels rather than by a competitive market. Second, antitrust law relies on market competition to produce higher-quality products. The remainder of this Note demonstrates that the use of the GPL is consistent with the goals of antitrust law. Establishing that the restraint is ancillary to other considerations does not determine whether the agreement violates antitrust law; instead, the restraint 2 ̆ 7 s effect on competition must be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Section I of the Sherman Act condemns and {{declares}} <b>illegal</b> “every <b>restraint,</b> combination in form {{of trust}} or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States. ” Under the Sherman Act, agreements to fix prices between natural competitors, e. g., retailers or manufacturers, are illegal per se. So-called horizontal price-fixing agreements of this nature do not require analysis by courts {{to determine whether or}} not they damage competition because they have been declared illegal by their very nature, i. e., per se. Vertical price-fixing and vertical price restraints, e. g., agreements between manufacturers and distributors which set a minimum price at which a product can be sold, were similarly declared illegal per se in 1911 by the United States Supreme Court in the famous Dr. Miles case. Generally, most other agreements or actions which are not illegal per se but are alleged to be in violation of the Sherman Act are judged by what is known as the rule of reason. Basically, the rule of reason doctrine requires analysis of an alleged violation and the weighing of all circumstances and factors to determine whether a restriction on trade or competition unreasonably restrains competition. Those that do not unreasonably restrain competition are permitted. In 2007, ninety-six years after they established the Dr. Miles rule for vertical restraints, the Supreme Court considered again the question of how agreements between manufacturers and distributors setting minimum prices should be viewed, i. e., under the rule of reason or per se illegal.

40|$|Around the world, the {{allocation}} of individual rights in the fisheries {{has proved to be}} a successful fisheries management tool. To date, the Individual Transferable Quota [ITQ] approach has been adopted for only a few fisheries in the U. S., although there is strong support for extending the approach to others. The basic goal of the ITQ approach is to create well-defined, exclusive property rights in a fishery, giving holders of those rights the incentive to fish efficiently and manage the resource for long-term sustainable yield. The property rights allocated are often percentage shares of the total annual allowable harvest or quota for the particular fishery. The transferability of these shares is key to the ITQ approach-being marketable, the shares will come to be owned by those who will most efficiently utilize them. Analysis of the ITQ approach, however, gives rise to the question of whether ITQ programs will have effects resulting in violations of U. S. antitrust law. The Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act all serve to protect consumers from anticompetitive activity. Once shares in a fishery are placed on the market, will trading result in single-owner accumulation of shares approaching monopoly in violation of these statutes? Will impermissible domination of competition and pricing result from concentrations of shares in the hands of a few? This Article examines the legal implications of ITQs with regard to antitrust law. It begins by identifying the benefits of the ITQ approach and considering the potential anticompetitive effects of an ITQ system. It then discusses the legal requirements for finding of monopoly, <b>illegal</b> price <b>restraints</b> and other impermissible restraints on competition. The Article concludes that ITQ systems can be designed to avert the possibility of excessive accumulation of shares in the hands of a few, and that such ITQ systems are unlikely to have effects that will result in antitrust violations...|$|R
40|$|It {{requires}} no argument {{to make the}} point that price-fixing agreements, when based on invalid patents, are illegal. The proposition is almost self-evident. Mere paper patents, surely, afford no sanctuary for the otherwise <b>illegal</b> combination in <b>restraint</b> of trade. But, of course, when the Government is plaintiff, the question is not brought up quite so bluntly; there is first a sort of preliminary question: whether the Government, having itself issued the patents, may properly be heard to question their validity. The question thus becomes a mixed one of law and morals: law, in that the courts will not interfere in certain cases with the determinations of administrative tribunals; morals, in that it is said the Government may not, in good faith, take away with its left hand that which it has given with its right. Of course, he who runs will note that, by this shift, it is possible largely to obscure what the uninitiated might think was the first question, that is, whether anti-monopoly legislation is to be fully enforced in the public interest. Unfortunately, that question simply cannot be reached at once, it would seem, if at all. And anyone can see that if the Government may not contest the validity or scope of the patents used by the members of industry to support their various price-fixing schemes, the result will be that a considerable area of the public domain has been set aside in which such combinations, although 2 ̆ 2 illegal, 2 ̆ 2 may operate with impunity...|$|R

Agreements among strikers to take peaceable means to induce others to remain away from the works of an employer until he yields {{to the demands of the}} strikers are not held to be conspiracies under the common law, and the carrying out of such a purpose by peaceable persuasion and without violence, intimidation or threats, is not unlawful. However, any interference with the constitutional rights of another to employ whom he chooses or to labour when, where or on what terms he pleases, is illegal. The boycott has been held to be an <b>illegal</b> conspiracy in <b>restraint</b> of trade. The statutory enactments of the various states concerning labour disturbances are in part re-enactments of the rules of common law and in part more or less departures from or additions to the established principles. The list of such statutory enactments is a large one, and includes laws relating to blacklisting, boycotting, conspiracy against working-men, interference with employment, intimidation, picketing and strikes of railway employees; laws requiring statements of causes of discharge of employees and notice of strikes in advertisements for labour; laws prohibiting deception in the employment of labour and the hiring of armed guards by employers; and laws declaring that certain labour agreements do not constitute conspiracy.

Since the attack was a facial one, and the state law required no per se violations, no preemption could occur. The Court also rejected the possibility of preemption due to Sherman Act violations stemming from misuse of the statute. The Court stated that rather than imposing [...] "irresistible economic pressure" [...] on sellers to violate the Sherman Act, the statute [...] "appears firmly anchored to {{the assumption that the}} Sherman Act will deter any attempts by the appellants to preserve their [...] [...] [...] price level one state by conspiring to raise the prices at which liquor is sold elsewhere in the country."
