40|$|Semiotics can be {{a useful}} {{paradigm}} in HCI research and yet the cognitive process of semiosis is difficult to uncover and empirically study. Thus {{in the domain of}} HCI semiotics has largely remained a descriptive theory, able to provide a theoretical basis for the study of interfaces and interaction, but unable to produce empirical data and generative research. This work, made up of several studies, aims to investigates human errors motivated by the problems of medical interfaces. It takes an empirical approach to investigate the interplay between semiotic signs and human error, attempting to uncover how signs in the interface may affect the use of interactive devices. Interfaces are created from signs, collections of symbols, icons and indices which form a semiotic scene, a meaningful whole through which the user may interact with the underlying system. Therefore interaction with an interface relies heavily on the process of semiosis. The first study in this thesis was a questionnaire study looking at number pads as <b>indurate</b> signs for calcu- lators and telephones. The questionnaire was designed to ascertain how users interpreted number-pads and what features of the number-pad influenced this interpretation. We found that the layout of the numerical buttons on a number-pad {{had little to do with}} how the number-pad was perceived, and that the users based their assumptions about the use of the interface based entirely upon the extra contextualizing non-numerical buttons. The wish to use a semiotic paradigm in an empirical study demanded the exploration of a novel experimental methodology. The next set of studies were experiments to see whether the interpretation of <b>indurate</b> signs could be overcome under pressure. Thus we used a computer game based experiments as it was thought that they would allow for the complete control and manipulation of signs within the experimental environment, and encourage more natural semiosis that one might expect from participants in a real life task based explicit ex- periment. In these studies it was found that under pressure participants fell back upon the culturally fossilized meanings of the <b>indurate</b> signs they encountered, suggesting that <b>indurate</b> signs may cause misinterpretation in human-machine interaction if used ineffectively. Overall this thesis makes a contribution to semiotics by exploring the notion of <b>indurate</b> signs and how they are interpreted, by investigating what features of common interfaces affect semiosis, and by attempting to further the course of empirical semiotic studies. This thesis also contributes towards the use of computer games as a research tool by charting the evolution of the game based experimental methodology over the course of this thesis. ...|$|R

The rash is red, and may be warm, but is generally painless. Classically, the innermost portion remains dark red and becomes <b>indurated</b> (is thicker and firmer), the outer edge remains red, and the portion in between clears, giving the appearance of a bull's eye.

[...] This was the first official description that approached the modern concept of the San Joaquin series. [...] Subsequent field and laboratory studies have led to further revisions and to the present concept given in the 1996 series description.In 1983, the type location for the San Joaquin soil was relocated to a site north of Lodi, California, in San Joaquin county.

The part of the valley in which the following beds are seen is near Potrero Seco. Bed 5, compact, fine-grained, pale greenish-grey, non- calcareous, <b>indurated</b> mudstone, easily fusible into a pale green and white glass. Bed 6, purplish, coarse-grained, hard sandstone, with broken crystals of feldspar and crystallised particles of carbonate of lime; it possesses a slightly nodular structure. Bed 7, blackish-grey, much <b>indurated,</b> calcareous mudstone, with extraneous particles of unequal size; the whole being in parts finely brecciated. In this mass there is a stratum, twenty feet in thickness, of impure gypsum. Bed 8, a greenish mudstone, with several layers of gypsum. Bed 9, a highly <b>indurated,</b> easily fusible, white tuff, thickly mottled with ferruginous matter, and including some white semi-porcellanic layers, which are interlaced with ferruginous veins.

I {{will not attempt to}} estimate the thickness of the strata in the gypseous formation hitherto described, but it must certainly be very many hundred feet. Bed 11 is at least 800 feet in thickness: it consists of thin layers of whitish, greenish, or more commonly brown, fine-grained, <b>indurated</b> tuffs, which crumble into angular fragments: some of the layers are semi-porcellanic, many of them highly ferruginous, and some are almost composed of carbonate of lime and iron with drusy cavities lined with quartzf-crystals.

Parts are calcareous, and there are numerous veins of highly crystalline carbonate of lime charged with iron. The mass has a nodular structure, and is divided by only a few planes of stratification: there are, however, two layers, each about eighteen inches thick, of a dark brown, finer-grained stone, having a conchoidal, semi-porcellanic fracture, which can be followed with the eye for some miles across the country.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} tepetates {{found in the}} Glacis de Buenavista, Morelos is hereby presented. The section of study (Ahuatenco) {{includes}} a sequence of seven <b>indurate</b> horizons (tepetate layers), underlying a polygenetic and well-developed Luvisol. In this work tepetates are considered as products of erosion-sedimentation and pedogenetic processes. Therefore they are interpreted as paleosols with different degrees of development. Macro and micromorphologic evidences indicate that the tepetate profile is constituted by a mixture of fresh coarse volcanic material, redeposited fragments of soil and pedogenetic features, which include: clay cutans, Fe-Mn nodules, weathered primary minerals and phytoliths accumulated within the layer matrix. These properties show that tepetates were exposed at the surface for a sufficient time to allow pedogenesis. The tepetates parent material are volcanic ashes derived from volcanic events, and eroded Bt-horizon remains from the upper portions that were redeposited along with volcanic materials. Because {{of the presence of}} these Bt-horizon fragments the clay content in <b>indurate</b> materials is high (47 %), but they display a contrasting distribution, showing lithological and textural discontinuities, so each layer is likely to represent a different stage of landscape evolution. The degree of alteration observed for the different layers vary, as well as the stability periods under which pedogenesis occurs...|$|R
30|$|One {{possibility}} is {{to imagine that}} Titan’s haze-derived organic solids get buried and subsequently lithify.

Rain may carry haze particles from their distribution across the surface through channels into either lakes or deltas, where the sediment load gets dumped. Over time those sediments could build to considerable thickness. Then overburden pressure could close up the pore space within the sediment and <b>indurate</b> it into less friable material.
