40|$|Removal of {{ice from}} roads {{is of the}} more {{challenging}} task in winter highway maintenance. The best mechanical method {{is to use a}} truck with underbody plow blade, but such equipment is not available to all agencies charged with winter maintenance operations. While counties and cities often use motor graders to scrape ice, it would be of great benefit if <b>front</b> mounted <b>plows</b> could be used effectively for ice removal. To reveal and understand the factors that influence the performance of these plows, measurement of the forces experienced by the plow blades during ice scraping is desirable. This study explores the possibility of using accelerometers to determine the forces on a front-mounted plow when scraping ice. The plow was modeled by using a dynamic approach. The forces on the plow were to be determined by the measurement of the accelerations of the plow. Field tests were conducted using an "as is" front-mounted plow instrumented with accelerometers. The results of the field tests indicate that in terms of ice removal, the front-mounted plow is not favorable equipment. The major problem in this study is that the <b>front</b> mounted <b>plow</b> was not able to cut ice, and therefore experienced no significant scraping forces. However, the use of accelerometers seems to be promising for analyzing the vibration problems of the front-mounted plow...|$|R
50|$|Locomotive {{propelled}} Jordan Ditcher/Spreaders {{are still}} sometimes used to plow especially deep {{snow in the}} US on the former Wisconsin Central railroad. These machines carry large main plows and hydraulic or air powered articulating wings to push snow {{far away from the}} tracks, sometimes past the next adjacent track to facilitate clearing snow from yards and sidings. These machines can also used to create ditches and plow the tracks clear of loose material during maintenance operations. Russell Plows are still in service at some locations, with large <b>front</b> wedge <b>plows</b> and shorter hinged air powered wings only suitable for plowing snow.|$|R
50|$|Expanding its {{agricultural}} products, in 2003 {{the company}} began production of agricultural trailers and specialist trailers (including the transport of animals, transport of timber) with a capacity from 2 to 23 ton, and manure spreaders. Pronar also specializes {{in the production of}} municipal products (communal tractors, utility trailers, sweepers, snow <b>plows,</b> <b>front</b> loaders complete with alternative facilities).|$|R
5000|$|If a front-engine {{front-wheel-drive}} layout is {{fitted with}} a four-wheel-drive, plus enthusiast driver aids, such as active front differential, active steering, and ultra-quick electrically adjustable shocks, this somewhat negate the understeer problem and allow the car to perform {{as well as a}} front-engine rear-wheel-drive car. These trick differentials, which are found on the Acura TL SH-AWD and Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro, and Audi RS5 4.2 FSI quattro, are heavy, complex, and expensive. While these aids do tame <b>front</b> end <b>plow,</b> cars fitted with these systems are still at a disadvantage when track tested against rear-wheel drive vehicles (including those with added four-wheel drive).|$|R
50|$|After Paris took Helen to Troy, Agamemnon sent Palamedes to Ithaca to {{retrieve}} Odysseus, who {{had promised to}} defend the marriage of Helen and Menelaus. Odysseus {{did not want to}} honor his oath, so he pretended to be insane and plowed his fields with salt. Palamedes guessed what was happening and put Odysseus' son, Telemachus, in <b>front</b> of the <b>plow.</b> Odysseus stopped working and revealed his sanity.|$|R
500|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front, and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into {{the point of}} occlusion, which {{is also known as}} the triple point. [...] It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. [...] In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm <b>front</b> and <b>plows</b> under both air masses. [...] In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm front and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.|$|R
50|$|When snow is too deep, {{the railroads}} call on their rotary. The plow is not self-propelled, so {{one or more}} {{locomotives}} are coupled behind it to push the plow along the line. An engine within the plow's carbody rotates the large circular assembly at the <b>front</b> of the <b>plow.</b> The blades on this wheel cut through the snow and force it through a channel just behind the disk to an output chute above the blade assembly.|$|R
50|$|In {{the speech}} Palamedes defends {{himself against the}} charge of treason. In Greek mythology, Odysseus - {{in order to avoid}} going to Troy with Agamemnon and Menelaus to bring Helen back to Sparta - pretended to have gone mad and began sowing the fields with salt. When Palamedes threw Odysseus' son, Telemachus, in <b>front</b> of the <b>plow,</b> Odysseus avoided him, demonstrating that he was sane. Odysseus, who never forgave Palamedes for making him reveal himself, later accused Palamedes of betraying the Greeks to the Trojans. Soon after, Palamedes was {{condemned}} and killed (Jarratt 58).|$|R
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm <b>front,</b> and <b>plows</b> under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|R
50|$|The first {{studbook}} for {{horses in}} Westphalia {{was founded in}} 1888, and the following year the first evaluations of stallions and mares were carried out. These inspections became the defining characteristic of the Westphalian, as they had for other warmbloods. The breeders of the best fillies were awarded a prize or premium as an incentive to keep high-quality breeding stock in the region. Only the very best colts, the young male horses that most closely fit what the local breeders wanted in a horse, were allowed to become breeding stallions. The first performance tests were held in 1905. These performance tests meant that stallions had now to not only fit a conformational model {{to be used for}} breeding, but also had to prove their worth under saddle and in <b>front</b> of the <b>plow.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Helen is abducted, Menelaus calls {{upon the}} other suitors to honour their oaths {{and help him}} to {{retrieve}} her, an attempt {{that leads to the}} Trojan War. Odysseus tries to avoid it by feigning lunacy, as an oracle had prophesied a long-delayed return home for him if he went. He hooks a donkey and an ox to his plow (as they have different stride lengths, hindering the efficiency of the plow) and (some modern sources add) starts sowing his fields with salt. Palamedes, at the behest of Menelaus' brother Agamemnon, seeks to disprove Odysseus' madness and places Telemachus, Odysseus' infant son, in <b>front</b> of the <b>plow.</b> Odysseus veers the plow away from his son, thus exposing his stratagem. Odysseus holds a grudge against Palamedes during the war for dragging him away from his home.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} drag and lift forces acting on an {{inclined}} plate {{while it is}} dragged {{on the surface of}} a granular media, both in experiment and numerical simulation. In particular, we investigated the influence of the horizontal velocity of the plate and its angle of attack. We show that a steady wedge of grains is moved in <b>front</b> of the <b>plow</b> and that the lift and drag forces are proportional to the weight of this wedge. These constants of proportionality vary with the angle of attack but not (or only weakly) on the velocity. We found a universal effective friction law which accounts for the dependence on all the above-mentioned parameters. The stress and velocity fields are calculated from the numerical simulations and show the existence of a shear band under the wedge and that the pressure is non-hydrostatic. The strongest gradients in stress and shear occur {{at the base of the}} plow where the dissipation rate is therefore highest. Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

Most cities in areas that get regular {{snowfall}} maintain a fleet of snow clearing vehicles. The first to be dispatched are gritters who do some plowing but also salt the road. The salt, via freezing point depression, helps melt the snow and ice and also gives vehicles more traction. Later, usually when the snow has ceased falling, snow <b>plows,</b> <b>front</b> end loaders with snowplow attachments and graders cover every street pushing snow {{to the side of}} the road. Salt trucks often then return to deal with any remaining ice and snow. The trucks generally travel much faster than the plows, averaging between 30 and 40 kilometers per hour. Most cities thus have at least twice as many plows as trucks. Smaller narrow body plows, with Caterpillar tracks or huge snow tires salt and clear sidewalks in some cities, but in many others with less snowfall and/or less pedestrian traffic individuals are tasked with clearing the sidewalk in front of their homes. Ecological movements often oppose this use of salt because of the damage it does when it eventually washes off the roads and spreads to the environment in general.|$|R
50|$|Mass Coastal {{operates}} {{with five}} locomotives; numbered 2006 through 2010. The 2006 is an ex-ATSF GP7u (previously BNSF 1336), the 2007 {{is a similar}} ex-ATSF GP9u (previously BNSF 1664), the 2008 is an ex-Canadian National GP9RM and the 2009 is an ex IC GP28. All Mass Coastal locomotives rotate jobs throughout the year. Usually, 1 locomotive handles the Energy Train, 2 handle the Cape Cod Central tourist trains, and the 2 others handle the Fall River and New Bedford Lines. All MC units are to eventually be equipped with cab signals, enabling them to traverse the CSX interchange in Middleborough, MA. As of September 2015, 2008 and 2009 are so equipped. All of the locomotives are painted in an attractive Cranberry Red scheme with a black band and yellow stripes and lettering. The two exceptions to the paint scheme are engines 2006 and 2007. After a main generator failure in early 2009, the 2007 re-emerged with a new generator and yellow safety stripes on the front pilots. Soon after, this the unit was transferred to Taunton. It replaced 2006 which came to Hyannis and had the yellow stripes painted on both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>plow.</b> In 2009, a fourth engine was acquired numbered 2009; A GP28 built by EMD in 1964 for the Illinois Central Railroad. This engine was purchased from National Rail Equipment in Silvis, Illinois. In late 2010, the railroad purchased their fifth locomotive, a GP50 #2010. This engine is a former Chicago North Western unit.|$|R
