5|$|Following {{the rapid}} Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire found itself {{confined}} to Asia Minor, the southern coasts of the Balkans, {{and parts of}} Italy. As Byzantium remained the Caliphate's major infidel enemy, Arab raids into Asia Minor continued throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Over time, these expeditions, launched from bases in the Arab <b>frontier</b> <b>zone</b> on an almost annual basis, acquired a quasi-ritualized character {{as part of the}} Muslim jihad (holy war).|$|E

The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the late}} Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphs, the {{frontier}} between Byzantium and the Caliphate became stabilized {{along the line}} of the Taurus-Antitaurus mountain ranges. On the Arab side, Cilicia was permanently occupied and its deserted cities, such as Adana, Mopsuestia (al-Massisa) and, most importantly, Tarsus, were refortified and resettled under the early Abbasids. Likewise, in Upper Mesopotamia, places like Germanikeia (Mar'ash), Hadath and Melitene (Malatya) became major military centers. These two regions came to form the two halves of a new fortified <b>frontier</b> <b>zone,</b> the thughur.|$|E

5|$|The young Ali ibn Abdallah {{began his}} career under his brother. In 936, Hasan invited his younger brother to his service, {{promising}} him the governorship of Diyar Bakr (the region around Amida) {{in exchange for his}} help against Ali ibn Ja'far, the rebellious governor of Mayyafariqin. Ali ibn Abdallah was successful in preventing Ibn Ja'far from receiving the assistance of his Armenian allies, and also secured control over the northern parts of the neighbouring province of Diyar Mudar after subduing the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj. From this position, he also launched expeditions to aid the Muslim emirates of the Byzantine <b>frontier</b> <b>zone</b> (the Thughur) against the advancing Byzantines, and intervened in Armenia to reverse growing Byzantine influence (see below).|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{division}} {{between east and}} west Wessex continued to be important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood Forest on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and Winchester in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus changed it from royal demesne, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a <b>frontier</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{disastrous}} Battle of Yarmouk in 636, the Byzantine Empire withdrew {{the bulk of}} its remaining forces from the Levant into Asia Minor, which was shielded by the Taurus Mountains from the Muslim expansion. This left the field open for the warriors of the nascent Rashidun Caliphate to complete their conquest of Syria, with Egypt too falling shortly after. Muslim raids against the Cilician <b>frontier</b> <b>zone</b> and deep into Asia Minor began as early as 640, and continued under Mu'awiya, then governor of the Levant. Mu'awiya also spearheaded {{the development of a}} Muslim navy, which within a few years grew sufficiently strong to occupy Cyprus and raid as far as Kos, Rhodes and Crete in the Aegean Sea. Finally, the young Muslim navy scored a crushing victory over its Byzantine counterpart in the Battle of Phoenix in 655. Following the murder of Caliph Uthman and the outbreak of the First Muslim Civil War, however, Arab attacks against Byzantium stopped. In 659, Mu'awiya even concluded a truce with Byzantium, including payment of tribute to the Empire.|$|E

5|$|Preoccupied with {{trouble in}} Khurasan, Harun now {{accepted}} tribute and made peace. An exchange of prisoners was also arranged and {{took place during}} the winter at the two empires' border, on the Lamos river in Cilicia; some 3,700 Muslims were exchanged for the Byzantines taken captive in the previous years. During Harun's absence in Khurasan, however, Nikephoros used the opportunity to rebuild the destroyed walls of the towns of Safsaf, Thebasa, and Ancyra. The following summer he launched the first Byzantine raid for two decades; into the Arab frontier district (thughur) in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided and took prisoners as it went, even capturing the major Abbasid stronghold of Tarsus. At the same time, another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian thughur and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of Melitene, while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in Cyprus. Harun retaliated with a massive invasion in 806, which forced Nikephoros to come to terms, but the Byzantine ruler soon violated them and prevailed over the Abbasid expeditions sent against him in 807. Following renewed trouble in Khurasan, a peace treaty was signed in 808 which left the Byzantine <b>frontier</b> <b>zone</b> intact and ended the payment of tribute to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, al-Muwaffaq {{also had to}} confront the {{challenge}} posed by the ambitious governor of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun. The son of a Turkish slave, Ibn Tulun had been the province's governor since the reign of al-Mu'tazz, and expanded his power further in 871, when he expelled the caliphal fiscal agent and assumed direct control of Egypt's revenue, which he used to create an army of ghilman of his own. Exploiting the rift between the increasingly powerless Caliph and his brother with demonstrations {{of support for the}} former, and relying on his powerful army, Ibn Tulun managed to gain control over Syria and the <b>frontier</b> <b>zone</b> with the Byzantine Empire (the Thughur). By 882, he governed as a de facto independent ruler, adding his own name to the coins alongside the names of the Caliph and his heir. Al-Muwaffaq tried to counter Ibn Tulun's advances by naming the trusted Musa ibn Bugha as governor of Egypt, but lack of funds foiled his plans, allowing Ibn Tulun to consolidate his power in the west. In 882, al-Mu'tamid tried to escape from Samarra to seek sanctuary with Ibn Tulun, but was apprehended and placed under effective house arrest. This event opened the rift between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq even further. Ibn Tulun tried to declare jihad against the regent, and the latter had curses against the Tulunid read in the mosques across the Caliphate. After Ibn Tulun's death in 884, al-Muwaffaq attempted again to retake control of Egypt from Ibn Tulun's successor Khumarawayh. Khumarawayh however defeated an expedition under Abu'l-Abbas, and extended his control over most of the Jazira and Cilicia as well. In 886, al-Muwaffaq was forced to recognize the Tulunids as governors over Egypt and Syria for 30 years, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 gold dinars.|$|E
5|$|In 828, al-Ma'mun {{appointed}} Abu Ishaq {{as governor}} of Egypt and Syria in place of Abdallah ibn Tahir, who departed to assume the governorship of Khurasan, while the Jazira and the <b>frontier</b> <b>zone</b> (thughūr) with the Byzantine Empire passed to al-Abbas. Egypt had just been brought back under caliphal authority and pacified after the tumults {{of the civil war}} by Ibn Tahir, but the situation remained volatile. When Abu Ishaq's governor, Umayr ibn al-Walid, tried to raise taxes, the Nile Delta and Hawf regions rose in revolt. In 830, Umayr tried to forcibly subdue the rebels, but was ambushed and killed along with many of his troops. With the government troops now confined to the capital Fustat, Abu Ishaq intervened in person, at the head of his 4,000 Turks. The rebels were soundly defeated and their leaders executed. In 831, however, soon after his departure, the revolt flared up again, this time encompassing both the Arab settlers and the native Christian Copts under the leadership of Ibn Ubaydus, a descendant of one of the original Arab conquerors of the country. The rebels were confronted by the Turks, led by al-Afshin. Al-Afshin conducted a systematic campaign, winning a string of victories and engaging in large-scale executions: the male Copts were executed and their women and children sold into slavery, while the old Arab elites who had ruled the country since the Muslim conquest of Egypt were practically annihilated. In early 832, al-Ma'mun came to Egypt, and soon after that the last bastion of resistance, the Copts of the coastal marshes, were subdued.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} bounded polities is {{dominated}} by research which focuses on those landscapes and those sites believed to lie at the territorial core, often overlooking the 'bounded' nature of these units. This research, in contrast, advocates that for {{a new perspective on}} the development of socio-political units, studies which concentrate on <b>frontier</b> <b>zones</b> should be prioritised. Consequently this thesis refocuses attention on the <b>frontier</b> <b>zones</b> between polities, proposing a methodology for working in and identifying <b>frontier</b> <b>zones</b> and promoting these areas as dynamic landscapes, integral to the emergence, development, and maintenance of socio-political units during the early medieval period. This methodology combines investigation of the distribution of distinct material culture, burial practices, and patterns of landscape use with an approach more frequently used by anthropologists â the identification of processes characteristic of frontier environments. The Avon Valley, the landscape through which the historically attested 7 th century frontier between the Hwicce and Mercia ran, provides the ideal environment in which to explore the origins of early medieval polities. A dataset of 58 sites within this study area is analysed. The focus on the Avon Valley also aims to highlight the potential of this oft overlooked part of the country. It aims to show the wealth of archaeological and toponymic data available and the contribution this region can make {{to the study of the}} early medieval period. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the Avon Valley was divided into an eastern and western zone as early as the 5 th and 6 th centuries. This has direct implications for the later emergence of the kingdom of the Hwicce. It suggests that between these two zones lay an area of contact and coalescence. This evidence, along with conclusions drawn from comparative studies of placenames, the western Severn Valley, and the middle Trent Valley, was used to set forth two new models for kingdom formation. These models focus on the interactions between polities, foregrounding the significance of external relations alongside internal developments. </p...|$|R
