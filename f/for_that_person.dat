5|$|Suzanne Jones sees a {{substantive}} difference between active listening as originated by Gordon and empathic listening {{as recommended by}} Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said {{to let them know}} you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In modern usage, Jewish singles {{will say}} that they are looking for their bashert, meaning they are looking <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> who will {{complement}} them perfectly, and whom they will complement perfectly.

2500|$|An {{executor}} is {{the person}} appointed by a will {{to act on the}} behalf of the estate of the will maker (the [...] "testator") upon his or her death. An executor is the legal personal representative of a deceased person's estate. The appointment of an executor only becomes effective after the death of the testator. After the testator dies, the person named in the will as executor can decline or renounce the position, and {{if that is the case}} should very quickly notify the probate court registry accordingly. There is no legal obligation <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> to accept the appointment.|$|E

On the other hand, a [...] "normal" [...] temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> For example, medically frail elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a [...] "normal" [...] temperature of [...] may represent a clinically significant fever.|$|E

The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose between the candidates with the [...] "two highest numbers" [...] of electoral votes. If multiple individuals are tied for second place, the Senate may consider all of them, in addition to the individual with the greatest number of votes. The Twelfth Amendment introduced a quorum requirement of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators for the conduct of balloting.

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1940s, the {{frequency}} theory approach to probability was well accepted within the Vienna circle, {{but in the}} 1950s Karl Popper proposed the propensity theory. Given that the frequency approach cannot deal with [...] "a single toss" [...] of a coin, and can only address large ensembles or collectives, the single-case probabilities were treated as propensities or chances. The concept of propensity was also driven {{by the desire to}} handle single-case probability settings in quantum mechanics, e.g. the probability of decay of a specific atom at a specific moment. In more general terms, the frequency approach can not deal with the probability of the death of a specific person given that the death can not be repeated multiple times <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person.</b> Karl Popper echoed the same sentiment as Aristotle in viewing randomness as subordinate to order when he wrote that [...] "the concept of chance is not opposed to the concept of law" [...] in nature, provided one considers the laws of chance.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides {{acknowledged}} {{that one might}} ask: Since God knows everything that will occur before it comes to pass, does God not know whether a person will be righteous or wicked? And if God knows that a person will be righteous, it would appear impossible <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> not to be righteous. However, if one would say that despite God's knowledge that the person would be righteous {{it is possible for}} the person to be wicked, then God's knowledge would be incomplete. Maimonides taught that just as it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's essential nature, as [...] says, [...] "No man will perceive Me and live," [...] so, too, it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's knowledge. This was what Isaiah intended when [...] says, [...] "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways, My ways." [...] Accordingly, {{we do not have the}} potential to conceive how God knows all the creations and their deeds. But Maimonides said that it is without doubt that people's actions are in their own hands and God does not decree them. Consequently, the prophets taught that people are judged according to their deeds.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{its many}} {{institutional}} forms, the function {{and structure of}} ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states, [...] "ideology has no history". All ideologies constitute a subject, even though {{he or she may}} differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of [...] "hailing" [...] or [...] "interpellation". Drawing heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stage, he compares ideology to a policeman shouting [...] "Hey you there!" [...] toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a subject. The person is conscious of being a subject and aware of the other person. Thus, for Althusser, being aware of other people is a form of ideology. Within that, Althusser sees subjectivity as a type of ideology. The person being hailed recognizes himself or herself as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a [...] "mis-recognition" [...] (méconnaissance), because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born. The [...] "transformation" [...] of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza's theory of immanence. To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what his place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with Christ. From this, Althusser draws the point that in order <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>person</b> to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. For Althusser, we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.|$|E
