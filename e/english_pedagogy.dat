However, current Literature in <b>English</b> language <b>pedagogy</b> is characterized by a monolingual practice with English dominating the literature learning/teaching classroom space – thus rendering the learners’ local linguistic and cultural knowledge impotent. To remedy the situation, the study investigated a dominant local language – Bemba – for a linguistic genre suitable for use in Literature in <b>English</b> language <b>pedagogy.</b> Archival retrieval and live recording of Bemba oral traditional narratives produced the initial research data. Transcription and translation techniques created an anthology from which a bilingual resource (BR) was derived. The BR was then trialled among Grade Ten Literature in English language learners in schools in the Copperbelt province of Zambia. Focus group discussions by participants generated evaluative data whose analysis using qualitative techniques indicate that learners responded positively to the bilingual materials and approach. Teachers were equally enthusiastic, describing the bilingual approach to Literature in <b>English</b> language <b>pedagogy</b> as unique, innovative and liberating. A Linguistic Synergy theory was thus developed to account for teachers’ and learners’ experiences in a bilingual Literature in English classroom. English StudiesD. Litt. et Phil. (English...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{discusses}} interconnections between {{research methodology}} and <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy</b> {{in a recent}} study I undertook. The study was designed to deepen understandings about adolescent reading, using particular English teaching approaches to generate data, mindful that ideas about what constitutes the act of reading are often wide-ranging. I elected to work with young people who regularly read for a variety of purposes and pleasures, in order to discover what construction of reading might be brought into relief by those who count reading as a habitual pursuit amongst the many other activities with which they engage. Readers ’ representations of reading and readership were also analysed from multiple theoretical perspectives: sociocultural, spatial and historical. The article focuses specifically on some of the implications of undertaking multi-faceted research in English classrooms, raising questions about how certain kinds of <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy</b> combined with case study research may lead to different constructions of young people as readers...|$|E

40|$|College English (CE), a {{required}} course {{for college and}} university’s students in China, {{plays a significant role}} in students’ academic performance and future career success. The quality of College English instruction contributes to students’ outcomes of English proficiency.

As an instructor paying less attention to students’ English writing may have a dramatic consequence on reading instruction and thus has led to the inefficiency of improving students’ overall English proficiency. Based on professor Yan’s one year visiting scholar experience at University of Massachusetts (Boston) of the United States, especially by sitting in several English faculties’ lectures, here the author tries to illustrate new ways of improving College English instruction at colleges and universities in China.

40|$|According to the author’s {{long-term}} {{observation of}} College English {{teaching and learning}} in Harbin University of Commerce in China, vocabulary accumulation and rote learning made up the repertoire of College <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy</b> and this was also argued by Hird (1995) and many other Chinese ELT researchers (e. g. Yan &# 38; Wu, 2002). After 2007, the new syllabus and textbooks have been released and the Internet-based approach to self-directed learning has been put into practice in the on-line course. However, there still seems a distance to the fundamental change of College English teaching and learning. The biggest challenges might lie in the teachers’ understanding of these potential innovative approaches proposed in the new syllabus and textbooks and their cognition {{of the nature of}} language and learning, so the old questions turn up again: What do we teach? and How do we teach? On the basis of this background, this research puts focus on exploration of potential approaches to lexis-focused College English teaching and learning in the 2007 curriculum and some possible challenges confronting the teachers in aspects of their classroom practice. The issues to be investigated in this research are mainly involved with the essence of lexis or vocabulary in the College English curriculum and the potential approaches to innovating lexis-focused College English teaching and learning. In order to investigate these issues, two research methods are employed: namely literature review and documentary analysis. The former provides this research with a review of traditional College <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy</b> in China as well as the nature of language and learning from a lexical perspective. The latter tends to meet the answers of research questions via analysis of the syllabus-College English Curriculum Requirements 2007 and the textbook-New Horizon College English. Throughout the documentary investigation in this research, it is found out that lexis as the basis of language system and lexis teaching and learning as the core of language pedagogy have been stereotyped to underpin the College English curriculum development. Being required in the syllabus document, learner autonomy as a catchall term underpinned with scaffolding and interaction, is emphasized in the new textbook with assistance of an on-line course. In term of textbook analysis, it is also found out that most of the requirements set in the College English syllabus are applied into tasks and activities, in which skill-based learning, lexis-focused learning and autonomous learning are potentially put into focus. As for the conclusion, based on the potential challenges in front of College English teaching and learning and the findings from the documentary analysis in this research, some implications for the CE teachers are put forward. They are mainly concerned with lexis being the basis of language, the teacher being the learning-instructor and learner autonomy being the final goal of College <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Globalization and {{multicultural}} communicative settings {{have contributed to}} the expansion of English as the main international language and as a result, English as a Lingua Franca use has been on the rise. Considering this situation, the concept of English as a Foreign Language seems to no longer fulfill the needs of our multicultural society in constant transformation. Accordingly, research in <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy</b> has also shifted from Standard English and grammatical correctness approaches, to communicative competence and communicative effectiveness. Nowadays, learning English is a two-way process in which the goal for many (depending on the students and aims) is to achieve intercultural communicative competence in order to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes and critical cultural awareness necessary to communicate. The essential shift has therefore been from an approach aimed at achieving fixed "forms", to a method in which we learn how to "function" accordingly with the language in variable contexts. ...|$|E

Their article focuses on a literature unit where ‘culturally salient’ texts were chosen to promote, not only a reading of the word but of the world (Freire, 1970). A culturally salient text, as understood by Kress (1995), is one that allows us to ask questions about its significance in its own cultural domain and for other cultures.

30|$|Despite the {{resources}} expended, English language teaching (ELT) {{in the official}} curricula of Asian countries is often criticized for being insufficient to enable learners to communicate in English; therefore, countries such as China (Luxia 2005), Japan (McKenzie 2010), and Sri Lanka (Wall and Alderson 1993) have launched new ELT curricula to remedy the situation. Out of similar concerns with the outcomes, ELT in Iran has undergone three major reforms since 1939 (Foroozandeh and Forouzani 2015), the most recent of which introduced in 2010. This reform was intended to shift the focus of teaching and testing from language forms to meaning and communication. The new policy is realized in {{the introduction of a}} new series of English textbooks called Prospect, intended to foster in Iranian junior high school students the ability to communicate in English, not to merely offer knowledge of language forms (Khadrir-Sharabyan et al. 2014).

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the critiques of critical multiculturalism of the well-established notion of liberal multiculturalism. Drawing insights from a critical theory, critical multiculturalism attempts to challenge and deconstruct the basic constructs such as culture and knowledge {{from the perspective}} of liberal multiculturalism. From this line of inquiry, I proceed to argue that English language education in the Indonesian context still clings to the spirit of liberal multicultural orthodoxy, which is evident from the <b>English</b> <b>pedagogy</b> policy, teaching and research. I then suggest that by adopting a critical perspective of multiculturalism, and hence critical multiculturalism as a framework of thinking, we can help raise teachers ‟ awareness to adopt critical teaching and research practices that not only value the multiplicity of students ‟ cultures but also resist linguistic and cultural determinism prevalent especially in academic writing practice. To demonstrate the possibility of resistance against the hegemonic forces of linguistic and cultural determinism, I present case studies of multilingual student writers in their search of the politics of identity in academic writing...|$|E
