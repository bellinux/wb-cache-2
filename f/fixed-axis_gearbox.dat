40|$|AbstractPlentiful {{work has}} been done for {{condition}} monitoring (CI) and fault diagnosis of fixed-axis gearboxes. However, still it is found that articles citing condition indicators for fault diagnosis of gearboxes are less in quantity, in academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. The specialty of condition indicators is to provide accurate information regarding the condition of various components at different levels of damage (initial, heavy or growing). Here, these indicators are addressed domain-wise and their characteristics are stated. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review and encapsulate this literature to provide a wide and good reference for researchers to be utilized. The structure of a <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox</b> is briefly introduced. The unique behaviors and fault characteristics of <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox</b> is recognized and studied. Investigations on the basis of statistical indicators are also summarized based on the adopted methodologies. Lastly, open problems are stated and further research prospects pointed out...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the direct}} current (DC) offset {{cancellation}} and S transform-based diagnosis method is verified using three case studies. For DC offset cancellation, correlated kurtosis (CK) {{is used instead}} of the cross-correlation coefficient {{in order to determine}} the optimal iteration number. Compared to the cross-correlation coefficient, CK enhances the DC offset cancellation ability enormously because of its excellent periodic impulse signal detection ability. Here, it has been proven experimentally that it can effectively diagnose the implanted bearing fault. However, the proposed method is less effective in the case of simultaneously present bearing and gear faults, especially for extremely weak bearing faults. In this circumstance, the iteration number of DC offset cancellation is determined directly by the high-speed shaft gear mesh frequency order. For the planetary gearbox, the application of the proposed method differs from the <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox,</b> because of its complex structure. For those small fault frequency parts, such as planet gear and ring gear, the DC offset cancellation’s ability is less effective than for the <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox.</b> In these studies, the S transform is used to display the time-frequency characteristics of the DC offset cancellation processed results; the performances are evaluated, and the discussions are given. The fault information can be more easily observed in the time-frequency contour than the frequency domain...|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate vibration signals of gears with tooth pitting covering multiple teeth, investigate pitting effects on vibration properties and provide effective features for pitting growth estimation. The scope of this paper is limited to a <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox</b> with a single pair of spur gears. A dynamic model is used to investigate the effects of tooth pitting growth on vibration properties of a gearbox. The tooth pitting propagation to the neighboring teeth is modeled. Three pitting levels are modeled: slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting. The vibration signals of a gearbox are simulated for each of the three severity levels. The vibration properties are investigated and fault symptoms are summarized. Statistical features are tested on simulated vibration signals. These features are ranked for pitting growth estimation. The features insensitive to gear mesh damping and environmental noise are recommended.|$|E
40|$|Studies on fault {{detection}} and diagnosis of planetary gearboxes are quite limited {{compared with those}} of <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> Different from <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> planetary gearboxes exhibit unique behaviors, which invalidate fault diagnosis methods that work well for <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> It is a fact that for systems as complex as planetary gearboxes, multiple sensors mounted on different locations provide complementary information on the health condition of the systems. On this basis, a {{fault detection}} method based on multi-sensor data fusion is introduced in this paper. In this method, two features developed for planetary gearboxes are used to characterize the gear health conditions, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized to fuse all features from different sensors. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are carried out on a planetary gearbox test rig, on which multiple accelerometers are mounted for data collection. The comparisons between the proposed method and the methods based on individual sensors show that the former achieves much higher accuracies in detecting planetary gearbox faults...|$|R
40|$|With the {{benefits}} of strong load-bearing capacity, compact, light weight and large transmission ratio, planetary gearboxes are widely applied {{in the fields of}} automobiles, helicopters, wind turbines, etc. However, at harsh working environments, some critical components of planetary gearboxes, such as gears and bearings, are extremely vulnerable to faults after the long-time operation, which may cause the breakdown of the entire machinery system. Vibration analysis is an efficient way for monitoring the machine conditions to avoid the catastrophic failures and facilitate maintenance plans for numerous industrial applications. However, there is still a lack of successful signal processing strategies for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults of the planetary gearbox. Because planetary gearbox comprises many rotating components that lead to signal contamination by strong background noise. Besides, the transmission path between an externally mounted sensor and fault signal source is time-varying, which means those traditional fault diagnosis methods developed for <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearboxes</b> may not work. For the purpose of solving the aforementioned bearing fault detection issues in the planetary gearbox, this thesis utilizes an internally mounted accelerometer for the vibration data collection. This thesis also develops a hybrid signal processing approach to the internal sensor-based measurement. The result shows that, in contrast to the externally mounted sensor, the internal sensor has an overwhelmingly superior performance for the inner race faults detection in the planet bearings. In addition, a novel spectral kurtosis (SK) based demodulation band selection approach is presented in this thesis. This method is introduced to address the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue from internal sensor-based measurement. It also could be further applied in other industrial cases where intense EMI appears...|$|R
30|$|Gear dynamic models {{may provide}} useful {{information}} for fault diagnosis [20]. Vibration-based time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain analyses provide powerful tools for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery [21, 22]. One traditional technique {{is based on}} statistical measurements of vibration signals [23]. Many statistical indicators were proposed for machine fault diagnosis [24 – 27]. In Liu et al. [25], 34 statistical indicators were summarized and 136 features were generated. In Zhao et al. [26], 63 statistical indicators were summarized and 252 features were produced. The features [25, 26] {{were used for the}} classification of gear damage levels of a lab planetary gearbox. In this study, 36 statistical indicators are selected from the literature. Then, 114 statistical features are generated and tested using simulated vibration signals for the pitting growth estimation of a <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The effect of gear mesh damping and environmental noise on the performance of statistical features will be analyzed.|$|E
40|$|Gear {{and bearing}} play an {{important}} role as key components of rotating machinery power transmission systems in nuclear power plants. Their state conditions are very important for safety and normal operation of entire nuclear power plant. Vibration based condition monitoring is more complicated for the gear and bearing of planetary gearbox than those of <b>fixed-axis</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Many theoretical and engineering challenges in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis have not yet been resolved which are of great importance for nuclear power plants. A detailed vibration condition monitoring review of planetary gearbox used in nuclear power plants is conducted in this paper. A new fault diagnosis method of planetary gearbox gears is proposed. Bearing fault data, bearing simulation data, and gear fault data are used to test the new method. Signals preprocessed using dilation-erosion gradient filter and fast Fourier transform for fault information extraction. The length of structuring element (SE) of dilation-erosion gradient filter is optimized by alpha stable distribution. Method experimental verification confirmed that parameter alpha is superior compared to kurtosis since it can reflect the form of entire signal and it cannot be influenced by noise similar to impulse...|$|E
