It reclassifies narcolepsy without cataplexy as major somnolence disorder (MSD).

25|$|Pharmacology is {{necessary}} for some conditions. Medication may be useful for acute insomnia and {{for some of the}} parasomnias. It is almost always needed, along with scheduled short naps and close follow-up, in the treatment of narcolepsy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Further complicating these updated {{classification}} schemes, {{overlap between}} narcolepsy with cataplexy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> {{has also been}} reported. [...] A subgroup of narcoleptics with long sleep time, comprising 18% of narcoleptics in one study, had symptoms of both narcolepsy with cataplexy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> (long sleep time and unrefreshing naps). It is believed that this subgroup might have dysfunction in multiple arousal systems, including orexin and GABA (see <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> causes).|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{differential}} diagnosis of primary (<b>idiopathic)</b> vs. psychiatric <b>hypersomnia</b> is challenging {{because of the}} lack of specific clinical or laboratory criteria differentiating these two disorders and the frequent comorbidity of mental disorders in patients with primary hypersomnia. The aim of this study was to assess whether polysom-nography aids in the {{differential diagnosis}} of these two disorders. Methods: After excluding patients taking medication and those with an additional diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing, we compared the nocturnal and daytime sleep of 82 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of either primary hypersomnia (N 5 59) or psychiatric hypersomnia (N 5 23) and normal control subjects (N 5 50). Results: During nocturnal sleep, patients with psychiatric hypersomnia showed significantly higher sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and total wake time and a significantly lower percentage of sleep time than patients with primary hypersomnia and control subjects (p,. 05). In addition, the daytime sleep of patients with psychiatric hypersomnia was significantly higher in terms of sleep latency, total wake time, and percentage of light (stage 1) sleep and lower in terms of percentage of sleep time and stage 2 sleep than in patients with primary hypersomnia and control subjects (p,. 05). The daytime sleep of patients with primary hypersomnia as compared with that of control subjects was characterized by lower sleep latency and total wake time and a higher percentage of sleep time (p,. 05). Finally, a sleep latency of less than 10 minutes or a sleep time percentage greater than 70 % in either of the two daytime naps was associated with a sensitivity of 78. 0 % and a specificity of 95. 7 %. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that psychiatric hypersomnia is a disorder of hyperarousal, whereas primary hypersomnia is a disorder of hypoarousal. Polysomnographic mea-sures may provide useful information in the differential diagnosis and treatment of these two disorders. Key words: primary hypersomnia, psychiatric hypersomnia, polysomnography.

2500|$|Given the {{possible}} role of hyper-active GABAA receptors {{in the primary}} hypersomnias (narcolepsy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia),</b> medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness. [...] These currently include clarithromycin and flumazenil.|$|E
2500|$|The 2001 International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) divides primary {{hypersomnia}} syndromes between narcolepsy, <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> and the recurrent hypersomnias (like Klein-Levin syndrome); {{it further}} divides narcolepsy into that with cataplexy and that without cataplexy. [...] This ICSD version defines narcolepsy as a disorder of unknown cause [...] "that {{is characterized by}} excessive sleepiness that typically is associated with cataplexy and other REM-sleep phenomena, such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations". It also establishes baseline categorical standards for diagnosis of narcolepsy, through 2 sets of well defined criteria, as follows.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 2001 ICSD, the {{classification}} of primary hypersomnias has been steadily evolving, as further research has shown more overlap between narcolepsy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> The 3rd edition of the ICSD is currently being finalized, and its new classification will label narcolepsy caused by orexin deficiency as “type 1 narcolepsy,” which is almost always associated with cataplexy. [...] The other primary hypersomnias will remain subdivided based {{on the presence of}} SOREMPs. They will be labeled: “type 2 narcolepsy,” with 2 or more SOREMPs on MSLT; and “idiopathic hypersomnia,” with less than 2 SOREMPS.|$|E
2500|$|Competence {{in sleep}} {{medicine}} {{requires an understanding}} of a plethora of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, {{in the absence of}} volitional sleep deprivation, [...] "is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder," [...] such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> Kleine-Levin syndrome, menstrual-related hypersomnia, idiopathic recurrent stupor, or circadian rhythm disturbances. Another common complaint is insomnia, a set of symptoms that can have many causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{test tube}} model, {{clarithromycin}} (an antibiotic approved by the FDA {{for the treatment of}} infections) was found to return the function of the GABA system to normal in patients with primary hypersomnias. Investigators therefore treated a few patients with off-label clarithromycin, and most felt their symptoms improved with this treatment. In order to help further determine whether clarithromycin is truly beneficial for the treatment of narcolepsy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was completed in 2012. [...] "In this pilot study, clarithromycin improved subjective sleepiness in GABA-related hypersomnia. Larger trials of longer duration are warranted." [...] In 2013, a retrospective review evaluating longer-term clarithromycin use showed efficacy in a large percentage of patients with GABA-related hypersomnia. “It {{is important to note that}} the positive effect of clarithromycin is secondary to a benzodiazepine antagonist-like effect, not its antibiotic effects, and treatment must be maintained.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> Also, because the {{underlying}} disease mechanism is not yet fully understood (see Causes), treatment efforts have usually focused on symptom management. Although there are several FDA-approved medications for use in narcolepsy, there are no FDA-approved medicines for <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> Therefore, the wake-promoting medications used in narcolepsy are also commonly used off-label to help manage the excessive daytime sleepiness of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> [...] "These treatments have not been studied to nearly the same extent in patients with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> and some patients with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> do not achieve adequate control of symptoms with these medications." ...|$|E
50|$|Further complicating these updated {{classification}} schemes, {{overlap between}} narcolepsy with cataplexy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> {{has also been}} reported. A subgroup of narcoleptics with long sleep time, comprising 18% of narcoleptics in one study, had symptoms of both narcolepsy with cataplexy and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> (long sleep time and unrefreshing naps). It is believed that this subgroup might have dysfunction in multiple arousal systems, including orexin and GABA (see <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> causes).|$|E
50|$|Overall, the {{medications}} currently used for <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> (all off-label) {{are far from}} satisfactory. CNS stimulants {{tend to be less}} effective for <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> than they are for narcolepsy and may be less well tolerated.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{complicating the}} {{diagnostic}} process, <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> lacks a clearly defining clinical feature. Whereas narcolepsy {{is associated with}} cataplexy and sleep-onset REM episodes, and Kleine-Levin syndrome is associated with megaphagia (compulsive food cravings) and hypersexuality, <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> has no such dramatic associated features, except perhaps sleep drunkenness. [...] "Consequently {{there has been an}} unfortunate tendency to label all difficult-to-classify cases of excessive daytime sleepiness as idiopathic hypersomnia." [...] For example, upper airway resistance syndrome and delayed sleep phase disorder were formerly confused with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> but now that they have been more clearly defined, doctors can more carefully exclude these causes of EDS in order to more correctly diagnose <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> However, [...] "even in the presence of other specific causes of hypersomnia, one should carefully assess the contribution of these etiological factors to the complaint of EDS and when specific treatments of these conditions fail to suppress EDS, the additional diagnosis of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> should be considered." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, [...] "there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT." [...] Given the newly understood overlap of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> and narcolepsy, the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also updated its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassified both <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> with and without long sleep time as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD encompasses all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low hypocretin, including not only <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> but also narcolepsy without cataplexy, and long sleepers (patients requiring >10 hours sleep/day).|$|E
5000|$|The 2001 ICSD defines <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> as [...] "a {{disorder}} of presumed {{central nervous system}} cause {{that is associated with}} a normal or prolonged major sleep episode and excessive sleepiness consisting of prolonged (1- to 2-hour) sleep episodes of N-REM"(non-rapid eye movement sleep). The ICSD initially described two clinical forms of idiopathic hypersomnia: [...] "1) a polysymptomatic form with nocturnal sleep and naps of abnormally long duration with ‘sleep drunkenness’ on awakening, and 2) a monosymptomatic form manifested by isolated EDS." [...] These forms were later described as <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> with long sleep time and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> without long sleep time, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Although the MSLT is {{currently}} the best available test to diagnose EDS in general, the MSLT protocol lacks the ability to document the extended, unrefreshing daytime naps that often occur in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> Complicating the matter, several groups of researchers have found normal MSLT results in patients who otherwise seem to have <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> Therefore, when <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> is suspected, researchers suggest appending a 24-hour continuous polysomnography to the standard overnight/MSLT study in order to record total sleep time. [...] Alternatively, an assay of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be performed {{in order to test}} for an adequate level of hypocretin (to exclude narcolepsy with cataplexy) and to determine whether the patient’s CSF abnormally boosts GABAA receptor sensitivity (thought to underlie many cases of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> and narcolepsy without cataplexy). Globally, there are very few labs capable of performing the CSF assays referenced above.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> a primary, {{neurologic}} {{cause of}} long-sleeping, sharing many similarities with narcolepsy.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{increased}} frequencies of other symptoms in patients with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> {{although it is not}} clear whether these symptoms are caused by the <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> These symptoms include palpitations, digestive problems, difficulty with body temperature regulation, and cognitive problems, especially deficits in memory, attention, and concentration. Anxiety and depression are often increased in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> most likely as a response to chronic illness. Peripheral vascular symptoms, such as cold hands and feet (Raynaud’s-type phenomena) have been noted in some patients. In addition to difficulty with temperature regulation and Raynaud’s type symptoms, other symptoms associated with autonomic dysfunction were also noted. These included: fainting episodes (syncope); dizziness upon arising (orthostatic hypotension); and headaches (possibly migrainous in quality). Food cravings and impotence have also been reported. [...] These are subjective symptoms reported by only a small number of patients. No research has been done to confirm whether they are related to <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>Hypersomnia</b> or not.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{underlying}} sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> or {{restless legs}} syndrome.|$|E

5000|$|In {{patients}} with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> polysomnography typically shows short sleep latency, increased mean slow wave sleep, {{and a high}} mean sleep efficiency. [...] "Latency to REM sleep and percentages of light sleep and REM sleep were normal, compared with normal ranges." [...] Despite this, one study has found increased sleep fragmentation in {{patients with}} <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> without long sleep time, suggesting multiple possible presentations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> profoundly affects work, education, {{and quality}} of life. Patients are often too sleepy to work or attend school regularly, and they are {{predisposed}} [...] "to develop serious performance decrements in multiple areas of function {{as well as to}} potentially life-threatening domestic, work-related and driving accidents." [...] Furthermore, these risks are higher for <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> patients than for those with sleep apnea or severe insomnia. In fact, [...] "the most severe cases of daytime somnolence are found in patients affected by narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia." [...] And <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> is often as, if not more, disabling than narcolepsy; surprisingly, excessive daytime sleepiness is even more handicapping than the cataplectic attacks of narcolepsy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> is {{a rarity}} {{in the public eye}} and has a very low level of public awareness.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} be {{effective}} in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness while improving vigilance in primary hypersomnias, such as <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early {{hydrocephalus}} {{can also}} cause severe EDS. Additionally, head trauma {{can be associated with}} a primary/central hypersomnia, and symptoms similar to those of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> can be seen within 6-18 months following the trauma. However, the associated symptoms of headaches, memory loss, and lack of concentration may be more frequent in head trauma than in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> [...] "The possibility of secondary narcolepsy following head injury in previously asymptomatic individuals has also been reported." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> {{has long}} been {{considered}} a rare disease, believed to be 10 times less frequent than narcolepsy. [...] The prevalence of narcolepsy (with cataplexy) is estimated between 1/3,300 and 1/5,000. [...] Although the true prevalence of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> is unknown, it is estimated at 1/10,000 - 1/25,000 for the long sleep form and 1/11,000 to 1/100,000 without long sleep. [...] A more precise estimate [...] "is complicated {{by a lack of}} clear biologic markers" [...] and a lack of [...] "unambiguous diagnostic criteria." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the medical}} literature, <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> {{may also be}} {{referred}} to as IH, IHS, primary hypersomnia, central hypersomnia, or hypersomnia of brain origin. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defines <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> as EDS without narcolepsy or the associated features of other sleep disorders. It occurs in the absence of medical problems or sleep disruptions, such as sleep apnea, that can cause secondary hypersomnia, and is therefore considered a subset of the primary hypersomnias, which 'are thought to arise from problems with the brain’s systems that regulate sleep and wake.' ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> is a condition, {{thought to}} be a {{neurological}} disorder, which is characterized primarily by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). It has historically been rarely diagnosed and is often very difficult to diagnose at an early stage; it is usually a lifelong chronic disease, which is often debilitating. There is a very low level of public awareness of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> which often leads to stigma for those who suffer from it. [...] There is currently no cure, but there are several off-label treatments, which are primarily FDA-approved narcolepsy medications. [...] Research funding for its study is scarce.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{possible}} role of hyperactive GABAA receptors in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> medications that could counteract this activity are being studied {{to test their}} potential to improve sleepiness. These currently include clarithromycin and flumazenil.|$|E
5000|$|Flumazenil is {{the only}} GABAA {{receptor}} antagonist on the market as of Jan 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation. It is approved by the FDA for use in anesthesia reversal and benzodiazepine overdose. However, given its pharmacology, researchers consider {{it to be a}} promising medication in the treatment of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> Results of a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial were published in November 2012. This research showed that flumazenil provides relief for most patients whose CSF contains the unknown [...] "somnogen" [...] that enhances the function of GABAA receptors, making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of GABA. For one patient, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years. [...] A 2014 case report also showed improvement in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> symptoms after treatment with a continuous subcutaneous flumazenil infusion. The supply of generic flumazenil was initially thought to be too low to meet the potential demand for treatment of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> However, this scarcity has eased, and dozens of patients are now being treated with flumazenil off-label.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia</b> is {{a lifelong}} {{disorder}} (with only rare spontaneous remissions) whose symptoms typically begin in adolescence or young adulthood. It is initially progressive, but may stabilize, and its main consequences are professional and social.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to differentiating between {{the primary and}} secondary hypersomnias, the 2001 International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) further classified the primary hypersomnia syndromes. These included <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> narcolepsy, and the recurrent hypersomnias (like Klein-Levin syndrome).|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that although sleep latencies are typically short in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> the clinical severity may not correlate closely with the MSLT results. In fact, [...] "latencies above 5 minutes are not uncommon in patients with clinically severe hypersomnia." [...] When sleep latency is below 10 minutes, the presence of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in two or more of the MSLT naps suggests a diagnosis of narcolepsy, whereas sleep periods lacking rapid eye movement (NREM sleep) in the various naps suggests a diagnosis of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia.</b> However, the importance of this differentiation between REM and NREM has been called into question.

50|$|There {{have been}} some studies {{suggesting}} levothyroxine as a possible treatment for <b>idiopathic</b> <b>hypersomnia,</b> especially for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.
