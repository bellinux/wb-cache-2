40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of including <b>illustrations</b> in beginning reading materials. Experiment 1 compared reading materials consisting solely of simple prose passages with materials consisting of the same passages plus informative <b>illustrations</b> depicting the content of each passage. Reading proficiency improved more under the no <b>illustrations</b> condition. Experiment 2 compared the informative <b>illustrations</b> with uninformative <b>illustrations.</b> Reading proficiency improved more using uninformative <b>illustrations.</b> Experiment 3 compared uninformative <b>illustrations</b> with no <b>illustrations</b> and found {{no significant differences between}} conditions. These results were interpreted within a cognitive load theory framework. It was concluded that informative <b>illustrations</b> are redundant and so impose an extraneous working memory load that interferes with learning to read...|$|R

5|$|Rothschild {{featured}} an <b>illustration</b> of the Guadeloupe amazon in his 1907 book Extinct Birds by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans, {{based on}} the early descriptions. In 1916, the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway criticised the <b>illustration</b> for differing from Du Tertre's description; Du Tertre supposedly only meant that the proximal primary feathers were yellow, whereas all the covert feathers are yellow in the <b>illustration,</b> apart from a red edge, and the head and underparts are slate.|$|E

5|$|Legend relates that in January 1297 François Grimaldi, {{disguised}} as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of François Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (<b>Illustration</b> 6) and {{in the arms of}} the House of Grimaldi where François is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (<b>Illustration</b> 2).|$|E
40|$|When {{students}} are learning to read, the materials supplied typically will include extensive <b>illustrations.</b> The implicit assumption is that the inclusion of such <b>illustrations</b> will assist students in learning to read. Cognitive load theory suggests that this way of formatting learning materials may not be maximally effective as the inclusion of <b>illustrations</b> with written text constitutes redundant information that may interfere with learning. If working memory resources are devoted to the <b>illustrations</b> rather than the text, as is likely with young children, those resources will be unavailable to decipher the text. The elimination of redundant <b>illustrations</b> may thus enhance learning to read. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of including <b>illustrations</b> in beginning reading materials. Experiment 1 compared reading materials consisting solely of simple prose passages with materials consisting of the same passages plus informative <b>illustrations</b> depicting the content of each passage. Reading proficiency improved more under the no <b>illustrations</b> condition. Experiment 2 compared the informative <b>illustrations</b> with uninformative <b>illustrations.</b> Reading proficiency improved more using uninformative <b>illustrations.</b> Experiment 3 compared uninformative <b>illustrations</b> with no <b>illustrations</b> and found {{no significant differences between}} these conditions.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} Digitalization project of signed <b>illustrations</b> in prints from {{the years of}} 1501 - 1750 held in the ASL collection, which has {{resulted}} {{in the creation of a}} database with around 3, 000 signed <b>illustrations,</b> which are the work of around 600 creators, and also 510 print containing these <b>illustrations.</b> Thanks to detailed compilation of both signed <b>illustrations</b> and printed materials in which <b>illustrations</b> are found, this database provides wide-ranging possibilities of interdisciplinary utilisation. Aside from the research possibilities that the database offers, the article is also focused on the overall characteristic of the mentioned group of signed <b>illustrations,</b> with regard to developmental changes of book <b>illustrations</b> over the course of the 16 th through the 18 th century, and to certain problems when deciphering the symbolic language of <b>illustrations</b> in the given period...|$|R
