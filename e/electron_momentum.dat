2500|$|The {{shapes of}} atomic orbitals can be {{understood}} qualitatively by considering the analogous case of standing waves on a circular drum. To see the analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane velocity and momentum at that point) must be considered relative to that point's distance {{from the center of}} the drum head. If this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals. The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electron's average momentum at that point, since high <b>electron</b> <b>momentum</b> at a given position tends to [...] "localize" [...] the electron in that position, via the properties of electron wave-packets (see the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for details of the mechanism).|$|E
