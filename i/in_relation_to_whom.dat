But Rose, for some reason or other, did not warble as usual this morning. She trod about silently, and somehow or other she was translated out of the ideality in which Septimius usually enveloped her, and looked little more than a New England girl, very pretty indeed, but not enough so perhaps to engross a man's life and higher purposes into her own narrow circle; so, at least, Septimius thought. Looking a little farther,--down into the green recess where stood Robert Hagburn's house,--he saw that young man, looking very pale, with his arm in a sling sitting listlessly on a half-chopped log of wood which was not likely soon to be severed by Robert's axe. Like other lovers, Septimius had not failed to be aware that Robert Hagburn was sensible to Rose Garfield's attractions; and now, as he looked down on them both from his elevated position, he wondered if it would not have been better for Rose's happiness if her thoughts and virgin fancies had settled on that frank, cheerful, able, wholesome young man, instead of on himself, who met her on so few points; and, <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom,</b> there was perhaps a plant that had its root in the grave, that would entwine itself around his whole life, overshadowing it with dark, rich foliage and fruit that he alone could feast upon.|$|E

5000|$|The unmoved movers, if {{they were}} anywhere, were said to fill the outer void, beyond the sphere of fixed stars: It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time, outside the heaven. Hence {{whatever}} is there, is of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; {{nor is there any}} change in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified, living the best and most self sufficient of lives… From fulfilment of the whole heavenderive the being and life which other things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy." [...] Aristotle [...] The unmoved movers are, themselves, immaterial substance, (separate and individual beings), having neither parts nor magnitude. As such, it would be physically impossible for them to move material objects of any size by pushing, pulling or collision. Because matter is, for Aristotle, a substratum in which a potential to change can be actualized, any and all potentiality must be actualized in a being that is eternal but it must not be still, because continuous activity is essential for all forms of life. This immaterial form of activity must be intellectual in nature and it cannot be contingent upon sensory perception if it is to remain uniform; therefore eternal substance must think only of thinking itself and exist outside the starry sphere, where even the notion of place is undefined for Aristotle. Their influence on lesser beings is purely the result of an [...] "aspiration or desire", and each aetheric celestial sphere emulates one of the unmoved movers, as best it can, by uniform circular motion. The first heaven, the outmost sphere of fixed stars, is moved by a desire to emulate the prime mover (first cause), <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom,</b> the subordinate movers suffer an accidental dependency.|$|E
5000|$|Kierkegaard says, {{every person}} has {{to find out for}} him or her self how guilt and sin came into their worlds. Kierkegaard argued about this in both Repetition and Fear and Trembling where he said {{philosophy}} must not define faith. He asks his reader, the single individual, to consider some questions. Can sin and guilt be transferred from one person to another? Is it [...] "an epidemic that spreads like cowpox"? Was every Jewish person responsible for the crucifixion of Christ? Does the single individual find sin in others or in him or herself? He believed in a rigorous self-inspection {{and at the same time}} a lenient inspection of others. He put it this way in Four Upbuilding Discourses of 1844: [...] We do not know the life of Paul in great detail, but we do, however, know Paul, which is the main consideration. That is to say, just as the sensate man is distinguishable by his seeing the speck in his brother’s eye but not seeing the log in his own, by his rigorously condemning the same fault in others that he lightly forgives in himself, so the mark of a more profound and concerned person is that he judges himself more rigorously, uses all his ingenuity to excuse the other person but is unable to excuse or forgive himself, indeed, is convinced that the other one is more excusable, because there is always still a possibility, since the only one <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> a person is deprived of this possibility is he himself. Bold confidence is a difficult matter, because it is not exactly synonymous with mental weakness. One may very well stop with it and need not go further by even wishing to judge God, that is, if in other respects bold confidence is bold confidence in the judgment, which certainly requires that God’s judgment penetrate the thought and heart, that is, if it is bold confidence in God’s mercy and there words are not a feigned pious expression of one’s own thoughtlessness, which does not trust God but is consoled by having ceased to sorrow long ago. If no human being is capable of acquitting himself he is capable of one thing-of indicting himself so terribly that he cannot acquit himself but learns to need mercy. With regard to this, it is difficult for one person to understand another, because the earnest person always lays the stress on himself.

40|$|That {{continuing}} {{professional development}} (CPD), or learning, for teachers {{is a good thing}} seems beyond question. However, broad agreement with the sentiment does not necessarily recognise the complexity of the situation and the multiple perspectives that position teacher professional learning as good, or indeed as fundamental. It quite clearly serves a wide range of purposes, which might be placed along a spectrum from performative to developmental. ‘Usefulness’ is therefore understood in relation to the underpinning perceived purpose of the learning. Under a performative focus, professional learning serves as a form of external accountability, and the usefulness of the learning is related {{to the extent to which}} it can be seen to satisfy externally imposed accountability measures, often associated with system-wide reform priorities. Under a developmental focus, professional learning is much more likely to be perceived as useful if an individual teacher or establishment views the learning as appropriate to their own needs, in a specific place at a specific time.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore how ‘ability’ is {{currently}} conceptualised in physical education and with what effects for different groups of young people. We interrogate approaches to theorising ability in physical education that draw on sociological and phenomenological ‘foundations’ together with notions of ability as ‘physical’ and ‘cultural capital’ drawn {{from the work of}} Bourdieu. We also look to data we and others have collected across a number of empirical projects to ask: where do we find talk about what we might identify as ‘ability’ in the context of physical education and sport; how is it talked about? And in what ways might this further our thinking of the meaning of ‘ability’ in physical education and school based sport? Our findings suggest that physical ability is far from a neutral concept and that how it is understood has important consequences for young people in relation to gender, race and social class. We argue that ongoing discussions around what we mean by ability, how we use it, and <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom,</b> are crucial in physical education where organised sport, recreation and exercise remain privileged over other constituents of physical culture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction The health {{locus of}} control {{is defined as the}} {{perception}} of individuals <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> they believe to be responsible for their health condition, including low back pain. Objective To identify whether individuals suffering from chronic low back pain in active physical therapy treatment believe they are responsible for their own condition. Material and methods Cross-sectional study involving 28 patients under active physical therapy treatment for non-specific chronic low back pain. Sociodemographic data and low back characteristics &# 8212; including disability and pain severity &# 8212; were collected. The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scale was used to assess the health {{locus of control}}. Results Participants undergoing active low back pain treatment presented a mean (SD) of 26 points (11. 40) in a 0 &# 8211; 100 point scale for disability and 6. 39 points (2. 24) on a 0 &# 8211; 10 scale for pain. In relation to the health locus of control, the means (SD) for internal, external and chance subscales were, respectively: 29. 32 (3. 98), 24. 75 (3. 58), and 13. 71 (6. 67). 82. 1 % of the participants presented higher rates for internal locus of control.

40|$|Malingering—the willful, deliberate, and {{fraudulent}} feigning or exaggeration of illness—was originally {{described as}} a means of avoiding military service. In present-day clinical practice, malingering may occur in circumstances where the person wishes to avoid legal responsibility or in situations where compensation or some other benefit might be obtained. In law, the term malingering is used <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> persons <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> military regulations apply; in other situations, malingering is regarded as fraud and may lead to charges of perjury or criminal fraud.

In this article, we will review the literature on pain and malingering and discuss attempts that have been made to develop methods and guidelines for the detection of malingered pain. There are, however, no valid clinical methods of assessment of possible malingering of pain.

40|$|In Sweden, {{cultural}} competence if often {{singled out as}} both a strategy and solution for managing differences attributed to migrants, but few studies have critically investigated the idea of {{cultural competence}}. This article is an empirical contribution, based on an ethnographic study, and analyses talk and actions in the everyday practice in special residential homes for boys and young men. It examines when, how and <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> what and <b>whom</b> cultural competence is made relevant, with special focus on how notions about cultural competence positions the staff in the studied institutions; organisationally, <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> different work tasks and in narratives about the care and treatment provided. The analysis shows that cultural competence is almost exclusively attributed to staff who have a migrant background, and that the position as cultural competent is ambiguous. On the one hand a position as expert, {{on the other hand}} surrounded by a suspicion not to be professional. Staff who are ascribed cultural competence are made into representatives of cultural difference and locked into culturalised and ethnified positions. Thus, cultural competence rather emerges as a tool to master and control the boys who are placed in the studied institutions than as a tool to affect a change process in support of multiculturalism...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, critics of Robert Browning's {{dramatic}} monologues, with some exceptions, {{have discussed the}} poems {{on the basis of}} Cartesian idealist tenets regarding subjectivity. Thus, although critics regard the interlocutor as a key feature of the genre, they tend to focus their attention primarily on monologue speakers who, as a result of idealist assumptions held by commentators, emerge from the readings as discrete and autonomous consciousnesses, unaffected by those at whom they address their utterances - their interlocutors - and by their social contexts. Post-Hegelian philosophical theories challenge Descartes' subjective idealism as, I argue, do dramatic monologues: both suggest that subjects do not exist in psychological isolation, but are products of a series of encounters with others, <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> they constantly attempt to gain a sense of their own identity. Post-Hegelian intersubjective and discursive theories can help to explain the psychological significance of the interlocutor for dramatic monologue speakers. In Chapter One I trace the development of dramatic monologue criticism, showing how theoretical assumptions have affected readings of monologues and in particular our understanding of the function of interlocutors. In Chapter Two I outline the philosophical and psychoanalytical theories of Hegel, Kojève, Lacan and the Bakhtin School. These provide alternative, but closely related ways of conceptualizing the intersubjective and discursive processes at play in monologues and enable me to show how speakers and interlocutors are not simply mutually influencing individuals. Rather, speakers and interlocutors are constantly in the process of constructing, and of being constructed by, each other. In Chapters Three, Four, Five and Six I discuss "Porphyria's Lover," "Andrea del Sarto," "Mr Sludge, The Medium'" and "Caliban upon Setebos" respectively, in order to show how the interlocutor's presence (whether actual or notional) is inevitably inscribed in the speaker's utterance {{to the extent that the}} speaker is inseparable from the interlocutor. These readings of Browning's monologues shift critical and theoretical emphasis from Cartesian idealism to dialogism and discursive process...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{clinical}} practice, {{the assessments}} provided by relatives {{are treated as}} a source of information about the emotional-cognitive difficulties manifested by a customer. Usually, those opinions are treated as objective data, i. e. data that indicate the real possibilities of the evaluated person. Data suggest that personality and affective factors of the assessing individual may modify the manner of describing an individual person in one’s care, regardless of the actual difficulties experienced by that individual. Participants and procedure In the study, the scale of the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) was used in the version investigating oneself, a peer and an elderly individual <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> the assessing individual undertakes care and support activities. The MFQ is relevant to different aspects of memory. The MFQ is composed of 64 questions grouped in scales composed of different numbers of items. Low results on the scales and a low general result illustrate the feeling that one experiences memory difficulties, whereas higher results illustrate the feeling that one’s memory is highly efficient. The participants (N = 65 individuals; 61 % female and 29 % male) were between 40 and 76 years old (M = 51. 50 and SD = 7. 25). In the analyses, the intensity of depression (GDS) and of positive and negative emotionality – state and trait (SUPIN) – of the assessing individual were taken into consideration, assuming that their intensity would correlate with opinions relevant to mnemonic capacities (one’s own and those of other people). Results On average, the participants assess their mnemonic competence as higher than that of their peers and of the elderly. The higher the level of abilities which the former ascribe to themselves, the better are those which are ascribed by them to a peer and an elderly individual. Negative affectivity shapes the conviction that one’s own mnemonic competence is deteriorating, and that the same thing is happening to that of a peer/an elderly individual as well. Conclusions Evaluation of the psychological functioning of a customer prepared by relatives/a caregiver can indicate symptoms of subclinical severity. There exists a connection between the affective-personality traits of a caregiver and the manner of the assessment of mnemonic competence (one’s own and that of near relations). The direction of those connections is not clear. The negative affectivity of a near relation/caregiver may result in formulating negative opinions about oneself, and about those in their care. Conversely, typical developmental memory changes in oneself and others can cause anxiety and depressive mood...|$|E
40|$|This work {{consists}} of a critical translation from the Arabic of "(On) First Philosophy", [title in Arabic], the major philosophical text of Yaʻqūb ibn Isḥāq al-Kindī (d. ca. 870 A. D.); and a detailed study of this text in relation to cognate treatises of al-Kindī's, and to works of classical and late Greek philosophy. Al-Kindī's ideas are also {{compared with those of}} his contemporaries among the theologians and philosophers of the 9 th and 10 th centuries. The translation is formally patterned upon the Arabic edition of "First Philosophy" by Muḥammad Abū Rīdah (Cairo, 1950). A critical apparatus accompanying the translation notes differences in my reading of the manuscript from that of Abū Rīdah, and also refers, wherever helpful, to the readings of another (less careful) Arabic edition, that done by Aḥmad al-Ahwānī (Cairo, 1948). The introduction to the translation {{consists of}} four chapters: l) a resumé of what is currently known of al-Kindī's life and times, and of the most important literature relating to al-Kindī philosophical studies; 2 a) a description of the text and translation of "On First Philosophy" and a summary of its contents; 2 b) a philosophical analysis of al-Kindī's views in "First Philosophy" and cognate texts; 3) a reevaluation of al-Kindī's relation to the muʻtazila. The following is a brief summary of the major points of the commentary and introduction, which expand upon the remarks and allusions found in the translation. Our growing awareness of the social and cultural forces at work in 9 th century Baghdad helps us to locate al-Kindī, the "philosopher of the Arabs", in a complex environment of competing ethnic and religious groups; with none of whom, however, can we identify al-Kindī with any certainty. His main involvement appears to have been with the tradition of Greek philosophy and sciences newly acquired by the Moslems; to the elucidation and propagation of which tradition many of his writings are directed. "On First Philosophy" thus shares with many of his writings a disarming combination of elementary philosophical definitions and rather sophisticated arguments; the proofs of which, however, are usually given in a repetitious manner. Al-Kindī's favorite formulation of arguments -in which he uses a combination of logical and factual premises to reach a conclusion considered by him as "necessary"- is that identified with Stoic logic, viz., the hypothetical and disjunctive "syllogism". In the repetitive and uneven style of his presentation, as well as in other ways, "First Philosophy" appears to have been presented originally in oral lecture form, probably at the court of the caliph. A number of his remarks in this and other treatises tally with recently discovered sayings attributed to al-Kindī in the abridgement of Abū Sulayman al-Sijistānī's Ṣiwān al-Ḥikmah, a source which also inclines one to revise in al-Kindī's favor the rather one-sided negative judgements of his personality known from antiquity. Al-Kindī emerges from this study as a subtle and relatively private man about whom the last word has yet to be written. Much, however, of al-Kindī's theoretical philosophy can be gleaned from a study of "On First Philosophy". The treatise analyzes causation, perception, substance and the categories and predicables of existence; presents elementary principles of logic; and defines the concepts of eternity and of body, motion and time, all of which are deemed finite. Unity and multiplicity (i. e., plurality) are examined separately and shown to require each other in the existence of every object; which is then seen as possessing unity in a non-essential, accidental way. This leads to the assumption of an essential cause for all accidental unity, which essential unity must be totally unlike any other kind of unity imaginable; neither one by number, form (including neither intellect or soul), genus or even by analogy. This unique, True One, however, as responsible for the unity of all else, is considered the (ultimate) cause of the becoming of all substances and of the creation of the world from nothing; achieved apparently by a process of emanation which is just barely mentioned. This reference to emanation, and the emphasis upon the existence of an ultimate One above all of creation, indicates a strong Neo-Platonic influence in al-Kindī's thought, though he does not attempt to construct an ontological scheme of universal hypostases existing between the One and man. He is similarly vague, in "First Philosophy" and elsewhere, on the status of the individual intellect and its entire relation to a possibly universal agent intellect. Al-Kindī is using a composite source (or sources) in this area as well as in many others, making use of Alexander of Aphrodisias' division of the intellect, though not of his identification of the Agent Intellect with the Divine Mind. Al-Kindī distinguishes between the One and all else, including any universal intellect, probably going further in his transcendental view of the one than even his Plotinian source. It is Aristotle's Metaphysics however, rather than Plotinus' Enneads, which serves as al-Kindī's main source in "First Philosophy", and he often follows the Arabic text of Aristotle's work quite closely, though never slavishly. He works with Aristotle's remarks on the general nature of all substance and being, supplementing the Metaphysics sources with material that ultimately goes back to the Categories, Posterior Analytics, Physics, and De Anima. He does not refer at all to Aristotle's unmoved mover; rejecting, with the denial of potential infinity as a philosophically significant concept, the notion of an eternal universe and of an infinite extension of time and movement. His proofs for the finiteness of all body, and concomitants of body, follow arguments originally presented by John Philoponus, and which also appear in a number of al-Kindī's contemporaries (though he does not follow John Philoponus in other, related areas); while his arguments for the absurdity of predicating unity or plurality exclusively of anything are descended ultimately from Plato's Parmenides, though they probably reached al-Kindī through a paraphrase contained in some Middle or Neo-Platonic work, or a doxography of the sort he uses elsewhere. A Hellenistic commentary to Porphyry's Isagoge serves as yet another major source for various parts of "First Philosophy", especially {{for a discussion of the}} predicables and the relation of unity and plurality to them. Al-Kindī probably referred to this same source for a critical discussion of number theory, with which he would also have been familiar from the Metaphysics and from Nichomachus of Gerasa's Introduction to Arithmetic though significant metaphysical differences exist between Nichomachus and al-Kindī. The Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʼ of the following century were also highly familiar with Nichomachus' work, as well as with all of the same authorities used by al-Kindī in "First Philosophy" and elsewhere; and a brief comparison of their Rasāʼil and al-Kindī's writings indicates a common source for many of their views. Al-Kindī had a number of disciples, notably Isaac Israeli and Aḥmed b. al-Ṭayyib al-Sarakhsī. Both men, like al-Kindl, seem to have been a-political figures in their respective communities; and, again like him, al-Sarakhsī at least could not escape being drawn into the politics of his day; and apparently also being victimized by personal or politically motivated changes at court which masqueraded as pious anti- Muʻtazila action. From rather blunt remarks in the first chapter of "On First Philosophy", and from a close analysis of al-Kindī's views on physics and revelation there and elsewhere, it appears that al-Kindī is not to be as closely identified with the Muʻtazila as has hitherto been generally assumed. He is not, for example, to be seen as "the philosopher of the Muʻtazilite theology"; though by necessity and choice he shares with those rational theologians some common themes, exegetical techniques, sources and goals. His perspective, however, is totally different, his commitment to the rational process as defined by Aristotle shaping his formulation of religious belief. Though he speaks in "First Philosophy" of the accidental nature of all existence and the dependence of all being upon God the Creator, the "truly one" <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> all else is only "metaphorically one", he also talks there and elsewhere of causality and of substance in a way that indicates he believes in its practical, if not theoretical, autonomy. It is with Aristotelian notions of form and matter, potentiality (though with reservations) and actuality that al-Kindī works, establishing their limitations and dependency upon an external source, but accepting within these limitations the view of a physical universe which they present. In yet other treatises, al-Kindī appears even to accept Aristotle f s view of eternal heavenly bodies which influence the earth; yet we must understand al-Kindī as meaning to say by this that the world is "eternal" as long as God, Who created it, wills it to endure. It is with such paradoxical if not contradictory expressions that al-Kindī formulates his philosophy, which, despite its shortcomings, entitles him to be known as the first major philosopher in Islam; a man who, working with many diverse sources, attempted to establish a philosophy which he felt would be viable for Islamic society. </p...|$|E

This paper focuses on research that seeks to understand what resources help shape individual resilience in adapting to extreme temperatures. It is based on combining holistic and social ecological approaches, integrating different social determinants of health to understand the multiple and diverse dimensions of resilience resources. This enables us to identify and explore the connections and relationships between different dimensions of resilience and adaptation to extreme temperatures. Using Lisbon, Portugal as a case study, we explore these dimensions <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> older people, <b>whom</b> represent a particularly vulnerable group in society. Here we present the findings from inter-seasonal (summer, winter) semi-structured interviews. Participants highlight engaging in common sense behaviours and state that are unable to act beyond these. Health and social inequalities, {{the need to maintain}} independence, housing characteristics and energy costs for cooling/heating illustrate some emerging themes. Our respondents refer to an array of adaptive behaviours, and barriers to adaptation and resilience. This paper also considers these findings in light of innovative policy and practice recommendations to assist and support individuals in developing resources needed for resilience and adaptation...|$|R

The project focussed on two language immersion contexts in Ireland which, despite obvious differences, share a range of significant commonalities.

The views of teachers and principals are described in this article. Data from this cohort illustrates how each school type approached the celebration of Language per se <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> learners for <b>whom</b> the language of instruction is not the L 1. This raises two key issues: (1) {{the extent to which the}} school can see itself as a site of and for multilingualism and (2) the extent to which learners in all immersion contexts can also be affirmed as language learners. Findings point to how immersion contexts, regardless of whether they are ‘design’ or ‘default’ in nature, can inform each other.

40|$|The {{criteria}} used {{to judge the}} acceptability of foster parent applications {{and the relationship of}} these criteria to the actual rate of foster parent success are issues of great concern for people working with foster children. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the predictability of a rating scheme in order to one, make effective use of home-study time and two, minimize unsuccessful placements. Factors important in this analysis are those of agency time and commitment to both client groups involved—potential foster parents and children—as well as the expectations and gratifications of the foster parents. These people are the backbone of a child care agency; in addition, they ahve a great potential in the areas of public relations and recruitment for their agency. Finally, there is the matter of effiency: the agency and applicant time spent on the home-study should be as fruitful as possible in terms of mutual assessment of the services to be provided and of suitability for the job. <b>In</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> these assessments, <b>whom</b> do we accept? Whom do we reject? Why? Two specific areas are explored in this study. First, what are some characteristics of foster parents which might be of predictive value? Second, what procedures might be established to predict foster parent success? To facilitate this analysis, several assumptions are made: one, that preduction is possible in this situation; two, that reliable predictive judgments can be made; three, that predictability of foster parent success would be beneficial to foster parent applicants, to agency planning, and to the children involved; and four, that the predictive data obtained can be used in making decisions about accepting foster parent applicants. The hypothesis of this exploratory study is that: If a high score is attained on the Predictive Instrument, the rate of placement failures will be reduced. The independent variable is the score attained, and the dependent variable is the rate of placement failures...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{considerable}} {{changes have}} taken place in thinking about development interventions. Many donors, host governments and development organisations embraced the concepts and the related methods of participatory approaches. In an attempt to move away from an era of more directive and top-down interventions, the project proposals in the 1990 s were dominated by concepts such as participation, decentralisation, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), empowerment, community-based development. In other words, the language of policy makers and practitioners in the field of development changed considerably. More significantly, the discourse of development changed. The discourse concept emphasises that language is not neutral. Discourse determines what can be said and written in a certain social group in a particular epoch. Discourse is not static; it changes {{as a result of its}} constant interplay with everyday practices and in social interaction. Framing is another important concept in this study. Framing refers to the process of filtering and selection of elements in the discourse that leads to new text and talk, new meanings and/or new social practices. In chapter two, a summary is given of ideas and thoughts of some important authors who have been influential in setting participatory approaches on the development agenda. The popularity of participatory approaches during the 1990 s did, however, generate criticism. Chapter three gives an overview of contemporary critical thoughts on these approaches. The advocates themselves, such as Robert Chambers, expressed concern over 'bad practices', which he regarded as a consequence of rapid up-scaling, insufficient training and 'use of the label without the substance'. In other words, the argument was that the ideas were good but that these ideas were not properly implemented in practice. More fundamental criticism was voiced by authors such as Mosse, Leeuwis, Cooke and Kothari. They pointed out the inherent contradictions and philosophical shortcomings of participatory approaches. The definitions of participation and empowerment are often vague, and the language used around these concepts tends to have a 'positive' connotation. This makes is easy to use these concepts in a rhetorical and populist way. In the discourse around participatory approaches, very little attention is paid to political dimensions of development interventions and existing social organisation. This study builds further on these critical reflections with the help of the concepts discourse and framing that are elaborated in chapter four. The objective of the study is to describe and compare the discourses and everyday practices of five development projects in rural Mozambique. In doing this, the study hopes to contribute to the understanding of everyday dynamics of participatory development interventions. The following research questions were formulated at the end of chapter four; 1) What was the project context like? 2) What were the project discourses around the concepts participation and empowerment? 3) What were the everyday project practices? 4) How did PRA project practices compare with principles of 'good' PRA practices? 5) How did project discourses compare with project practices? 6) How can gaps between discourses and practices be explained? Two major case studies and three minor ones were selected. The approach of the study is explained in chapter five. The methodology consisted mainly of participant observation and interviews. The involvement of the researcher in these projects either as an advisor, trainer or evaluator gave a good opportunity to have access to observations from within the project. For the two major cases, the researcher also had the opportunity to do research as an outsider, acting independently of any project involvement. Chapter six provides important contextual information by describing the recent history of Mozambique. It specifically explores the events and facts that are important for the understanding of rural development in Mozambique in the 1990 s. The empirical chapters, chapters seven through nine, have the following structure: first the project context is described, then the project discourses, and finally some critical incidents and observations, thus answering the first three research questions. The other three research questions are dealt with in the concluding chapters ten and eleven. The first major case study deals with various interventions in the most southern district of Mozambique, Matutuíne, in Maputo province. The aim of this project was to involve local people in the management of natural resources. The main focus was an initiative by the Swiss NGO Helvetas. The project was geared towards empowering the inhabitants of the district to confront commercial investors with interests in the area. In chapter seven, some of their activities—such as a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), community land delimitation and seminars—are described. This chapter also reflects on the relations of the project with various other actors in the district. The other major case study is a project that promoted decentralised district planning in 14 districts of Nampula Province in the North of Mozambique. This project was a joint initiative of two UN organizations (UNDP and UNCDF), the Government of the Netherlands and the Mozambican Ministry of Planning and Finance. District administration was encouraged to write district plans. PRAs, the establishment of District Consultative Councils (DCCs) and Local Development Committees (LDCs) were the vehicles implemented to involve rural people in the development planning of the district. This project is described in chapter eight. The three minor case studies, all based on projects run by NGOs, are presented in chapter nine. The first minor case was an initiative in the area of land rights and took place in Nicoadala district in Zambezia province. The project attempted to delimit land for communities, a possibility provided for through the land law of 1997. The second minor case took place in Machaze district in Manica province and is similar to the project in Nampula since its aim was decentralised district planning. The difference is that this project in Machaze placed more emphasis on the local level and started with the establishment of a Local Development Committee and a series of PRAs. The third minor case is about a PRA that was planned by an NGO to take place in Morrumbala district, Zambezia province, but in fact never took place. All projects made use of PRA. In chapter ten, I first take a closer look at how PRAs were perceived and how the PRAs were conducted by project staff. I compare this with the supposed principles of 'good' PRA practice. Project staff largely regarded PRA as a tool for data collection or as a way to obtain a ranking of a wish-list or other information. The way in which data were collected and the way in which problems were analysed revealed a rather extractive and uncritical way of working. The level of probing and triangulation was minimal. There was little space for sharing, joint analysis or critique. The role of PRA in the intervention or in the envisaged development process was seldom made explicit in project documents.   Chapter ten continues to synthesize three gaps between project discourses and project practices. Firstly, project discourses tend to picture the intervention as rather a-political and its methods as neutral, while in practice many different interests and several conflicts surfaced as a result of the intervention. It became apparent how different power-holders try to either control or even block the interventions. In turn, project staff do all they can to appease all actors and keep their project running. Secondly, all projects have empowerment as an objective. It is however apparent that, in the project discourses, this concept is not further elaborated and it is not clear who should be empowered <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom,</b> or how this could be achieved. Since the PRAs were rather extractive and uncritical, and as the interests of project staff differed often from the empowerment of local people, these exercises offered little scope for local learning or mobilisation. Projects tended to create new institutions rather than trying to change existing local institutions. Little or no attention was paid to intra-community inequalities and, as time went by, projects tended to water down their empowerment objectives. The third gap that was identified is that whereas, according to the discourse of participatory development, processes should be bottom-up and local, observations showed that most interventions were largely imposed by donors and development agencies and their staff. The philosophies of the project rationale and approach are rather foreign. The influence of expatriates on project formulation and implementation was obvious. Moreover, agenda setting of everyday activities or determining the next step during a PRA was in the hands of project staff, with local people having virtually no say in the matter. New organisations such as Local Development Committees and District Development Councils were equally largely imposed by project staff and their durability is therefore questioned. In chapter eleven an attempt is made to explain these gaps. The concepts of discourse and framing were very useful for doing so. We can talk of a discourse of participatory development; a dominant system of representation that governed the way policy makers and practitioners talked and wrote about development during the 1990 s. This discourse was shared in trans-national discourse coalitions and often had rather optimist and positive connotations. When it came to putting this discourse into practice, formulating the project document, and operationalising this document in activities in the field, the discourse had to be actively framed or translated. The various actors do this in several ways so as to fit the discourse into their wants and needs. One and the same actor can also frame the discourse in different ways, depending on the audience and context. Project discourses were characterised by vagueness, thus allowing the many different actors to select only that which they regarded as being useful. Several contextual factors may contribute towards explaining the gaps between discourses and practices. The following are distinguished; the brutal history of colonial and post-colonial top-down interventions in rural Mozambique, the consequent distrust towards outsiders, the lack of training and experience of project staff, party-political tensions, expectations of local people, and a lack of commitment towards the empowerment of local people on the part of project staff and local power-holders. In addition, discourses of participatory development exhibit a number of conceptual and philosophical shortcomings that also contribute to the divide between formal discourses and everyday project practices. The most important (and most known) criticism is that participatory approaches are quite naïve since they often ignore power relations. It generally assumes that people are willing and able to collaborate, and are able to overcome conflict via mutual learning. Furthermore, the fact that certain concepts are not further specified, being kept vague, makes the approach difficult to criticise. In the last section I turn my attention specifically to project managers who have to deal in everyday practice with: 1) the inherent contradictions of the approach, 2) framing the laudable but naïve ideas into activities and 3) the different actors with their various interests. Good project managers in Mozambique have to be highly politically sensitive and strategic. They often have to adopt a strategy what I have called 'juggle and muddle'. Keeping the discourse vague is not only an observation of this study; at particular moments it can also be a recommendable strategy in running a project effectively...|$|E
6000|$|The {{portrait}} of Mr. Whitman reproduced {{in the present}} volume is taken from an engraving after a daguerreotype given in the original Leaves of Grass. He is much above the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned--a model of physique and of health, and, by natural consequence, as fully and finely related to all physical facts by his bodily constitution as to all mental and spiritual facts by his mind and his consciousness. He is now, however, old-looking for his years, and might even (according to the statement {{of one of his}} enthusiasts, Mr. O'Connor) have passed for being beyond the age for the draft when the war was going on. The same gentleman, in confutation of any inferences which might be drawn from the Leaves of Grass by a Harlan or other Holy Willie, affirms that [...] "one more irreproachable <b>in</b> his <b>relations</b> <b>to</b> the other sex lives not upon this earth"--an assertion which one must take as one finds it, having neither confirmatory nor traversing evidence at hand. Whitman has light blue eyes, a florid complexion, a fleecy beard now grey, and a quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> those with <b>whom</b> he comes in contact. His ordinary appearance is masculine and cheerful: he never shows depression of spirits, and is sufficiently undemonstrative, and even somewhat silent in company. He has always been carried by predilection towards the society of the common people; but is not the less for that open to refined and artistic impressions--fond of operatic and other good music, and discerning in works of art. As to either praise or blame of what he writes, he is totally indifferent, not to say scornful--having in fact a very decisive opinion of his own concerning its calibre and destinies. Thoreau, a very congenial spirit, said of Whitman, [...] "He is Democracy;" [...] and again, [...] "After all, he suggests something a little more than human." [...] Lincoln broke out into the exclamation, [...] "Well, he looks like a man!" [...] Whitman responded to the instinctive appreciation of the President, considering him (it is said by Mr. Burroughs) [...] "by far the noblest and purest of the political characters of the time;" [...] and, if anything can cast, in the eyes of posterity, an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal qualities and the great doings of Lincoln, it will assuredly be the written monument reared to him by Whitman.|$|R
40|$|Avalia as repercussÃes econÃmicas das contrataÃÃes do FNE no setor agroindustrial do Nordeste no perÃodo de 1989 a 2008, inovando, em relaÃÃo Ãs anÃlises tradicionais, ao mudar o foco da anÃlise de impactos da esfera do Programa para o Ãmbito das atividades caracterÃsticas do setor. Para tal, foi utilizada como ferramenta para mensuraÃÃo de impactos, a recentemente atualizada Matriz de Insumo-Produto do Nordeste. Dessa forma, mensurando os impactos individuais das atividades e posteriormente agregando-os foram encontrados os resultados para o Setor. De maneira geral, os citados resultados confirmaram que os recursos do FNE direcionados ao setor agroindustrial foram fundamentais para a economia nordestina, haja vista que, representando apenas 6, 9 % do total aplicado pelo citado Fundo na RegiÃo, impactaram na inserÃÃo de R$ 11, 7 bilhÃes em Valor Bruto da produÃÃo, que por sua vez, se materializaram em incrementos no PIB da RegiÃo da ordem de R$ 5, 9 bilhÃes e na criaÃÃo e manutenÃÃo, em mÃdia, de 15. 145 postos de trabalho por ano, durante o perÃodo de anÃlise. O FNE foi responsÃvel ainda por impactos de R$ 1, 7 bilhÃo na massa salarial e pela geraÃÃo de cerca de R$ 1, 9 bilhÃo em receitas tributÃrias em favor da AdministraÃÃo PÃblica. Neste particular, os setores de FabricaÃÃo de aÃÃcar e FabricaÃÃo de celulose e Pasta mecÃnica foram os que apresentaram os maiores impactos e os melhores multiplicadores em praticamente todas as variÃveis estudadas. NÃo obstante os resultados mencionados, os elevados percentuais de transbordamento e baixos Ãndices puros de ligaÃÃo identificados evidenciaram o Nordeste como um comprador de produtos com maior valor agregado em relaÃÃo Ãqueles que ele vende, o que o torna um exportador de riqueza e tributos, assim como deficitÃrio em relaÃÃo Ã sua balanÃa {{comercial}} e significante dependente dos setores produtivos do restante do paÃs.

For doing so, it {{has been used as a}} tool for impact measurement, the recently up-to-date Northeast Input-output Matrix. Under this way, measuring the individual impacts of the activities and, afterward, aggregating them, there has been found the results for the Sector. Overall, the mentioned results confirmed that the FNE resources directed to the agribusiness sector have been fundamental to the northeastern economy, considering that, representing only 6, 9 % of the total applied by the mentioned Fund in the Region, it has impacted on the Gross Value insertion of R$ 11, 7 billions in the production; which, for its turn, has been materialized in increments on the Regionâs PIB of about R$ 5, 9 billions and in the creation and maintenance in an average of 15. 145 work opportunities each year, during the analysis period. FNE has still been responsible for impacts of R$ 1, 7 billion on the total wages and for the generation of around R$ 1, 9 billion in tributary income in favor of the Public Administration. Regarding this, the sectors that manufacture sugar, and cellulose and mechanical paste have been the ones that presented the biggest impacts and the best multipliers in practically all the variables studied. In despite of the mentioned results, the elevated percentages of overflowing and low pure bonding indexes identified have evidenced the Northeast as a products buyer with a bigger aggregated value <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> those <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> it sells, which is what turns it into an exporter of wealth and taxes, as well as an <b>in</b> deficit <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> its trade balance and meaningful dependent on the productive sectors of the rest of the country...|$|R

40|$|NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Statens helsetilsyn har oppsummert erfaringer fra fylkesmennenes tilsyn med sosiale tjenester i 2003 og 2004. Tilsynene har vært gjennomført både som systemrevisjoner i 116 kommuner og som stedlig tilsyn. Stedlig tilsyn omfatter i hovedsak tilsyn med at tvangstiltak gjennomføres i tråd med godkjente vedtak. Oppsummeringen viser at når tilsynsmyndighetene har rettet oppmerksomhet mot sosiale tjenester er det tjenester og hjelpetiltak til personer med psykisk utviklingshemning og familier med funksjonshemmede barn som oftest er vurdert. Oppmerksomhet er videre rettet mot kommunenes håndtering av tvang og makt overfor personer med psykisk utviklingshemning. Hjelpetiltakene omfatter hjemmebaserte tjenester som praktisk bistand og opplæring, avlastning, støttekontakt og omsorgslønn. De erfaringene som beskrives i denne rapporten er derfor i hovedsak knyttet til kommunenes tjenestetilbud til disse brukergruppene. Kommunene har fortsatt arbeid å gjøre når det gjelder å bedre styring av tjenestene, og sikre kontinuerlig forbedring. Kommunene mangler ofte rutiner som sikrer brukernes rettigheter i saksbehandling ved tildeling, endring og iverksetting av tjenester. Det er mye aktivitet når det gjelder opplæring, men det rapporteres også om manglende systematiske tiltak som sikrer at ansatte har tilstrekkelig kunnskap og ferdigheter innen aktuelle fagfelt og tjenester de yter. Kommunenes praksis knyttet til brukere hvor det foreligger godkjente vedtak om bruk av tvang og makt er ofte i tråd med lovens krav. Det synes imidlertid å være grunn til bekymring for at tvang og makt brukes uten at dette følges opp slik lovverket forutsetter. SUMMARY IN ENGLISH: The Norwegian Board of Health has {{summarized}} the experience gained by the Offices of the County Governors from their supervision {{of social services}} in 2003 and 2004. Supervision {{has been carried out}} both as system audits in 116 municipalities and as local supervision. Local supervision mainly involved investigating whether the use of restraint is carried out in accordance with authorized decisions. The summary has shown that when the supervision authorities have directed their attention to social services, services and practical measures for people with mental disabilities and families with physically handicapped children are evaluated most often. Attention has also been directed {{to the way in which}} the municipalities manage the use of restraint for people with mental disabilities. Practical measures include home-based services such as practical assistance and training, relief for carers, support contacts and economic assistance for carers. Therefore, the experience described in this report is mainly related to municipal services for these client groups. The municipalities still have work to do when it comes to improving the management and the supply of services. The municipalities often lack routines for ensuring that clients’ rights are met when services are allocated, provided and altered. There is a great deal of activity in the area of training. However, there are reports of lack of systematic measures to ensure that employees have adequate knowledge and skills within the areas they work and the services they provide. The municipalities’ practice <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> clients for <b>whom</b> an approved decision has been made about the use of restraint, is often in accordance with the requirements laid down in the legislation. However, there seems to be reason for concern that restraint is used without being followed up in accordance with the legislation...|$|R
