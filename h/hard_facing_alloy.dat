40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This {{paper is}} a {{metallurgical}} {{study of the}} microstructure of a cobalt base <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> <b>alloy</b> to determine the cause for inconsistant wear properties. Wear tests on a Stellite 6 alloy, deposited using oxyacetylene welding techniques, resulted {{in a wide range}} of weight losses. Microscopic examination has revealed the probable cause to be variations in carbon content after welding. Cooling rates may also be a contributing factor. The "as received" structure of the Stellite alloy is a matrix of fine carbides surrounding large dendrites of cobalt rich material. The use of a reducing flame during welding causes an increase in carbon resulting in a structure of massive, hard, and brittle primary carbides in a soft but tough cobalt matrix containing eutectic microconstituents and free graphite. This structure appears to be the most desirable one for a superior wearing material when subjected to dry grinding abrasion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) {{is first}} of its kind 500 MWe pool type, sodium cooled nuclear reactor which is {{presently}} in advanced stage of construction at Kalpakkam, India. Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) is a shell and tube type, counter current, sodium to sodium heat exchanger. IHX is a very important, massive, over dimensional (∼ 42 tones in weight, ∼ 2 meters in diameter and ∼ 18 meters in length) and critical component of reactor, as it transfers heat from the radioactive primary circuit sodium to non-radioactive secondary circuit sodium forming the boundary between these two circuits. The principal material of construction of IHX is austenitic stainless steel grade 316 LN. Each IHX has 3600 nos. of straight seamless tubes which are rolled and then welded to the either ends of top and bottom tubesheets by autogenous pulsed Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process. The shell welding around the tube bundle is extremely difficult and challenging task due to small gap between the tube bundle and shell inside diameter. Special arrangements were made to avoid arc strike or fusion on the tube during shell welding around the tube bundle. A mechanical hardfaced seal arrangement at the interface of the IHX outer shell and the inner vessel stand pipe is the chosen design concept to ensure leak tightness in the IHX penetrations. Based on radiation dose rate & shielding considerations during maintenance, handling and decommissioning, nickel based ENiCr-B <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> <b>alloy</b> (Colmonoy- 5) was chosen to replace the traditionally used cobalt based stellite alloys to improve the resistance to high temperature wear, especially galling of mating surfaces in sodium environment. The more versatile Plasma Transferred Arc Welding (PTAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) were used for deposition of Colmonoy- 5. The hardfacing on the seal ring is really challenging task, as the diameter is too large and thickness & width is too small and which has hardfacing on all mating surfaces. Extensive varieties of trials were conducted on the mockup to optimize the hardfacing process along with heat treatment cycle to obtain minimum distortion deploying special tools and fixtures. Intermediate Heat Exchanger involves 10 mm and 28 mm thick borated stainless steel components around the tube bundle and bottom portion confirming to ASTM 887, Type 304 B 4, Grade B classification to reduce the radiation level in secondary sodium system while flowing through the IHX. Various types of welding trials were conducted on the test coupons for welding procedure qualification of borated stainless steel components using versatile grades of welding consumables. More than hundred nos. of trial coupons welded using 10 varieties of welding consumables have shown fissures and cracks in weld, as these welding consumables found not having good compatibility with SS 304 B 4, Grade B borated steel. Special development work was taken-up {{for the first time in}} the country by developing a special grade ∼ 1 % borated welding consumable (GRINOX- 308 BRN electrode) specifically for welding of borated steel components of IHX. This paper highlights on welding aspects and challenges during fabrication of Intermediate Heat Exchangers for 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor...|$|E
40|$|Wear {{caused by}} {{abrasive}} particles {{is far more}} extensive, when compared with adhesive or normal wear. The effect of a mating surface on the abrasive wear was rarely observed. In practice, however, the wear caused by particles introduced between rubbing surfaces is very important. Combining various materials as rubbing surfaces, the author investigated {{the effect of the}} difference in hardness on wear caused by abrasive particles between them. Bearing steel, stainless steel, high-chromium steel, heat resisting steel castings, Ni-hard and several <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> <b>alloys</b> were used as the material for the cylindrical testpiece of 8 mm diameter. The mating surface was a disc of bearing steel, carbon steel, phospher bronze or cast iron. Carborundum, alundum, quartz and garnet were experimented with as the abrasive particles. Test results showed clearly the presence of steep peak in the plot of the product of the hardness and the specific wear, i. e. the abraded volume/(load×rubbed distance), against the hardness, when the hardness of both surfaces became nearly equal. This tendency was always observed irrespective {{of the nature of the}} abrasive material, and deviated considerably from the empirical law stating the constancy of the product. The author attempted to explain this fact by observing traces of free particles and embedded particles on the rubbing surfaces by means of an electron microscope. The difference in the embedability of the rubbing surfaces was found to cause the wide deviation of the value of the product. When the hardness of the cylindrical test piece related to its embedability closely approaches to that of the disk, the abrasive action of embedded particles becomes remarkable...|$|R

Typical reactor components on which overlays are provided include grid plate, diverse safety rod drive mechanism etc. The {{thickness of the}} overlay ranges from 0. 5 - 3 mm. Typical defects likely during deposition include lack of bonding between substrate and overlay, cracks and porosities. Conventionally ultrasonic, LPT and radiography {{has been used for}} the process qualification and on the actual components. It is well established that thermal imaging can be used for detection of detects especially lack of bonding and materials characterization. Conventionally active techniques such as pulsed thermal imaging have been employed. This paper highlights the successful application of lock-in thermography for characterization of colmonoy coatings. The main advantage of lock in technique is that it is unaffected by emissivity variations and also defect depth can be estimated. A Silver- 420 system with pulsed and lock in thermography was used for the study. A sinusoidal signal was used and the frequency of modulation varied from 0. 05 Hz – 0. 5 Hz. The images were acquired at a frame rate of 50 Hz and the integration time was 1600 µs. The sample consisted of Colmonoy coating (2 - 3 mm) on a 316 LN substrate. 5 % notch and 2 φ flat bottom holes were introduced on the Colmonoy coated side for calibration. The phase and the amplitude images were analysed. It was observed that the average phase angle could be clearly used for detecting thickness variations and presence of debonds in the specimen. The results were correlated using ultrasonic techniques. Results clearly indicate the superior defect detectability and quantization by lock in method especially for coatings. This paper presents in detail the experimental methodologies, challenges and also the results of the investigation...|$|R
40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{experience}} a much shorter fatigue life than continuous rail sections, especially IRJs located in heavy haul rail corridors. IRJs {{are one of}} the most critical components of the rail system since their failure can lead to multiple catastrophic consequences, including; malfunctioning of the track signalling system due to metal contact across the insulating rail gap and, in cases where joints are damaged at the fishplate or rail bolt holes, derailment of railway vehicles. A literature review on the topic revealed that these joints suffer from a wide range of damage, predominately resulting from either the gradual accumulation of metal under plastic flow across the railhead in the vicinity of the rail end post, or rail end spalling and/or rail end post insulation damage. Other failure modes relate to problems with fishplates/joint bar and rail bolt holes. These include: fishplate cracking, delamination of fishplates, bolt looseness and bolt hole cracking. Therefore, IRJs are regarded as high-risk component and are maintained via expensive maintenance programs requiring high standards. Every year rail operators around Australia and the world install tens of thousands of rail joints, due to their early failure, or the risk of failure of either the signalling system and/or the structural track integrity. For the Australian heavy haul rail industry, the economic costs of IRJ maintenance are very high. In this study, approaches to both advanced characterisation of IRJ damage and to improving IRJs service lifetimes were investigated. Damage accumulation in the vicinity of the joint was characterised by advanced metallographic (optical microscopy, SEM and TEM) and neutron diffraction techniques. In the early stage of the project, surface <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> was selected as a potential approach to improving IRJ lifetimes, and surface clad rail samples were produced and studied via simulation testing and testing of ex-service rails. The initial <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> experiments involved comparison of the performance of ex-service laser clad IRJ samples (431 stainless steel cladding produced by Jarvie Engineering Private Limited) with that of uncoated IRJ samples manufactured from normal head hardened 60 kg grade rail. The results indicated IRJ lifetimes can be improved by a <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> of rail ends. Follow-up investigations were performed using both robots TIG MMAW <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> deposition approach, and experimentation with a choice of cladding metal and geometry of the hard-face rail surface. Experimentation included advanced metallography and electron microscopy, and limited wear testing of cladding materials. Full-scale wheel on track rig testing was also performed on both coated and uncoated samples, which involves cyclic rolling contact loading on railhead surface was the main objective to investigate the railhead damage. It was concluded that ferritic type commercial <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> <b>alloys,</b> and maraging steels, appear good candidate materials for <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> by weld deposition in the vicinity of IRJs. They also appear more suitable than the initial 431 stainless steel used in the laser cladding experiments as deleterious effects of thermal contraction during cooling are less in the ferritic alloys. It was also concluded and that geometry of the <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> profile should include a steep angle of <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> with the rail surface where it intersects the top surface of the rail head. Neutron diffraction analysis of ex-service IRJs revealed significant stress evolution in the vicinity of the top surfaces of the rail ends abutting the insulating gap. This distribution is characterised by a compressive layer of approximately 5 mm deep and a counterbalanced tensile layer located 5 - 15 mm at the sub-surface region. It exceeded the distribution along the continuous rail. Residual stresses analysis for the laboratory rig tested rail ends revealed similar characteristic to those found in ex-service rail ends. However, in contrast to the ex-service rail ends, the stress distributions in the test rig samples were slightly different and this difference was attributed to the localization of wheel load under the particular test conditions. A separate neutron diffraction examination of residual stresses near bolt-holes across ex-service IRJ fishplates revealed a stress evolution characterised by both compressive and tensile stresses, extended in a 900 and 450 angles to the longitudinal plane. The later results were consistent with a common observation of fishplate fracture originating at bolt holes at 450 to the running rail surface...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The introduction of overhead camshaft valve train systems some 25 years ago has resulted in improved engine performance and efficiency, this in turn however, has caused increased wear problems. In {{order to understand the}} tribological behaviour of overhead camshaft systems, test engines and dynameter test methods have been extensively used. These are however, time consuming and expensive, a cheaper and quicker method of camshaft material and lubricant appraisal is therefore required and this has resulted in the design and construction of a simulative overhead camshaft test rig. A range of commercially available camshaft and follower materials have been tested using both a fully formulated and a -mineral base -equivalent. The most commonly encountered cam and follower wear failures of scuffing, pitting and polishing were reproduced. Results showed scuffing wear to be associated with all of the camshaft materials using the mineral base oil under high load, boundary lubrication conditions. Scuffing also occurred under low load, mixed lubrication conditions using the case-hardened steel cam and chilled white iron follower combinations. The remaining cam materials, carbonitrided and induction hardened grey flake iron did not fail under similar test conditions due to the presence of free graphite in the icrostructure. The fully formulated oil generally suppressed the onset of scuffing under all test conditions due to the presence of the zinc-dialkyldithiophosphate (Z. D. D. P) anti-wear additive in the oil. Pitting failure was associated with the chilled white iron follower using the fully formulated oil under high load conditions. This failure could have been initiated by either a surface, sub-surface or stress - corrosion mechanism. Analysis of this type of failure is complicated by the difference in both chill depth and hardness and also the presence. of cracks within, samples prior to examination and testing. Standardisation of chilled white irons therefore needs to be carried out in order to understand fully the wear behaviour of such materials. Polishing wear was associated with the fully formulated oil at low loads, and appeared to occur by a chemical reaction between the contacting surfaces and the additives present in the oil. The use of the acetate replica technique proved a satisfactory method of analysing the change in surface topography of cam surfaces. Using the fully formulated oil the cam surface 'ran in' satisfactorily, by a process of plastic deformation and fracture, whilst the mineral base oil caused instanteous scuffing of the cam surface. Once the surfaces had 'run in' satisfactorily by using either the additives in the oil or by a diamond lapping operation, the cams continued to run without scuffing in the mineral base oil under continuous, non stop test conditions. An intermittent, stop/start operating cycle however results in eventual scuffing due to additive film depletion and repeated surface interaction under boundary lubrication conditions. From a range of 'new' materials tested for follower application the ceramics, {{with the exception of the}} toughened zirconia, exhibited the best wear characteristics using a case hardened steel cam as a standard and tested under mineral base oil conditions. The silicon carbide and sialon ceramics both exhibited a low frictional resistance and wear rate, whilst the metallic follower materials of cobalt and nickel base <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> <b>alloys</b> and a ceramic fibre reinforced aluminium/silicon alloy all suffered some form of material.

There are numerous processes and consumables available in the market to improve the surface characteristics of components. This technique has potential to deposit hard-faced layer on substrate. The properties usually sought are greater resistance to wear from abrasion, impact, adhesion (metal-to-metal), heat, corrosion or any combination of these factors. <b>Hard</b> <b>facing</b> is applied only to specific areas of metal parts that are exposed to wear.

40|$|This paper gives a {{procedure}} for {{choosing the right}} technology for reparative <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> of damaged forging dies. Since {{they are subject to}} impact loads and cyclic temperature elevations, forging dies should be made of steel that is able to withstand great impact loads, maintain good mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and that is resistant to wear and thermal fatigue.
