The city-state plays host to 400 French company sites (mainly in the electronics and financial services industries) and about 40 companies that have been founded locally.

50|$|The {{luxury goods}} {{market has been}} on an upward climb for many years. Apart from the setback caused by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the {{industry}} has performed well, particularly in 2000. In that year, the world luxury goods market - which includes drinks, fashion, cosmetics, fragrances, watches, jewelry, luggage, handbags - was worth close to $170 billion and grew 7.9 percent. The United States has been the largest regional market for luxury goods and is estimated {{to continue to be}} the leading personal luxury goods market in 2013, with a value of 62.5 billion euros. The largest sector in this category was luxury drinks, including premium whisky, Champagne, Cognac. This sector {{was the only one that}} suffered a decline in value (-0.9 percent). The watches and jewelry section showed the strongest performance, growing in value by 23.3 percent, while the clothing and accessories section grew 11.6 percent between 1996 and 2000, to $32.8 billion. North America is the largest regional market for luxury goods; unlike the modest 2.9 percent growth experienced by the Western European market, the North American market achieved growth of just under 10 percent. The largest ten markets for luxury <b>goods</b> <b>account</b> for 83 percent of overall sales, and include Japan, China, United States, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, and Switzerland.|$|E

This paper presents two accounting results from a global input-output framework that shed light on this channel. We feed in observed changes in final demand and find that trade in final goods fell by twice as much as trade in intermediate goods. Nevertheless, intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>account</b> for more than two-fifths of the trade collapse. We also find that vertical specialization trade fell 13 percent, while value-added trade fell by 10 percent, because declines in demand were largest in highly vertically-specialized sectors. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores, from an investment-saving perspective, {{the factors}} {{underlying}} the persistent widening {{of the current}} account surplus in the Netherlands since the early 1980 s. Standard intertemporal models, even appropriately extended to incorporate specific features of the Dutch economy, {{do not appear to}} fully account for this development. Accordingly, the paper focusses attention on the production side of the economy to gain further insight into the trends of the current account. Empirical evidence suggests that changes in relative factor prices and a relative demand shift toward non-tradable <b>goods</b> <b>account</b> for the bulk of the observed widening of the current account surplus. In turn, the impact of these factors on the current account appears to reflect both changes in factor proportions and deviations from perfect competition in the Dutch sheltered sector. ...|$|E
40|$|To protect {{children}} in research, procedures {{that are not}} administered in the medical interests of a child must be restricted. The risk threshold for these procedures is generally measured according {{to the concept of}} minimal risk. Minimal risk is often defined according to the risks of "daily life. " But it is not clear whose daily life should serve as the baseline; that is, it is not clear to whom minimal risk should refer. Commentators in research ethics often argue that "minimal risk" should refer to healthy children or the subjects of the research. I argue that neither of these interpretations is successful. I propose a new interpretation in which minimal risk refers to children who are not unduly burdened by their daily lives. I argue that children are not unduly burdened when they fare well, and I defend a substantive <b>goods</b> <b>account</b> of children's welfare...|$|E
40|$|A formal {{definition}} of cultural industries is developed following four distinct features of cultural goods: (a) oversupply, (b) quality uncertainty, (c) network effects and (d) demand reversal. Drawing on economic and socio-psychological notions of ‘network’, increasing returns and social contagion effects are distinguished. Increasing returns may govern {{the adoption of}} standards when choices are binary, social contagion explains the diffusion of cultural goods when choices are multiple. Together, the four structural features delineating cultural industries account for curious competitive dynamics prevalent in cultural markets, such as the notorious 10 : 90 proportionality (under which 10 % of cultural <b>goods</b> <b>account</b> for 90 % of the market), causal ambiguity about the reasons for success, {{and the formation of}} fashions. Six managerial recommendations are advanced, focusing on a criticial circulation point triggering self-sustaining diffusion patterns. Finally ‘project-based enterprises’ and ‘network forms of governance’ are identified as the organizational forms most suited to the dynamics of the cultural markets...|$|E

Nontraded goods, both {{in the form of}} final consumption goods and as an input into the production of final tradable goods, are an important aspect behind international relative price movements.

The public <b>goods</b> <b>account</b> {{has the advantage of}} establishing a relatively clear and distinctive mission for public health. It also allows a consensus of people with different comprehensive moral and political commitments to endorse public health measures, even if they disagree about precisely why they are desirable. The field of public health is having an identity crisis. From its inception, public health has been concerned with promoting the health of populations rather than individuals, which explains its special emphasis on com-municable disease. But many have begun to see public health as a branch of social work rather than medicine. On this view, public health seeks to promote human rights and social justice in addition to preventing pan-demics and pollution. ...|$|E
