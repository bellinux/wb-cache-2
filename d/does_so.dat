5|$|According to Lokasenna, Loki rebukes {{the gods}} {{at the start}} of the poem for not {{properly}} welcoming him to the feast at Ægir's hall. In stanza 10, Odin finally relents to the rules of hospitality, urging Víðarr to stand and pour a drink for the quarrelsome guest. Víðarr <b>does</b> <b>so,</b> and then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.|$|E
5|$|Cellular {{automaton}} {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two alternating subsets, and perform updates {{on one of the}} two subsets at a time. In each update, every cell that can flip <b>does</b> <b>so.</b> This defines a reversible cellular automaton which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect. It is {{a bacterial}} protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It <b>does</b> <b>so</b> by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E

5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period.

5|$|Homer awakens {{one morning}} to find the pile of trash gone and {{believes}} he has beaten City Hall, only to learn that Marge wrote a letter of apology to the Springfield Sanitation Commissioner Ray Patterson, forging Homer's name. Homer sees the commissioner, demanding the letter be returned. Patterson <b>does</b> <b>so</b> and tries to be civil with Homer, but Homer insists he will fight the department and decides to run for Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre <b>does</b> <b>so</b> via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E

5|$|It <b>does</b> <b>so</b> by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) {{discuss their}} new relationship, and kiss passionately on Donna's sofa. Elsewhere, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), still {{mourning}} Laura's death, dances {{in his living}} room, sobbing and holding a portrait of Laura as he <b>does</b> <b>so.</b> He breaks open the picture's frame, cutting his hands, as his wife Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) screams at him to stop.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{intrinsic}} finality presumes an objective reality that obeys a natural order or natural {{law in the}} universe. Things are [...] "meant" [...] to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way. For instance, animals have natural instincts for self-preservation, seeking food, and reproduction. They <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because it is their nature to <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Theologians go further, to argue that they <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because they were created to <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R

5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but <b>does</b> <b>so</b> sparingly. Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, and debris in the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction in place of a predator-prey relationship.|$|E

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it <b>does</b> <b>so</b> it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it <b>does</b> <b>so</b> at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the claimant (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and <b>does</b> <b>so.</b> The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
