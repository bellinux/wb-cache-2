40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} employing starch-protein hydrolysate of amaranth flour, as by-product in manufacture of protein concentrate, to produce protective edible coats on butter. Tests were run on 2 coating solutions. The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate containing 35 % (w/v) dry matter, 30 % (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 % (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin).

Butters were stored {{for a total of}} 126 days in refrigerator at 6 ± 1. 5 °C and relative humidity 43 ± 3 °C. Tests examined the oxidation course of butter by determining its peroxide value (PV) and the difference between PV of butters with coatings, without coatings, of butter wrapped <b>in</b> original <b>wrapper,</b> butters wrapped <b>in</b> paper <b>wrapper</b> and of butters <b>in</b> paper <b>wrappers</b> impregnated with coating solutions.
