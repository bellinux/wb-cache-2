We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is going to go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E
500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants. She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit right for her. She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's not one to strap {{on some sort of}} fake image." [...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E
