25|$|<b>Gastrin</b> – is in {{the stomach}} and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an {{inactive}} form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. Secretion of <b>gastrin</b> is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH.|$|E
25|$|Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, {{which can}} be present with {{increased}} gastric acidity due to <b>gastrin</b> production.|$|E
25|$|A {{high blood}} calcium level, which can {{increase}} <b>gastrin</b> production, leading to increased acidity.|$|E
25|$|A major {{causative factor}} (60% of gastric {{and up to}} 50–75% of {{duodenal}} ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa. The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active gastritis (type B gastritis). <b>Gastrin</b> stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased <b>gastrin,</b> the increase in acid {{can contribute to the}} erosion of the mucosa and therefore ulcer formation.|$|E
25|$|Secretion {{of these}} proenzymes is via the hormones <b>gastrin,</b> {{cholecystokinin}} and secretin, which are secreted by {{cells in the}} stomach and duodenum in response to distension and/or food.|$|E
25|$|The GI tract {{releases}} hormones from enzymes to help {{regulate the}} digestive process. These hormones, including <b>gastrin,</b> secretin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin, are mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms, {{indicating that the}} cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{intestinal}} phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food {{fills the}} duodenum. This triggers intestinal <b>gastrin</b> to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular stimuli {{are carried}} by the vagus nerve. The vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information, {{including}} for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying, to suppress or promote feeding, by signalling the release of leptin or <b>gastrin,</b> respectively. Again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern of}} B12 {{transfer}} to a special binding protein secreted in a previous digestive step, is repeated once more before absorption. The next binding protein for B12 is intrinsic factor (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric parietal cells that is secreted in response to histamine, <b>gastrin</b> and pentagastrin, {{as well as the}} presence of food.|$|E
25|$|Other than <b>gastrin,</b> these hormones all act to {{turn off}} the stomach action. This is in {{response}} to food products in the liver and gall bladder, which have not yet been absorbed. The stomach needs to push food into the small intestine only when the intestine is not busy. While the intestine is full and still digesting food, the stomach acts as storage for food.|$|E
25|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone <b>gastrin,</b> for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift {{up a piece of}} paper. Torunn Atteraas Garin participated in the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener.|$|E
25|$|The H2 antagonists are {{competitive}} antagonists of histamine at the parietal cell's H2 receptor. They {{suppress the}} normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: Histamine released by ECL {{cells in the}} stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors, which stimulate acid secretion; therefore, other substances that promote acid secretion (such as <b>gastrin</b> and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.|$|E
500|$|The {{inflammatory}} response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces G {{cells in the}} antrum to secrete the hormone <b>gastrin,</b> which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus. <b>Gastrin</b> stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen, and over time increases the number of parietal cells, as well. [...] The increased acid load damages the duodenum, which may eventually result in ulcers forming in the duodenum.|$|E
500|$|The small {{minority}} of tumors that arise elsewhere in the pancreas are mainly pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). [...] Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are {{a diverse group of}} benign or malignant tumors that arise from the body's neuroendocrine cells, which are responsible for integrating the nervous and endocrine systems. NETs can start in most organs of the body, including the pancreas, where the various malignant types are all considered to be rare. [...] PanNETs are grouped into 'functioning' and 'non-functioning' types, depending on {{the degree to which they}} produce hormones. The functioning types secrete hormones such as insulin, <b>gastrin,</b> and glucagon into the bloodstream, often in large quantities, giving rise to serious symptoms such as low blood sugar, but also favoring relatively early detection. The most common functioning PanNETs are insulinomas and gastrinomas, named after the hormones they secrete. The non-functioning types do not secrete hormones in a sufficient quantity to give rise to overt clinical symptoms. For this reason, non-functioning PanNETs are often diagnosed only after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{phases of}} {{digestion}} take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase {{occurs at the}} sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food {{at this point and}} thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes <b>gastrin)</b> activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of <b>gastrin</b> and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release <b>gastrin,</b> which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. [...] Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. [...] Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.|$|E
2500|$|Under microscopy, the pylorus {{contains}} numerous glands, including gastric pits, which constitute {{about half}} {{the depth of the}} pyloric mucosa. [...] They consist of two or three short closed tubes opening into a common duct or mouth. These tubes are wavy, and are about one-half the length of the duct. The duct is lined by columnar cells, continuous with the epithelium lining the surface of the mucous membrane of the stomach, the tubes by shorter and more cubical cell which are finely granular. The glands contain mucus cells and G cells that secrete <b>gastrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Gastrin</b> II has {{identical}} {{amino acid}} composition to <b>Gastrin</b> I, {{the only difference}} is that the single tyrosine residue is sulfated in <b>Gastrin</b> II.|$|E
5000|$|Tetragastrin (N-((phenylmethoxy)carbonyl)-L-tryptophyl-L-methionyl-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalaninamide) is the C-terminal tetrapeptide of <b>gastrin.</b> It is the {{smallest}} peptide fragment of <b>gastrin</b> which has the same physiological and pharmacological activity as <b>gastrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Minigastrin (also mini <b>gastrin)</b> {{is a form}} of <b>gastrin.</b> Its {{sequence}} is H-Leu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2.|$|E
50|$|Big <b>gastrin</b> {{is a form}} of <b>gastrin</b> with 34 {{amino acids}} in the sequence.|$|E
50|$|Little <b>gastrin</b> I {{is a form}} of <b>gastrin</b> {{commonly}} called as gastrin-17. This is a protein hormone, secreted by the intestine.|$|E
50|$|Low intragastric pH stimulates antral D {{cells to}} release somatostatin. Somatostatin {{inhibits}} <b>gastrin</b> release from G cells. Reduced <b>gastrin</b> secretion reduces acid secretion.|$|E
50|$|In anatomy, the G cell {{is a type}} of cell in {{the stomach}} and {{duodenum}} that secretes <b>gastrin.</b> It works in conjunction with gastric chief cells and parietal cells. G cells are found deep within the pyloric glands of the stomach antrum, and occasionally in the pancreas and duodenum. The vagus nerve innervates the G cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide is released by the post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve onto G cells during parasympathetic stimulation. The peptide hormone bombesin also stimulates <b>gastrin</b> from G cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide, as well as the presence of amino acids in the stomach, stimulates the release of <b>gastrin</b> from the G cells. <b>Gastrin</b> stimulates enterochromaffin-like cells to secrete histamine. <b>Gastrin</b> also targets parietal cells by increasing the amount of histamine and the direct stimulation by <b>gastrin,</b> causing the parietal cells to increase HCl secretion in the stomach.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gastrin</b> {{primarily}} induces acid-secretion indirectly, increasing histamine synthesis in ECL cells,which in {{turn signal}} parietal cells via histamine release/H2 stimulation. <b>Gastrin</b> itself {{has no effect}} on the maximum histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion.|$|E
50|$|Most {{islet cell}} tumors secrete {{pancreatic}} polypeptide, the clinical significance {{of which is}} unknown. <b>Gastrin</b> is secreted by many non-β-cell tumors (increased <b>gastrin</b> secretion in MEN 1 also often originates from the duodenum). Increased <b>gastrin</b> secretion increases gastric acid, which may inactivate pancreatic lipase, leading to diarrhea and steatorrhea. Increased <b>gastrin</b> secretion also leads to peptic ulcers in > 50% of MEN 1 patients. Usually the ulcers are multiple or atypical in location, and often bleed, perforate, or become obstructed. Peptic ulcer disease may be intractable and complicated. Among patients presenting with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, 20 to 60% have MEN 1.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gastrin</b> is {{a linear}} peptide hormone {{produced}} by G {{cells of the}} duodenum and in the Pyloric antrum of the stomach. It is secreted into the bloodstream. <b>Gastrin</b> is found primarily in three forms: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{autoimmune}} gastritis, {{the immune}} system attacks the parietal cells leading to hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid secretion). This results in an elevated <b>gastrin</b> level {{in an attempt to}} compensate for increased pH in the stomach. Eventually, all the parietal cells are lost and achlorhydria results leading to a loss of negative feedback on <b>gastrin</b> secretion. Plasma <b>gastrin</b> concentration is elevated in virtually all individuals with mucolipidosis type IV (mean 1507 pg/mL; range 400-4100 pg/mL) (normal 0-200 pg/mL) secondary to a constitutive achlorhydria. This finding facilitates the diagnosis of patients with this neurogenetic disorder. Additionally, elevated <b>gastrin</b> levels may be present in chronic gastritis resulting from H pylori infection.|$|E
50|$|Hordenine {{has been}} found to be a potent {{stimulant}} of <b>gastrin</b> release in the rat, being essentially equipotent with N-methyltyramine: 83 nM/kg of hordenine (corresponding to ~14 mg/kg of the free base) enhancing <b>gastrin</b> release by ~ 60%.|$|E
5000|$|... b. Chemical Stimuli (i.e. {{partially}} digested proteins, caffeine) - directly activates - G cells (Enteroendocrine Cells) {{located in}} the pyloric region of the stomach - to secrete <b>gastrin</b> - <b>Gastrin</b> stimulates - Gastric Glands to secrete gastric Juice.|$|E
50|$|Through {{her medical}} training, Tracy linked <b>gastrin</b> to a disease in humans, the rare cancer Zollinger-Ellison {{syndrome}} where excessive production of <b>gastrin</b> results in peptic ulcers. She drove {{this aspect of}} their research forwards that involved collaborations in the USA.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gastrin</b> - is in {{the stomach}} and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an {{inactive}} form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. Secretion of <b>gastrin</b> is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH.|$|E
5000|$|In the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, <b>gastrin</b> is {{produced}} at excessive levels, often by a gastrinoma (gastrin-producing tumor, mostly benign) of the duodenum or the pancreas. To investigate for hypergastrinemia (high {{blood levels of}} <b>gastrin),</b> a [...] "pentagastrin test" [...] can be performed.|$|E
50|$|A secretagogue is a {{substance}} that causes another substance to be secreted. One example is <b>gastrin,</b> which stimulates the H/K ATPase in the parietal cells (increased gastric acid production by the stomach). Pentagastrin, a synthetic <b>gastrin,</b> histamine, and acetylcholine are also gastric secretagogues.|$|E
50|$|VMAT1 {{also has}} {{effects on the}} {{modulation}} of <b>gastrin</b> processing in G cells. These intestinal endocrine cells process amine precursors, and VMAT1 pulls them into vesicles for storage. The activity of VMAT1 in these cells has a seemingly inhibitory effect on the processing of <b>gastrin.</b> Essentially, this means that certain compounds in the gut can be taken into these G cells and either amplify or inhibit the function of VMAT1, which will impact <b>gastrin</b> processing (conversion from G34 to G17).|$|E
50|$|Gastrin-releasing peptide is a {{regulatory}} human peptide that elicits <b>gastrin</b> release and regulates gastric acid secretion and enteric motor function. The post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve that innervate the G {{cells of the}} stomach release GRP, which stimulates the G cells to release <b>gastrin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He then {{trained as}} a {{physiologist}} in the Department of Physiology at University College, London in the early 1930s and then studied gastrointestinal physiology for a PhD at North-Western University, Illinois. He {{turned his attention to}} <b>gastrin</b> while he was Holt Professor of Physiology, and Head of Department, at the University of Liverpool (appointed in 1948). He [...] "made fundamental contributions to the study of gut hormones through his isolation of the gastric acid stimulating hormone <b>gastrin,</b> the characterisation of its spectrum of actions, the identification of structure-activity relationships and discovery that <b>gastrin</b> was produced in excess in the tumours of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome". Much of the work on <b>gastrin</b> at Liverpool was with his long-term collaborator Hilda Tracy in the same department.|$|E
