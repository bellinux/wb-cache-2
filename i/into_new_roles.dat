25|$|The 9th Division began embarking for {{its return}} to Australia on 24 January 1943. Transported on four troopships—the Queen Mary, Ile de France, Nieuw Amsterdam and Aquitania—as part of Operation Pamphlet the {{division}} arrived at Fremantle in Western Australia on 18 February whereupon {{all members of}} the division were granted three weeks leave. Welcome-home parades were held in every Australian capital city, after which the 9th Division began reforming in April 1943 in the semi-tropical Atherton Tablelands region of Far North Queensland where it began re-organising and re-training for jungle warfare. As part of the conversion to a Jungle Division many of the division’s units were either separated from the division, reorganised <b>into</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> or disbanded. Of note, the division's cavalry unit, the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment, gave up its vehicles and was converted to the commando role, becoming the 2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiment. After completing amphibious training near Cairns the 9th Division, now under Major General George Wootten who had taken command of the division in March, departed for Milne Bay in New Guinea in late July and early August 1943.|$|E

50|$|The {{organisation}} uses {{many different}} types of vehicles. Some are purpose-built and some have been adapted <b>into</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> such as mobile incident command units. Many of the vehicles have all-terrain capabilities such as Land Rover Defender field ambulances, Bedford and Iveco four-wheel drive lorries and Bandvagn 206 personnel carriers. Standard vehicles such as emergency ambulances and class B fire appliances are also available for use by their respective services. Vehicle livery is generally non-standardised orange and blue on a white background with the exception of Dublin Civil Defence who use fleet-standard orange/blue Battenburg markings over white paintwork on all new vehicles. The Water Rescue Unit have a fleet of inshore patrol vessels and rigid-hulled inflatable boats.|$|E

50|$|Between {{the major}} world wars {{incremental}} improvements made in many areas, especially powerplants, aerodynamics, structures, and weapons, {{led to an}} even more rapid advance in aircraft technology during World War II, with large performance increases {{and the introduction of}} aircraft <b>into</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles,</b> including Airborne Early Warning, electronic warfare, weather reconnaissance, and flying lifeboats. Great Britain used aircraft to suppress revolts throughout the Empire during the interwar period and introduced the first military transports, which revolutionized logistics, allowing troops and supplies to be quickly delivered over vastly greater distances. While they first appeared during World War I, ground attack aircraft didn't provide a decisive contribution until the Germans introduced Blitzkrieg during the Invasion of Poland and Battle of France, where aircraft functioned as mobile flying artillery to quickly disrupt defensive formations. The Allies would later use rocket-equipped fighters in the same role, immobilizing German armored divisions during the Battle of Normandy and afterwards. World War I also saw the creation of the first strategic bomber units, however, they wouldn't be tested until the Spanish Civil War where the perceived effects of mass bombardment would encourage their widespread use during World War II. Carrier aviation also first appeared during World War I, and likewise came {{to play a major role}} during World War II, with most major navies recognizing the aircraft carrier's advantages over the battleship and devoting massive resources to the building of new carriers.|$|E
5000|$|Over 21 {{million people}} were killed or injured in World War I; in many cases, all {{of the men in}} one family were killed, {{numerous}} cities in Europe were destroyed, and family life throughout the world was greatly affected. [...] While the United States suffered the fewest casualties, family life was still greatly affected as husbands were deployed and wives had to begin working. As the war draft suddenly removed many men from factory work, the factories began soliciting for women workers in traditionally male-dominated areas. [...] Therefore, women had less time to spend at home with the children, as many of them would have before the war. As fathers, uncles, brothers, and grandfathers deployed in military service, women filled their places in factories and offices, changing the ways young children and teens received home nurturing. Additionally, women moving <b>into</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> in society had lasting effects on children and family life after the war. President Woodrow Wilson stated, [...] "We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?" [...] As women began working in the factories, more of society began to realize the need for women’s rights; while women had been granted suffrage (voting rights) to varying degrees in several states beginning in the late 19th century, they were now guaranteed full suffrage throughout the United States by the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution passed in August, 1920. This also {{paved the way for the}} children of future generations by creating greater career opportunities for girls and women; as women gained a stronger voice, girls became more involved in the workforce and education and prepared for roles outside of the home. Additionally, family life was affected after the war as more and more women entered the work force, moving away from the traditional stay-at-home mother and housewife role.|$|E

40|$|At {{present it}} is usual {{that there is}} an effort in primary schools to shift a part of the {{responsibilities}} off the teacher on the students.

40|$|The {{termination}} {{of a marriage}} by death or separation precipitates individuals <b>into</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> and social situations, and {{it has long been}} assumed that this experience may create exceptional vulnera-bility to medico-social disorders. Stein and Susser (1969) have suggested that this vulnerability is created by the transitional event rather than by the continuing new situation. As a means of ap-proaching the general question, this paper examines the self-reported health experience of a sample of female divorcees. The findings support the notion that transitions in marital status are causally related to morbidity, and suggest also that the general practitioner may be strategically situated to mediate in situations of marriage breakdown...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPlus strand RNA {{viruses that}} {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm face challenges {{in supporting the}} numerous biosynthetic functions required for replication and propagation.

In the course of infectious cycles many nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins of mostly nuclear distribution are detained in the cytoplasm by viruses and re-purposed for their own gain. Many mammalian viruses hijack a common group of the same factors. This review summarizes recent gains in our knowledge of how cytoplasmic RNA viruses use these co-opted host nuclear factors in new functional roles supporting virus translation and virus RNA replication and common themes employed between different virus groups...|$|E
40|$|Education is {{changing}} and becoming more global. Therefore, {{there is an}} increasing need for human resource managers to effectively manage the expatriation and repatriation processes of expatriates. The literature argues that the repatriation process from both workplace and employee's perspective remains problematic, and has been neglected by both organisations and the research literature. Returning home and resettling <b>into</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> is often traumatic for the expatriate. The literature reports that staff often leave their organisations following repatriation. This results {{in a loss of}} international knowledge and calls for a more strategic approach to repatriation. This exploratory paper which draws on experience of expatriates and research literature in the field, argues for the development of new knowledge management frameworks and taxonomies, because globalisation has forced expatriation and repatriation on to the strategic agenda.
