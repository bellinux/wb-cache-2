25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{it shares}} the {{temperate}} climate found in Southern Ontario, {{its proximity to}} Lake Ontario moderates winter temperatures and it also benefits from a sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment, allowing the most northerly tracts of Carolinian forest to thrive on the Escarpment that runs through western sections of city. Several species of flora and fauna usually found only in more southern climes have their only Canadian presence here including paw-paw, green dragon (Arisaema dracontium), tuckahoe (Peltandra virginica), American columbo (Frasera carolinensis), wall-rue (Asplenium ruta-muraria), plus the Louisiana waterthrush, the <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> the southern flying squirrel and the rare eastern pipistrelle.

50|$|No golden-winged warblers or blue-winged warblers were {{observed}} in Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 55 between 2011 and 2013. However, 14 species of warblers were there observed in May 1997. These warblers included the magnolia warbler, the yellow-rumped warbler, the Blackburnian warbler, the black-throated blue warbler, the black-throated green warbler, the <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> the cerulean warbler, and several others. Dark-eyed juncos also inhabit the game lands.|$|E
50|$|These birds feed on insects, {{which are}} often found in low {{vegetation}} or caught by flycatching. Hooded warblers' breeding habitats are broadleaved woodlands with dense undergrowth. These birds nest in low areas of a bush, laying three to five eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Hooded warblers are often the victims of brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird, especially where the hooded warblers' forest habitats are fragmented. In areas with protected woodlands or recovering wooded habitat, the <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler</b> population is stable and possibly increasing.|$|E

Mature forests are often dominated by American beech and sugar maple with a notable presence of species, including sassafras and tulip tree, which are restricted to the Carolinian forest region. Some rare birds are present, most notably <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler</b> in woods and Acadian flycatcher in ravines.|$|E
50|$|Cootes Paradise is {{designated}} a nationally Important Bird Area (IBA) {{due to its}} strategic location {{at the tip of}} Lake Ontario and with the Central and Mississippi Flyways.

Notable species include the least bittern, <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> white pelican, Caspian tern, black-crowned night-heron, osprey, pileated woodpecker, and the prothonotary warbler. Recently, a nesting pair of bald eagles have recolonized the marsh on the north shore of Cootes Paradise. This is the first such nest on Lake Ontario in more than 40 years.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 in Giles County, Virginia, {{a female}} Canada warbler (or a post-hatching year old male {{that failed to}} moult, {{something}} never before observed) {{for the first time}} was observed singing. Its songs repertoire consisted of a repeated song of 12 to 13 notes as well as several shorter songs consisting of the first five or six notes of the longer song. The bird did not respond to playbacks of its own song or a recording of a male. Although female singing among the parulids has long been considered [...] "idiosyncratic," [...] singing by female Canada warblers is supported by observation of femaile singing in congener Wilsons warbler (C. pusilla) and the closely related <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga citrina).|$|E

50|$|Reports {{of birds}} from the Missouri and Arkansas {{breeding}} grounds lasted through the 1940s, while birds were reported breeding in South Carolina's I'on Swamp until 1953. Individuals were reported from Fairfax County, Virginia in 1954 and 1958, and a male was seen singing near I'on Swamp in April 1962. On March 30, 1977 an immature female {{was seen in}} Brevard County, Florida. Credible reports ended in the 1980s. More recent reports of the species from the Congaree National Park in the early 2000s have prompted formal investigation, but were attributed as misidentifications of <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler</b> sightings and northern parula songs. A thorough and systematic search using playback of recorded Bachman's warbler songs did not reveal any territorial males and did not provoke any aggressive response from other bird species.|$|E
50|$|Tortoises {{such as the}} Eastern box turtle can {{be found}} in Prince William Forest Park, {{especially}} after a light rain. There are a number of Amphibians that inhabit the park. Toads and frogs, such as the American toad, American bullfrogs, and Cope's gray tree frog can be spotted in the park, as can salamanders such as the marbled salamander and the eastern red-backed salamander. A variety of bird species, such as the <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> the wood thrush, and the red-shouldered hawk, can also be found. The park is also home to Mammals, such as red foxes and white-tailed deer; spotted along the upper North Valley Trail. A few black rat snakes have been seen in and around logs and brush areas. Various skinks can be seen around sunny areas of the trails.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is a small}} {{bird and}} mid-sized warbler, {{measuring}} 13 cm in length and weighing 9 - 12 g. It has a plain olive/green-brown back, and yellow underparts. Their outer rectrices have whitish vanes. Males have distinctive black hoods which surround their yellow faces; the female has an olive-green cap which does not extend to the forehead, ears and throat instead. Males attain their hood at about 9-12 months of age; younger birds are essentially identical to (and easily confused with) females. The song {{is a series of}} musical notes which sound like: wheeta wheeta whee-tee-oh, for which a common mnemonic is [...] "The red, the red T-shirt" [...] or [...] "Come to the woods or you won't see me".

5000|$|There are six broad {{categories}} of bird habitats near Long Island Sound: (1) open water areas, including bays, coves, rivers and the Sound itself; (2) tidal marshes; (3) mudflats; (4) sandy beaches; (5) offshore islands; and (6) mainland uplands, including woodlands and fields. Some birds are summer residents or winter residents, {{while others are}} spring and fall transients. Year round residents include herring gull, greater black-backed gull, common tern and double-crested cormorant.

50|$|Whitetail {{deer are}} the largest {{indigenous}} mammals found in the Southeast, {{with the exception of}} small, isolated populations of black bear and the endangered Florida panther. Many small mammals inhabit this region including raccoons, fox squirrels, eastern gray squirrels, foxes, cottontail rabbits, armadillos and opossums. Bobwhite and wild turkey are the main game bird that {{can be found in the}} region. Other very common birds found in the Southeast are mourning doves, pine warbler, cardinal, summer tanager, Carolina wren, ruby-throated hummingbird, blue jay, <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> eastern towhee, and tufted titmouse. Many non-game migratory birds and migratory waterfowl are common as well. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is also native to the region. Numerous species of reptiles and amphibians can be found here as well, such as the American alligator, common and alligator snapping turtles, fence and glass lizards, and salamanders. The forest snake species found include cottonmouth moccasin, copperhead, rough green snake, rat snake, coachwhip, and speckled kingsnake. Manatees are found in estuaries and channels throughout the state. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many tropical fish species.|$|E
50|$|The mammal species found {{throughout}} the Northeast United States {{are similar to those}} of the Southeast and include whitetail deer, black bear, bobcat, gray fox, raccoon, eastern gray squirrel, fox squirrel, eastern chipmunk, white-footed mouse, pine vole, and cotton mouse. The Northeast has a very abundant bird population. Common game birds found in the region are turkey, ruffed grouse, bobwhite, and mourning dove. Other non-game birds found in abundance include the cardinal, Carolina wren, wood thrush, summer tanager, red-eyed vireo, blue-gray gnatcatcher, and tufted titmouse. In the mountain range other commonly found species include red-breasted nuthatches, black-throated green warblers, golden-crowned warblers, flickersworm-eating warblers, brilliant <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> golden-crowned kinglets, northern juncos, pileated woodpeckers, downy, hairy, and red-bellied woodpeckers, Louisiana waterthrush, wood thrush, ovenbird, summer tanager, and rose-breasted grosbeak.

5000|$|The {{forests are}} a part of the {{temperate}} deciduous forest that extends from Florida north to eastern Canada. [...] The mixed plains ecozone has the highest plant diversity in Canada, with the Lake Erie lowland having trees species that occur nowhere else in Canada. Within Canada, these forest types are often referred to as the 'Carolinian zone' owing to the many southern plants and animals that reach their northern limits here. Clearing for agriculture and urbanization have reduced natural forest cover to less than ten percent. An overview of the flora and fauna of this distinctive region is available in The Natural Treasures of Carolinian Canada. A few of the many examples of southern species found here include the <b>hooded</b> <b>warbler,</b> king rail, prothonotary warbler, blue-gray gnatcatcher, American badger, opossum, and eastern spiny softshell turtle. Past work has identified 38 critical natural areas, and an initiative known as The Big Picture aims to restore natural corridors as part of a natural heritage system. Some of the critical core areas in this region include Point Pelee, Long Point, Rondeau Park, Skunk's Misery, Backus Woods and Willoughby Marsh.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{species of}} birds {{can be found on}} Gildersleeve mountain. Barred owls are common year round {{residents}} and can be found by listening and watching carefully.

Cooper's hawks, red-shouldered hawks, broad-winged hawks and red-tailed hawks also nest on the slopes. Wild turkey nests here. The spectacular pileated woodpecker, as well as hairy, downy, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common year round. Great creasted flycatcher, eastern phoebe, eastern wood pewee and Acadian flycatcher are common nesters. Eastern bluebird is common in the more open areas, wood thrush is found nesting wherever trees create a canopy overhead. Black-capped chickadees, tufted titmice, white-breasted nuthatch are common residents and red-breasted nuthatch is sometimes found. Red-eyed vireos are common tree top nesters. <b>Hooded</b> <b>warbler</b> and American redstart are common nesters in the forest under story.
