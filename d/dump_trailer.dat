50|$|Euclid also {{pioneered the}} high speed tractor belly dumper. This {{combined}} an off road tractor (with a fifth wheel) {{and a very}} large, up to 100-ton capacity, belly <b>dump</b> <b>trailer.</b> This machine, descended from bottom dump wagons drawn by crawler tractors, discharged its load through longitudinal gates {{in the bottom of}} the trailer. The first such trucks carried 13 cubic yards, but by the early 1960s capacities reached 110 tons.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dump</b> <b>{{trailers}}</b> ("British" [...] Tippers) are trailers {{in which}} one end can be raised to allow the cargo (often building materials or Agricultural produce) to slide out the other end.

50|$|Stack {{steaming}} is {{used when}} thermically treating compost and substrates such as turf. Depending on the amount, {{the material to}} be steamed is piled up to 70 cm height in steaming boxes or in small <b>dump</b> <b>trailers.</b> Steam is evenly injected via manifolds. For huge amounts, steaming containers and soil boxes are used which are equipped with suction systems to improve steaming results. Midget amounts can be steamed in special small steaming devices.|$|R
5000|$|A live bottom trailer is a {{semi-trailer}} {{used for}} hauling loose material such as asphalt, grain, potatoes, sand and gravel. A live bottom trailer is {{the alternative to}} a dump truck or an end <b>dump</b> <b>trailer.</b> The typical live bottom trailer has a conveyor belt {{on the bottom of}} the trailer tub that pushes the material out of the back of the trailer at a controlled pace. Unlike the conventional dump truck, the tub does not have to be raised to deposit the materials.|$|E
50|$|The live bottom trailer {{eliminates}} trailer {{roll over}} because the tub {{does not have}} to be raised in the air to unload the materials. The trailer has a lower centre of gravity which makes it easy for the trailer to unload in an uneven area, compared to dump trailers that have to be on level ground to unload.Over head wires are a danger for the conventional <b>dump</b> <b>trailer</b> during unloading, but with a live bottom, wires are not a problem. The trailer can work anywhere that it can drive into because the tub {{does not have to}} be raised for unloading.|$|E
5000|$|The tub empties clean, {{making it}} easier for {{different}} materials to be transported without having to get inside the tub to clean it out. The conveyor belt allows the material to be dumped at a controlled pace so that the material can be partially unloaded where it is needed.The rounded tub results in a lower centre of gravity which means a smoother ride and better handling than other trailers. Working under bridges and in confined areas is easier with a live bottom as opposed to a <b>dump</b> <b>trailer</b> because it can fit anywhere it can drive.Wet or dry materials can be hauled in a live bottom trailer.|$|E

For example, its early Dirt Hauler kit {{was merely a}} generic tractor-trailer with <b>dumping</b> <b>trailer.</b> Then, in 1969, AMT released the California Hauler 359 kit. This new kit was a revolution for model building, a realistic model of a Peterbilt 359 tractor-trailer, the design having been copied from the manufacturer's specifications. It also had an authentic 8V71 Detroit Diesel engine under the hood. The kit lacked a sleeper cab, {{but there was a}} coupon that could be sent in along with ten cents to get it. The following year, the second version was issued with a sleeper cab.|$|R
5000|$|Dedicated Contract Service (DCS): Started in 1992. DCS {{operations}} typically provide customized {{services that}} are governed by long-term contracts and currently include dry-van, flatbed, temperature-controlled, <b>dump</b> <b>trailers</b> and local inner-city operationsIntermodal (JBI): The JBI segment began operations in 1989 with {{a partnership with the}} former Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway Company). Essentially, JBI draws on the intermodal (also known as [...] "container on flatcar") services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries ("drayage") for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations.

5000|$|The {{dump truck}} {{is thought to}} have been first {{conceived}} in the farms of late 19th century western Europe. Thornycroft developed a steam dust-cart in 1896 with a tipper mechanism. The first motorized dump trucks in the United States were developed by small equipment companies such as The Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, Galion Buggy Co. and Lauth-Juergens among many others around 1910. Hydraulic dump beds were introduced by Wood Hoist Co. shortly after. Such companies flourished during World War I due to massive wartime demand. August Fruehauf had obtained military contracts for his semi-trailer, invented in 1914 and later created the partner vehicle, the semi-truck for use in World War I. After the war, Fruehauf introduced hydraulics in his trailers. They offered hydraulic lift gates, hydraulic winches and a <b>dump</b> <b>trailer</b> for sales in the early 1920s. Fruehauf became the premier supplier of dump trailers and their famed [...] "bathtub dump" [...] was considered to be the best by heavy haulers, road and mining construction firms.|$|E
50|$|A {{side dump}} truck (SDT) {{consists}} of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either {{the left or right}} side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side <b>dump</b> <b>trailer</b> will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the trailer's wheels. Trailers that dump at the appropriate angle (50° for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the trailer wheels by dumping their loads further {{to the side of the}} truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.|$|E

50|$|Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, {{previously}} Fruehauf Trailer Company (1918-1963) and Fruehauf Corporation (1963-1989), was an American company {{engaged in}} the manufacture and sale of truck trailers, and other machinery and equipment, with headquarters located in Detroit, Michigan. It was founded in 1918 in Detroit, after August Fruehauf created the semi-trailer and launched a new industry. The Fruehauf trailer company introduced revolutionary inventions to trucking and transportation with hydraulic <b>dump</b> <b>trailers,</b> bulk tanker trailers, and automatic fifth wheel coupling among their over one thousand patents, including the shipping container in 1956. Expanding across the country, Fruehauf had 16 plants and over 80 distributorships for parts and service. Globally, the company expanded into Europe, South America and Asia. Following a proxy battle in the late 1980s the company filed for bankrupt protection in 1997. International divisions became independent, U.S. subsidiaries like Kelsey Hayes, Pro-Par, Budd Wheels and Hobbs were sold; Wabash National acquired the crippled company in 1997.|$|R
