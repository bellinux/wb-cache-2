40|$|A {{theory has}} been {{developed}} for prediction of flow-generated noise due to the interaction of two strip spoilers in a low Mach number airflow duct in a ventilation system. In this paper, the concept of partially coherent fields is applied to formulate the sound powers radiated at frequencies below and above the cut-on frequency of the first transverse duct mode. An interaction factor {{is defined as a}} result of a simple relationship between the sound power level due to the interaction of two flow spoilers and that due to a single <b>flow</b> <b>spoiler</b> in an air duct. The present investigation therefore indicates that it is possible to predict the level and spectral distribution of the additional acoustic energy produced by the interaction of two similar strip spoilers. The proposed prediction method can form a basis of a generalised prediction method for flow-generated noise radiated by in-duct elements in a ventilation system.

It was {{published}} in the journal, Journal of analytical atomic spectrometry [© RSC Publishing] and is available at: [URL] paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to the modelling of the performance of a cyclonic spray chamber with <b>flow</b> <b>spoiler</b> designed to provide good efficiency with rapid wash-out time. The modelling is carried out under two flow regimes, one corresponding to typical sample introduction conditions and one to low sample uptake. Velocity distributions, pressure distributions and mass flows are simulated, the latter employing the measured primary aerosol distributions as inputs to the computation. The dynamic performance of chambers is also modelled and the signal profiles produced are shown to correspond to those derived directly from measurement. Six different chambers are studied corresponding to a chamber with no spoiler, a single spoiler in four different positions, and a chamber with 3 spoilers. The position of the spoiler is shown to be critical in determining the flow field in the chamber and hence the efficiency and washout time. It is demonstrated that chamber geometry has maximum impact under low uptake conditions where the limited dispersion primary aerosol can effectively follow the gas flow lines. Computation indicates that a chamber with optimised spoiler, operating under low uptake conditions, provides the best combination of efficiency and response time. This was confirmed by experiment in which the performance of 3 different chambers was compared, with the optimised design providing detection limits 1. 5 – 19 better than those obtained with the chamber supplied with the ICP-AES instrument. A chamber with 3 spoilers indicates the formation of a low-volum...|$|E

40|$|Flyover {{noise levels}} of today's {{aircraft}} in the approach configuration - i. e. with slats, flaps and gears deployed -are occasionally dominated by airframe noise contributions. Initial airframe noise tests were performed in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel, employing full-scale A 320 landing gears. Farfield noise characteristics were determined from measurements with different gear configurations (covering different gear elements with streamlined fairings) at wind speeds ranging from 40 to 78 m/s. Aerodynamic noise from landing gears turnes out to be broadband with constant levels in 1 / 3 -oct. bands up to 3 kHz. Levels increase corresponding to the 6 th power of flow velocity.

40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} have sought to develop a {{generalised}} prediction method for flow-generated noise that is produced by the interaction of multiple elements in the air flow duct of an air-conditioning system. The prediction methods for single or multiple in-duct discontinuities {{are based on the}} assumption that there is a constant of proportionality between the fluctuating drag force and the steady drag force that acts on the <b>flow</b> <b>spoilers.</b> To develop a prediction method for multiple in-duct discontinuities, the concept of partially coherent sound fields is adopted to formulate the sound powers that are produced by the interaction of multiple in-duct elements at frequencies both below and above the cut-on frequency of the lowest transverse duct mode. An interaction factor is defined as the result of a simple relationship between the sound power that is due to the interaction of multiple in-duct elements and the sound power that is due to a single in-duct element. The method has been found to agree well for two in-duct elements with experimental studies.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to devise generalized prediction techniques for airflow-generated noise [1]. A technique based upon the static pressure loss due to in-duct elements which built upon the earlier work of Nelson and Morfey [2] has recently been proposed by the authors [3]. In this paper, we describe how the Nelson and Morfey work can also be employed as the starting point of an alternative technique based upon aerodynamic and acoustical similarity. Many fluid-flow situations are of such complexity that they cannot be modelled using analytical techniques. An alternative approach is to use data measured on one con"guration to predict the behaviour of another con"guration which is suciently similar for simple scaling laws to be applied. For example, this is the basis of the wind-tunnel testing of scale models to determine the drag characteristics of dynamic objects. In employing similarity in this way, it is necessary to identify relevant dimensionless groupings of parameters. The Strouhal number is such a dimensionless grouping and its most well-known application is to relate the frequency of vortex shedding from a cylindrical spoiler in an air stream to the velocity of the airflow and the diameter of the spoiler. The Strouhal number is also frequently employed to normalize spectral data relating to the noise generated by in-duct <b>flow</b> <b>spoilers</b> (see, for example, reference [4]). In this paper, we show how similarity can be used to predict the airflow noise generated by common types of duct components...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow field}} {{generated}} by a two-dimensional airfoil with a statically deflected flap type spoiler has been experimentally studied. Subsonic tests ascertained the effect of varying spoiler deflection and angle of attack on the flow field at two Reynolds numbers. Measurements of the mean and fluctuating surface pressures and velocities in the wake, along with schlieren flow visualization of the near wake, were made. The results pertaining to the unsteady characteristics of the <b>spoiler</b> <b>flow</b> field are presented. It is shown that vortex shedding characterized the spoiler wake and determines the unsteady nature of the overall flow field; {{the character of the}} vortex shedding changes with spoiler deflection; and the fluctuating surface pressure field (vortex shedding frequency component) is of appreciable magnitude at large spoiler deflections...|$|R

Cantilever beam with uniformly varying load with roller support at the free end is considered for smart flaps. The boundedness criteria for this procedure are determined from a Normalized Variable diagram (NVD) scheme. The procedure incorporates the ε−k eddy-viscosity turbulence model. The method is first validated against experimental data. Then, the algorithm is applied for turbulent aerodynamic <b>flows</b> around a <b>spoiler</b> section with smart and conventional flaps for different attack angle, flap angle and ground clearance where the results of two flaps are compared. Finally, the best position of spoiler based on PSO optimization algorithm is calculated...|$|R

In a first attempt, steady RANS methods using the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras, the two-equation Menter kw-SST and the SSG/LRR-w Reynolds stress models have been applied to assess the suitability of the current approach in challenging flow conditions.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{investigators}} {{have tried to}} develop a generalized prediction method for flow-generated noise produced by in-duct elements in a ventilation system. Most of these prediction methods relied on limited data obtained from conventional measurement techniques that {{require the use of}} an expensive and specially combined acoustic and aerodynamic experimental facility. An alternative to using a specialised and aerodynamic facility that is currently gaining favour in building engineering is using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software packages. CFD is a powerful design tool that is able to predict the behaviour of fluid flow regimes. With the aid of CFD, Mak and Oldham have developed a predictive technique that is based on the relationship between the acoustic power radiated, due to the interaction of air <b>flow</b> and a <b>spoiler,</b> and the turbulent kinetic energy generated in the region of the spoiler. Based on the results of CFD simulation of relevant configurations, the technique has been adopted to normalize the published experimental data of Nelson and Morfey, who produced a normalized spectrum for predicting the sound power level of flow-noise produced by the strip spoilers in a rectangular air duct. In this paper, the theoretical basis of this technique was reviewed and revised. A collapse of data from the simulation models were obtained against the experimental data of Oldham and Ukpoho. The data collapse for a damper were generally excellent at most Strouhal numbers. The data collapse for an orifice plate were generally excellent at lower Strouhal numbers but was less efficient at higher Strouhal numbers where considerable scatter was observed.
