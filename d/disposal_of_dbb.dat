40|$|Desbutyl-benflumetol (DBB) {{is a novel}} {{antimalarial}} compound {{closely related}} to benflumetol (lumefantrine), {{of which it is}} a putative metabolite. The in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum to DBB was studied in Mae Hong Son and Mae Sot, in northwest Thailand, in 1997 and 1998. In total, 155 fresh isolates were successfully tested using the World Health Organization standard in vitro microtest system (Mark II). The mean 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) and 90 % effective concentration <b>of</b> <b>DBB</b> were 6. 36 and 31. 09 nmol/liter, respectively. The comparison of the activity <b>of</b> <b>DBB</b> and benflumetol yielded a highly significant potency ratio of 4. 52, corresponding to a more than four times higher efficacy <b>of</b> <b>DBB.</b> A considerable potency difference was found between isolates from Mae Hong Son and those from Mae Sot, reflecting lesser sensitivity in the area with marked resistance to mefloquine and quinine. This observation is also supported by a highly significant activity correlation with benflumetol (P < 0. 001) and to a similar degree with mefloquine (P < 0. 001), reflecting a close relationship <b>of</b> <b>DBB</b> with the class II aryl amino alcohol blood schizontocides. A less distinct association was also found with artemisinin, which was significant only at the EC 50 level, and there was no correlation at all with chloroquine. DBB is a promising antimalarial compound that merits further investigation in order to define its practical therapeutic potential...|$|R

40|$|Elements of a "deeper level" {{explanation}} <b>of</b> the deBroglie-Bohm (<b>dBB)</b> version <b>of</b> {{quantum mechanics}} are presented. Our explanation {{is based on}} an analogy of quantum wave-particle duality with bouncing droplets in an oscillating medium, the latter being identified as the vacuum's zero-point field. A hydrodynamic analogy of a similar type has recently come under criticism by Richardson et al., because despite striking similarities at a phenomenological level the governing equations related to the force on the particle are evidently different for the hydrodynamic and the quantum descriptions, respectively. However, said differences are not relevant if a radically different use of said analogy is being made, thereby essentially referring to emergent processes in our model. If the latter are taken into account, one can show that the forces on the particles are identical in both the dBB and our model. In particular, this identity results from an exact matching of our emergent velocity field with the Bohmian "guiding equation". One thus arrives at an explanation involving a deeper, i. e. subquantum, level <b>of</b> the <b>dBB</b> version <b>of</b> quantum mechanics. We show in particular how the classically-local approach of the usual hydrodynamical modeling can be overcome and how, as a consequence, the configuration-space version <b>of</b> <b>dBB</b> theory for $N$ particles can be completely substituted by a "superclassical" emergent dynamics of $N$ particles in real 3 -dimensional space.

40|$|Abstract Background Children’s stool {{disposal}} {{is often}} overlooked in sanitation programs of any country. Unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool makes children susceptible to many diseases that transmit through faecal-oral route. Therefore, the study {{aims to examine}} the magnitude <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools in India, the factors associated with it and finally its association with childhood diarrhea. Methods Data from {{the third round of}} the National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) conducted in 2005 – 06 is used to carry out the analysis. The binary logistic regression model is used to examine the factors associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool. Binary logistic regression is also used to examine the association between unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool and childhood diarrhea. Result Overall, stools of 79 % of children in India were disposed of unsafely. The urban-rural gap in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool was wide. Mother’s illiteracy and lack of exposure to media, the age of the child, religion and caste/tribe of the household head, wealth index, access to toilet facility and urban-rural residence were statistically associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> stool. The odds of diarrhea in children whose stools were disposed of unsafely was estimated to be 11 % higher (95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 21) than that of children whose stools were disposed of safely. An increase in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool in the community also increased the risk of diarrhea in children. Conclusion We found significant statistical association between children’s stool disposal and diarrhea. Therefore, gains in reduction of childhood diarrhea can be achieved in India through the complete elimination <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools. The sanitation programmes currently being run in India must also focus on safe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool...|$|R
