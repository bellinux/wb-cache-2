25|$|Further {{application}} of the methodology used by Card and Krueger by other researchers yielded results similar to their original findings, across additional data sets. A 2010 study by three economists (Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, William Lester of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Michael Reich of the University of California, Berkeley), compared adjacent counties in different states where the minimum wage had been raised {{in one of the}} states. They analyzed <b>employment</b> <b>trends</b> for several categories of low-wage workers from 1990 to 2006 and found that increases in minimum wages had no negative effects on low-wage employment and successfully increased the income of workers in food services and retail employment, as well as the narrower category of workers in restaurants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Employment</b> <b>trends</b> in Bogotá {{indicate}} that rates of unemployment have fallen while {{a growing number}} of citizens are looking for work. This paradox can largely be explained by ongoing urbanization into Bogotá, therefore poverty remains a substantial problem. Jobs have been created in some sectors, and women are gaining more opportunities for employment, but more progress is needed. Overall, poverty since 1970 has decreased; however, data collected and presented in 2006 by UN-HABITAT at the World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada reveal that 50% of the population still live in poverty and many of those live in slums. A separate UN-HABITAT report from 2003 describes three types of slums in Bogotá: inner-city, those lying on the perimeter, and squatter settlements. The total number of those living under these conditions is around 700,000. Additional data by UN-HABITAT shows that wealth is very unevenly distributed and that pockets of poverty exist in Bogotá that are poorer than the poorest regions of the country as a whole.|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistic’s Job Opening and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTS) {{attempts}} to measure US labor market dynamics {{on a monthly}} basis. The JOLTS survey estimates both the flow of employment into business establishments (hires) and the flow of employment out of business establishments (separations). In theory, {{it is assumed that}} the levels of these two types of flow should relate directly and proportionately to the trend in the overall employment level. A number of factors prevent the <b>employment</b> <b>trend</b> and the net flow of hires and separations from equilibrating on a monthly basis. However, it is expected in theory that over time this equilibration should eventually occur. We will present evidence that even over time, for reported JOLTS data, the net flow of hires minus separations greatly exceeds reported <b>employment</b> <b>trend</b> and that this disequilibrium {{is the result of a}} significant deficiency in reported separations or excess of reported hires. Finally, we will present the corrective action adopted by JOLTS to account for the divergence between Current Employment Survey (CES) employment and JOLTS hires minus separations...|$|R

Since 2005, the upward trend in the number of workers contributing to social security has more or less moved in parallel in both parts of the country. This positive trend was supported by the widespread abolition of generous early retirement options. As a result, the employment rates of older workers increased sharply.|$|R
