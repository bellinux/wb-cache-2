Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, but this was not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, <b>fully</b> <b>loaded,</b> and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable.

5|$|A bulker's voyages are {{determined}} by market forces; routes and cargoes often vary. A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route.

5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port <b>fully</b> <b>loaded.</b> These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, loading and unloading, when partially and <b>fully</b> <b>loaded,</b> and {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E

At Unforgiven, Edge and Christian faced The New Age Outlaws for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.|$|E
5|$|On the June 26, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the APA won a Tag-Team Battle Royal against seven other teams {{to win a}} WWF Tag Team Championship match. During {{the weeks leading up}} to <b>Fully</b> <b>Loaded,</b> Edge and Christian avoided {{defending}} the Tag Team Championship against the APA. On July 10, 2000, the APA were scheduled to face Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championship, but Edge announced that he would face Bradshaw one-on-one in a match, which Bradshaw lost. Later that week on SmackDown!, Edge and Christian were scheduled to defend their Tag Team Championship against the APA, but they again made a one-on-one match, where Christian was defeated by Faarooq. At <b>Fully</b> <b>Loaded,</b> the APA won the Tag Team match by disqualification; due to WWF rules, Edge and Christian retained the Tag Team Championship. On the September 7, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the Dudley Boyz and the APA formed an alliance. The following week on Raw, the APA faced Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a losing effort. Then, on the September 18, 2000 edition of Raw, the Dudley Boyz also lost to Buchanan and The Goodfather. After the match, all the members of the Right to Censor (Buchanan, The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Val Venis) attacked the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in the APA coming out to help the Dudley Boyz, as a part of their alliance. The Dudley Boyz and the APA were then booked in an Eight-man Tag Team match against Right to Censor at Unforgiven, which Right to Censor won via pinfall.|$|E

50|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{electric}} generator performed as expected, but {{did have some}} difficulties {{at the beginning of}} installation. These problems were not entirely unexpected because there was no testing of the unit before shipment. Technology was not advanced enough and the manufacturer had no way of <b>fully</b> <b>loading</b> the machine for a thorough test before shipping. One of the troubles that developed when the turbine was in operation was with lubrication. The mechanism around the turbine shaft leaked some oil and came in contact with steam which impaired its lubricating ability.|$|R

40|$|Two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} analyses are performed {{to identify the}} optimal internal skirt spacing for the maximum undrained capacity of subsea skirted mudmats. <b>Fully</b> three-dimensional <b>loading</b> (vertical, biaxial horizontal, biaxial moment and torsion) is considered for subsea mudmats with skirt embedment ranging from 5 % to 20 % of the foundation breadth in soil {{with a range of}} linearly increasing strength with depth. The results have identified the governing case for determining the optimal skirt spacing for mudmats subjected to <b>fully</b> three-dimensional <b>loading.</b> It is also shown that optimal skirt spacing for rectangular or square mudmats can be determined in plane strain conditions using the equivalent foundation embedment ratio. The number of internal skirts required to ensure soil plug rigidity under <b>fully</b> three-dimensional <b>loading</b> is presented as a function of skirt embedment ratio, soil heterogeneity index and vertical load mobilisation. Results also indicate that effects of skirt roughness become negligible as foundation embedment ratio increases in terms of determining the optimal skirt spacing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. </p...|$|R

Another convoy was located and struck near Cape Padaran in southern Indochina, resulting {{in the loss of}} a tanker, two destroyer escorts and a patrol boat. A convoy comprising seven vessels was also attacked near Cape St. James in southern Indochina, leading to two freighters, three tankers, three destroyer escorts and a landing craft being sunk or forced to beach.|$|E
5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder <b>fully</b> <b>loaded</b> aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E

50|$|The {{transport}} {{process was}} costly, slow and dangerous. The bilancelle {{could not stand}} stormy seas, especially when loaded with lead, and so the service was discontinuous and the boats commonly sank. Sailors had terrible working conditions with low wages, no rest, and great physical fatigue. In bad weather, up to two months could be needed to <b>fully</b> <b>load</b> a steamship in Carloforte, while in good conditions no less than seven days were needed: {{the cost of the}} wages for so many workers in addition to the much larger cost of the steamship and quay rent made the transportation of the ore a very significant expense in the production process.|$|R

5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the <b>fully</b> <b>loaded</b> cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|In June 2000, Team Xtreme began a storyline with T & A (Test and Albert), with Lita {{engaging}} in a rivalry with their manager, Trish Stratus. The rivalry developed into an off and on long-term feud between the two women that lasted until Stratus retired in 2006. The storyline ended shortly after <b>Fully</b> <b>Loaded,</b> where Lita pinned Stratus in a six-person intergender tag team match. Subsequently, Lita began feuding with WWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. In the main event of the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw is War, Lita defeated Stephanie with a moonsault to win the Women's Championship for the first time.
