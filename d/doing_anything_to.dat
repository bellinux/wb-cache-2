25|$|Tension {{between the}} forest {{tradition}} and the Thammayut administrative hierarchy escalated in 1926, when Tisso Uan attempted to drive a senior Forest Tradition monk named Ajaan Sing — along with his following of 50 monks and 100 nuns and laypeople — out of Ubon, which was under Tisso Uan's jurisdiction. Ajaan Sing refused, saying he {{and many of his}} supporters were born there, and they weren't <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> harm anyone. After arguing with district officials the directive was eventually dropped.|$|E

25|$|A report {{published}} in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated {{that in the}} period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades.

As a result, he writes, readers are brought to understand the lust for money as a [...] "human illness" [...] which must be overcome: they should follow the example of Tan Kioe Gie, not Tan Kioe Lie. John Kwee of the University of Auckland, citing Gie's departure from Kamadjoean, suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press, then becoming increasingly commercial.|$|E

500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can I do for you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E

2500|$|During the war the Brazilian navy {{had been}} criticised for its inertia.

[...] Those same vessels had been defied by two Paraguayan chatas (flat-bottomed, towable barges mounting a single gun). [...] Although the Brazilian naval command protested that the shallow river waters enjoined caution, the Brazilian soldiery and the Emperor Pedro II were disgusted.

2500|$|It {{was said}} that {{throughout}} the time that Yuan served as chancellor with Zhang Jiazhen and Zhang Shuo, he largely acted carefully and simply deferred to them on important matters—and he was much criticized when, at Zhang Jiazhen's suggestion, Jiang was exiled in 722, and he failed to try to intercede on Jiang's behalf, despite Jiang's having recommended him years before. [...] By 729, when he was serving with Li Yuanhong and Du Xian, Li and Du often disagreed with each other, and Yuan was not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> moderate them. [...] This drew Emperor Xuanzong's displeasure with all three and, in summer 729, he removed all three from chancellor posts, replacing them with Yuwen Rong and Pei Guangting, while retaining fellow chancellor Xiao Song. [...] Yuan kept his position as Zuo Chengxiang and continued to serve in that office briefly. [...] In fall 729, he was made an advisor to Li Hong the Crown Prince, with the title Taizi Shaoshi (太子少師) -- but declined {{on the basis that}} his grandfather Yuan Shimin had the character [...] "Shi" [...] in his name, and therefore he could not accept the office due to naming taboo. [...] In response, Emperor Xuanzong renamed the office Taizi Shaofu (太子少傅) to allow Yuan to be able to serve. [...] The day that Yuan was to take office, Song and Zhang Shuo were to take new offices as well, Emperor Xuanzong set up a grand ceremony for their inauguration, including an elaborate tent, music, and food from the imperial kitchen. [...] Emperor Xuanzong personally wrote a poem commemorating the contributions of the three. [...] He also created Yuan the Duke of Anyang.|$|E

[...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so. After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope you know what is good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said.
