On January 2, 1858, the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission.

Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On September 17, 1864, he was certified as an applied mechanics professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of Carter County the only schools in the area were private subscription schools. These schools were generally held in a home or an abandoned log cabin. Teachers were paid by charging a monthly tuition, generally <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> which they were responsible for collecting. The average salary for these teachers was about ten dollars month. The curriculum was very basic as generally the teachers themselves had {{little in the way of}} education.|$|R
5|$|The Liberals made no new, radical {{proposals}} {{during their}} campaign, but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional {{attacks on the}} opposition parties. They were convinced that the public still supported their party, and that no expensive promises need be made to voters. St. Laurent was made {{the image of the}} nation's prosperity, and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed. When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> St. Laurent refused to consider it, feeling that the increase had been calculated {{on the basis of the}} available facts, and those facts had not changed.|$|E
5|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} summer camp at Fort Clinton, MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at Fort Dix; they then marched back to West Point with full packs. He attempted to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, {{the study of the}} campaigns of the American Civil War was replaced with the study of those of World War I. In History class, more emphasis was placed on the Far East. MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate. He allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation, and sanctioned a cadet newspaper, The Brag, forerunner of today's West Pointer. He also permitted cadets to travel to watch their football team play, and gave them an allowance of $5 ($ in modern <b>dollars)</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves. Most of MacArthur's West Point reforms were soon discarded but, in the ensuing years, his ideas became accepted and his innovations were gradually restored.|$|E

These were both subscription schools, a common practice in which each child paid the teacher <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> School terms were only six months long, but sometimes semesters were extended if enough students enrolled. A Baptist church was also constructed on the outskirts of town, but few records remain.|$|R

He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings. He soon managed to sell some of them to Judge magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis-based Calgary Eye-Opener, a racy men's cartoon magazine of the era. He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines. His salary of 90 <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> was considered respectable enough for the time.

Recognizing the opportunity, Baltimore resident Otway B. Zantzinger acquired 400 hilly acres just beyond the eastern corner of the District of Columbia. He divided the tract into 4,000 lots and began to sell them at prices ranging from $20 to $150 each. He advertised a picturesque view of Washington, D.C., a proposed electric railway, drinking water from crystal-clear springs, nothing down and <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> no interest, no landlords, and, in the custom and vernacular of the times, [...] "no colored people."

25|$|Because of {{the money}} she gave up, her family stayed poor because her salary was only 207 RMB, which was equal to 20 <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> And her {{research}} and work place was very poor. However, she never gave up. After coming back to China, she began working as soon as possible. In 1957, her workplace-Institute of Semiconductor CAS—finished making the first mono-crystalline germanium in China. By virtue of the working experience in Sylvania Company, she knew all the processes in making the mono-crystalline silicon. However she could not get any equipment because of embargoes from other countries. So she changed the process and made the first mono-crystalline silicon in China in 1958. China became the third country to make mono-crystalline silicon by itself. In 1962, she designed the mono-crystal furnace. This furnace had been merchandized to many countries. In the same year, she made the first mono-crystalline gallium arsenide in China. Lanying Lin’s gallium arsenide reached the highest mobility {{at that time in}} the whole world.|$|E

Prior to the expedition, leaving their base camp in Pittsburgh, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were away from the main party, securing last minute supplies and making other preparations, leaving Sergeant John Ordway in charge. A group of recruits including Colter disobeyed orders from Ordway. Upon hearing of this infraction Lewis confined Colter and the others to ten days in the base camp. Soon thereafter, Colter was court-martialed after threatening to shoot Ordway. After a review of the situation, Colter was reinstated after he offered an apology and promised to reform.|$|E

He attended Pearl's Hill Primary School and Outram Road School, at various stages walking [...] to school, sleeping along a five foot way, bathing at a roadside pump and studying at night under a street lamp. He completed his secondary education and took the Senior Cambridge examination at Raffles Institution in the top class in 1929. There, he was a classmate of David Marshall, the first Chief Minister of Singapore; they became good friends. Initially unemployed between 1930 and 1934 due to the Great Depression, he subsequently worked for three years as a clerk in the law firm of Mallal & Namazie for a monthly salary of 20 Straits dollars. Thereafter, he joined the Government Clerical Services for 60 Straits <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> and was posted to the Official Assignee's office, which was in charge of administering the estates of bankrupt persons.|$|E

500|$|The Pony Express had an {{estimated}} 80 riders who were traveling {{east or west}} along various points of the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied for jobs with the Pony Express, ready to face the dangers and the challenges that sometimes lay along the delivery route. Waddell and Majors could have easily hired them at a much lesser rate, but instead paid them a handsome sum for that time of one hundred <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Famous American author Mark Twain, who saw the Pony Express in action first hand, described the riders in his travel memoir Roughing It as: [...] "...usually {{a little bit of}} a man". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, their untarnished record proved them to be heroes of the American West for the much needed and dangerous service they provided for the nation. Establishing a complete list of riders is virtually impossible. There was no official list of riders kept by the express company and the scarcity of newspapers along the route contributed to the absence of this information. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the Pony Express was forgotten about almost entirely, and consequently there was not much interest in pursuing and searching out this information for many years following, by which time much of it had simply vanished in the course of everyday affairs. A partial list of riders has been compiled in Raymond and Nancy Settle's 1972 book Saddles & Spurs.|$|E
