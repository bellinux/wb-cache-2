This form of inhibition is termed [...] "shunting" [...] because of the synaptic conductance short-circuit currents that are generated at adjacent excitatory synapses. If a shunting <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapse</b> is activated, the input resistance is reduced locally and, following Ohm's law, the amplitude of subsequent excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is reduced.

50|$|There {{are three}} layers to the {{cerebellar}} cortex; from outer to inner layer, {{these are the}} molecular, Purkinje, and granular layers. The function of the cerebellar cortex is essentially to modulate information flowing through the deep nuclei. The microcircuitry of the cerebellum is schematized in Figure 5. Mossy and climbing fibers carry sensorimotor information into the deep nuclei, which in turn {{pass it on to}} various premotor areas, thus regulating the gain and timing of motor actions. Mossy and climbing fibers also feed this information into the cerebellar cortex, which performs various computations, resulting in the regulation of Purkinje cell firing. Purkinje neurons feed back into the deep nuclei via a potent <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapse.</b> This synapse regulates the extent to which mossy and climbing fibers activate the deep nuclei, and thus control the ultimate effect of the cerebellum on motor function. The synaptic strength of almost every synapse in the cerebellar cortex has been shown to undergo synaptic plasticity.

We used a genetic approach in mice to identify the Ig superfamily member IgSF 9 /Dasm 1 as a candidate homophilic synaptic adhesion protein that regulates <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapse</b> development. IgSF 9 is expressed in pyramidal cells and subsets of interneurons in the CA 1 region of hippocampus. Electrophysiological recordings of acute hippocampal slices revealed that genetic inactivation of the IgSF 9 gene resulted in fewer functional inhibitory synapses; however, the strength of the remaining synapses was unaltered. These physiological abnormalities were correlated with decreased expression of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapse</b> markers in IgSF 9 (-/-) mice, providing anatomical evidence for a reduction in <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapse</b> numbers, whereas excitatory synapse development was normal. Surprisingly, knock-in mice expressing a mutant isoform of IgSF 9 lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain (IgSF 9 (Delta C/Delta C) mice) had no defects in <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapse</b> development, providing genetic evidence that IgSF 9 regulates synapse development via ectodomain interactions rather than acting itself as a signaling receptor. Further, we found that IgSF 9 mediated homotypic binding and cell aggregation, but failed to induce synapse formation, suggesting that IgSF 9 acts as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) to maintain synapses.

It also provides homeostasis against the oscillating theta input, making the frequency of the network less variable over a theta cycle. However, this homeostatic effect works only when the sinusoidal forcing is of theta or slower frequencies. Additionally, when responding to pulsatile gamma inputs too fast to follow cycle by cycle, the system with the M-current exhibits sparse entrainment. By contrast, the system without the M-current (but with the same natural frequency) reacts to faster gamma inputs by phase walk-through.|$|E

Although STP is much studied, {{its role in the}} processing of complex natural spike patterns is unknown. Here we analyze the responses of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> hippocampal <b>synapses</b> to natural spike trains at near-physiological temperatures. Our results show that excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapses</b> express complementary sets of STP components that selectively change synaptic strength during epochs of high-frequency discharge associated with hippocampal place fields. In both types of synapses, synaptic strength rapidly alternates between a near-constant level during low activity and another near-constant, but elevated (for excitatory synapses) or reduced (for <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapses)</b> level during high-frequency epochs. These history-dependent changes in synaptic strength are largely independent of the particular temporal pattern within the discharges, and occur concomitantly in the two types of synapses. When excitatory and feed-forward <b>inhibitory</b> <b>synapses</b> are co-activated within the hippocampal feed-forward circuit unit, the net effect of their complementary STP is an additional increase in the gain of excitatory synapses during high-frequency discharges via selective disinhibition.

Furthermore, α-neurexins (α-Nrxs) are components of a CST- 3 complex involved in CST- 3 -mediated presynaptic differentiation. However, CST- 3 does not directly bind to Nrxs.

IPSCs remained normal until P 22, when a second, sustained phase of weakening began. Delaying deprivation onset by 5 days prevented the P 15 weakening.
