One of the less-explored questions of {{international criminal law}} is its social effects, within the international community and the community <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law,</b> in other parts and activities of international law. In particular, what are the effects of the rise of international criminal law and its emerging system of tribunals on the rest of the laws of armed conflict? What are the effects upon apparently unrelated aspects of humanitarian and human rights law? What are the effects upon other large systems and <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law,</b> such as the UN and other international organizations? As international criminal law has emerged as a visible face <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law,</b> has it supplanted or even ‘crowded’ other aspects and <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law?</b> This brief article offers a high-altitude, high-speed look at the effects of international criminal law on other parts <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law</b> and organizations...|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, most <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> Roman <b>public</b> <b>law</b> fell into disuse, but much of Roman {{political}} theory remained. In a letter, Duo Sunt, Pope Gelasius I argued that Christendom was ruled, in theory, by the priests and princes. The former had the spiritual authority, which was identified with auctoritas, while the latter had temporal power, identified with potestas.At first, the Pope crowned secular rulers after Pope Stephen II crowned the Frankish king Pepin the Short in January 754, and secular rulers often appointed local bishops and abbots, but after the Investiture Controversy the Pope was instead chosen by the College of Cardinals and, at least in theory, approved episcopal nominations.|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} legal community posits universality {{as a central}} characteristic of modern international law. But {{there has been little}} work to assess the degree to which {{international legal}} norms are widely shared and incorporated into the foreign policy-making of states. Previous work in this area has attempted to describe the distribution of legal values across cultures. This work has proven contradictory and inconclusive. The epistemic communities literature suggests looking at the distribution of practitioners as an alternative approach for assessing the diffusion of norms and practices. In fact, the community of litigators who practice before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) comes from a very small set of Western states. While Western states utilize their own staff lawyers when appearing before the ICJ, non-Western states hire Western lawyers. International lawyers often identify the ICJ as the premier <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law.</b> The failure of non-Western states to produce their own lawyers for use at the ICJ raises significant questions about their resources and motivation to incorporate international law into their foreign policy-making.

The Division of {{infrastructure}} projects of Banco Popular has among its main functions {{to manage the}} institutional infrastructure projects, manage and administer the institutional maintenance of buildings and lease expiration control contracts for leased premises; directing the efforts of these areas to objectives of the Directorate of Administrative Support and Corporate Strategic Plan. This research proposes a professional project management methodology for the division {{of infrastructure}} and projects of the bank, specifically directed {{to the area of}} institutional infrastructure projects. To develop the reference framework proposed in project management it is required to make a diagnose of the current situation that Division faces up regarding to maturity in project management, tools, processes, procedures, and skills, to determine the level of project management maturity in the Division. Additionally, it will determine the critical success factors {{to be taken into account}} for the development of projects at the DIP. Once completed, the analysis of the level of maturity it will be demonstrated that it does not have a standard methodology for managing institutional infrastructure projects, and lacks of metrics, policies, processes and tools to evaluate the performance of projects, which is adversely affecting the performance of projects. The development of the proposed methodology is based on the PMBOK® (Guide to the Project Management the PMI®) and given that the Bank is an <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> nonstate <b>public</b> <b>law</b> governing, it operates under the rules <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>law,</b> these are considered the factors of greatest impact on public sector projects in regards of the government's extension to the PMBOK® Guide. Finally, it concluded that due to the lack of a project management methodology the maturity level of the Division is impacted, making a standard in the activities and tools to make managing projects successful. And it is recommended to implement the proposed methodology in a period not exceeding one year, considering a balanced matrix structure in the Division, such that, allow to keep the management in institutional maintenance and management of institutional projects. Key words: Institutional infrastructure projects, PMI®, PMBok®, maturity in project management, project management, critical success factors, methodology and public institution.

40|$|In {{spite of}} recent {{literature}} that examines {{late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century transnational movements in innovative ways, the largest transnational movement of that period, the women 2 ̆ 7 s movement, remains lodged in academic and popular memory as the 2 ̆ 2 suffrage movement, 2 ̆ 2 a single-issue campaign waged by privileged Victorian women, a foregone development in the march of electoral progress that ended in victory with postwar enfranchisement. A fresh approach to the suffrage archive reveals instead a far more radical movement than conventional history suggests, one that explicitly linked its cause with both the revolutionary democratic tradition and with anti-colonial activism. Like the non-Western nationalists with whom they were often allied, suffragists employed an unavoidably paradoxical discourse as they alternately embraced and rejected the political order that excluded them. To a greater extent than the other radical movements of the period, the suffrage activists developed creative and provocative tactics that forced the state to use violence against them, thus revealing the violence underlying the facade of liberal consent and further tying their cause to that of the 2 ̆ 2 subject races. 2 ̆ 2 At the same time, suffragists were devoting enormous energy and resources to the first <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> international <b>law</b> and imagining an alternative concept of global citizenship that would empower them as well as their anti-colonial allies. The same themes of radical economic and political decentralization, social equality and human rights that mark women 2 ̆ 7 s political tradition on the national level were re-articulated for a new global order in the pre-war years. From the perspective of this radical tradition, the postwar bestowal of a limited franchise as a reward for cooperation in war-making was no victory, and a postwar international legal regime that re-inscribed the liberal priorities and exclusions of the nation-state was not a story of progress.

40|$|It has {{not been}} written much about duress on the {{national}} level, which, in our legal system is the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> private and <b>public</b> <b>law,</b> {{as defined by the}} Law of Obligations and the Criminal Code of the Republic of Serbia. The subject of this paper is an attempt to highlight and analyze one of the controversial legal institutions normatively, relying on a philological analysis of texts, historical legal, comparative and socio-political. In addition, the basic intention of the author is twofold. First, the tendency is to present in detail the origin and development <b>of</b> this legal <b>institution</b> in the Roman law, with the necessary emphasis on the socio-political circumstances that led to it. In the following analysis, the author tackles the issue of consensus, as a fundamental element for the development of contracts and relationships between inside and declared will, criticizing the dominant position in the Roman studies that in classical Roman law prevailed the principle coactus voluit tamen voluit. At the same time, special attention is paid to the conditions under which the injured party may use protection instruments. In this context, he insists on objectified role of fear {{as one of the most}} important conditions for the existence of duress and offers arguments supporting the thesis that the Roman law already established the principle of a reasonable fear that the modern law consistently adopted. The author tries to point out the relationship of mechanisms of protection against duress in the Roman law, noting the argument that the restitution and statement of claim did not function separately, but that the statement of claim had restitution role. Second, in the normative analysis of the legal duress institution in contemporary domestic law, the author tries to draw a line between the solution of the Roman jurisprudence and national legislators, pointing out the numerous and visible examples of this reception. At the same time the dual character is highlighted of duress, in the Roman law as shortcomings of will and private praetorian tort, and in domestic as <b>public</b> <b>law</b> and private law institution. It is in essence another contribution to the author's tendency to observe the Roman law as alive, dynamic and current system that in the modern efforts of harmonization of the EU legal system may be used worthily...|$|R

However in recent years a common theme running through the discussions <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>law</b> is one <b>of</b> loss. What function and future can <b>public</b> <b>law</b> have in this rapidly transforming landscape, where globalized states and supranational institutions have ever-increasing importance? The contributions to this volume take stock of the idea, concepts, and values <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>law</b> as it has developed alongside {{the growth of the}} modern state, and assess its continued usefulness as a distinct area of legal inquiry and normativity in light of various historical trends and contemporary pressures affecting the global configuration of law in general.

The second part focuses on the domains, values, and functions <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>law</b> in contemporary (state) legal practice, as seen, in part, through its relationship with private domains, values, and functions.
