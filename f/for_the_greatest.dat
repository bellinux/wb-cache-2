5|$|Although he {{left the}} {{direction}} of the battle to subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field again.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy {{rainfall}} and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including {{an accumulation of}} more than 7.8in (200mm) which set the record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451buildings were flooded, some up {{to a depth of}} 8ft (2.4m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought down trees and power lines.|$|E

5|$|Brian Langford {{holds the}} record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number of {{first-class}} appearances for Somerset. Between 1953 and 1974 the right-arm off break bowler played 504 {{times for the}} club. Only three other players have made more than 400 appearances for Somerset, and no-one has reached the milestone since Langford. Jack White, one of the three, is the club's leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket, claiming 2,165 dismissals for the county between 1909 and 1937. Harold Gimblett's tally of 21,142 first-class runs is the most by a Somerset cricketer, over 2,000 more than the next, Marcus Trescothick.|$|E

5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E

The {{challenge}} was completed by M Beaumont on 26July 1911, in about 22½ hours.

5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E
5|$|Ratatouille was {{nominated}} for five Oscars including Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Film, which it lost to Atonement, The Bourne Ultimatum (for both Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing) and Juno, respectively, winning only the last one. At the time, the film held the record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number of Oscar nominations for a computer animated feature film, breaking the previous record held by Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles at four nominations, but tied with Aladdin for any animated film. In 2008, WALL-E surpassed that record with 6 nominations. As of 2013, Ratatouille is tied with Up and Toy Story 3 for animated film with the second greatest number of Oscar nominations. Beauty and the Beast still holds the record for most Oscar nominations (also 6) for an animated feature film.|$|E

5|$|Selwood and Geelong {{began the}} 2013 AFL season on a seven-game winning streak before {{finishing}} with an improved 18-4 win-loss record to qualify in second {{position for the}} finals series. During the season, Selwood made his 150th appearance for the club and set a club record for the fastest 150 games played from debut (six years and one hundred and four days). In doing so, Selwood surpassed the previous record set by Jack Hawkins (seven years and four days). He also became the third youngest player (25 years, 48 days) in club history to reach 150 games, behind only Ken Newland (24 years, 85 days) and Gary Ablett, Jr. (24 years, 339 days). He also set a VFL/AFL record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> winning percentage amongst 150 game players, having won 124 of his first 150 games (83% winning percentage) since debuting in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the Coronation {{class was}} {{represented}} at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed {{to compare the}} performances of similar locomotives from {{all four of the}} pre-nationalised companies, the representative engine performed disastrously. Gone was any hint of the power that could be unleashed by these engines; instead, uncharacteristically low coal consumption was the target. If the trials were forgettable, other achievements of the class are certainly memorable. Firstly, No. 6220 Coronation held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1939. Secondly, No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn holds the record to this day <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> British power output to be officially recorded on an attached dynamometer car, achieved in 1939. Unfortunately the most memorable event {{in the history of the}} class was the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 City of Glasgow. This was the second worst rail crash in British history, the death toll being 112.|$|E
