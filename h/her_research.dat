5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing <b>her</b> <b>research,</b> Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing <b>her</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E

5|$|As <b>her</b> <b>research</b> progressed, Carson found {{a sizable}} {{community}} of scientists who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main {{responsibilities}} were {{to analyze}} and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using <b>her</b> <b>research</b> and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote {{a steady stream of}} articles for The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{when she}} was {{finishing}} writing up her thesis, she was the youngest and last of Mulliken's pre-war students, and was working alone because all her fellow students had become involved with war work. She met Herbert Anderson, who was working for Enrico Fermi. The two would go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from <b>her</b> <b>research,</b> {{and as soon as}} her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock {{discovered}} transposition {{and used}} it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of <b>her</b> <b>research</b> and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1963, Ginsburg was a {{research}} associate and then {{associate director of the}} Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learning Swedish to co-author a book with Anders Bruzelius on civil procedure in Sweden. Ginsburg conducted extensive research for her book at Lund University in Sweden. Ginsburg's time in Sweden also influenced her thinking on gender equality. She was inspired observing the changes in Sweden where women were twenty to twenty-five percent of all law students, and one of the judges Ginsburg watched for <b>her</b> <b>research</b> was eight months pregnant and still working.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Evers-Emden {{published}} {{four books}} in Dutch based on <b>her</b> <b>research.</b> Geleende Kinderen (Borrowed Children) (1994) {{focused on the}} foster parents who hid the children.

5|$|Rubin's {{calculations}} {{showed that}} galaxies must contain {{at least five}} to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter. Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades, {{and became the first}} persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing. <b>Her</b> <b>research</b> also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of her career}} was spent at Cambridge's Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology, where she returned in 1929. Her work there was an extension of <b>her</b> <b>research</b> with Dobell, as she studied nuclear division in parasitic flagellates and amoebae of diverse species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. She isolated one type of protozoan, aerotolerant anaerobes, from the digestive tract of Haemopis sanguisuga during this period. Bishop also discovered a new species, Pseudotrichomonas keilini, which she named to acknowledge her colleague David Keilin, {{as well as the}} parasite's resemblance to the genus Trichomonas. <b>Her</b> <b>research</b> at Manchester with H.P. Baynon concerned the identification, isolation, and study of the turkey blackhead parasite (Histomonas meleagridis); this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver. Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate Histomonas and then prove its role in blackhead. Bishop's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her best-known work, a comprehensive study of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) and potential chemotherapies for the disease.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} as belonging to the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H. Breen helped <b>her</b> <b>research</b> the story.|$|E
5|$|After emigrating to the United States in 1941, she {{was granted}} a Carnegie Fellowship to {{continue}} <b>her</b> <b>research</b> and provided technical information on her polonium extraction methods to the Manhattan Project.
