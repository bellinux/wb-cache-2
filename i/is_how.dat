5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew <b>is</b> <b>how</b> street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling <b>is</b> <b>how</b> b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase [...] "how dry I am" [...] {{had become}} {{structured}} into song and referred specifically to drinking alcohol {{by at least}} 1898, as one journal describes a college drinking song that goes: <b>How</b> dry I <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry I <b>am!</b> God only knows How dry I am.A 1919 book entitled Out and about: A Note-book of London in War-time describes a group of Americans drinking in London and singing [...] "some excellent numbers of American marching-songs," [...] including one described as [...] "the anthem of the 'dry' States" [...] whose lyrics were:Nobody knows <b>how</b> dry I <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry I <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry I <b>am.</b> You don't know <b>how</b> dry I <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry I <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry I am.Nobody knows <b>how</b> dry I <b>am,</b> And nobody cares a damn.The 1921 musical comedy Up In The Clouds included a similar song entitled [...] "How Dry I Am" [...] with music by Tom A.

5|$|Alloa led {{the match}} 2–1 at half-time {{but only two}} minutes after the {{interval}} both teams scored to make it 3–2 by the 47th minute.

Martin Cameron scored his second goal for Alloa in the 104th minute to take a 4–3 lead but was cancelled out when Sheerin completed a hat-trick of goals for Inverness to make it 4–4 and take the game to penalties.

When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> Starfish still is today.|$|E

5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic <b>is</b> <b>how</b> they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, and this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E

The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The display information for each Case <b>is</b> <b>how</b> it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years.

5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question <b>is</b> <b>how</b> an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question <b>is</b> <b>how</b> closely related the parent species are.|$|E

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, <b>is</b> <b>how</b> it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
