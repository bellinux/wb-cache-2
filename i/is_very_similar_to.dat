5|$|A. n. punicus, {{described}} by Erlanger in 1897, is resident in north-west Africa, {{north of the}} Sahara. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> nisus, being large and pale.|$|E

5|$|A. n. nisosimilis was {{described}} by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China. This subspecies is wholly migratory, wintering from Pakistan and India eastwards through South-East Asia and southern China to Korea and Japan; some even reach Africa. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to,</b> but slightly larger than, the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> other domestic herd animals. A {{flock of sheep}} is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Boletus reticulatus <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> B.aereus, also {{occurring}} {{during the}} summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a more elaborate and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.|$|E

5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, {{and the two}} {{can only}} be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|Stela 74 is a {{fragment}} of Olmec-style sculpture that {{was found in the}} Middle Preclassic fill of Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a cartouche and has other, smaller, U-symbols at its base. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.|$|E

Photos and video footage of the finalists at the Great Ormond Street Hospital are shown throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|E
5|$|Jagaddhatri Puja {{is celebrated}} {{on the last}} four days of the Navaratis, {{following}} Kali Puja. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Durga Puja in its details and observance, and is especially popular in Bengal and some other parts of Eastern India. Gauri Puja is performed {{on the fifth day}} after Ganesh Chaturthi, during Ganesha Puja in Western India, to celebrate the arrival of Gauri, Mother of Ganesha where she brings her son back home.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus {{has several}} {{features}} of the head in common with basal theropods such as other ceratosaurs and coelophysoids, but it also convergently shares a number of traits, including the beak and the fused sternum, with the later coelurosaurs. The overall aspect of the animal, including the long neck and legs, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of the Cretaceous ornithomimid theropods, {{as well as the}} Triassic non-dinosaurian archosaur Effigia, representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E
5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E
