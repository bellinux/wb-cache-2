2500|$|Strangely, Luther {{does not}} seem to have known much about his older brother, Daniel Isaac Gotwald. He was a printer who died in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1849 when he was 21. Luther says of him that [...] "He was, I think, noble and upright in all his deportment, respectful and happy in his disposition, and a genial {{favorite}} among all who knew him. [...] At the time of his death, several of the Cincinnati papers spoke very favorably of him." [...] Luther admits that he does not even know whether Daniel Isaac was a Christian, but continued that [...] "Fervently do <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was, for it is a dreadful thought that any of those we love, and especially one so dear as a Brother, should be called unprepared, from time into eternity, there to suffer forever for the misdeeds of this life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How delighted I {{shall be}} {{to see my}} old friend the Tin Woodman again! <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> rules his people more {{successfully}} than I have ruled mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I am sure <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not. But, father, {{the horses}} are our own; {{it was his}} that died, you remember. We can ride away on them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} be {{separated}} any longer, dear heart," [...] I heard Uncle Blair say tenderly. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> meant he would stay in Canada--not <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would take the Story Girl away.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned a}} shade paler, {{but he did}} not {{sacrifice}} his dignity, as <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would, by answering me with anger. He did not even answer me at all. He looked over my head at my lover.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> is what <b>he</b> said, and <b>I</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was right, {{since at}} present there is {{something}} very wrong with the world, especially in Africa.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, Kilmeny. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can, and I know {{he will do}} {{all that}} mortal skill can do. If he can remove your defect will you promise to marry me, dearest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; he {{came down}} simply in {{gratitude}} for a service I rendered him. I {{do not know whether}} he intends to go back; but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will remain here, with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so, too, my boy," [...] I answered, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> will {{continue}} to do so, for I tell you we are in a worse place than ever you were among the Fung." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{interrupted}} brightening, [...] "thank you for mentioning him, <b>that</b> reminds me. <b>He</b> wished this, so <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is gone {{you will take}} the same view." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS P.--No, mamma, I {{think it}} will be too large a party,--Mr. Milliken has often said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would like to go abroad, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> now <b>he</b> {{will be able to make}} his tour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, of course," [...] gasped Foy, kicking {{his legs}} {{into the air}} with delight, [...] "why, they call the old fellow 'Singe jaloux.' Oh! it's capital, and <b>I</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> opens the lady's letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sergeant! I am {{sure you}} will all like him, {{when you come to}} know him; for he is a well-spoken young fellow, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will make as good a soldier. Good night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Drummond will, for the present, {{serve with}} the marshal {{as one of}} his aides-de-camp; but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will soon join the {{regiment}} where, at any rate, he will at all times find a warm welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hope that}} it will be a {{permanent}} one. I, you know, am his confidant, and entrusted with all his plans. If I succeed in arranging something according to his wishes, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not again quit us.' ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{not quite}} what I had intended. <b>I</b> had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have {{observed}} the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should have}} been glad to thank him,' {{returned}} Lizzie. 'He {{has done a great}} deal for me. <b>I</b> must <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will let me thank him some day. You asked me has it anything to do--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He'd swear at {{me if he}} weren't. I can't make it out. He has the go-fever {{upon him}} and he won't go. <b>I</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> mayn't have to go some day when he doesn't want to,' said Torpenhow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{he is most}} welcome," [...] said Nigel, [...] "and yet <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is one who can relish a soldier's fare {{and sleep}} under a humble roof, for indeed we can but give our best, poor as it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘The {{marriage}} of a King {{is a matter}} of State,’ says Dan, in a white-hot rage, for he could feel, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going against his better mind. He walked out of the Council-room, and the others sat still, looking at the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has not {{she been}} good? I don't {{understand}} about the cottage. It belongs to some friend of hers; and I {{have not been}} able to say a word about the rent. It is so nice;--and looks upon the river. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> doesn't. <b>I</b> do <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not. <b>I</b> cannot {{understand}} what pleasure {{it is that}} men take in making chimneys of themselves, and going about smelling {{so that no one}} can bear to come near them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right-o! But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> devoutly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn't {{catch me}} at it. I've {{a sort of}} idea that if the old dad {{discovered}} that I was making allowances for him, he would have from ten to fifteen fits." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{have finally}} broken with Schikaneder, whose kingdom has been entirely eclipsed {{by the light}} of the clever and {{thoughtful}} French operas. Meanwhile he has held me back for fully six months, and I have let myself be deceived simply because, since he is undeniably good at creating stage effects, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would produce something more clever than usual. How wrong <b>I</b> was. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> at least <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have the verses and the contents of the libretto corrected and improved by someone else, but in vain. For it was impossible to persuade this arrogant fellow to do this. Well, I have given up my arrangement with him, although I had composed several numbers. Just picture to yourself a Roman subject (of which I had been told neither the scheme nor anything else whatever) and language and verses such as could come out of the mouths of our Viennese women apple-vendors.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be better not to disturb him," [...] I answered, [...] "he may be tired. He will get up of his own accord very soon. And indeed <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not get up until I go to the store and get him a new chain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{it is you}} {{who have}} saved me," [...] she murmured. [...] "Ah, Mr. John," [...] she added, as she walked {{with him to the}} door, [...] "if ever there comes to me a lover, not for the days only but pour la vie, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may be an Englishman like you, whom all the world trusts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is right," [...] Cuthbert replied, {{but with}} the {{indifference}} common to men in extreme weakness. [...] "I should certainly like to give the finishing touches to those two pictures. There is nothing else to show for my life. Yes, I should like to finish them. You are looking bad yourself," [...] he added, suddenly, [...] "all {{this is too much}} for you." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{said nothing}} more to John, {{but in the next}} few days I got all my {{arrangements}} made and my things packed. And when the last afternoon came I sat down and wrote John a long letter, to leave on my boudoir table, telling him that I had gone to Bermuda. I told him that I wanted to be alone: I said that I couldn't tell when I would be back--that it might be months, or it might be years, and <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would try to be as happy as he could and forget me entirely, and to send me money on the first of every month.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{sincerely}} <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would be}} closely pushed, {{and in fact}} so closely pushed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have no booty to bring. But if he did succeed in his nefarious plans, I was glad that I would {{know where to look}} for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'd swear at {{me if he}} weren't. I can't make it out. He has the go-fever {{upon him}} and he won't go. <b>I</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> mayn't have to go some day when he doesn't want to," [...] said Torpenhow. * * * * * * ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baron von Konigstein is {{very much}} changed since last he had the {{pleasure}} of conversing with Lady Madeleine Trevor; more changed than she will perhaps believe; more changed than he can sometimes himself believe. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not be less acceptable to Lady Madeleine Trevor because he is no longer rash, passionate, and unthinking; because he has learnt to live more for others and less for himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I saw {{him off to}} England {{four days}} ago. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{will be able to}} rejoin before long, but it is not certain yet that the wound won't bring on {{permanent}} lameness. I am very anxious about it, especially as he has now got his step, and it would be awfully hard on him to leave the service just as he has got field-officer's rank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Inkosi-kaas," [...] said Maduna, [...] "you have persuaded me. I {{give you}} the life of that white fox, your husband, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not trick you as he has tricked us, and set you to hoe rock instead of soil," [...] {{and he looked at}} Robert wrathfully. [...] "I give him to you and all his belongings. Now, is there {{anything}} else that you would ask?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know as to that," [...] said Ben Bolter; [...] "but there's {{no doubt}} that Admiral Nelson is the man to lick the French, and <b>I</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may find their fleet, and that I may be there to lend a hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may {{be found}} out," [...] replied Mr. Mainwaring with equal enthusiasm, [...] "and then {{he will be in}} Rufford gaol before long. That's the justice I look for. Who do you think put down the poison in Dillsborough wood?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grayson {{just had}} a phone message from Cuivaca," [...] he explained. [...] "They only {{repaired}} the line yesterday since Pesita's men cut it last month. This was our first message. And do you know, Barbara, I can't help feeling sorry. <b>I</b> had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would get away." ...|$|R
