40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the energy-transfer {{dynamics}} in chromatophores of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodospirillum rubrum at 77 K, with <b>functional</b> charge <b>separation.</b> Using low-intensity picosecond absorption recovery, we determined that transfer between the energetically low-lying antenna component BChl 896 and the special pair of the reaction center occurs with a time constant of 37 ps in Rb. sphaeroides and 75 ps in R. rubrum. Assuming that a Förster energy-transfer mechanism applies to the process, this allows us to estimate the distance between BChl 896 in the B 875 complex and the special pair P 870 in the reaction center to range between 26 and 39 Å in Rb. sphaeroides. Such a distance indicates that the BChl 896 pigment and the special pair of the reaction center are at the minimum separation allowed by {{the size and shape}} of the reaction center and the light-harvesting polypeptides...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis is {{focused more on}} {{the difference between the}} dorsal and ventral subregions and takes into consideration their <b>functional</b> <b>separation.</b> In this model, the PCC is hypothesized to take a chief regulatory role in focusing internal and external attention. Mounting evidence that the posterior cingulate cortex is involved in both integrating memories of experiences and initiating a signal to change behavioral strategies supports this hypothesis. Under this model, the PCC plays a crucial role in controlling state of arousal, the breadth of focus, and the internal or external focus of attention. This hypothesis emphasizes the PCC as a dynamic network, rather than a fixed and unchanging structure.|$|E

This plan was highly influenced by the writings of Émile Zola, in particular his socialist utopian novel Travail (1901).

50|$|The black-box {{character}} of neural networks {{in general and}} extreme learning machines (ELM) in particular {{is one of the}} major concerns that repels engineers from application in unsafe automation tasks. This particular issue was approached by means of several different techniques. One approach is to reduce the dependence on the random input. Another approach focuses on the incorporation of continuous constraints into the learning process of ELMs which are derived from prior knowledge about the specific task. This is reasonable, because machine learning solutions have to guarantee a safe operation in many application domains. The mentioned studies revealed that the special form of ELMs, with its <b>functional</b> <b>separation</b> and the linear read-out weights, is particularly well suited for the efficient incorporation of continuous constraints in predefined regions of the input space.|$|E
5000|$|The {{physical}} and <b>functional</b> <b>separation</b> {{of the inner}} cell mass from the trophectoderm (TE) is a special feature of mammalian development and is the first cell lineage specification in these embryos. Following fertilization in the oviduct, the mammalian embryo undergoes a relatively slow round of cleavages to produce an eight cell morula. Each cell of the morula, called a blastomere, increases surface contact with its neighbors in a process called compaction. This results in a polarization of the cells within the morula, and further cleavage yields a blastocyst of roughly 32 cells. [...] In mice, about 12 internal cells comprise the new inner cell mass and 20 - 24 cells comprise the surrounding trophectoderm. There is variation between species of mammals as to number of cells at compaction with bovine embryos showing differences related to compaction as early as 9-15 cells and in rabbits not until after 32 cells. There is also interspecies variation in gene expression patterns in early embryos ...|$|E
50|$|In Kassite {{times the}} area was defined by a large wall that {{enclosed}} about 225 ha. The shape {{of the city is}} elongated and features several mounds, perhaps reflecting a <b>functional</b> <b>separation</b> of the parts of the site. The hill of Aqar Quf is dominated by the most visible monument at the site, a ziggurat devoted to the main god of the Babylonian pantheon, Enlil. Because of the uniformity of architectural features, the ziggurat and surrounding temple complexes appear to have been founded by the Kassite king, Kurigalzu. The ziggurat measured 69 x 67.6 m at its base. It was approached by three main staircases leading up to the first terrace, which has been reconstructed by the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities. The surrounding temple-complex has only been excavated on the south-west side of the ziggurat. The palace area of Tell al-Abyad consists of several stratigraphic architectural layers, which suggests several phases of building in this area over the entire stretch of the Kassite period, and therefore has great potential to yield an invaluable sequence of pottery and other material for the period. Associated tablets confirm that the structure was occupied throughout the Kassite period. The palace has innovative architectural features, being constructed in modules of three rooms around large courts. In addition, excavators also discovered a treasury on the east of the palace and a probable throne room or royal reception/ceremonial chamber.|$|E
