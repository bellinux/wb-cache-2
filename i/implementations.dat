However, {{there has been}} limited knowledge exchange between <b>implementation</b> science and policy <b>implementation</b> research, which has been conducted since the early 1970 s. Based on a narrative review of selective literature on <b>implementation</b> science and policy <b>implementation</b> research, {{the aim of this}} paper is to describe the characteristics of policy <b>implementation</b> research, analyze key similarities and differences between this field and <b>implementation</b> science, and discuss how knowledge assembled in policy <b>implementation</b> research could inform <b>implementation</b> science. Discussion: Following a brief overview of policy <b>implementation</b> research, several aspects of the two fields were described and compared: the purpose and origins of the research; the characteristics of the research; the development and use of theory; determinants of change (independent variables); and the impact of <b>implementation</b> (dependent variables). The comparative analysis showed that there are many similarities between the two fields, yet there are also profound differences. Still, important learning may be derived from several aspects of policy <b>implementation</b> research, including issues related to the influence of the context of <b>implementation</b> and the values and norms of the implementers (the healthcare practitioners) on <b>implementation</b> processes. Relevant research on various associated policy topics, including The Advocacy Coalition Framework, Governance Theory, and Institutional Theory, may also contribute to improved understanding of the difficulties of implementing evidence in healthcare. <b>Implementation</b> science is at a relatively early stage of development, and advancement of the field would benefit from accounting for knowledge beyond the parameters of the immediate <b>implementation</b> science literature. Summary: There are many common issues in policy <b>implementation</b> research and <b>implementation</b> science. Research in both fields deals with the challenges of translating intentions into desired changes.

The focus {{of the current study}} was to provide a detailed report of the resource use and costs associated with <b>implementation</b> of a short stay programme for breast cancer surgery in four Dutch hospitals. METHODS: The analysis was performed alongside a multi-centre <b>implementation</b> study. The process of identification, measurement and valuation of the <b>implementation</b> activities was based on recommendations for the design, analysis and reporting of health technology assessments. A scoring form was developed to prospectively determine the <b>implementation</b> activities at professional and <b>implementation</b> expert level. A time horizon of 5 years was used to calculate the <b>implementation</b> costs per patient. RESULTS: Identified activities were consisted of development and execution of the <b>implementation</b> strategy during the <b>implementation</b> project. Total <b>implementation</b> costs over the four hospitals were euro 83. 293. Mean <b>implementation</b> costs, calculated for 660 patients treated over a period of 5 years, were euro 25 per patient.

40|$|Abstract Background Climate has a {{long history}} in {{organizational}} studies, but few theoretical models integrate the complex effects of climate during innovation <b>implementation.</b> In 1996, a theoretical model was proposed that organizations could develop a positive climate for <b>implementation</b> by making use of various policies and practices that promote organizational members' means, motives, and opportunities for innovation use. The model proposes that <b>implementation</b> climate [...] or the extent to which organizational members perceive that innovation use is expected, supported, and rewarded [...] is positively associated with <b>implementation</b> effectiveness. The <b>implementation</b> climate construct holds significant promise for advancing scientific knowledge about the organizational determinants of innovation <b>implementation.</b> However, the construct has not received sufficient scholarly attention, despite numerous citations in the scientific literature. In this article, we clarify the meaning of <b>implementation</b> climate, discuss several measurement issues, and propose guidelines for empirical study. Discussion <b>Implementation</b> climate differs from constructs such as organizational climate, culture, or context in two important respects: first, it has a strategic focus (<b>implementation),</b> and second, it is innovation-specific. Measuring <b>implementation</b> climate is challenging because the construct operates at the organizational level, but requires the collection of multi-dimensional perceptual data from many expected innovation users within an organization. In order to avoid problems with construct validity, assessments of within-group agreement of <b>implementation</b> climate measures must be carefully considered. <b>Implementation</b> climate implies a high degree of within-group agreement in climate perceptions. However, researchers might find it useful to distinguish <b>implementation</b> climate level (the average of <b>implementation</b> climate perceptions) from <b>implementation</b> climate strength (the variability of <b>implementation</b> climate perceptions). It {{is important to recognize that}} the <b>implementation</b> climate construct applies most readily to innovations that require collective, coordinated behavior change by many organizational members both for successful <b>implementation</b> and for realization of anticipated benefits. For innovations that do not possess these attributes, individual-level theories of behavior change could be more useful in explaining <b>implementation</b> effectiveness. Summary This construct has considerable value in <b>implementation</b> science, however, further debate and development is necessary to refine and distinguish the construct for empirical use. </p...|$|R
