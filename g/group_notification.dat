40|$|Push {{notifications}} offer {{a promising}} strategy for enhancing engagement with smartphone-based health interventions. Intelligent sensor-driven machine learning models may improve the timeliness of notifications by adapting delivery to a user’s current context (e. g. location). This exploratory mixed-methods {{study examined the}} potential impact of timing and frequency on notification response and usage of Healthy Mind, a smartphone-based stress management intervention. 77 participants were randomised to use one of three versions of Healthy Mind that provided: intelligent notifications; daily notifications within pre-defined time frames; or occasional notifications within pre-defined time frames. Notification response and Healthy Mind usage were automatically recorded. Telephone interviews explored participants’ experiences of using Healthy Mind.

50|$|In Minnesota, a law {{requiring}} community notification on high-risk offenders was implemented in 1997. To {{examine the relationship}} between community notification and recidivism, the Minnesota Department of Corrections conducted a study comparing differences between three <b>groups.</b> A <b>notification</b> <b>group</b> consisted of 155 Level 3 ("high public risk") sex offenders. This group was subject to broad community notification after release from Minnesota prisons between 1997 and 2002. Two control groups were compared with this <b>notification</b> <b>group.</b> The first control group -prenotification- was built using a statistical matching technique and consisted of 125 offenders released between 1990-1997 who likely would have been assigned to Level 3, and would have been subject to community notification had the law been at place {{at the time of their}} release. A second control group -non-notification- consisted of offenders assigned to Level 1 and Level 2 who were released between 1997-2002 and not subject to broad community notification. The sexual re-conviction rates within a 3-year period for the notification, pre-notification and non-notification groups was found to be 3.2%, 32.8% and 9.6%, respectively. The authors concluded that these results suggest a community notification system based on tiered risk-management has an effect of reducing recidivism, although they noted that part of the effect might arise from heightened penalties and post-release supervision, improved treatment, or unmeasured historical factors unique to the 1990-1996 period. They further concluded that applying community notification to low-risk offenders would hinder their ability for successful community re-entry, and probably would not produce appreciable reduction in sexual recidivism given the low base rate (5-7% within 3 years) of recidivism in that sample.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether a sentinel surveillance project comprising motivated and guided occupational physicians would provide higherquality information than a national registry for a policy to prevent occupational diseases. Methods A group of 45 occupational physicians participated ill a sentinel surveillance project for two years. All other occupational physicians (N = 1, 729) in the national registry were the reference group. We compared the number of notifications per occupational physician, the proportion of incorrect notifications, and the overall reported incidence of occupational diseases. Results The median number of notifications per occupational physician during the project was 13. 0 (IQR, 4. 5 - 31. 5) in the sentinel group versus 1. 0 (IQR, 0. 0 - 5. 0) in the reference group (P < 0. 001). The proportion of incorrect notifications was 3. 3 % in the sentinel group and 8. 9 % in the reference group (P < 0. 001). The overall reported occupational disease incidence was 7 times higher (RR = 6. 9, 95 % CI: 6. 5 - 7. 4) in the sentinel <b>group</b> (466 <b>notifications</b> per 100, 000 employee years) than in the reference <b>group</b> (67 <b>notifications</b> per 100, 000 employee years).

In this paper, {{we present}} an SOA-based generic {{architecture}} for CSCW systems, directed towards overcoming {{the shortcomings of}} other architectural models when developing this type of system, as well as tackling {{the lack of a}} generic architecture in web service-based collaborative applications. Since it is based on SOA, the resulting application has the following characteristics: modularity, reusability, interoperability, scalability, flexibility, adaptability, robustness and efficiency. In addition, the services can be published or requested from any device (including mobile devices) independently of the language or platform used. The architecture supports the development of collaborative applications with <b>group</b> awareness, <b>notification,</b> consistency and security mechanisms. This allows us to change the group size, the roles played by the user and the interaction policies, and to add new services without the need to modify existing services.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>group</b> education and <b>notification</b> with that of notification alone in modifying prescribing of regulated analgesics. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from Dec. 1, 1992, to Dec. 31, 1993. SETTING: Nonacademic primary care practices in British Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four physicians randomly selected {{from a group of}} 100 physicians who had written a number of prescriptions for regulated drugs more than than two standard deviations above the mean number of prescriptions written for such drugs in 1992. Any physician who was unable to participate was replaced from the original group of 100 before the study began. Five subjects did not complete the study and {{were not included in the}} analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: those in the first group received a written notification of excessive prescribing and attended a 1 -day group-education activity, those in the second group received a written notification of excessive prescribing only and those in the third group were not subject to any intervention and were unaware that their prescribing had received special notice. OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean number of prescriptions for regulated analgesics issued per physician in the 6 months before and the 6 months after the interventions. RESULTS: Physicians in the group that attended the education intervention wrote, on average, 33 % fewer prescriptions after the intervention, whereas physicians in the group that received only written notification wrote 25 % fewer prescriptions, on average, after the intervention. No change in prescribing was shown in the control group. The differences in rates of prescribing of regulated analgesics between each intervention group and the control group were statistically significant (p < 0. 01). The difference in the rate of prescribing between the two intervention groups was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Group</b> education and <b>notification</b> of prescriber status as well as notification alone significantly reduced prescribing of regulated analgesics. Hence, feedback on a physician's prescribing pattern may be a practical and less costly alternative to direct educational intervention in moderating the prescribing of regulated analgesics. The results do not, however, imply that notification is as effective as education in improving overall patient care.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of pertussis in the Australian Capital Territory from 1999 to 2005, determine whether the apparent changes could be accounted for by greater recognition and testing, and explore the impact of false positive serology results associated with faulty test kits. The Australian Capital Territory resident notifica-tion, laboratory and separation data from 1999 to 2005 were examined and the proportions of positive tests across time periods and age <b>groups</b> compared. <b>Notification</b> rates increased in the years 2000, 2003 and 2005. There was a shift in the age distribution of cases, from children and teen-agers in 2000, to teenagers in 2003 and adults in 2005. Testing activity and notification activity were closely related. Comparing the epidemic periods to the preceding inter-epidemic periods, the propor-tion of positive tests was maintained or increased for all age groups combined and for adults and children (e. g. statistically significant increase from 7. 8 % to 14. 0 % in the 2005 epidemic in adults). During each epidemic the proportion of positive tests was statistically significantly higher in the age group with the highest notification activity. Despite similar testing rates in adults in 2003 and 2005, greater disease activity was reported in 2005. Although the numbers were small, polymerase chain reaction and culture positive test results increased in 2003 but not in 2005. The propor-tion of positive polymerase chain reaction results increased in 2003, providing strong evidence that the apparent epidemic of 2003 was due to a true {{increase in}} underlying disease activity.

Over 66 % of the chlamydia and gonorrhea cases in Palm Beach County are from clients aged 15 - 24 years. In order to limit transmission, it is imperative there is timely treatment. Methods. A coded text message was sent to the client for negative or positive lab results; this was done in English, Spanish or Haitian Creole. Patients with positive results would call to make an appointment for treatment. Results. During the period April 7, 2014 through April 7, 2015, 1, 881 individuals chose to be notified of their results using Private Reporting Option through coded TEXT messages (PROTEXT). Demographic profile of PROTEXT users who called back as protocol required were: median age of 25 years, spoke English and Black non-Hispanic (88 %).

40|$|Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{testing and}} {{counselling}} {{have the potential}} to impact individual behaviour and transmission dynamics at the population level. Evidence of the impact of an HCV-positive status notification on injection risk reduction is limited. The objective of our study was to (1) assess drug and alcohol use and injection risk behaviours following notification; (2) to compare behaviour change in people who inject drugs (PWID) who received a positive test result and those who remained negative; and (3) to assess the effect of age on risk behaviour. Methods Data from the International Collaboration of Incident HIV and HCV Infection in Injecting Cohorts (InC 3 Study) were analysed. Participants who were initially HCV seronegative were followed prospectively with periodic HCV blood testing and post-test disclosure and interview-administered questionnaires assessing drug use and injection behaviours. Multivariable generalised estimating equations were used to assess behavioural changes over time. Results Notification of an HCV-positive test was independently associated with a small increase in alcohol use relative to notification of a negative test. No significant differences in postnotification injection drug use, receptive sharing of ancillary injecting equipment and syringe borrowing postnotification were observed between diagnosis groups. Younger PWID receiving a positive HCV test notification demonstrated a significant increase in subsequent alcohol use compared with younger HCV negative. Conclusions The proportion of PWID reporting alcohol use increased among those receiving an HCV-positive notification, increased the frequency of alcohol use postnotification, while no reduction in injection drug use behaviours was observed between <b>notification</b> <b>groups.</b> These findings underscore the need to develop novel communication strategies during post-test notification to improve their impact on subsequent alcohol use and risk behaviour...|$|R

Both groups with users’ decisions on where to mark landmarks and, thus, where to allocate attention (AllocHum_LocHum, allocation of attention and self-localization by human; and AllocHum_LocSys, allocation of attention by human and self-localization by system) show 82 % success rates in finding the exact same route back. The two groups in which the system allocates users’ attention to landmarks show success rates of 63 % (AllocSys_LocSys, allocation of attention and self-localization by system) and 38 % (AllocSys_LocHum, allocation of attention by system and self-localization by human). The fact that so many participants did not find their way back correctly after just 10 [*]min of walking along a simple route may seem surprising. However, these results support the hypothesis of Chrastil and Warren (2012), Parush et al. (2007), and Willis et al. (2009) that activating a user with a location-dependent task (in our case, typing three self-selected keywords into a navigation system) increases spatial knowledge acquisition. In contrast, the two study <b>groups</b> with <b>notification</b> texts (AllocSys_LocHum and AllocSys_LocSys) who were using a navigation system {{with a high level of}} automation show lower success rates. This result seems to confirm findings by Pielot and Rello (2017) and Lee et al. (2014), who demonstrated that system notifications can interrupt an activity. In our case, textual notifications indicated by tactile alarms forced users to focus on their navigation system, rather than the environment, at locations defined by the system. Navigation decisions were taken away from navigators by the system, and thus may have interrupted the process of acquiring spatial knowledge. We further explain this result with the fact that the AllocSys groups were forced to switch to the survey perspective at the system’s discretion, while the AllocHum groups could maintain the first-person perspective until choosing themselves to make the switch to the survey perspective in order to make a place–action link (as described in Chrastil & Warren, 2012). This explanation aligns with the divided attention literature (Gardony et al., 2013) and the stated cognitive problem of “passive nature of interaction” (Willis et al., 2009). The effects of the two modes of the cognitive process “self-localization” are less pronounced in our study, which may at least in part be explained by the fact that they are similar in their level of automation (levels 8 and 10 in Fig.  1, respectively).|$|R
