5|$|The JNA was {{initially}} formed during World War II {{to carry out}} <b>guerrilla</b> <b>warfare</b> against occupying Axis forces. The success of the Partisan movement led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on <b>guerrilla</b> <b>warfare,</b> as its plans normally entailed defending against NATO or Warsaw Pact attacks, where other types of warfare would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a Territorial Defense system.|$|E

25|$|The Molotov {{cocktail}} is {{a generic}} name {{used for a}} variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in urban <b>guerrilla</b> <b>warfares.</b> They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline/petrol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than gasoline.|$|R

5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam.

Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek to win the war outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E

Confederate General Sterling Price failed to gain control of Missouri in his 1861 offensive and retreated into Arkansas, leaving only the guerrillas to challenge Union dominance. Quantrill was at the time the most prominent guerrilla in the Kansas–Missouri area. In early 1863, William and Jim Anderson traveled to Jackson County, Missouri, to join him.

A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law into their own hands. Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of <b>guerrilla</b> <b>warfare</b> persisted.|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} few years, the {{importance}} {{of the role of the}} state in formulating and implementing economic policies to achieve growth and development of society, broadly speaking, both state and society have undergone a lot of changes and transformations. In Mexico, the so called neoliberal model of state has been impossed over a former protectionist, statist and populist regimes and had achieved some impressive results in terms of economic growth and development, although this rate "falls well below the 3. 4 percent GDP growth" that the World Bank considers neccesary to reduce poverty. Regarding this last issue, the largest increase has resulted of implementing the structural adjustment policies and the new social policies (Programa Nacional de Solidaridad). The results are dissapointing with the increasing of unmeployment rate, the slumping of incomes, the widening of the gap betwen the rich and the poor and thus, fissures in the Mexican society while fueling <b>guerrilla's</b> <b>warfare</b> and crime waves. In fact, at the turn of the new millennium, the debate on the model of state that not only a more globalizad and highly developed societies, but also the less developed societies, such as the case of Mexico, require, is takeing more importance. The mains issues of this discussion focus on fundamental concepts of representation, economic functions and organization of the Mexican state...|$|R
