40|$|Ventilation {{systems for}} {{residential}} buildings can be generally categorized as supply, exhaust, or balanced systems. Subcategories include: integration into central air distribution ducts, or single- or multi-point air distribution. This effort focused on establishing a design methodology for central-fan-integrated supply ventilation systems using an outside air duct to the return {{side of a}} central air distribution fan, with a specialized fan recycling control. A measurement protocol was developed, and air flow measurements were taken for 25 ' lengths of 5 " through 9 " diameter flexible ducts, with a 6 " wall-cap, at duct pressures of- 10 Pa to- 120 Pa. Using these measurements, a five-step method was developed {{as a guide for}} correctly designing, sizing, and installing the components of the ventilation system. An economic evaluation was made by conducting hourly computer simulations to determine the impact on heating, cooling, and fan energy use for four U. S. climates: cold (Chicago), mixed (Charlotte), hot-dry (Las Vegas), and hot-humid (Orlando). It was found that an effective ventilation system can be achieved using a 5 " to 9 " diameter <b>insulated</b> <b>duct</b> from outdoors to the return side of a central air distribution fan, with a specialized fan control that automatically cycles the fan if the fan has been inactive for a period of time.

Experiments have been performed in a laboratory to study the effects of particle size and air speed on deposition rates of particles from turbulent air flows in galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. The duct systems were constructed of materials typically found in commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. In the steel duct system, experiments with nominal particle sizes of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. In the <b>insulated</b> <b>duct</b> system, deposition rates of particles with nominal sizes of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m were measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to duct surfaces (floor, wall and ceiling) at two straight duct sections where the turbulent flow profile was fully developed. In steel ducts, deposition rates were higher to the duct floor than to the wall, which were, in turn, greater than to the ceiling. In insulated ducts, deposition was nearly the same to the duct floor, wall and ceiling for a given particle size and air speed. Deposition to duct walls and ceilings was greatly enhanced in insulated ducts compared to steel ducts. Deposition velocities to each of the three duct surface orientations in both systems were found to increase with increasing particle size or air velocity over the ranges studied. Deposition rates measured in the current experiments were in general agreement with the limited observations of similar systems by previous researchers...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} particles is detrimental {{to human health}} and indoor exposures dominate total exposures for most people. The accidental or intentional release of aerosolized chemical and biological agents within or near a building can lead to exposures of building occupants to hazardous agents and costly building remediation. Particle deposition in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may significantly influence exposures to particles indoors, diminish HVAC performance and lead to secondary pollutant release within buildings. This dissertation advances the understanding of particle behavior in HVAC systems and the fates of indoor particles by means of experiments and modeling. Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify particle deposition rates in horizontal ventilation ducts using real HVAC materials. Particle deposition experiments were conducted in steel and internally <b>insulated</b> <b>ducts</b> at air speeds typically found in ventilation ducts, 2 - 9 m/s. Behaviors of monodisperse particles with diameters in the size range 1 - 16 {micro}m were investigated. Deposition rates were measured in straight ducts with a fully developed turbulent flow profile, straight ducts with a developing turbulent flow profile, in duct bends and at S-connector pieces located at duct junctions. In straight ducts with fully developed turbulence, experiments showed deposition rates to be highest at duct floors, intermediate at duct walls, and lowest at duct ceilings. Deposition rates to a given surface increased {{with an increase in}} particle size or air speed. Deposition was much higher in internally <b>insulated</b> <b>ducts</b> than in uninsulated steel ducts. In most cases, deposition in straight ducts with developing turbulence, in duct bends and at S-connectors at duct junctions was higher than in straight ducts with fully developed turbulence. Measured deposition rates were generally higher than predicted by published models. A model incorporating empirical equations based on the experimental measurements was applied to evaluate particle losses in supply and return duct runs. Model results suggest that duct losses are negligible for particle sizes less than 1 {micro}m and complete for particle sizes greater than 50 {micro}m. Deposition to <b>insulated</b> <b>ducts,</b> horizontal duct floors and bends are predicted to control losses in duct systems. When combined with models for HVAC filtration and deposition to indoor surfaces to predict the ultimate fates of particles within buildings, these results suggest that ventilation ducts play only a small role in determining indoor particle concentrations, especially when HVAC filtration is present. However, the measured and modeled particle deposition rates are expected to be important for ventilation system contamination...|$|R
40|$|In {{ventilation}} duct flow the turbulent flow profile is commonly disturbed or not fully developed and these conditions {{are likely to}} influence particle deposition to duct surfaces. Particle deposition rates at eight S-connectors, in two 90 {sup o} duct bends and in two ducts where the turbulent flow profile was not fully developed were measured in a laboratory duct system with both galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. In the steel duct system, experiments with nominal particle diameters of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. In the <b>insulated</b> <b>duct</b> system, deposition of particles with nominal diameters of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m was measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to duct surfaces. Deposition at S-connectors, in bends and in straight ducts with developing turbulence was often greater than deposition in straight ducts with fully developed turbulence for equal particle sizes, air speeds and duct surface orientations. Deposition rates at all locations were found to increase {{with an increase in}} particle size or air speed. High deposition rates at S-connectors resulted from impaction and these rates were nearly independent of the orientation of the S-connector. Deposition rates in the two 90 {sup o} bends differed by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, probably because of the difference in turbulence conditions at the bend inlets. In straight steel ducts where the turbulent flow profile was developing, the deposition enhancement relative to fully developed turbulence generally increased with air speed and decreased with downstream distance from the duct inlet. This enhancement was greater at the duct ceiling and wall than at the duct floor. In insulated ducts, deposition enhancement was less pronounced overall than in steel ducts. Trends that were observed in steel ducts were present, but weaker, in insulated ducts...|$|E

The goal of the tests and subsequent modeling was to develop an accurate method of assessing duct system performance in the laboratory, enabling limiting conditions to be imposed at will and results {{to be applied to}} residential attics with attic duct systems. Steady-state tests were done at a severe summer and a mild winter condition. In all tests the roof surface was heated above ambient air temperatures by infrared lights. The attic test module first included then did not include the duct system. Attic ventilation from eave vents to a ridge vent was varied from none to values achievable by a high level of power ventilation. A radiant barrier was attached to the underside of the roof deck, both with and without the duct system in place.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the variability of duct leakage impacts on air distribution system performance for typical large commercial buildings in California. Specifically, a hybrid DOE- 2 /TRNSYS sequential simulation approach was used to model the energy use of a low-pressure terminal-reheat variable-air-volume (VAV) HVAC system with six duct leakage configurations (tight to leaky) in nine prototypical large office buildings (representing three construction eras in three California climates where these types of buildings are common). Combined fan power for the variable-speed-controlled supply and return fans at design conditions was assumed to be 0. 8 W/cfm. Based on our analyses of the 54 simulation cases, the increase in annual fan energy is estimated to be 40 to 50 % for a system with a total leakage of 19 % at design conditions compared to a tight system with 5 % leakage. Annual cooling plant energy also increases by about 7 to 10 %, but reheat energy decreases (about 3 to 10 %). In combination, the increase in total annual HVAC site energy is 2 to 14 %. The total HVAC site energy use includes supply and return fan electricity consumption, chiller and cooling tower electricity consumption, boiler electricity consumption, and boiler natural gas consumption. Using year 2000 average commercial sector energy prices for California ($ 0. 0986 /kWh and $ 7. 71 /Million Btu), the energy increases result in 9 to 18 % ($ 7, 400 to $ 9, 500) increases in HVAC system annual operating costs. Normalized by duct surface area, the increases in annual operating costs are 0. 14 to 0. 18 $/ft{sup 2 }. Using a suggested one-time duct sealing cost of $ 0. 20 per square foot of duct surface area, these results indicate that sealing leaky ducts in VAV systems has a simple payback period of about 1. 3 years. Even with total leakage rates as low as 10 %, duct sealing is still cost effective. This suggests that duct sealing should be considered at least for VAV systems with 10 % or more total duct leakage. The VAV system that we simulated had perfectly <b>insulated</b> <b>ducts,</b> and maintained constant static pressure in the ducts upstream of the VAV boxes and a constant supply air temperature at the airhandler. Further evaluations of duct leakage impacts should be carried out in the future after methodologies are developed to deal with duct surface heat transfer effects, to deal with airflows entering VAV boxes from ceiling return plenums (e. g., to model parallel fan-powered VAV boxes), and to deal with static pressure reset and supply air temperature reset strategies...|$|R

40|$|Research {{efforts to}} improve {{residential}} heat-pump performance have {{tended to focus on}} laboratory and theoretical studies of the machine itself, with some limited field research having been focused on in-situ performance and installation issues. One issue that has received surprisingly little attention is the interaction between the heat pump and the duct system to which it is connected. This paper presents the results of a field study that addresses this interaction. Field performance measurements before and after sealing and <b>insulating</b> the <b>duct</b> systems were made on three heat pumps. From the pre-retrofit data it was found that reductions in heat-pump capacity due to low outdoor temperatures and/or coil frosting are accompanied by lower duct-system energy delivery efficiencies. The conduction loss reductions, and thus the delivery temperature improvements, due to adding duct insulation were found to vary widely depending on the length of the particular duct section, the thermal mass of that duct section, and the cycling characteristics of the heat-pump. In addition, {{it was found that the}} use of strip-heat back-up decreased after the retrofits, and that heat-pump cycling increased dramatically after the retrofits, which respectively increase and decrease savings due to the retrofits. Finally, normalized energy use for the three systems which were operated consistently pre- and post-retrofit showed an average reduction of 19 % after retrofit, which corresponds to a chance in overall distribution-system efficiency of 24 %...|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is that [...] "If no one in your household suffers from allergies or unexplained symptoms or illnesses and if, after a visual inspection of {{the inside of the}} ducts, you see no indication that your air ducts are contaminated with large deposits of dust or mold (no musty odor or visible mold growth), having your air ducts cleaned is probably unnecessary."A thorough duct cleaning done by a professional duct cleaner will remove dust, cobwebs, debris, pet hair, rodent hair and droppings, paper clips, calcium deposits, children's toys, and whatever else might collect inside. Ideally, the interior surface will be shiny and bright after cleaning. <b>Insulated</b> fiber glass <b>duct</b> liner and duct board can be cleaned with special non-metallic bristles. Fabric ducting can be washed or vacuumed using typical household appliances.|$|R

In order to improve the insulation performance of the solid insulators, we should consider the following two technical points. Firstly, we have to improve the insulation performance of solid dielectrics itself. The second is {{the control of the}} electric field distribution in and around the solid insulating spacers. In this paper, we have proposed a new concept for spacer insulation; an application of a functionally graded material (FGM). We investigated the applicability of FGM for reducing the electric stress on triple junction point, {{which was one of the}} important factors dominating a long-term insulating property of the solid. Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used throughout this work, for its favorable accuracy, to calculate the electric field distribution inside gas <b>insulated</b> bus <b>duct</b> (GIBD). The electric field distribution around earthed particle contamination which adhered to uniform and FGM of disc-spacer is studied. Electric field relaxation effect (EFGM / Euniform) by introduction of the U-shape FGM spacer is also studied. The breakdown voltage calculations in case of gap with particles contamination are studied. The effect of gas pressure, SF 6 -gas concentration in various mixtures and the particle dimension (length and hemi-spherical radius) on the breakdown voltage are also studied. Finally, the effect of FGM of spacer on breakdown voltage i...|$|R
