5|$|Russian Air Force Su-25s were {{extensively}} {{used during}} the Second Chechen War in particular during the first phase when Russian forces were invading the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Up to seven Russian Su-25s were lost, one to hostile fire: on 4 October 1999, a Su-25 was shot down by a MANPADS during a reconnaissance mission over the village of Tolstoy-Yurt killing its pilot. The wings of the aircraft were put on a pedestal in the central square in <b>Grozny.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1999–2000 {{battle of}} <b>Grozny</b> was the siege and assault of the Chechen capital <b>Grozny</b> by Russian forces, lasting from late 1999 to early 2000.

25|$|According to the {{official}} Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and {{an unknown number of}} pro-Russian militiamen died in <b>Grozny.</b> The separatist forces too suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that 2,700 separatists were killed trying to leave <b>Grozny.</b> The separatists said they lost at least 500 fighters in the mine field at Alkhan-Kala.|$|E
25|$|The First Battle of <b>Grozny</b> was the Russian Army's {{invasion}} and subsequent {{conquest of the}} Chechen capital, <b>Grozny,</b> during {{the early months of}} the First Chechen War. The attack lasted from December 1994 to March 1995, resulted in the military occupation of the city by the Russian Army and rallied most of the Chechen nation around the separatist government of Dzhokhar Dudayev.|$|E
25|$|On January 4 and January 5, the Chechens began {{retreating}} to villages {{south of}} <b>Grozny</b> with whatever combat vehicles {{they had at}} their disposal. These convoys were bombed by Russian air attacks. Though the Chechens were on the retreat, they still controlled much {{of the center of}} the city. Reinforcements from both sides arrived, including Chechen volunteers from the villages outside of <b>Grozny</b> and Russian Naval Infantry.|$|E
50|$|Hadijat Gatayeva (also transliterated Hadizhat Gataeva or Khadijad Gataeva) is a Chechen Muslim {{humanitarian}} activist who, {{together with}} her husband Malik, took care {{of some of the}} <b>Grozny's</b> war orphans. She is usually referred to just as Hadijat.|$|R
5000|$|November 27 - <b>Grozny's</b> {{central market}} was entirely {{destroyed}} by Russian armored vehicles {{the first day}} of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Pro-Moscow Chechen said that in November alone, 18 Russian soldiers were killed in or disappeared from the market.|$|R
5000|$|April 15 - A fierce {{skirmish}} {{took place}} between Chechen guerrillas and Russian elite forces in <b>Grozny's</b> Leninsky city district. Reportedly six Chechen fighters from Doku Umarov's group were killed, while five spetsnaz soldiers were killed and two seriously wounded. There were some civilian casualties.|$|R
25|$|Much {{damage was}} done at <b>Grozny,</b> but the {{remaining}} oilfields were beyond the logistical reach of the German Army {{as well as the}} fighter aircraft of the Luftwaffe. <b>Grozny</b> was within range of German bombers from 4th Air Corps, based near the Terek River. But <b>Grozny</b> and the captured oilfields at Maykop produced only ten per cent of Soviet oil. The main fields at Baku were out of German fighter range. German bombers could have reached them, but it meant flying the most direct, thus most predictable route without protection. In August it may have been possible to carry out these operations owing to the weakness of Soviet air power in the region, but by October it had been considerably strengthened.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Second Chechen War in late 1999, Gelayev {{commanded}} a large force of some 1,500 fighters in the siege of <b>Grozny,</b> charged with defense of the south-western sector of the city. However, he and most of his men left the city without orders in January 2000, which left it open to attack. Following Gelayev's unauthorized withdrawal from <b>Grozny,</b> Maskhadov demoted him from the rank of brigadier general to a private and stripped him of all military decorations.|$|E
25|$|Further east, the Axis enjoyed greater {{success and}} on 1 September, the Germans took Khulkhuta (Хулхута́), halfway between Elista and Astrakhan. During August and September, German patrols raided the railway between Kizlyar, {{north-east}} of <b>Grozny,</b> marking the farthest {{advance of the}} German forces towards the Caspian Sea. In the south, the First Panzer Army advance on <b>Grozny</b> was stopped by the Red Army and the 14th Air Army. By late September, supply failures and {{the resistance of the}} Red Army slowed the Axis advance.|$|E
5000|$|July 10 - At {{least one}} Interior Ministry {{serviceman}} {{was killed and}} nine were wounded in a grenade and gun attack on their vehicles in <b>Grozny's</b> Staropromyslovsky district (the rebels had claimed that 15-20 Russian servicemen {{were killed in the}} incident). A local policeman was shot dead in the Chechen village of Kargalinskaya.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} round of matches, the 16 clubs (10 of which scored) {{combined}} for 34 goals to open the Russian Premier League, a new record that was elapsed even prior to Terek <b>Grozny's</b> home match against Amkar Perm on August 4. Ten of those goals came in Dinamo Moskva's 7-3 victory over FC Rostov.|$|R
50|$|Sadulayev {{was born}} into the Biltoy branch of the Ustradoi teip, an {{influential}} clan {{in the town of}} Argun on the plains of central Chechnya to the east of Grozny.http://www.waynakh.com/eng/2008/05/abdul-khalim-salamovich-sadullayev/ After growing up in Argun, he entered <b>Grozny's</b> university to study Chechen and Russian philology, but had to break off his studies as the First Chechen War with the Russian Federation broke out in 1994. He joined an Argun militia to fight against the Russians as a volunteer fighter.|$|R
25|$|When in September 1999, the Russian army entered Chechnya {{after the}} Chechen {{incursion}} in Dagestan and the Moscow apartment block bombings, Said {{was able to}} return to Northern Chechnya. With some of his fellow anti-Maskhadov rebels, he formed an armed detachment and entered <b>Grozny.</b> Kakiyev claimed his unit was the first to hoist the Russian flag in <b>Grozny.</b> During the battle of Komsomolskoye, forces commanded by Kakiyev managed to surround forces commanded by Ruslan Gelayev; Kakiyev was also involved in hunting down Gelayev during the winter of 2003-2004.|$|E
25|$|As of the {{civilian}} casualties, Sergei Kovalev, the Russian Duma's commissioner for human rights, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin's aide on human rights, {{who had been in}} <b>Grozny</b> during part of the fighting, estimated 27,000 people, many of them ethnic Russians, died in five weeks of fighting. Anatol Lieven, who was also in <b>Grozny</b> during the battle, in his book Chechnya: Tombstone of Russian Power put his estimates lower at about 5,000 killed civilians, with some 500 more killed by the Russian air raids prior to the battle.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Chechen fighters, however, {{were either}} undisciplined militiamen with no {{authority}} or answering only to orders coming only from their immediate field commander (often just a warlord), which made effective battle co-ordination {{extremely difficult for}} <b>Grozny's</b> Chief of Staff, Colonel Aslan Maskhadov. The Chechen forces (which included a number of foreign volunteers, among them a group of Ukrainian nationalists) had {{a limited number of}} heavy weapons, including a handful of T-62 and T-72 tanks. Most of the heavy weapons were at disposal of the regular forces.|$|R
50|$|Kadyrov {{dismissed}} <b>Grozny's</b> mayor, Movsar Temirbayev, who {{was appointed}} to the post by his father in late 2003, and his place was taken by Muslim Khuchiyev. Former deputy prime minister Odes Baysultanov (a cousin of Ramzan Kadyrov on his mother's side of the family) received the vacated post of prime minister. The deputy interior minister, Sultan Satuyev, was replaced by Alambek Yasayev. Khalid Vaykhanov was given the post of secretary to the Chechen Council for Economic and Social Security, replacing German Vok, who tendered his resignation shortly before Alu Alkhanov resigned as Chechen President.|$|R
2500|$|April 2, 2006: The {{remains of}} 57 bodies were {{discovered}} in unmarked graves during unexploded ordnance and land mine disposal work in the Sergey Kirov Park in <b>Grozny's</b> Leninsky district. Valery Kuznetsov, Chechnya's prosecutor, claimed that {{an examination of the}} corpses buried in the unmarked graves indicated that they were [...] "ordinary citizens" [...] who had died from explosions of artillery shells and bombs during siege between 1999 and 2000; he added {{that there would be no}} investigations on the finding. Six bodies from that dig were never identified and were reburied in numbered graves. Local authorities planned to build a large entertainment center, to be called after Akhmad Kadyrov, on the site of the former Kirov Park, where nine other graves were uncovered in April–May 2000.|$|R
25|$|The Russian {{ground troops}} {{advanced}} slowly, and <b>Grozny</b> {{was surrounded by}} late November 1999. More than two additional weeks of shelling and bombing were required before Russian troops were able to claim a foothold within {{any part of the}} heavily fortified city. Russian ground forces met stiff resistance from rebel fighters as they moved forward, using a slow, neighborhood-by-neighborhood advance with the fighting focused on a strategic hill overlooking the city. Both sides accused each other of launching chemical attacks. Claims of chemical attacks may have originated from the observation of unburnt remnants of gaseous explosive from TOS-1 thermobaric missiles or the chemicals may have escaped from destroyed industrial plants. The rumours of gas attacks and the divisions among Chechens (the Islamic extremists were blamed for provoking the war), contributed to the abandoning of <b>Grozny</b> by many rebel fighters. In early December, Russia seized the town of Urus-Martan, the separatist stronghold near <b>Grozny,</b> after it had been battered with heavy air and artillery bombardments for several weeks.|$|E
25|$|The siege and {{fighting}} left the capital devastated {{like no other}} European city since World War II; in 2003 the United Nations called <b>Grozny</b> the most destroyed city on Earth.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, Chechen fighters {{attacked}} and destroyed a Russian armoured column which {{had entered the}} village of Duba-Yurt the day before. The following day, Gen. Valentin Astaviyev said on state television that Russian forces had suffered only three dead in the previous 24 hours. Yet the commander of an Interior Ministry unit in <b>Grozny</b> told Agence France-Presse that 50 men {{had been killed in}} the previous 48 hours. On January 4, Chechen fighters in <b>Grozny</b> launched a series of counter attacks and broke through Russian lines in at least two places, temporarily seizing the village of Alkhan-Kala. Russian public support for the war, which was previously overwhelming, appeared to fade as casualties mounted and the government came in for increasing criticism in the tightly controlled Russian media for understating casualty figures. However, Russia's heavy bombardments had finally begun to take their toll: using multiple rocket launchers and massed tank and artillery fire, the Russians flattened large parts of <b>Grozny</b> in preparation for an all-out assault.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on 6 September 1991, militants of the All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP) party, {{created by}} the former Soviet Air Force general Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed a session of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR Supreme Soviet {{with the aim of}} asserting independence. The {{storming}} caused the death of the head of <b>Grozny's</b> branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Vitaly Kutsenko, who was defenestrated (thrown out of a window) or fell while trying to escape. This effectively dissolved the government of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic of the Soviet Union. In the following month, Dudayev won overwhelming popular support (as evidenced by the later presidential elections with high turnout and a clear Dudayev victory) to oust the interim administration that was supported by the central government. He was made president and declared independence from the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|The {{case of the}} war diaries is {{exceptional}} because among {{confusion in}} the news, reticence, and many conflicting assessments, just observations of ordinary people, who by the will of fate have become hostages of the war, can give an accurate picture of what is happening. One example of such literature now is the Chechen diary of Polina, the issue {{of which was a}} notable event. The book is a real diary that <b>Grozny's</b> resident Polina Zherebtsova kept as a teenager in 1999-2002, {{at the height of the}} second Chechen war. Some fragments of the diary were published earlier (in particular, for those Polina won a literary prize in Jerusalem named after Janusz Korczak in 2006), but to publish the entire book she managed not at once since no publishing house take the responsibility to publish [...] "the truth about Chechnya".|$|R
25|$|This had {{not always}} been the case. Most of German {{aviation}} had been concentrated on the Stalingrad Front in August, on Hitler's orders. Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps IV was over-stretched for over a month from 28 July. Richthofen had wanted to support Army Group B in the south, but despite the Caucasus oilfields being the primary target for German strategy, the Army Group received poor air support. Richthofen's arm-chair general tactics were important in deciding where air power was to be used, and would be done so only if he rated the army's chances of success as reasonable. He allowed some raids against <b>Grozny's</b> oilfields and close support operations, but the mountain terrain in the region {{made it difficult for}} the Panzer Divisions to exploit the actions of his air units. In a fit of pique at the army's failures, Richthofen refused to provide support for the Caucasus front. This remained the situation until mid-October. For a few days, a concentrated effort was made in the Caucasus. Hitler's realisation that the oilfields at Baku could not be captured meant that he was forced to order the Luftwaffe to eliminate them. The operations had limited success.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the assault}} on <b>Grozny</b> started in early December. The battle {{accompanied}} by the struggle for the neighbouring settlements ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000.|$|E
25|$|Rustam Atayev (25) – An ethnic Chechen {{native to}} Psedkah, Ingushetia. His 12-year-old younger brother {{and two other}} boys were murdered in 2002 in <b>Grozny</b> by {{unidentified}} men in camouflage.|$|E
25|$|During the First Chechen War Raduyev {{became a}} field {{commander}} for the separatist Chechen forces. He {{fought in the}} battle of <b>Grozny</b> and was wounded in March 1995 during an attempt to capture him by the Russian special forces. In October 1995, {{he became one of the}} most important of the Chechen field commanders, commanding the 6th Brigade based in the strategically important Gudermessky District and responsible for the Gudermessky, part of the capital <b>Grozny</b> and the town of Argun. On December 14, 1995, Raduyev, along with Sultan Geliskhanov, led a raid on the city of Gudermes.|$|E
50|$|Knyaz (Prince) Nikita Serebryanni {{is on his}} way to Moscow. In Medvedevka village {{his small}} armed unit of {{servants}} clashes with the oprichnik Khomyak’s gang. There and then the Prince learns that bloodshed and lawlessness here were inspired by Tsar Ioann's new policies, known as oprichnina. Another plotline involves Yelena Morozova, the wife of Medvedevka landlord whom the Prince helped out; she turns out to be his own loved one of the old times, who had to marry the old man in order to thwart another vile oprichnik, Vyazemsky, with his unwanted passes. Further on his way, Serebrenni helps out the outlaw named Persten (the latter would repay the Prince by leading him out of <b>Grozny’s</b> jail) and encounters the much feared Tsar himself. Appalled by Boris Godunov's cynicism (the latter suggests that the two should join forces in the anti-Grozny alliance) and torn apart between his righteous hatred towards the Tsar with his corrupt oprichnicks, and his own oath of allegiance, Serebrenni, all kinds of adventures behind, chooses to go to war, to fight for his country (not its amoral ruler), and die the death of a noble man.|$|R

5000|$|On August 7, a large armored column {{from the}} 205th [...] "Cossack" [...] Separate Motor Rifle Brigade arrived {{to assist the}} trapped Russian forces. The day before, a Chechen separatist group led by Akhmed Zakayev had {{captured}} a large supply of RPO rocket launchers by seizing <b>Grozny's</b> main railway station (according to the 2002 indictment by the Russian government, Zakayev's fighters killed or wounded more than 300 MVD troops at the train station); as a result, Russian tanks became much easier targets for Chechen mobile units. When the Russian military sent another column on August 8, they too were stopped and lost many vehicles to Chechen ambushes. On the fifth day of the battle, 900 fresh soldiers of the 276th Motor Rifle Regiment attempted to retake {{the center of the}} city, but failed at the price of about half of them being killed or wounded within just two days. Only one column of armored vehicles succeeded in delivering some supplies to the besieged federal stronghold in the city center and evacuating some of the wounded. Over the course of five days of their counterattacks, Russian columns lost 18 tanks, 69 other armoured vehicles, and 23 trucks and cars; in addition, three helicopters were shot down.|$|R
