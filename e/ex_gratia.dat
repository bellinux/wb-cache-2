In October 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, the Sammarinese government submitted a claim for 732 million lira to the British government for wartime compensation, of which 500 million lira were given as the related costs of the fighting in September and 20 million lira as the costs of the occupation. The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an <b>ex</b> <b>gratia</b> payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E

NESCo received an <b>ex</b> <b>gratia</b> payment of £6,650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point. The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it. On 9 October 1945, Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin made clear in the House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier, sufficing the demand for electricity, and meaning no station was needed at Kepier.|$|E

In China, families of passengers were offered ¥31,000 (about US$5,000) [...] "comfort money"; but some families rejected the offer. It was also reported that Malaysian relatives received only $2,000.

Houchen later said that [...] "it {{was the only time}} I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... I said to Yvonne, 'I'm just going to take the money'". In doing so he rejected moves to Preston North End and Third Division Bury.

500|$|Brain {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from TAA on 3February 1955—effective 17March—to become Managing Director of deHavilland Aircraft in Sydney (later Hawker de Havilland, part of Boeing Australia). While his departure {{came as a}} surprise to ACAC, Brain had for some time felt shackled by having to run TAA on a commercial basis under the control of a government bureaucracy, and on a public servant's remuneration. His anticipated salary increases had been less than he expected under the terms of his employment; Watt's attempts to make good on them had been resisted by Federal Cabinet. The government yet feared that, once he had resigned, Brain might attempt to sue for back pay, though he assured Watt that this was not his intention. Nevertheless, in November he received a Cabinet-approved <b>ex</b> <b>gratia</b> payment totalling £6,250, in recognition of his [...] "long and distinguished service to civil aviation in Australia".|$|E
500|$|Nigel Kneale was a Manx {{television}} playwright who {{had come}} to prominence in the 1950s thanks to his adaptation of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and his three Quatermass serials, all of which had been made by the BBC. Kneale had since become disenchanted with the BBC, mainly because he had received no extra money when the BBC sold the film rights to The Quatermass Experiment, and had turned to freelance writing, producing scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. [...] When approached by the BBC for a script for the BBC2 anthology series Theatre 625, Kneale, still upset over the sale of the film rights to The Quatermass Experiment, turned them down. The Director General of the BBC, Sir Hugh Greene intervened and arranged a £3,000 <b>ex</b> <b>gratia</b> payment to Kneale in recognition of Quatermass' success. Kneale accepted a commission from Theatre 625 producer Michael Bakewell on Friday, 7 April 1967 for what would become The Year of the Sex Olympics.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, West Ham {{were again}} relegated to Division Two, but Lyall was {{retained}} as manager {{and led the}} team to an FA Cup Final win against Arsenal in 1980, their last major honour. [...] They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi-final. The Hammers won 1–0, with a goal scored from a header by Trevor Brooking in the 13th minute. This is notable as no team outside the top division has won the trophy since. West Ham were promoted to Division One in 1981, and {{finished in the top}} ten of the first division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 1985–86; a group of players which {{came to be known as}} The Boys of 86. However, they suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyall's sacking. He was awarded an <b>ex</b> <b>gratia</b> payment of £100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as [...] "upsetting" [...] circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service.|$|E

For those living {{along the banks of the}} Adyar, Cooum River and the Buckingham Canal and who had lost homes, the Chief Minister ordered an immediate allocation of 10,000 tenements in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam and Perumbakkam, which had been built by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board.

2500|$|Since 1988, {{there have}} been regular calls for an {{official}} review of the government's actions throughout the crisis. In 2008, newly appointed de facto Law Minister Zaid Ibrahim said the government had to make an open apology to the sacked judges, calling the government's actions during the crisis [...] "inappropriate".

Prashanta Mazumdar additionally asked for government workers to assess the damage and distribute relief. Indian National Congress (INC) member Deepa Dasmunshi countered by saying the state administration had failed miserably.
