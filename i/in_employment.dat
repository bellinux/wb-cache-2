40|$|We {{investigate}} {{gender differences}} among Italian self employed graduates focusing on flow {{data from a}} ten-year labor market transition matrix (1993 - 2003).

We argue that the disappointment provoked by the gender wage gap <b>in</b> paid <b>employment</b> may induce some female graduates with low entrepreneurial ability to set up on their own, but once <b>in</b> self <b>employment</b> they have lower survival rates than both men <b>in</b> self <b>employment</b> and women <b>in</b> paid <b>employment.</b> Applying Markovian analysis to labor market transitions we confirm our hypothesis: female graduates rarely move from paid employment to self employment, but the reverse is often the case. Thus, what we observe overall, is that education reduces {{the percentage of women}} <b>in</b> self <b>employment,</b> and increases the percentage of women <b>in</b> paid <b>employment...</b>|$|R
