40|$|Recently, by the {{development}} of computer technology, the system of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) is being utilized and is being popularized in many enterprises, and it is a necessary for design or drafting in many industrial fields such as machine design. Under these back ground, 4 engineering work stations for CAD/CAM was introduced at Tsuyama National College of Technology in 1990. Therefore, {{the development}} and investigation on many educational system or soft ware of CAD/CAM that enable to utilize for machine design and drafting, engineering experimentation, engineering work and so on will be necessary. This investigation was performed as a objection to draw up a model for <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> and to practice the parametric component graphic analysis (PCM), Results obtained are follows; 1) A program for PCM was developed and practiced. 2) A model of <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> was drawn up...|$|E

A method {{which may be}} used by a designer to calculate the total energy requirement of a product, in a more appropriate manner than methods previously published, is described. With the proposed method the advantage of recycling materials from discarded products results in a lower energy requirement. Two examples are given to illustrate the calculation method. The first is {{a comparison of the}} energy used, in manufacturing <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> by extrusion and cutting whilst the second concerns the energy commitments involved in substituting aluminium alloys for steel and cast iron parts in automobiles. ...|$|R

25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the block heater was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on the engine block or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|R
25|$|A third cause {{might be}} {{cracks in the}} engine block from {{overtightening}} the <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot catalytic converter or exhaust manifold {{at the front of}} the engine compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{on older}} Torx heads {{is that the}} smaller internal [...] "splines" [...] can corrode relatively easily and cause the Torx driver to slip and damage the head, {{making it more difficult}} to remove than the traditional <b>hexagon</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Owing {{to a large}} {{error in}} the factory <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> torque {{specifications}} (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos head gasket {{in lieu of a}} copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown head gaskets. Toyota never issued a recall for any of the affected vehicles. The problem could be easily fixed by replacing the head gasket and torquing the <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> to [...] of torque. However, owing to the lack of a recall or appropriate service bulletin, the head gasket problem would recur in another 75,000 miles or so if the gasket was replaced and the bolts were retorqued to the erroneous service manual specifications of [...] With the <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> torqued correctly, the engines were otherwise extremely durable.|$|R

50|$|Closely {{related to}} {{carriage}} bolts are timber bolts, meant {{for use with}} large wood planks and structures. They have a domed head that is proportionally wider {{than that of a}} carriage bolt, and instead of a square section of shank under the head, they have four sharp-cornered fillets that grip the edge of the hole in the wood to prevent rotation. They are also known as mushroom <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> or dome <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> They are used to fasten wood to wood, instead of metal to wood.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} extractor {{was developed}} for extraction of okra seeds. Studies were conducted on effect of different cylinder speed (5, 6 and 7 m/s), concave clearance (7, 10 and 13 mm), moisture content of okra fruit (12. 3, 15. 8 and 18. 8 % db) and type of extraction drum at a feed rate of 70 kg/h on machine performance and seed quality. Three types of extractor drums namely; square <b>head</b> <b>bolted,</b> rubberized and rasp-bar were used. Seed quality was evaluated for vigour index, dead seed, normal and abnormal germination. The performance of seed extractor was evaluated for its extraction efficiency, cleaning efficiency, seed loss and energy consumption at different crop and machine variables. Extraction efficiency (99. 3 %) caused by square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum was found highest among all the three extraction mechanisms. Cleaning efficiency {{was found in the}} range of 97. 9 to 99. 6 % for all crop variables. The value of seed loss (4. 7 %) was low with the square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum in comparison to rasp-bar and rubberized extraction mechanism. The average energy consumption per quintal (100 kg) seed was found to be 1. 9 kWh. It was found that germination and vigour index decreased with increase in pod moisture content. Higher germination was found with square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum as compared to the rasp-bar and rubberized drum. The germination decreased, whereas dead seed percentage increased with cylinder speed. The best seed quality machine performance was found at 12. 3 percent moisture content (d. b.), 7 mm concave clearance and 5 m/s cylinder speed with the square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum extraction mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Locking was {{achieved}} by a solid <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> and three <b>bolt</b> lugs. The <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> {{was designed to be}} removable thus allowing the owner to vary the head space by replacing the <b>head.</b> The <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> is of the floating type whereby it is a loose fit in the bolt tube and held in place by a pin, the firing pin passing through a hole in that pin. This allows the locking lugs to self centre with even pressure when the action is locked.|$|R

40|$|Large {{static strain}} {{appears on the}} fillet on upper deck of diesel engine {{cylinder}} block by tightening force of cylinder <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> Reducing static strain is necessary to avoid the crack initiation on the fillet. The static strain along the fillet can be reduced, for example, by modifying the depth of thread engagement, and modifying the bead shape and position into the bore grommet of cylinder head gasket. In the present study, the depth of thread engagement was optimized considering four conditions, the overall magnitude of strain, the circumferential fluctuation of strain, the change rate of strain against the depth of thread engagement, {{and the length of}} cylinder <b>head</b> <b>bolt.</b> The bead shape or position was optimized considering two conditions, the overall magnitude of strain, and the distribution of contact pressure on the contact area with the cylinder block and the cylinder liner.

5000|$|The 196 OHV {{requires}} more periodic maintenance than newer-model engines. The <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> must be re-torqued (retightening process) regularly.

30|$|Rock bolts {{applied in}} the United States {{can be divided into}} many types: rock bolts with {{pretension}} and without pretension; point-anchored bolts and fully-grouted bolts; <b>headed</b> <b>bolts</b> and threaded bolts. Special rock bolts, including various cables and bolt trusses, are applicable to special geological conditions.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> type {{includes}} a different means of cartridge ejection. The push-feed <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> utilize a plunger-type ejector {{mounted in the}} bolt face.The controlled-round-feed <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> have a relief cut for a receiver-mounted, spring-loaded folding ejector to pass through as the bolt is retracted.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{cylinder}} head design (Removal of the heads {{was designed to}} be accomplished whilst leaving the camshaft and valvetrain in place), <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> were both vertically and diagonally set in the engine block, to be accessible around the camshafts. As the bolts were made of the same material and set on different angles; this created areas of different expansion under heat, creating not only head warping but resulting in extremely difficult to remove cylinder <b>heads</b> as <b>bolts</b> stretched and corroded in place at different rates.|$|R
50|$|GM ceased {{production}} of the Northstar series in July 2010, with the final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolling off the line in 2011. Newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V use the GM LS small-block OHV engine, marking {{a return to a}} simpler push rod engine design. The North star has been plagued from the beginning with reliability issues, particularly head gaskets that fail when <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> pull out of the block, allowing coolant to seep into the oil system. To exacerbate the situation, the entire engine must be completely removed to replace the head gasket, and a solution implemented to repair the <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> The cost to repair is usually upwards of $3000, and involves adding inserts (Normserts, timeserts) in the block to better grip the bolts. The LC3 supercharged variant, with its sealed deck design, has been largely immune from these issues. Cadillac implemented design changes throughout the Northstar's run (particularly 2000 and 2004), lengthening the <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> and making the threads coarser, but even the 2004+ engines have experienced head gasket failures. The only way to bulletproof the engine is to tap deeper, drill extremely coarse threads, and stud the head to the block.|$|R
5000|$|On used bolt-action firearms, especially, the {{headspace}} {{should be}} checked with headspace gauges prior to shooting to ensure it is correct, {{and to prevent}} over-stressing chambers and cartridge brass. Some bolt-action rifles, such as the Lee-Enfield, {{have a series of}} different length bolts available to extend the service life of the rifle, for taking up any wear of the bolt and chamber occurring from long years of service. In the case of the No. 4 Lee-Enfield <b>bolt,</b> the <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> themselves are replaceable separate from the bolt and are marked 0, 1, 2, or 3, with each <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> in sequence being nominally 0.003" [...] longer than the <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> numbered one less, for easily taking up any action stretching that may have occurred. It is possible to replace such a <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> without tools by disassembling the bolt from the action, unscrewing the <b>bolt</b> <b>head,</b> and replacing the <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> with the next higher number <b>bolt</b> <b>head,</b> for restoring a safe headspace.|$|R

5000|$|... Ford/International used four Torque to Yield (TTY) {{cylinder}} <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> per cylinder for the 6.0s and 6.4s. TTY bolts {{offer some}} of the most precise clamping force available, but can be problematic. In certain situations (Oil cooler/EGR cooler failure, high boost/load levels brought on by improper use of aftermarket programmers) TTY bolts can be stretched beyond their torque mark by increased cylinder pressures.

Some in the aftermarket will replace the factory <b>bolts</b> with <b>head</b> studs in an attempt to protect the head gaskets from future failure. If this is done without addressing the underlying issue, the head gaskets may fail again bringing along a cracked or warped cylinder head.
