5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the <b>discriminant</b> modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
25|$|The <b>discriminant</b> of K can be {{referred}} to as the absolute <b>discriminant</b> of K to distinguish it from the relative <b>discriminant</b> of an extension K/L of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of L, and like the absolute <b>discriminant</b> it indicates which primes are ramified in K/L. It is a generalization of the absolute <b>discriminant</b> allowing for L to be bigger than Q; in fact, when L=Q, the relative <b>discriminant</b> of K/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute <b>discriminant</b> of K.|$|E

25|$|Hermite's theorem predates {{the general}} {{definition}} of the <b>discriminant</b> with Charles Hermite publishing a proof of it in 1857. In 1877, Alexander von Brill determined {{the sign of the}} <b>discriminant.</b> Leopold Kronecker first stated Minkowski's theorem in 1882, though the first proof was given by Hermann Minkowski in 1891. In the same year, Minkowski published his bound on the <b>discriminant.</b> Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, Ludwig Stickelberger obtained his theorem on the residue of the <b>discriminant</b> modulo four.|$|E

40|$|We study equivariant de Rham <b>discriminants</b> {{associated}} to arithmetic varieties which support a tame action by a finite group; we form these <b>discriminants</b> by endowing the de Rham cohomology with pairings arising from duality theory. Such equivariant <b>discriminants</b> are shown {{to break up}} naturally into a metric part and a signature part. In a previous paper we described the equivariant Arakelov <b>discriminants,</b> obtained by endowing the equivariant determinant of de Rham cohomology with various metrics. In this paper we study the associated equivariant signature information; in particular, we show that the symplectic signature invariants both determine and {{are determined by the}} symplectic Archimedean epsilon constants of the arithmetic variety.

25|$|The {{relative}} <b>discriminant</b> {{regulates the}} ramification {{data of the}} field extension K/L. A prime ideal p of L ramifies in K if, and only if, it divides the relative <b>discriminant</b> ΔK/L. An extension is unramified if, and only if, the <b>discriminant</b> is the unit ideal. The Minkowski bound above shows {{that there are no}} non-trivial unramified extensions of Q. Fields larger than Q may have unramified extensions: for example, for any field with class number greater than one, its Hilbert class field is a non-trivial unramified extension.|$|E
