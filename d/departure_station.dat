40|$|This study models {{the choices}} of Dutch railway users. We find a steeper {{negative}} distance effect on the utility of <b>departure</b> <b>stations</b> accessed by the non-motorized modes of walking and bicycle {{as compared to the}} motorized modes of car and public transport. Availability of parking places and bicycle standing areas {{have a positive effect on}} the choice of <b>departure</b> railway <b>stations</b> accessed by car and bicycle, respectively. Public transport frequency has a positive whereas travel time has a negative effect on the choice of <b>departure</b> <b>stations</b> accessed by public transport. The derived rail service quality index (RSQI), which provides a measure of rail accessibility to all other stations, has a significant and positive effect on the choice of <b>departure</b> <b>stations</b> accessed by all modes. The outcome of this paper can be used to develop a comprehensive railway accessibility indicator for neighbourhoods, for hedonic pricing studies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Immediately opposite to this, is the arrival station, which is also of wooden erection, having spacious waiting rooms, and porter and lamp rooms. The roof also projects over the platform in a similar way to that of the <b>departure</b> <b>station.</b> A short distance lower down the line is a convenient goods shed, 75 feet long by 42 feet span of roof. Near to the <b>departure</b> <b>station</b> is the train shed, 100 feet long, in which, in addition to the engines employed on the line, it is intended to contain first, second, and third class carriages, in order to meet any extra requirements that may at any time arise." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{counter-argument}} is that passengers, {{particularly by}} train, can check in, travel a distance {{that would be}} more expensive than the deposit amount, and then not check out, allowing the passenger to save more than if she had she checked out at the station of destination.

50|$|As {{sleeping}} car fares were determined not by fare-kilometer {{but on a}} per-night basis, even {{in the case of}} a direct train between the two railways, the specified fare was simply collected in Korean yen at Mantetsu stations, and in Manchukuo yuan at National Railway stations. However, if a sleeper ticket was bought at a station of the railway other than the one from which the {{sleeping car}} was to depart from, the sleeper fare had to be paid in the currency used at the <b>departure</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

50|$|City Night Line trains were {{operated}} in a through coach system. From their joint <b>departure</b> <b>station,</b> they covered {{part of the}} route together as one train; on arrival at a certain station, they were split up and joined to other trains, with which they then continued to the different destination stations. The same procedure applied on the return journey. For example, the trains on the Amsterdam - Munich and Amsterdam - Zurich routes ran as a joint train as far as Mannheim, where the train was split up. The train section travelling to Munich was joined to a train coming from Paris with destination Munich, while the section travelling to Zurich was joined to a CNL coming from Hamburg. On the changeover to the 2009/2010 timetable, the number of these shunting processes was reduced to one per network.|$|E
