500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Grant became {{troubled by the}} deaths {{of so many of}} his close friends, {{including}} Howard Hughes in 1976, Howard Hawks in 1977, Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979, Alfred Hitchcock in 1980, Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982, and David Niven in 1983. At the funeral of Mountbatten he was quoted as remarking to a friend: [...] "I'm absolutely pooped, and I'm so goddamned old...I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> all next year. I'm going to lie in bed...I shall just close all doors, turn off the telephone, and enjoy my life". Kelly's death was the hardest hitting on Grant, as the death was unexpected, and the two remained close friends after filming To Catch a Thief. Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement, and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the band}} co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day. The tour was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 to echo the famous Monsters of Rock tours; {{the idea was}} to have, effectively, a Monsters of Punk tour. The tour, from the band's point of view, had been put together as a show of unity in the face of consistent accusations of rivalry between the two bands, especially in Europe. Instead, Green Day's Tré Cool acknowledged in a Kerrang! interview that they committed to the tour as an opportunity to regain their reputation as a great live band, as they felt their spotlight had faded over the years. [...] "We set out to reclaim our throne as the most incredible live punk band from you know who," [...] said Cool. Cool contended that [...] "we heard they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> the tour because they were getting smoked so badly... We didn't want them to quit the tour. They're good for filling up the seats up front." [...] Several reviewers were unimpressed with Blink-182's headlining set following Green Day. [...] "Sometimes playing last at a rock show is more a curse than a privilege... Pity the headliner, for instance, that gets blown off the stage by the band before it. Blink-182 endured that indignity Saturday at the Shoreline Amphitheatre," [...] a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was thought}} that Ryan was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> the soap after several reports of her leaving EastEnders. One of her friends who spoke in September 2004 revealed,"Without {{sounding}} arrogant, Michelle believes she has the looks and talent to succeed at the highest level. She has been in EastEnders for four years but sees her future very much in films and modelling. She realises the show has {{put her on the}} map but doesn't want to be typecast."Because of her soap commitments she's had to turn down dozens of great modelling offers and feels her soap role is now holding her back.

6000|$|... "You {{poor little}} strawberry-leafed nonentity," [...] said the Minister, {{checking}} {{himself for a}} moment in his stride and rolling out his words spasmodically; [...] "who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sweep us away, I should like to know? The voting masses are on our side, and all the ability and administrative talent is on our side too. No power of earth or Heaven is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> move us from our place till we choose <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> it. No power of earth or--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. G.—Bassetlaw {{looks as}} if we were <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> 1886. For me [...] that is notice <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Another five years’ {{agitation}} at my age [...] would be impossible—ludicrous (with much emphasis).|$|R
