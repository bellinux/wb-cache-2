5|$|In 2000, the {{population}} of the Tryon Creek watershed within Portland was about 18,000. In 2005, Portland's Bureau of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Services</b> (BES) described land-use zoning in the watershed as follows: single-family residential, 55percent; parks and open space, 14percent; multi-family residential, 5percent; commercial, 3percent, and insufficient data, 2percent. To reach 100percent, BES listed but did not differentiate by zoning type the roughly 20percent of the watershed that lies beyond the Portland city limits. Metro, the regional government for the Portland metropolitan area, says that parks and natural areas cover about 21percent of the total watershed, while single-family housing dominates most of the rest.|$|E

5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Services</b> (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.|$|E
5|$|Ruth Bader Ginsburg (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and took {{the oath of office}} on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to be confirmed to the Court (after Sandra Day O'Connor), and one of four female justices to be confirmed (with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw <b>Environmental</b> <b>Services,</b> Inc.|$|E

5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.

40|$|In the {{political}} discussion, {{it is often}} emphasized that the <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> industry (which produces a clean factor of production) benefits from an early and strong environmental policy. This is especially likely if the costs of production are decreasing over time due to learning curve effects. Surprisingly, the <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> industry has not been integrated into the theory of strategic environmental policy yet. Our main question is whether a national leadership in environmental policy can pay off if profits of the <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> industry are taken into account. We consider a two-period model with one firm in each country competing on a third market. Emissions can be substituted by the clean factor when deciding upon the production technology. The unit costs of producing the clean factor {{in the second period}} are decreasing in the quantity produced in the initial period. We derive the optimal environmental policy for both periods from a national point of view and show that the presence of the <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> industry can indeed lead to a national leadership in pollution control.
