5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{prides itself}} on its health services, {{some of the best}} in the region. Qualified medics, {{favourable}} investment climate and Jordan's stability has contributed to the success of this sector. The country's <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> divided between public and private institutions. On 1 June 2007, Jordan Hospital (as the biggest private hospital) was the first general specialty hospital to gain the international accreditation JCAHO. The King Hussein Cancer Center is a leading cancer treatment center. 66% of Jordanians have medical insurance.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{continuously}} {{faced with}} a shortage of doctors known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe.

Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as {{one of the goals of}} the government.|$|E

25|$|The US <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} a dysfunctional mess. Conventional wisdom {{has been turned}} on its head.

25|$|Healthcare in the Netherlands can {{be divided}} in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (huisartsen, {{comparable}} to General Practitioners) form the largest {{part of the first}} echelon. Being referenced {{by a member of the}} first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.

25|$|One of the {{identified}} {{causes of the}} waste in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> a lack of communication between doctors and patients. The decisions of physicians account for most of a patient's expenses, yet physicians work under various pressures including limited {{time to talk with}} patients and review their information. Patients sometimes make requests for treatment against their doctor's advice in cases where more effective choices would be made if doctors had time to consult expert medical opinion.|$|E

Health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public, university and semi-private hospitals. Health care service are payable by the patient and reimbursed later by health insurance institutions, but for ineligible categories (of patients and services) so-called 3rd party payment systems exist.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{important}} ethical issues raised by <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> how best to sustain equity.

Changes {{in the structure of}} a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> thus key events that can affect equity in important ways. Using the "Benchmarks of Fairness" approach, we assessed the possible effects of introducing selective contracting of physicians on the equity of the Swiss <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system.</b> This approach yields a number of open questions that need to be further addressed if this proposed reform is to be implemented without diminishing the fairness of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing and delivery in Switzerland...|$|R

This service will be available sometime early year 2014. Volunteer doctors of Global Clinic have tried to help these people, for whom only acute care has been available. This means that the Finnish <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> open for all people coming outside of the European Union.
