25|$|In 1891, {{the postal}} and stamp <b>issuing</b> <b>authority</b> was created as an {{administrative}} {{division of the}} Secretaría de Comunicaciones (Secretariat of Communications). It was called Servicio Postal Mexicano (Sepomex). In 1901, the Dirección General de Correos (General Direction of Mail) was made a separate government agency. The Palacio de Correos de Mexico is used since 1907 as main post office.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008 federal budget, Jim Flaherty, Minister of Finance, {{announced}} that biometric passports ("e-passports") would be introduced by 2011. A pilot project began in 2009, with e-passports being issued to special and diplomatic passport applicants. The e-passport roll-out was pushed back to July 1, 2013. On the same day, the <b>issuing</b> <b>authority</b> of Canadian passports was shifted from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), {{now known as}} IRCC.|$|E
25|$|The <b>issuing</b> <b>authority</b> {{may also}} require {{applicants}} to attest {{that they have}} had no criminal convictions, or that they do not partake in certain activities (like prostitution or drug trafficking). Some countries will deny visas if the travelers' passports show evidence of citizenship of, or travel to, a country which is considered hostile by that country. For example, some Arabic-oriented countries will not issue visas to nationals of Israel and those whose passports bear evidence of visiting Israel.|$|E

5000|$|Connecticut and Delaware are {{regarded}} as permissive may-issue states, where either governmental policy or court precedence direct <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> to approve applications that meet all non-discretionary criteria.|$|R
25|$|The only {{substantial}} hoard of English coins {{from this}} period was found at Crondall, and included 69 English tremisses {{as well as a}} number of Frankish tremisses, probably deposited around 630. These and other finds reveal a range of types that rarely name a mint or <b>issuing</b> <b>authority,</b> though one scarce type bears the name of London, and others are struck in the name of King Eadbald of Kent (616–40). In terms of design they are based on Roman and Merovingian prototypes.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and during}} World War II, various bodies issued {{banknotes}} in yen, {{such as the}} Ministry of Finance and the Imperial Japanese National Bank. The Allied forces also issued some notes shortly after the war. Since then, the Bank of Japan has been the exclusive note <b>issuing</b> <b>authority.</b> The bank has issued five series after World War II. Series E, the current series introduced in 2004, consists of ¥1000, ¥5000, and ¥10,000 notes. The EURion constellation pattern {{is present in the}} designs.|$|E
25|$|Both United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes {{are parts}} of the {{national}} currency of the United States, and both have been legal tender since the gold recall of 1933. Both {{have been used in}} circulation as money in the same way. However, the <b>issuing</b> <b>authority</b> for them came from different statutes. United States Notes were created as fiat currency, in that the government has never categorically guaranteed to redeem them for precious metal - even though at times, such as after the specie resumption of 1879, federal officials were authorized to do so if requested.|$|E
50|$|DataFlow Group {{was founded}} in 2006 with its {{headquarters}} located in Hong Kong. The company has a network of 60,000 <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> throughout more than 200 countries, in addition to 620 experts and researchers.|$|R
25|$|Valid <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> for Philippine {{passports}} {{include the}} main office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila, branch offices of the DFA located in certain cities around the Philippines, and Philippine embassies and consulates.|$|R
50|$|Between 1914 and 1927, {{large amounts}} of monnaie de nécessité were issued in France and its North African colonies during the {{economic}} crisis caused by World War I. Among the <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> were companies and local chambers of commerce.|$|R
25|$|In 1970 {{the country}} {{switched}} its currency from the Bermudian pound to the Bermudian dollar, which is pegged at {{par with the}} US dollar. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee {{for the purchase of}} US dollars with Bermudian dollars. Bermudian notes carry the image of Queen Elizabeth II. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the <b>issuing</b> <b>authority</b> for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins.|$|E
25|$|Coins {{are usually}} metal or alloy, or {{sometimes}} made of synthetic materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal {{are stored in}} large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (i.e. excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than {{the value of the}} metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the <b>issuing</b> <b>authority</b> may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law).|$|E
25|$|The <b>issuing</b> <b>authority,</b> {{usually a}} branch of the country's foreign {{ministry}} or department (e.g. U.S. State Department), and typically consular affairs officers, may request appropriate documentation from the applicant. This may include proof that the applicant is able to support himself in the host country (lodging, food), proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant, proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance, etc. Some countries ask for proof of health status, especially for long-term visas; some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses, such as AIDS. The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa. Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long-term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan. However, in Uzbekistan, the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced. Other countries require a medical test that includes an HIV test, even for a short-term tourism visa. For example, Cuban citizens and international exchange students require such a test approved by a medical authority to enter Chilean territory.|$|E

5000|$|These billets de confiance bore no guarantee, {{but could}} be {{exchanged}} for assignats, a type of paper currency introduced by the revolutionary government of which there was a shortage. However, <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> {{were not required to}} keep enough assignats on hand to redeem all the card money they issued; the Paris-based Maison de Secours ran up a deficit of 2 million livres by issuing more billets de confiance than they held in assignats. The billets faced heavy counterfeiting, which resulted in the <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> making more complex designs. In February 1792 tax collectors stopped accepting payments in billets de confiance; economist [...] suggests that this may have been due to concerns over counterfeiting. Ultimately, in mid-1793 the issuing of card money was stopped.|$|R
