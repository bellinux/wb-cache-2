50|$|Today, Wolfsville retains {{much of its}} {{historic}} fabric {{with a high degree}} of integrity. Architectural styles range from early vernacular expressions of Greek Revival or Federal styles to late Victorian era examples of Queen Anne and Gothic Revival styles. Several buildings display their original dual use as dwellings and commercial spaces. One general store remains in operation today at the crossroads in the heart of Wolfsville, operated by the <b>Harne</b> Family since 1945. The Hoover Farm, situated on the southeastern edge of the village, preserves an early 19th-century stone dwelling and barn, site of early religious meetings which later formalized into Wolfsville's churches. In the mid-19th century, Wolfsville had three churches: Lutheran, German Reformed, and United Brethren. Two of these congregations remain active today: St. Mark's Lutheran Church and Salem United Brethren Church, both built in 1847 out of native stone, but significantly altered since.|$|R

40|$|The year 1996 {{marks the}} 100 th {{anniversary of the}} Certified Public Accountant (CPA) {{examination}} in the USA. The first law establishing the CPA designation was passed in New York on April 17, 1896. Passage {{was the culmination of}} years of efforts by practicing accountants. As early as 1884, the first accounting organization in the USA, the Institute of Accounts (originally called the Institute of Accountants and Bookkeepers) issued certificates to members who passed an examination. Similarly, the American Association of Public Accountants admitted the more experienced members as "Fellows " beginning in 1887 [25, p. 300]. However, this early certification was limited in that the organizations could not limit practice by nonmembers. Legislation was needed to control the growing ranks of practitioners. As early as 1894, a draft of a bill providing for a professional examination was circulated in Albany, New York, by Charles E. Sprague (who would later hold New York CPA certificate number 11).
